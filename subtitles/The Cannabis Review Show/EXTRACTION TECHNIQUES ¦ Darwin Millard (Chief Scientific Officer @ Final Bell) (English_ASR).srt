[Music]

2
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:10,879
welcome everybody to the next episode of

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,120
the cannabis review i'm delighted to be

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,719
joined on this episode by darwin miller

5
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:17,038
who's the chief scientific officer at

6
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:19,919
final bail i'm also an entrepreneur and

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,320
inventor how you keeping today daryl

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,160
i'm doing very well owen how are you

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,439
i'm fantastic mate as always thank you

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,960
very much for taking time out of your

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,399
busy day to chat with us and help

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,920
hopefully educate the audience on a

13
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:31,919
couple of different topics do you want

14
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,640
to maybe give everybody a quick overview

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,000
of how you ended up the csl final bell i

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,000
know you've been in the industry a long

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,719
time

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,759
uh sure yeah so i'm in an industry 17

19
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,520
years

20
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:45,119
for me you know a mechanical engineer

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,960
out of college it could have been design

22
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:48,000
slurry pumps for the fracking industry

23
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,000
or

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,480
joined the cannabis industry 17 years

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,920
later i've been able to with my hands-on

26
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:54,878
experience and kind of navigating the

27
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,640
market

28
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:59,039
teamed up with an amazing group here at

29
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,960
final bell and have them an opportunity

30
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,520
to be the chief science officer and help

31
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,760
with our scientific and project process

32
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,439
efficiencies and all sorts of different

33
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,799
uh research and development efforts that

34
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:10,559
we're doing

35
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,080
amazing yeah the photo bit looked like a

36
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,840
very impressive company and i can see

37
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,759
them changing the landscape for a lot of

38
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,439
the smaller brands over the next coming

39
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,319
years and i'm sure it's exciting to be

40
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:22,559
part of such a great group

41
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:24,559
absolutely it's an amazing team and uh i

42
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,240
feel super fortunate

43
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,519
right well let's just jump into this

44
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:29,039
topic straight away the first one i

45
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:30,719
wanted to talk about and you're pretty

46
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,720
an expert on this topic is extraction

47
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,239
techniques can you maybe explain over

48
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:35,679
here in ireland at the moment you're

49
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:37,839
only allowed to use a cold pressed

50
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,159
isolate so there are no supercritical

51
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,478
there are no co2 extraction the legality

52
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,320
is it has to be a cold-pressed isolator

53
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,239
it has to be done on the firm can you

54
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:47,839
maybe give everybody a quick overview of

55
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,199
what are the the best techniques what's

56
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,240
the most cost effective and what's the

57
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,200
most popular one you see

58
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:56,640
for sure well i guess um

59
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,280
that's an interesting question you know

60
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,118
obviously depending on what type of end

61
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,640
product you're looking to make maybe you

62
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:04,399
might choose a different extraction

63
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,200
method or technique based on that end

64
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,878
goal right so there might be

65
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,039
multiple different ways to get to say a

66
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,039
crude initial extract

67
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:15,679
and then a few different ways to refine

68
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:17,840
that but maybe only a couple of uh say

69
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,080
techniques for isolating and purifying

70
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,159
individual cannabinoids so depending on

71
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,520
that marketplace you're in uh if you're

72
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:24,799
not allowed to utilize certain

73
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,040
techniques then you're kind of

74
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,400
prohibited from

75
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:32,000
being able to make it there and you

76
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,000
might have to import those products

77
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:36,878
what do you see as being what's the best

78
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:38,878
form of extraction if you were to make

79
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:40,239
is it is it a completely different

80
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:41,919
process for let's say an edible

81
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,560
extraction than it would be for a

82
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:46,479
cartridge extraction

83
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,360
that's another great question you know

84
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:51,119
again i'm uh as a process trained design

85
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,800
engineer and kind of uh trying to be

86
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,920
agnostic about extraction techniques

87
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,519
don't have

88
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:57,119
one method over another that's

89
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,840
particularly good

90
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,920
again co2 ethanol extraction hydrocarbon

91
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,680
these all work well for

92
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,439
depending on what your end goal is what

93
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,120
you're trying to make some may be more

94
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:08,719
or less efficient based on you know

95
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,680
whether you're trying to make a purified

96
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:13,519
isolate or a distillate for instance

97
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,360
okay so when it turns to the extraction

98
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,080
techniques there isn't a metric let's

99
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,720
say

100
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,440
per gram per liter extracted that people

101
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:23,120
use in the industry to be able to

102
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:24,400
use a specific okay this is the

103
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,000
technique we're going to use because it

104
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,519
delivers this a b and c of our return

105
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,759
well i mean that's a great question too

106
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,519
so yield is obviously really important

107
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:35,919
and depending on whether that's weight

108
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,120
end to weight out or how much solvent

109
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:38,479
you're using and other things there's

110
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,400
lots of different ways to measure

111
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:42,399
efficiency and i think scale of

112
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,760
operation is one of the most important

113
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,280
and kind of depending on where you're at

114
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:49,280
if you're trying to get a quick and

115
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,719
dirty ethanol you know extraction out

116
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,598
and then clean that up with distillation

117
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:54,639
for instance uh ethanol really is

118
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:58,318
a

119
00:03:54,639 --> 00:04:00,399
very cost-effective solution

120
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:02,399
and no reason to use you know something

121
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,920
like a very expensive co2 extractor

122
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,200
again for instance right if you're just

123
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,199
trying to make crew that you're going to

124
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:09,759
clean up with distillate and what would

125
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:13,039
be super critical extraction what's the

126
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:13,039
that makes that so super

127
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:18,238
great question so super critical fluid

128
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:20,478
extraction is uh you take co2 and you

129
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:23,519
know there are uh there's liquid there's

130
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:26,079
solid and there's uh gas right well

131
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:28,560
supercritical is another phase of matter

132
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:30,159
where you actually have the

133
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,360
properties of a gas

134
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,520
and a liquid so you can

135
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,800
extract more efficiently when you're in

136
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:40,879
those those particular phases

137
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,560
okay amazing and

138
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:43,600
in the two processes that get the end

139
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,360
product the extraction and the

140
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,280
distillation can you do a bad

141
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,879
distillation and have a good extraction

142
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,638
or can you do a bad extraction and have

143
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:53,360
a good distillation or do you both need

144
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,000
to be delivering

145
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,720
standards that are required

146
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,120
another great question uh so i mean

147
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,120
you can certainly have bad distillation

148
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,879
and bad extractions right and you could

149
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,360
clean up a bad extraction with good

150
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:10,079
distillation and you could ruin a good

151
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,439
extract with a bad distillation process

152
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,159
for sure so

153
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:15,038
dialing in your pro your parameters uh

154
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,280
you know

155
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:18,639
vacuum depth temperature et cetera that

156
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:20,399
helps you achieve

157
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,879
your efficient extraction and or

158
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:24,239
distillation process

159
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:26,319
okay i'm going to jump on to the next

160
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,840
topic and it's something that i've kind

161
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:28,719
of been curious and i think you're the

162
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:30,719
most

163
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,160
expert guest that i've had on you might

164
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,479
be able to answer this for some

165
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,560
pharmacological properties terpenes

166
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:38,319
versus terpenoids versus cannabinoids

167
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,600
now we know terpenes are basically just

168
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:42,478
a simple harm

169
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,039
hide carbonated structure and terpenoids

170
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:47,680
have oxygen in that exact same structure

171
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:49,759
if you were to extract a product which

172
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,600
one would you be advising somebody to

173
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,720
put into a specific let's say an

174
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,639
oil-based product or are they all a

175
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,639
combination are going to be required to

176
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:02,079
have the the desired effect

177
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,160
another great question so i'm actually

178
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:06,079
not the best to answer pharmacological

179
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,639
property questions but i do know that in

180
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,560
regards to classes of molecules terpenes

181
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,680
and trapenoids and and cannabinoids are

182
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,000
all terpeno terpene terpenoid phenolic

183
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,639
secondary metabolites and are all coming

184
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,399
together inside of uh in your typical

185
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,560
extraction process so if you know you're

186
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:25,839
going for a full spectrum or

187
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,038
uh a broad spectrum extract right um all

188
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:29,599
of these are coming together and they

189
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:31,759
make up that flavor profile that smell

190
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,120
profile everything that is really

191
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,639
whether it's a

192
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,240
solvent-less extract or a

193
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,439
hydrocarbon-based extract or whatever

194
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,600
that makes that that profile so unique

195
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:43,759
and broad spectrum versus full spectrum

196
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,319
is there an argument to be had here or

197
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,240
is it a non-conversation i hear somebody

198
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,240
who's it's not real unless it's full

199
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,840
spectrum and other people battle the

200
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,759
other way what's your expert opinion on

201
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:55,519
that

202
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,120
uh great question so for me it's

203
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:59,598
semantics whether it's full or broad

204
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,519
spectrum you know i guess a great uh

205
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:03,439
scientific approach to that is how can

206
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:05,598
you truly be full

207
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:07,519
if you are leaving behind like cellulose

208
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:09,918
or chlorophyll other things that might

209
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,519
not be necessarily of interest in your

210
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:13,758
extract

211
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:15,359
so you know whether it's full or broad i

212
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,439
think what the market is kind of define

213
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,120
that as is does it have trace amounts of

214
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:23,120
thc in it or no thc at all and that's

215
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,879
kind of where that has fallen

216
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,639
okay very interesting so full spectrum

217
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:28,000
medic is a is a non-starter for

218
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,598
conversation because it is an actual

219
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,800
full spectrum there are certain elements

220
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:34,000
left behind

221
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,439
okay great absolutely you got it yeah

222
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,839
this would be a wealth of information to

223
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:39,519
come out of you and basically i wanted

224
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:42,000
to talk about international affairs in

225
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:43,439
cannabis now we hear a lot of talk about

226
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,199
europe is going to be a bigger market

227
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:47,598
than north america and a lot of the

228
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,199
companies in canada and america talking

229
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:51,680
about how they're going to have x amount

230
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,520
of market share when it comes to this in

231
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,439
terms of the language that you see

232
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:57,758
happening in the international affairs

233
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:59,598
and cannabis how realistic do you think

234
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,520
american brands are going to be over in

235
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:04,159
europe selling to a recreate

236
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:05,839
recreational market and how quickly do

237
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,360
you think actually probably the senate

238
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:11,439
is going to okay

239
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,598
full legislation in america first off

240
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:15,120
ooh uh that's a good question so in

241
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:17,598
regards to

242
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,240
adult use products being manufactured in

243
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:21,918
say the states being shipped and sold in

244
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,160
europe i don't think that

245
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,519
uh is going to happen i think europe is

246
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,120
more than capable of being able to

247
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:30,799
produce its own

248
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:33,278
adult use cannabis products no problem

249
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,120
that said you know the more novel foods

250
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:37,278
dietary supplements and true

251
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,158
pharmaceuticals you know that's where

252
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:42,000
you might see more uh global commodity

253
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:44,319
manufacturing hubs coming up whether

254
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,679
that might be in india or south africa

255
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:50,879
or uh north america or wherever it might

256
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:52,559
more uh the climatic region makes it

257
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:54,240
more efficient right to produce these

258
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:56,879
raw materials that allow you to produce

259
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,159
large bulk uh ingredients for whether

260
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:59,838
that's the

261
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:01,838
food supply chain which obviously is

262
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,480
quite demanding on

263
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,600
raw ingredients or pharmaceuticals

264
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,039
um

265
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,120
when it comes so i think there's an

266
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:12,000
opportunity for say u.s manufacturers

267
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,959
who are uh advantageous about conforming

268
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,039
to

269
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:17,278
european quality control

270
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:19,360
practices to be able to sell either raw

271
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:21,120
ingredients or finished goods that they

272
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,639
can manufacture legally in the states

273
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:27,120
but say can't sell legally nationally

274
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:29,199
and can take advantage of the

275
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,120
say the european union or the uk's

276
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,240
marketplace that allows for novel foods

277
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,080
with cbd in them for instance

278
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,080
okay and what are your thoughts now

279
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,639
there's a lot of talk but we've already

280
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,040
talked to uh elan sobel from

281
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:45,519
bio harvest sciences and from creole

282
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:47,519
ingredients susie sarkar what are your

283
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,000
thoughts on the ability for bioreactor

284
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,600
bioreactors to be able to create kind of

285
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,399
a mass scale with a multiple different

286
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,159
uh yields per year for versus a farm do

287
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,480
you see that being an actual

288
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:02,799
logical uh

289
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,399
ingredient for people to be using due to

290
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:06,159
the price point they're going to be able

291
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,240
to compete with and the amount of scale

292
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:09,199
they're going to be able to deliver

293
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,039
i mean

294
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,720
precision fermentation is an amazing

295
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:14,719
science uh but to address your other

296
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,040
question i forgot uh within the united

297
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,759
states for legality where are we when is

298
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:21,519
it going to happen i'd stay still easily

299
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:23,600
three to five years out

300
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,679
before we see it nationally but

301
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,440
precision fermentation now that's an

302
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:28,799
amazing subject you know where are we

303
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,640
going to see that come into play in the

304
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:31,679
cannabinoid industry right

305
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:33,759
it takes place

306
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:35,519
when it comes to precision manufacturing

307
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:38,240
of enzymes and other things we see in

308
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,159
food like this is a known thing like

309
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,560
it's it's commonly done and without it

310
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:44,399
right we actually wouldn't have uh yeast

311
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:47,119
cultures that would be available right

312
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,600
to do it to sell commercially for bread

313
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,200
starts and things like that right so

314
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,278
precision fermentation is definitely

315
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,278
here to stay when does it come into play

316
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,958
for the cannabidoin industry that's a

317
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:59,519
great question because it's not as

318
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:00,479
simple as i just want to make thcv for

319
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,440
instance

320
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,879
well to do that you have to map out the

321
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,320
genetic

322
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:10,399
pathway to get from cbga the very first

323
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:14,160
cannabinoid all the way through the

324
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,839
cycle to get to thcv and that's not one

325
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:18,559
culture of yeast that's

326
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:21,040
multiple iterations and life cycles of

327
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:23,359
yeast to get to that one that'll take a

328
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:26,480
starter from another culture

329
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:29,200
and produce thcv so you have to have

330
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,200
a culture that produces cbga first and

331
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,360
then one that makes cbg and then one

332
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,120
that makes thca and then one that makes

333
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,278
cbga and then one

334
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,679
et cetera et cetera before you can

335
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:42,480
really get there so what we'll see is

336
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:45,120
these you know the master or precursor

337
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:48,959
cannabinoid cbg come around first

338
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,399
uh and i think you'll you know if you

339
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,559
kind of look around the industry you'll

340
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,958
already see that cbg from precision

341
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:56,479
fermentation is currently being used in

342
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,799
the marketplace

343
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,399
and then we'll see thc and cbd come

344
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:01,439
around but i think in those particular

345
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,559
cases

346
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,040
where you have

347
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:07,759
uh the e the ability to produce it so

348
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:09,919
easily from plant material it might be

349
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:12,000
harder to justify the significant

350
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:14,000
investment in that infrastructure to

351
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,679
precision ferment it but for some of

352
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,919
these novel cannabinoids that might be

353
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:21,039
more difficult to do and say that that

354
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:22,639
synthesis pathway might be easier to

355
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:24,000
genetically imprint

356
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,519
i think we'll start to see that come

357
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,720
around in the next five to ten years for

358
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,078
sure

359
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,399
yeah i think you see a lot of the

360
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:32,638
companies uh gerano flies phosphate and

361
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,799
the cbga are the kind of things that

362
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,039
they're initially uh having the let's

363
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:39,679
say the strain of yeast or visas spit

364
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:42,159
out and can do is it another case of

365
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:44,719
that cbga then just needs to have enzyme

366
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:46,240
reactions that'll turn the cbga into

367
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,759
another cannabinoids is that why the

368
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,720
process works or is it a whole new

369
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:53,519
strain of engineered use do you think

370
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,000
no no so you're right but it is also uh

371
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,879
another pers engineered strain of yeast

372
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,919
to do that second stage in the synthesis

373
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:01,519
pathway

374
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:04,000
i'll catch up i catch it i got you know

375
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,639
it's an example

376
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,278
i apologize one has to make the cbga

377
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:12,720
right and then the next yeast culture

378
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:14,320
then takes that cbga and turns it to cbg

379
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,800
i get you i gotcha it's definitely an

380
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,680
interesting space harley has a random

381
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:21,599
history already in in this space i'll be

382
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:23,519
so i think you you're going to see

383
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,200
once it gets perfected those rare

384
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,519
cannabinoids going into applied

385
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,278
pharmaceutical ingredients and gone into

386
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,480
food and beverage ingredients i think

387
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:33,360
it's definitely going to be a future for

388
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,680
the european industry for sure

389
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,680
100

390
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,639
tell me this what are you looking

391
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:39,919
forward to the most over the next 12 to

392
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,278
24 months

393
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:42,958
what's going to happen in the industry

394
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:44,799
that you're most excited about is it a

395
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,479
case of one of the things i'd love to

396
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:50,000
see is augmented reality being

397
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,959
introduced into a cultivation course or

398
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,198
maybe machine learning been used to

399
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,638
you to to to find some cannabinoids and

400
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:58,958
some properties that might not have been

401
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,799
already recognized

402
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:02,719
oh well that's uh interesting i like the

403
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:05,120
idea of augmented reality for training

404
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,839
especially remote right i i know that

405
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,679
it's been implemented already in like uh

406
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,519
facility walkthroughs you know see your

407
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:13,838
facility before it's built type of thing

408
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,919
right which has been interesting uh but

409
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,079
honestly as a member of astm

410
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:20,719
international's technical committee d37

411
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:24,078
on cannabis what i i see in the next 12

412
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,079
to 24 months is hopefully a

413
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,600
a significance and use campaign brought

414
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,159
on by

415
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,399
the committee to help inform the global

416
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:34,799
community of the existence of our 35

417
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,078
standards and how they can be used in

418
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:38,078
the impact and benefit to the

419
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:40,638
marketplace and regulatory authorities

420
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:42,638
that for instance have not yet set up

421
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,198
regulatory programs and might be

422
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:48,159
thinking about it and to help them ease

423
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:50,240
into from illicit to list

424
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:51,039
listed marketplaces so i'm excited to

425
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,039
see

426
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:57,120
more and more global marketplaces come

427
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:58,958
online and facilitate standards to ease

428
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,278
access into the marketplace and

429
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:03,198
hopefully facilitate a more diverse

430
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:05,838
uh and

431
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:07,759
i guess global community in regards to

432
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,120
the cannabis industry

433
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:11,198
yeah i couldn't agree with you more it

434
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,039
seems like little pockets at the moment

435
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:15,120
on a global scale and once those free

436
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:16,639
market and free trades are

437
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,480
open for this industry i think it's

438
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,399
going to be a very very exciting place

439
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,079
with people at yourself with great

440
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,679
interview inventions who've already got

441
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:25,759
a foothold in the industry it's been

442
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:27,120
great talking to you darwin it's been

443
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:30,399
exactly what i thought it was

444
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,679
informative and uh a great chat for

445
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,440
anybody who wants to know more about

446
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:35,679
darwin he's his own website the spock of

447
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,680
cannabis.com is below i highly recommend

448
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:40,399
everybody checking it out and thank you

449
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:42,319
again darwin

450
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,320
yeah thank you so much and live long in

451
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,639
process
