1
00:00:01,078 --> 00:00:04,078
foreign

2
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:18,358
who's a partner at Arman Nino Mike has

3
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:21,000
been a tax professional since 1999 as a

4
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,400
significant experience in federal state

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,778
and local tax for both illegal and a

6
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:25,858
financial perspective how you keeping

7
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:28,379
today Mike

8
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,820
I'm doing well how are you I'm fantastic

9
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:31,799
thank you very much for taking your time

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,539
to do this it's a topic I've wanted to

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,980
cover for a short bit of time and no

12
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:37,200
better man than yourself to be able to

13
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:40,019
help give us some guidance on this topic

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,340
yes looking forward to it great stuff do

15
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,200
you maybe want to give the audience a

16
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,059
quick overview in under 30 seconds of

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,379
how armanino ended up having a tax

18
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:48,599
division and how you ended up being

19
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:51,539
ahead of the Cannabis Tax Group

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:55,079
yeah I started uh several years ago back

21
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:57,359
in 2015 and I noticed that you know

22
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,160
cannabis was going to go state by state

23
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,259
and it was not going to be federally

24
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:04,198
legal for quite some time and it still

25
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:06,899
is not in the U.S and so

26
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:08,640
um you know learned about it and then

27
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,439
um wrote the Treatise for Thompson

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,920
rewarder it's all multi-state cannabis

29
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:15,779
Taxation and so I'm one of the leading

30
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,060
experts in how this industry is taxed

31
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,700
across the U.S

32
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,259
okay fantastic so there's a couple of

33
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,180
things that from a European perspective

34
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:25,739
I'd love to find out about the U.S tax

35
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,020
state by state so hopefully you're going

36
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:30,298
to be able to help so first and foremost

37
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:33,959
why are the taxes so high on a state

38
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:35,579
level is it just uh the governments and

39
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:37,798
the states don't understand how it

40
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:38,879
should be taxed or it's a part of greed

41
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,920
thinking the industry is going to bring

42
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:43,500
in more Revenue than it actually does

43
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,299
yeah unfortunately the the States you

44
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,819
know when they determine you know how to

45
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:50,520
tax this industry instead of taxing it

46
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:53,519
at a very low rate say alcohol or

47
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:55,798
tobacco they determine how much revenue

48
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:58,078
do they want to generate from Cannabis

49
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,360
then they figure out how much legal

50
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:03,719
cannabis will be sold that will be taxed

51
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:06,539
and then they back into the tax rate

52
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:08,879
which you know ends up being such a high

53
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,219
rate that many cannabis companies are

54
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,859
having trouble uh keeping their business

55
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:17,699
open because the the taxes are just so

56
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:20,760
high and the illicit Market is thriving

57
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:23,098
under these conditions

58
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:24,598
okay interesting is there any state that

59
00:02:23,098 --> 00:02:26,639
have gotten it right so far or is

60
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:28,079
everybody doing the exact same mistake

61
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:29,039
that their predecessors have done before

62
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,680
them

63
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:33,299
yeah unfortunately the the the the newer

64
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,000
states that are coming onto the market

65
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,160
you know such as New York and others

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,400
um are making the same mistakes and and

67
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:45,299
in New York's case they're taxing it uh

68
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:47,159
not on price but on THC content and so

69
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:50,519
you know there could be some

70
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:52,859
manipulation of you know the the testing

71
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:55,500
labs to to

72
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,180
score something with the lower THC

73
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,000
because that means that'll be a lower

74
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:03,360
tax in in New York

75
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,519
okay and so when it comes to the news

76
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,680
that uh Governor Gavin Newsom of

77
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,180
California basically got rid of a

78
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,400
cultivation tax I think it is and

79
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,379
changed excise tax what's the big deal

80
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,780
with what he did there and was it a

81
00:03:13,378 --> 00:03:18,299
crazy uh play for the get-go they're

82
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:21,120
they're more riding around at the moment

83
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,459
yeah in California they they structured

84
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,379
their tax system somewhat like a

85
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:28,439
value-added tax that's used in Europe

86
00:03:25,378 --> 00:03:30,479
and they wanted to tax it all along the

87
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:33,539
way you know from cultivation to

88
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:35,219
distribution to manufacturing to finally

89
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:37,439
retail

90
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:40,199
um but at the cultivation level you know

91
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:43,620
that was just uh the tax again was too

92
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:47,098
high and you know now that it's gone

93
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:49,920
away it's a little too little too late

94
00:03:47,098 --> 00:03:53,399
kind of scenario for many California

95
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:56,039
um cannabis Growers because the price of

96
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,560
you know wholesale cannabis has gone

97
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:00,298
from say two thousand dollars a pound to

98
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,420
now less than six hundred dollars a

99
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:06,060
pound uh and it costs you know many of

100
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:08,878
those Growers about that much to to

101
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:12,598
produce the product

102
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:14,280
okay and so do you does it look like New

103
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:16,019
York so it seems to be the one that

104
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,879
seems to be uh maybe hopefully getting

105
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:21,000
it right or from your perspective are

106
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:23,219
they making the same tax and mistakes

107
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,800
that the other states are making

108
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:29,280
yeah again New York you know decided to

109
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,978
use a um THC content as their means of

110
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:34,379
taxing this industry uh at the retail

111
00:04:31,978 --> 00:04:36,659
level and and unfortunately I think that

112
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:40,139
there's just this race to higher and

113
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:41,759
higher THC levels you know to to you

114
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:45,300
know come up with a product that has the

115
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:47,220
highest THC which you know I I think you

116
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,460
know once you get to a certain point you

117
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:53,400
don't need more THC and you know New

118
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:55,079
York wants to tax you know it based on a

119
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:56,819
THC content and I don't think that's

120
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:59,819
going to be a solution either because

121
00:04:56,819 --> 00:05:02,759
the price of cannabis you know when you

122
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:05,939
buy it legally is going to be so high

123
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:08,759
compared to the illegal market and there

124
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:11,279
hasn't been enough enforcement of

125
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:13,620
illegal operators

126
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:16,198
um that you know I I think it's still

127
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,579
going to be a problem there in New York

128
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:19,500
um when it comes to setting the actual

129
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:21,120
percentage of taxes not to enter the

130
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,538
governor's office is down to the

131
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,220
taxation like the IRS is it down to who

132
00:05:24,538 --> 00:05:28,379
exactly decides right it's going to be

133
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:31,080
15 or 12 percent

134
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:33,360
yeah and it varies you know depending on

135
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:35,758
the different you know governments and

136
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,520
how they do it some of it is done by you

137
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,680
know uh committee some of it's done at

138
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:42,659
the legislative level

139
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,879
um you know certainly the governors of

140
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:47,820
each state you know has to sign off on

141
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:50,459
all of this so uh it goes through many

142
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:54,000
layers of review but unfortunately

143
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:56,758
there's too many uh hands you know in in

144
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,579
this issue and and everybody wants

145
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:01,139
cannabis to pay for all of the different

146
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:03,240
projects and things that they've been

147
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:05,759
wanting to do for years and didn't have

148
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,918
the revenue to do and you know many

149
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,600
state and local governments see cannabis

150
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:12,418
as their

151
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,100
um savior in this respect

152
00:06:12,418 --> 00:06:15,659
I would imagine there's a lot of

153
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,759
internal battles with the different

154
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:19,620
departments when a State legalizes the

155
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,500
industry to see who takes on the revenue

156
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:24,300
is the best model to create a new

157
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,279
division like let's say Colorado's

158
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,079
marijuana enforcement division or the

159
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:29,879
Cannabis Bureau in California is that

160
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:31,680
the best model or is it to be integrated

161
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:33,800
into the department of health or

162
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,360
Department of cultivate or agriculture

163
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:39,060
yeah and you know there's there's

164
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:42,479
usually like you know a grant for power

165
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:44,339
whenever cannabis becomes legal and you

166
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:47,699
know all these different agencies want

167
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:50,339
to have their say-so in in it and it

168
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:54,120
just further complicates it and makes

169
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:56,579
more regulations added to uh which is

170
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,860
already a very highly regulated business

171
00:06:56,579 --> 00:07:00,538
and it just makes it more difficult for

172
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:04,680
operators

173
00:07:00,538 --> 00:07:06,180
um to work in this this Arena so yeah it

174
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,439
would be great if there was just one

175
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:10,079
centralized

176
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:12,439
um you know body that you could get all

177
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:15,779
of the regulations done in that area but

178
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:18,839
you know you get environmentalists

179
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:21,239
involved you get you know work safety

180
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:24,359
people involved there's just so many

181
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:27,478
different you know agencies that get um

182
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,639
pulled into this that it just becomes a

183
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:31,439
nightmare for the for operators all

184
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:33,360
those Durant and countries like Ireland

185
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:36,120
and other countries in Europe that I can

186
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,280
learn from the process and and try and

187
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,038
ensure that it's a lot more smooth

188
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:42,598
sailing over this side of the pond

189
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:45,719
exactly and I I think what they should

190
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:49,139
do is is try to model it as closely as

191
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:52,020
they can to alcohol and tobacco where

192
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:56,038
you can have operators work in this

193
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:57,538
Arena maybe take advantage of rules and

194
00:07:56,038 --> 00:08:00,300
regulations that have already been

195
00:07:57,538 --> 00:08:04,259
established for alcohol and tobacco and

196
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:07,379
then parlay that into cannabis to the

197
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:11,280
extent possible so that it is just not

198
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:13,379
quite the burden that it is right now

199
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:15,598
okay next topic I wanted to jump into

200
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:18,959
was basically unpaid taxes in North

201
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:20,159
America the the likes of Matt at MJ

202
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:21,598
beers and some of the other great

203
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,699
articles they've read so far have been

204
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:25,978
highlighted this and it seems to be both

205
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:27,960
countries Canada and America are in the

206
00:08:25,978 --> 00:08:30,839
high hundreds of millions of unpaid

207
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:33,120
taxes towards the their respective

208
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:34,978
governments is this a part of just

209
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,440
normal business or is this something

210
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:38,940
that investors or people look at the

211
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,180
industry should be alarmed about running

212
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:44,820
up this level of of our debt

213
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:47,699
yeah this has been a quite a an issue

214
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:51,180
for for the industry and you know again

215
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:53,220
the taxes are so high that you know many

216
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:55,559
of these companies can't pay these taxes

217
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,899
with their working capital and so what

218
00:08:55,559 --> 00:09:01,859
they have chosen to do is not pay the

219
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:04,980
tax and you know run their business as

220
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:07,320
best they can and and kick the can down

221
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:10,259
the road and hope that you know it

222
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:13,440
becomes legal that these

223
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:17,039
um as tax assessments at some point get

224
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,500
negotiated for a lesser amount that they

225
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:22,860
work out some sort of uh an agreement to

226
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:25,519
maybe pay the taxes over a a long period

227
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:28,500
of time say you know five to ten years

228
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:31,259
uh and and hoping that their business

229
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,519
will then you know turn around in the

230
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:34,620
interim

231
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:37,740
yeah so it's more protecting your

232
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:39,299
capital for growth and uh arguing let's

233
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,278
say sense in the dollar down further

234
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:44,039
down the line and do you think this is

235
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:45,600
sustainable we I mentioned Our Fair

236
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:47,399
before that it seems to be that this

237
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,200
industry like other Industries will be

238
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:50,580
end up being dominated by a handful of

239
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,120
players in the different territories

240
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:55,440
like chocolate like uh crisp

241
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,179
manufacturing there's a various other

242
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,920
consumer package Goods that you could

243
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:01,259
point to this area where there's just

244
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:03,240
two or three big competitors was it a

245
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:05,159
case of in this industry that anybody or

246
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,899
Capital can get into it and we're now

247
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:08,939
just seeing the byproduct of the

248
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:10,379
strongest will survive and the weaker

249
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,820
companies are the ones falling off and

250
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:14,220
the ones with good balance sheets and

251
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,540
good executive structure and board

252
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,519
management are the ones that are going

253
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:20,338
to thrive long long term

254
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,620
yeah I see this you know being similar

255
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:25,019
to the Beer industry you know they're

256
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,360
going to be some major players they're

257
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:30,120
going to be worldwide brands that are

258
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,278
going to dominate you know the the

259
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:35,039
majority of the business but then there

260
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:38,580
will be like craft Brewers and others

261
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:41,039
that are smaller that will still you

262
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,839
know thrive in this industry because you

263
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:45,838
know cannabis you know affects people

264
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:48,720
differently based on your your body

265
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,940
composition and for some people one

266
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,040
product will have a great effect and

267
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:55,620
another product in that same product for

268
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:58,439
someone else could be you know does

269
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:00,179
doesn't do anything for them and so once

270
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,339
someone finds the product that they like

271
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:05,099
and a brand that they like and and the

272
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:06,480
effect that they get from that brand

273
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,180
um they're going to gravitate to that

274
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,920
and I think those entities will will do

275
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:13,859
well and and they could still be

276
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:18,120
acquired by the national uh and

277
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:21,539
international Brands and remain as as as

278
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:23,639
a small craft producer because you know

279
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:26,819
you don't want to lose that following

280
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:31,799
and and roll it up into a national brand

281
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:33,839
and and lose all that um marketing power

282
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:36,240
yeah speaking of Brands and marketing

283
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,100
power we see that the kind of top retail

284
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,139
Prospect over in America cookies have

285
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,300
already made some Ventures into the

286
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:44,819
European market I see them being one of

287
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:46,559
the dominant uh dominant brand names

288
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:49,560
across every single country I think what

289
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:51,299
Berner has done been done so far has

290
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:53,159
been pretty phenomenal

291
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:54,958
yes they're they're one of our clients

292
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:57,958
and I I started working with them when

293
00:11:54,958 --> 00:12:00,119
they had their first dispensary and uh

294
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:02,518
now they've become you know a worldwide

295
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,320
brand and you know continuing to grow

296
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:06,299
and you know that's going to be very

297
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,220
important in this industry is branding

298
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:11,939
and just like

299
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:14,759
um Coca-Cola and other worldwide Brands

300
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:18,000
um once you know you can dominate the

301
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:21,000
market with your branding and people you

302
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,578
know gravitate to that uh is very

303
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,440
helpful I mean what cookies is doing is

304
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:27,778
really produ you know promoting a

305
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,360
lifestyle you know so it's more than

306
00:12:27,778 --> 00:12:32,820
just the the cookies

307
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:35,278
um you know cannabis product you know

308
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:37,980
they have you know clothing and other

309
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:40,919
things that you know would be similar to

310
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:43,920
maybe like the Supreme brand that is

311
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:47,039
this Urban you know Lifestyle brand that

312
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:48,360
you know gravitates with many younger

313
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:50,159
people

314
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,778
yet now as we said they've been doing

315
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:53,519
phenomenal to work so far and I look

316
00:12:51,778 --> 00:12:56,220
forward to the day that Dublin has a

317
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,139
