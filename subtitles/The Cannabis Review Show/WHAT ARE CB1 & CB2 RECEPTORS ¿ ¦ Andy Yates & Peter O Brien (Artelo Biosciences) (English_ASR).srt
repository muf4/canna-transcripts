1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,839
foreign

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,440
everybody to the next episode of the

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,839
Cannabis review I'm delighted to be

4
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,879
joined in this episode by Andy Yates and

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,820
Peter O'Brien from artelo buoyance

6
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:22,799
biosciences and our Channel biome sizes

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,719
are as a clinical Stage Company that

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,778
uses cutting-edge science to improve

9
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:29,339
patient care they're founded in 2017 on

10
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:32,278
the premise of therapeutic development

11
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:34,320
based on lipid signaling modification

12
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,300
including the targeting The receptors of

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,738
the endocannabinoid system how we keep

14
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:39,000
it today gentlemen thank you for joining

15
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:41,159
us

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,039
thank you

17
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:45,238
thanks for inviting us on delighted to

18
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:47,280
have you done the show so I'm going to

19
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:48,959
break the questions into two uh

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,100
different sections so I'm going to I'm

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,200
going to start with you with a lot of

22
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,460
medical questions first and foremost can

23
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,199
you maybe give everybody a quick

24
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,840
overview of exactly their their

25
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,218
Ambitions and aims of our television

26
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,719
space

27
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,359
absolutely

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,540
um we recognized quite a while ago that

29
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:10,019
the endocannabinoid system which is a

30
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:12,840
series of lipids that the body makes

31
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:15,239
um has an influence in so many diseases

32
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,640
and disease States within the human body

33
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:20,699
that we we felt that there was a great

34
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,040
untap potential there so we took a sort

35
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,859
of classic pharmaceutical or biotech

36
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,380
approach and narrowed down on some

37
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:30,840
approaches where we could directly and

38
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:33,478
indirectly affect the endocannabinoid

39
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,340
system in a number of diseases so as you

40
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:37,618
said we we're a clinical Stage Company

41
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,140
we've got one asset in the clinic right

42
00:01:37,618 --> 00:01:42,900
now in uh anorexia associated with

43
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:45,299
cancer so that's a synthetic cannabinoid

44
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,820
which hits the receptors that we we

45
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:51,118
would know plant-derived cannabinoids

46
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:52,798
can hit we've got another compound which

47
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:56,700
is heading towards the clinic either

48
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,320
late next year or early 2024

49
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,840
um that's targeting something called

50
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,879
chemo induced peripheral neuropathy

51
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,000
which is a very painful condition for

52
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:07,978
cancer patients that undergo

53
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,699
chemotherapy that's a molecule again

54
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:13,400
synthetic which affects a protein in the

55
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:15,780
body which helps transport the

56
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,080
endocannabinoids around and by a fact in

57
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:22,140
that we can attenuate the the natural

58
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,940
tone of the body's endocannabinoids and

59
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:26,219
the final program we have which is in

60
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:28,378
the in pre-clinical development is is

61
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:32,039
taking a cannabinoid made by the plant

62
00:02:28,378 --> 00:02:33,899
called CBD or cannabidiol which is

63
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:36,060
really good when when you can get it

64
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,099
into the body and work there's plenty of

65
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,860
clinical studies to show its effects in

66
00:02:38,098 --> 00:02:42,299
a multitude of diseases but it's not a

67
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,519
very good drug it's not a very good

68
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,760
medicine so what we've done there is

69
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:50,519
taken the opportunity to combine it with

70
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:53,699
with another chemical substance which

71
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:55,800
sort of Turbo charges the the CBD and

72
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:58,199
allows it to be given

73
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,640
um orally in a sort of pill or capsule

74
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:01,439
format versus

75
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:03,899
currently where you have to get it in a

76
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,060
liquid format and that this helps it get

77
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,920
into the body a little easier and then

78
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,659
when it's in the body it can get on and

79
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:12,719
do its job

80
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:15,359
okay incredible so for everybody that's

81
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:17,639
not understanding so the if you could

82
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,400
explain what are the cv1 and CV2

83
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:23,579
receptors for everybody please

84
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:27,180
absolutely so a lot of um a lot of

85
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:28,920
biology relies on receptors

86
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,900
um the way I was taught receptors and

87
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:33,179
the way I still see receptors is that

88
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,158
they are the the lock

89
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:38,040
um and obviously you want to either open

90
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:43,079
or close that lock and in order to do

91
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:46,859
that you need keys so cv1 receptor is a

92
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,360
a lock that is mainly located

93
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:51,360
um or was originally thought to be

94
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,280
mainly located in the brain but

95
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,519
subsequent to that you actually find a

96
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,919
lot of CB1 receptors located in organs

97
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:02,099
within the body that's very important

98
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:04,798
for our for our lead compound and CB2

99
00:04:02,098 --> 00:04:06,719
receptors again they were originally

100
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,239
called the peripheral cannabinoid

101
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:11,759
receptor I.E they occurred in areas of

102
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:14,219
the body that were not associated with

103
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:17,099
the brain there is some evidence that

104
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:19,500
CB2 does exist in the brain

105
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:22,979
um but again we see that mainly as a as

106
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:25,079
a body receptor if you wish and we've

107
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:28,079
got within our portfolio

108
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:30,839
um a molecule if you wish is the key and

109
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:33,599
can turn that lock at both the CB1 and

110
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:35,399
the CB2 receptor and that's the compound

111
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,740
that we're developing currently in

112
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:39,359
anorexia associated with cancer where

113
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:42,300
obviously patients lose a lot of body

114
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,960
weight and we actually believe that both

115
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:48,240
of those receptors are very important in

116
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:50,519
the effects that we will get and I see

117
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,560
in front from that drug

118
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:55,500
okay brilliant and can you maybe explain

119
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,899
what the benefits of modulating lipid

120
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:01,019
signaling Parkways are

121
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:04,500
yeah sure so as I said

122
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:07,198
um cannabinoids or the endocannabinoids

123
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:10,319
um that we make in our own body

124
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:13,139
um are a lipid molecule so lipid means

125
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:15,000
fat so they're based on fats and they

126
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:17,939
have a little modification that makes

127
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,579
them Target these CB1 and CB2 receptors

128
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:23,399
that we've already talked about so at a

129
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:27,060
very simple level lipid modification

130
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:29,000
means that we're able to alter the

131
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:31,379
balance of those lipids those

132
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,600
endocannabinoids and and you know get

133
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:34,800
the the cannabinoid effects from that

134
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,220
approach

135
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:41,340
the the molecule that we have which is

136
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:45,060
uh we I talked about being used for

137
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:47,579
chemo induced peripheral neuropathy

138
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:50,699
that targets a protein in the body

139
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:52,319
called fatty acid binding protein or

140
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:55,080
fabp

141
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:58,139
as the name suggests it moves fatty

142
00:05:55,079 --> 00:06:00,120
acids around and fatty acids or lipids

143
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:02,060
so what we know with that molecule is

144
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,459
that not only does it affect the

145
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:07,500
endocannabinoid tone which is

146
00:06:04,459 --> 00:06:11,339
cannabinoid based but it also affects

147
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:13,740
other lipids and lipids signaling is I

148
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:16,159
guess a new frontier in biology and

149
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:19,019
science so people may have heard of

150
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,840
genomics and proteomics which is the

151
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:23,639
study of genetics and proteins well

152
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:26,519
we're looking at lipidomics and

153
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:29,579
lipidomics is the study of lipids within

154
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:33,240
the cell and if you can modify lipids in

155
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:35,818
the cell then you can modify diseases

156
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,460
okay incredible so as you mentioned that

157
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:40,620
uh CBD is a great molecule but

158
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:42,599
necessarily not the best molecule on its

159
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:45,240
own to be able to provide any relief for

160
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,699
a patient our Blends and formulations

161
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,918
now the key to the medical side of the

162
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:51,780
Cannabis industry moving forward

163
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:53,758
that's a great question

164
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:56,099
um that is one of the approaches being

165
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,259
taken I guess by some of our competitors

166
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:00,419
and those that are in the alcoholic

167
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:02,819
unlicensed cannabinoid space so they're

168
00:07:00,418 --> 00:07:04,439
using unlicensed medicines simply

169
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:06,660
because at the moment there aren't that

170
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:08,038
many licensed medicines it's not like a

171
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,740
bad approach it's just a different

172
00:07:08,038 --> 00:07:14,180
approach they definitely are using

173
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:17,180
formulations and blends as their way of

174
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:19,918
optimizing the what the plan can do

175
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:22,800
we've taken a different approach which

176
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:24,359
says we believe the active molecule in

177
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,900
in the plans or one of the active

178
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:30,960
molecules in the plant is CBD and just

179
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:34,679
like we've talked about before CBD is is

180
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:36,478
a fatty lipid like molecule and for any

181
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,699
one of your viewers who's ever washed

182
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:41,758
the roasting pan or the frying pan after

183
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:43,978
uh uh some food you realize obviously

184
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,780
that that fats and Waters don't mix and

185
00:07:43,978 --> 00:07:49,199
we've got exactly the same problem with

186
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:50,879
CBD when you take CBD and you take it

187
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,598
into your stomach the first thing it

188
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:57,899
hits is the is the stomach juices and

189
00:07:54,598 --> 00:08:00,659
they are made of water so it doesn't it

190
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:02,038
doesn't dissolve very well and from then

191
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:05,160
on in you've got a bit of a problem

192
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:07,139
getting the CBD across the gut wall and

193
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,599
into the blood and plasma where it can

194
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:13,019
do its job and what we've done is we've

195
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:14,639
formed a cold Crystal of CBD so that's

196
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:18,899
where we've combined it with another

197
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:21,720
chemical called TMP which is a food food

198
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:24,418
ingredient and what it does is it Stacks

199
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,759
the CBD in a very orderly way I think of

200
00:08:24,418 --> 00:08:29,279
Lego block blocks here you know Yellow

201
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:32,639
Block representing CBD red block

202
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:34,978
representing tmvp and it goes yellow red

203
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:37,979
yellow red yellow red and by doing that

204
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:39,200
what you've done is broken up the very

205
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:43,440
fatty

206
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:46,200
non-penetrating environment of of the

207
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,420
fatty CBD and you've given it a chance

208
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,339
to interact with the water in the

209
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:52,740
stomach and start to dissolve of them

210
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:54,779
once you've dissolved CBD then you're on

211
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,700
a good pathway forward to get that CBD

212
00:08:54,778 --> 00:08:59,399
into your blood where it can go off and

213
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:02,580
do many of the the different things that

214
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:06,240
CBD is is from the literature known to

215
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:09,060
do such as a pain relief uh helping with

216
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,700
sleep and anxiety and stress lowering

217
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:13,379
inflammation Etc

218
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,600
brilliant Peter now I want to ask you a

219
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:17,159
few business questions do you see all of

220
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,680
the top companies in this space coming

221
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:22,079
from North America at the moment or is

222
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:23,819
there you start to see movement in

223
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,680
Europe because we really have a lot of

224
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,720
the top pharmaceutical companies based

225
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:30,000
whether it's in Malta or in Ireland so

226
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,820
are we slow to catch up or North America

227
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,339
just too far ahead of us at the moment

228
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:38,879
yeah it's a very good question on and I

229
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:42,320
suppose yeah I I often think of where

230
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,320
we're based on Fitzwilliam Square

231
00:09:42,379 --> 00:09:49,620
to has been very it's notorious for

232
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:52,739
being the aircraft leasing square of the

233
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:55,139
world so apparently 70 of aircrafts are

234
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:58,440
released from fitzroyum square but when

235
00:09:55,139 --> 00:10:01,019
you look at the square it also has a a

236
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:03,779
very strong representation when it comes

237
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:05,700
to companies in our space and unusually

238
00:10:03,778 --> 00:10:07,679
strong I would say so

239
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:10,500
um GW Pharma

240
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:13,379
who would be I suppose one of the the

241
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,839
companies that we would have um look to

242
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:18,838
when we we started pioneering in this

243
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:22,140
area and GW were bought out I believe

244
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:25,740
two years ago for um I believe 7.6

245
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:27,958
billion by Jazz Pharma and um the Jazz

246
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:30,419
farmer a couple of Doors Down GW where

247
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:32,278
as well and satisfire and some of the

248
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:34,319
other companies so

249
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:36,899
um tilray apparently is around the the

250
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,480
corner as well so and there's quite a

251
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:41,100
nice mix and and it's it's

252
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,959
um it's interesting to see that they're

253
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,959
all on their doorstep interestingly

254
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:48,778
enough one of our programs is with

255
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:50,819
um Trinity College in Dublin and they

256
00:10:48,778 --> 00:10:53,338
have a newsletter and a lot of the

257
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:56,640
alumni get this newsletter so I often

258
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:59,700
get and WhatsApp or LinkedIn messages

259
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:01,799
and referring to any news that is uh

260
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,560
that has put out in Trinity so look it's

261
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:08,578
a very small space and there's not many

262
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:11,099
companies globally in this Arena and um

263
00:11:08,578 --> 00:11:13,500
so it's um certainly one to watch

264
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:16,019
yes very much so do you think that's the

265
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:18,000
high Capital uh cost initially in

266
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:20,220
intensive Capital to start and the

267
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,659
expertise that's required that basically

268
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,399
is a hindrance to a lot of companies

269
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:26,100
putting their foot in this

270
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:28,379
yeah I suppose look when I I'm not as

271
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,220
involved in the company as much as Andy

272
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:31,500
as

273
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,899
um these days but I do look after the

274
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,700
investor relations for Europe and Greg

275
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:38,578
and Andy will be at the Forefront of the

276
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:40,980
company and Professor Sergio Sullivan so

277
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:42,239
um professional Sullivan is a con tariff

278
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,940
NATO so

279
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,980
um also Dublin curl and X Trinity and

280
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:49,680
and obviously Andy is across the water

281
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:51,839
so when we when myself and Greg for his

282
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:54,179
company we asked you know many people

283
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,279
who were the best people in this area uh

284
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:57,899
this Arena and we were and we were

285
00:11:56,278 --> 00:12:00,838
Andy's name was brought up a couple of

286
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:03,240
times so thankfully he came on board so

287
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:05,220
I suppose look since 2017 we've been

288
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,740
building the board clinically very

289
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:09,480
strong in Europe and in America and the

290
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:11,759
board in the US has always been very

291
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,680
strong and so we work with various

292
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:16,559
universities and

293
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:18,559
what I would say is that and you know we

294
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:20,879
identified our competition we started

295
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,199
and we were never going to go into

296
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:24,120
growing

297
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,220
um cannabis and going down that route

298
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:29,339
what we wanted pharmaceutical company

299
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:31,860
and to you know focus on the triggers of

300
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:33,660
the endocannabinoid system so we

301
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:36,300
differentiate ourselves immediately from

302
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:38,100
the very start and which helped us we

303
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:40,500
felt absolutely

304
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,120
um I suppose Greg would have um you know

305
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,759
30 years experience of Pharma companies

306
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:46,620
in North America and Connie maksui and

307
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:50,039
he's our chairwoman and she's head of

308
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:51,980
and you know it has been ahead of many a

309
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:53,699
big large and public companies

310
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:56,399
Alzheimer's is one where she was

311
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:58,259
chairperson for a couple years and um so

312
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,320
we knew the costs involved and we wanted

313
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:03,958
to set it up so we could deliver and we

314
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:06,420
as Andy touched on what we wanted to do

315
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:09,059
was we knew people weren't going to be

316
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:11,039
able to get the right doses up you know

317
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:12,958
if they'd Rank 10 bottles of CBD a day

318
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:15,240
I'm sure the effect their liver and

319
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:18,359
kidneys and everything so we from the

320
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:21,120
outset we felt prescribing gas in our

321
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:24,480
programs to um to be able to be as

322
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,700
bright was the way to go and and it's a

323
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,820
longer Road far more expensive road but

324
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:32,639
we haven't changed from that and all the

325
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:35,100
management decisions have been with a

326
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,259
view to FDA approval which is obviously

327
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:39,899
our core Crystal and cook crystals have

328
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:42,299
been FDA approved before so we've um

329
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:44,940
we've we've stopped to a pretty

330
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:48,059
um you know a pretty tight

331
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:51,120
um guideline and mandate

332
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:53,159
yeah we've been very disciplined and we

333
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,620
actually benefit from the best of all

334
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:57,480
worlds as Peter alluded to you know

335
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:00,179
we're listed on the NASDAQ and we've got

336
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:02,519
a North American biotech very strong

337
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:04,979
management team and board

338
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:07,259
um we've got our Irish operations which

339
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:09,300
is fantastic because Trinity College

340
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:11,759
with the expertise there we're really

341
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:14,099
tap it into both pre-clinically so we've

342
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:16,860
got pre-clinical work ongoing but also

343
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:19,740
the clinical study and we hope to engage

344
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:22,320
more sites in Ireland and then from a UK

345
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:26,579
perspective I I'm sat here today in the

346
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:29,339
ax AstraZeneca r d facilities

347
00:14:26,578 --> 00:14:31,799
um and we can tap into world-class

348
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:33,720
research here on our on our door but

349
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:35,939
drug development actually research on

350
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:39,240
our doorstep and benefit from a

351
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:41,760
fantastic r d credit environment which

352
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:45,000
the UK has put in place which allows us

353
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:46,679
to do the best research at the lowest

354
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,600
cost base

355
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:50,698
incredible we've we've nearly had our

356
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,079
time already it's flown by one quick

357
00:14:50,698 --> 00:14:54,599
question left Andrew you might be able

358
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:56,578
to want to answer this one from start to

359
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,800
finish what's the rough time scale that

360
00:14:56,578 --> 00:15:00,838
it takes you to go from uh highlighting

361
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:02,578
a potential drug that you can make and

362
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:05,220
going through all the various trials is

363
00:15:02,578 --> 00:15:07,319
it one year five years

364
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:09,778
um to take it through a trial we'll take

365
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:12,000
between one to two years but you may

366
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:15,059
need more than one trial

367
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,399
um it also obvious but it depends on

368
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:20,159
where you start from so with our lead

369
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:22,919
clinical compound we actually license

370
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,319
that compound from AstraZeneca

371
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:26,819
um so obviously a well-known

372
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,620
pharmaceutical company so they actually

373
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,778
already spent four or five years

374
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,940
researching this drug it didn't work for

375
00:15:30,778 --> 00:15:35,519
what they wanted it to work in but we we

376
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:37,079
saw a different opportunity there

377
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,339
um so I would say sort of start to

378
00:15:37,078 --> 00:15:40,439
finish you're looking at a sort of

379
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:43,500
five-year development timeline and we're

380
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,000
we're in yeah well into that for drugs

381
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,458
that are more in the sort of

382
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,039
pre-clinical space which is our fatty

383
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:51,838
acid binding protein inhibitor so we've

384
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:53,759
actually already had four or five years

385
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,579
worth of research in that from our

386
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,559
partner at Stony Brook University and

387
00:15:56,578 --> 00:16:00,179
we're now taking it on its journey into

388
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:03,299
the clinic and again you could probably

389
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:05,099
expect about you four to five years in

390
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:07,679
the clinic before it can become a

391
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:09,240
registered drug saying for the cold

392
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:10,919
Crystal

393
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,440
well gentlemen the time was up already

394
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:15,179
but I think artelo bio and scientists is

395
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,800
one of the top companies that I found in

396
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:18,599
this space around the world and I think

397
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:20,578
the next five to ten years is going to

398
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,440
be very exciting to see all the IEPs

399
00:16:20,578 --> 00:16:24,000
that come out of this industry and all

400
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,500
the benefit that can be created for

401
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
patients from all the hard work you guys

402
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,860
are doing

403
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,600
