wanted to talk about it's the juicy

54
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,979
field story it seems to be a big news at

55
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,140
the moment in the Cannabis industry how

56
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:18,119
a group of guys created an investment

57
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:20,279
platform that turned into a Ponzi scheme

58
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,439
and ran away with everybody's money can

59
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,719
you maybe give everybody your expert

60
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:27,479
overview of that scenario in that case

61
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:31,019
so we can get people up to speed on it

62
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:33,840
well yes I started to cover uh Jessica's

63
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:37,759
story just a few days ago actually other

64
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:40,500
Publications such as uh El Diario and uh

65
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:43,739
Spin and zero covered this topic for

66
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:46,919
months because of this alleged scheme

67
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:49,500
images about basketballs uh crowdfunding

68
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:53,238
cannabis platform where people could

69
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:59,459
invest to buy a plant to be cultivated

70
00:02:53,239 --> 00:03:01,680
uh uh Harvest and sold and but uh at the

71
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:05,219
same time it was discovered it could be

72
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:08,219
uh on uh quantity scheme yeah in the

73
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:10,259
sense that the the website is not

74
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:14,759
working uh it's not working more

75
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:18,658
actually and uh people uh just uh cannot

76
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:21,598
withdraw their their deposits and uh now

77
00:03:18,658 --> 00:03:24,780
there are uh some private investigation

78
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:28,798
about what's going on there on a

79
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:31,860
juicital platform and uh actually there

80
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,799
are some lawyers working uh only at best

81
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:37,760
clip it seems that

82
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:42,000
um the owners of the platform belong to

83
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:45,419
three people with a Russian uh passports

84
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:50,658
and uh they just they just disappeared

85
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:54,658
even the CEOs of the the pharmacy of the

86
00:03:50,658 --> 00:03:57,298
uh juicy juicy food uh said he didn't

87
00:03:54,658 --> 00:03:59,519
know anything about that but of course

88
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:00,799
the investigation are ongoing there are

89
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,719
no

90
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:06,599
official news schedules of the

91
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:09,000
developing story and uh basically upon

92
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:12,719
the scheme uh it's based on the fact

93
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,699
that the early investor uh get the money

94
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:17,879
from a newer investors

95
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:22,139
so on that in this way the contest came

96
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:24,540
uh is a functioning for uh for the

97
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:26,600
owners to collect all morning possible a

98
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:31,620
disappeared suddenly

99
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:33,740
and uh Jessica was uh mainly focused on

100
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:37,139
cannabis cultivation

101
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:41,819
but investors most of them were from

102
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:45,139
Latin America Spain and Europe with some

103
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:50,159
users also from Asia and North America

104
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:54,540
but uh as the the coverage suggests me

105
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:58,680
uh that most users were from Germany uh

106
00:04:54,540 --> 00:05:02,280
Spain and uh Latin America and um but

107
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:07,379
they were also like uh Italian or uh

108
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:10,079
uh British uh British uses so it was a

109
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:13,199
very uh huge platform in terms of

110
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:16,859
cannabis industry because it counted

111
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:20,400
about 500 500 000 users according to uh

112
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:23,100
Joseph official records

113
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:26,099
um but at the same time you know the

114
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:30,360
Cannabis industry is a very new industry

115
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:33,539
it's a very volatile and scums can

116
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,520
happen we um like in any other new

117
00:05:33,538 --> 00:05:37,620
Industries

118
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:41,579
yeah no I agree there's I think this

119
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:43,439
won't be the last uh opportunistic

120
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:44,939
um company that we see praying on

121
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:46,079
people's investment and people's money

122
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:48,180
because as you said it's still

123
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,819
unregulated there's still a lot of black

124
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,680
holes to the to the industry the latest

125
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:55,199
article you wrote We reposted on the

126
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,240
Cannabis review was about Switzerland uh

127
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,240
legalized medical cannabis and and and

128
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,400
and imports and exports do you see those

129
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,199
that uh we know Spain legalized and

130
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,000
they're saying within six months they're

131
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:07,860
gonna have a medical cannabis program up

132
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,360
and running do you think Switzerland are

133
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,400
going to be within that time frame or

134
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,020
within 12 months or is it still too uh

135
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:15,359
too early to tell

136
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:18,599
well uh can we uh can it be this

137
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:24,240
business around was really legal for a

138
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:27,060
specific uh uh disease uh conditions and

139
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:30,900
but now from a from my first of August

140
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:35,100
it will be uh fully legalized which

141
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:38,459
means uh passion won't uh have us for me

142
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:42,060
uh authorization to the agency but

143
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:43,918
simply a physician could prescribe

144
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:47,160
cannabis for them

145
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:53,120
and also cannabis would be with a high

146
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:55,819
level of that uh CBD I'll do uh

147
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:59,098
THC should be kept at the one percent

148
00:06:55,819 --> 00:07:01,860
but probably it could be uh it could be

149
00:06:59,098 --> 00:07:04,978
more we have to see about that about the

150
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:07,860
implementation of the law and uh of

151
00:07:04,978 --> 00:07:10,680
course could be a very good news for

152
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:15,900
European countries which are lacking up

153
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:17,579
supplies uh for example in Italy uh most

154
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:20,038
of the supplies come from the

155
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:23,300
Netherlands and other parts of Europe of

156
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:27,120
Canada through Aurora cannabis

157
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:29,939
company and but also all their state

158
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,939
lots of uh cannabis supplies so there

159
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:35,939
are many patients that depends what kind

160
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:39,060
of conditions the uh the legislation

161
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:41,879
allowed to use a medical cannabis and

162
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:44,579
also for Spain which has apparently uh

163
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:48,000
recently legalized cannabis although uh

164
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:50,219
have interviewed some some experts in

165
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,120
the field of a Spanish cannabis industry

166
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:56,639
which have written is a very limited

167
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:59,459
legislation which won't

168
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:03,120
um solve the problem at the moment

169
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:04,918
yeah we had Dr adanda Celeste Kyogre on

170
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,720
the episode recently and he was

171
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:08,818
basically outlining that six months is a

172
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,819
little bit ambitious for Spain to think

173
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:13,860
and even the the the language used in

174
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:16,259
the ruling is still unclear which uh

175
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,180
whether it's a specialized physician or

176
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:20,879
he he was even saying that it's a doctor

177
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,740
with no conflict of interest is the one

178
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,560
who has to prescribe but as I said

179
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:27,300
trying to figure out that web of uh

180
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,918
of knowledge will be a tough one for the

181
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,918
Spanish regulator is I want to basically

182
00:08:28,918 --> 00:08:34,319
move on now to Middle East North African

183
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:36,478
cannabis and the various territories in

184
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,039
there basically there's a lot of

185
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,379
countries and I wanted to try and cover

186
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:42,958
them all so I've got a list of all the

187
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:44,458
top countries in this space and I

188
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,958
basically want to run through them and I

189
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:49,139
want to give you get you to give them an

190
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:51,419
A or an F depending on how good their

191
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:55,019
cannabis industry is okay so that sounds

192
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:58,620
fair sure right so first one is Algeria

193
00:08:55,019 --> 00:09:01,799
where does Algeria stand arf

194
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:06,120
well except if we talk about uh

195
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:08,219
regulation of cannabis or all the of the

196
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:11,459
recreational Cannabis all the Middle

197
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:13,379
East countries are at which means not

198
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:15,018
badly legalized cannabis for

199
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:18,480
recreational use

200
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:20,820
and uh so Algeria is included on that

201
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:24,659
although there are some illegal

202
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:27,300
cultivation some uh legal trafficking

203
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:30,439
okay perfectly Bahrain

204
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:34,799
Bahrain the same the same

205
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:38,040
uh also even uh CBD is considered

206
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:40,199
illegal because it's a part of the

207
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:43,500
uh of the cannabis plant which is

208
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,000
considered the legal there as well yeah

209
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,220
that's what we think parents one of the

210
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,778
strictest ones Egypt anything happening

211
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:52,440
in Egypt

212
00:09:48,778 --> 00:09:58,379
Egypt has a long history of a cannabis

213
00:09:52,440 --> 00:10:01,620
culture uh uh since the 18 uh um yeah

214
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:04,019
the 18th century they were or even uh

215
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:06,778
even before there was largely consumed

216
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:10,019
by population which is the uh most

217
00:10:06,778 --> 00:10:12,360
populated Arab country and but still is

218
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:14,039
uh illegal there are trafficking between

219
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:18,000
the upper Sydney

220
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:22,439
and I would uh with a border with a Gaza

221
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,899
Strip and uh but it's illegal as well

222
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,700
so Iran and Iraq I'm pretty much going

223
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:28,559
to put together I presume it's highly

224
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:31,379
illegal there as it is in Bahrain that

225
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:34,018
there's not even a CBD Market yeah I

226
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:36,240
mean Iran is a even

227
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:39,799
um I mean drug trafficking could be

228
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:43,320
punished with a deaf parents as well

229
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:45,299
Iraq uh I'm not sure about that penalty

230
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,040
but of course it's illegal yeah yeah

231
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:49,259
some of the countries seem to be now

232
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:51,659
Israel we know of obviously has a

233
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:54,899
thriving medical uh industry at the

234
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:59,039
moment and Export industry yeah is there

235
00:10:54,899 --> 00:11:01,679
is a different story uh Israel uh we can

236
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:03,000
if uh has no legalized the rec National

237
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:05,819
candidate

238
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:10,159
medical cannabis could be used for

239
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:12,899
certain uh usage but a very entrepreneur

240
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:15,179
but at the same time wasn't interesting

241
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:18,919
about Israel is the research we don't

242
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:24,539
have to forget uh uh

243
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:28,319
that THC was isolated there in in 1964

244
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:28,319
by micholam

245
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:34,800
in 1964 it was isolated there so it's a

246
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:37,620
long history with a

247
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:41,099
with the research and also recently is

248
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:43,560
one of the largest import of cannabis uh

249
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:47,579
I think even more than Germany actually

250
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:51,000
and uh it started to export uh seats to

251
00:11:47,578 --> 00:11:51,958
the U.S recently in a couple of months

252
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
ago

253
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:56,278
okay so Jordan is there any movement

254
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,240
Jordan there seem to have uh for

255
00:11:56,278 --> 00:12:02,338
thinking King no no uh Jordan as well

256
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:07,259
same legislation on what this country is

257
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:10,459
predicted and uh it's illegal and Kuwait

258
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:13,799
illegal as well Lebanon

259
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:17,039
Lebanon was the first country to

260
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:21,120
legalize medical cannabis in 2020

261
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:25,439
to with the hope to uh

262
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:28,740
to contain the economic crisis uh that

263
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:31,200
started in 20 in late 2019 I'll Harbor

264
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:33,060
has not been

265
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,660
um has not been implemented the

266
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:39,479
legislation at the same time so there is

267
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:41,699
a just a loop that has not lamented no

268
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,440
companies working on it no Farmers as

269
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,420
well at the same time Lebanon has long

270
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,180
history with the hash issue Lebanese

271
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:50,458
hashes it was one uh one of the

272
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:53,399
top-notch hardships in the world along

273
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:57,299
with the Moroccan hashish and it

274
00:12:53,399 --> 00:13:00,600
exported legally uh with traffic rule to

275
00:12:57,299 --> 00:13:02,458
a Middle East Country and Africa as well

276
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,800
yeah I've just finished a book about the

277
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:06,899
Phoenicians and uh hashish and Lebanon

278
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:09,120
clubs up a little bit in the the kings

279
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:11,759
of trading in the Mediterranean a number

280
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,740
of years ago so how about uh Libya then

281
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:16,679
is there any action in Libya

282
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:19,320
Libya uh there is no legislation as well

283
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:22,259
layout in uh it's legal regarding

284
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,079
cannons Morocco we we know that there's

285
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:27,360
a movement happening there to a degree

286
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:30,679
yeah Morocco legalized medical economies

287
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:34,200
and Industrial Hub in 2021

288
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:36,899
uh and to contain also the drug

289
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:41,278
trafficking there and a half Farmers

290
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:43,559
from the rape region uh to to go legal

291
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:48,659
at the same time Iraq is the first

292
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:50,778
supplier of uh hashes hashes on uh in

293
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:54,838
the European continent

294
00:13:50,778 --> 00:13:56,759
uh so it's a so recreational camera be

295
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:59,300
still continue to be illegal although

296
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:02,819
there is uh some form of the tourism

297
00:13:59,299 --> 00:14:06,120
regarding the uh regarding the legal

298
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:10,139

00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:36,120
everyone even regarding uh CBD uh some

308

all the different charities that are

334
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,959
happening at the moment for anybody who

335
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:02,578
hasn't read any of Dario's work I highly

336
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:04,679
recommend going to his website the link

337
00:16:02,578 --> 00:16:06,719
is below and in the information below

338
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:08,758
subscribe to the newsletters there he's

339
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,920
one of the top journalists covering

340
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:12,720
cannabis is as far as I'm concerned so

341
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:14,639
Dario thank you very much for taking the

342
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,500
time to join us today

346
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:22,559
year and we'll get an update on some of

347
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,659
these territories and hopefully we've

348
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:26,458
got some movement in Europe and uh

349
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:31,278
