around there around europe and look at

11
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:29,278
the kind of top media platforms that are

12
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:31,198
in europe and as everybody knows

13
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:32,880
newsweek friends is the top platform in

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,480
france so it's great to have you on the

16
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:39,039
what is happening in your district can

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,800
you maybe get everybody up to speed and

18
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,640
where your career started in media and

19
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,479
how you ended up setting up news with

20
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,920
friends so we before we move into the

21
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:47,599
first topic

22
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,719
yes um

23
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,840
so newsweek was created seven years ago

24
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:58,320
uh before that i worked um in the media

25
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:00,399
industry um and i just figured out that

26
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,679
in france we didn't have any cannabis

27
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,680
news um so i'm

28
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:08,959
decided to

29
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,400
fulfill this empty space

30
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:13,438
and just

31
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,359
do what uh i was doing in in my previous

32
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:18,719
company um

33
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:22,799
that's building web platform um building

34
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:26,319
audience um and just talking about um

35
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,680
an empty topic in france um and when

36
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,000
starting

37
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,799
seven years ago um

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,879
i

39
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:37,280
was pretty sure i am was very aware of

40
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:40,000
all cannabis related topics and i

41
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,359
discovered pretty quickly that i didn't

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,640
know anything

43
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:44,640
um that

44
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,960
everything that i was taught in france

45
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,239
about cannabis was either debuts or

46
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:54,399
false um so i restarted to educate

47
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:56,000
myself on every cannabis related topic

48
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,759
mostly with

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,280
anglophone sources studies therapeutical

50
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,879
studies and

51
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,759
all the topics that

52
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:08,478
is cannabis related and i started to

53
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,199
answer my own question and in fact the

54
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:14,560
first news with article were the answer

55
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:16,639
um at my question um and

56
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,360
after a few months

57
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:22,479
after starting newsweek it was really

58
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:26,160
a beginner stuff at the beginning

59
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:30,479
and i gained traction i can audience and

60
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:33,598
i decided to quit my job to um just

61
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:36,238
develop news with and and build a

62
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:39,280
true cannabis media that yeah it is

63
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,719
today and today we are

64
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,000

65
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:48,239
leading um cannabis median friends and

66
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:52,639
prejudices only one to do what we do um

67
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:56,159
that is um writing daily about worldwide

68
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:59,279
legal cannabis news without advocating

69
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:02,400
um or without be uh being a

70
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,519
pro cannabis or poor legalization

71
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:09,120
and we try to cover all kind of stuff

72
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:12,319
from political uh subject to

73
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,360
therapeutical to lifestyle to culture um

74
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:17,518
not translation because we can't uh

75
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,480
talk about translation in france but

76
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,519
culture

77
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:21,518
and and and

78
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:28,480
that array of after peach and i am

79
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,439
got um extremely lucky for example to

80
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,479
work with with maps which is one of the

81
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:33,759
biggest

82
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:37,679
tech company

83
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:39,439
cannabis related in u.s um so all my

84
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,719
journey

85
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:44,878
was really i was very lucky to meet a

86
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:48,239
lot of companies of worldwide companies

87
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:49,598
that are very very known now

88
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,280
amazing yeah you guys have built up a

89
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:53,280
great reputation and the content that

90
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,519
you put out on a daily basis are very

91
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,280
impressive to say the least the first

92
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,840
topic i wanted to kind of jump into was

93
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,120
european cannabis

94
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,280
media the one thing i've noticed about

95
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,480
the media was it was a very open space

96
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:09,120
at the start you had mj biz daily and

97
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,959
maybe business can came to the fore over

98
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,560
here a little bit first and pro pro

99
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,920
british parkers have acquired them now

100
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,478
recently so i'm sure they're going to

101
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:18,319
grow their their market share as well

102
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,399
everything seemed directed initially at

103
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:24,000
the the kind of business people and the

104
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:26,319
ceos and there has been very few

105
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,478
consumer based media platforms that i've

106
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:30,639
noticed up yet even the likes of high

107
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:32,240
time seem to have lost their way to a

108
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,240
good degree that they're not as

109
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,079
reputable as they used to be

110
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,840
who are the kind of cannabis media

111
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:40,560
players in europe that you kind of would

112
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:43,679
respect there's obviously laura ramos in

113
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,280
portugal what kind of reporter is one of

114
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,759
the good sources is there anybody up in

115
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:50,079
switzerland or germany or denmark or

116
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,759
maybe even italy that you're at grc and

117
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:55,758
coming to the fore

118
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:58,319
yeah and i i look at um yeah obviously

119
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,759
can reporter cannabis industry in

120
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:01,038
netherlands too

121
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,960
uh business

122
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:04,719
in uk dolce vita

123
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:05,680
in italy kenya

124
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,199
um

125
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,000
in spain

126
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:13,520
pretty every european country has his

127
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,639
own um either magazine or web platform

128
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:16,879
and

129
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,879
when i started news with

130
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:20,079
friends didn't have any

131
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,319
any so

132
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:24,000
that's why i created

133
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:24,800
my media

134
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,120
and

135
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,759
they are pretty reputable some of the

136
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,600
oldest magazines the printed magazine

137
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:36,319
still exists today

138
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:37,120
um and in france we didn't have any um

139
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:38,959
any

140
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,600
media about cannabis because it's really

141
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:45,519
difficult to to talk about cannabis you

142
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:48,879
can't um uh advocate for cannabis use

143
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:52,560
for example um it's still punished with

144
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:53,759
fine and and potentially jail um so the

145
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,918
media

146
00:05:53,759 --> 00:06:01,360
angle was a way to talk um

147
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:03,359
about cannabis without being punished uh

148
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,000
and i think all

149
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,720
the other european countries have more

150
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,399
facility to to talk and write

151
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,880
about that subject

152
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:15,198
obviously business is a big part of

153
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:16,000
all the media today

154
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,400
but

155
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,478
i try to have more

156
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:22,799
lifestyle and culture

157
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:24,240
which is important because um

158
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,759
all the medical

159
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:31,600
and the adult use industry is based on

160
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,400
what happened um 20 30 40 years before

161
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,759
and

162
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:37,758
we have to be aware of that to build a

163
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,280
sustainable industry

164
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,520
yeah now i agree i think a lot of the

165
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:43,758
b2b uh media platforms now they're all

166
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:45,279
just rehashing the same story somebody

167
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,360
puts out one story it just seems to be

168
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:49,918
copy and pasted ten times over whereas

169
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,759
the culture side of it and uh yeah

170
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:54,639
highlighting specific whether it's music

171
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,400
or food or creativity or whatever it is

172
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,160
that it may be there's a consumer base

173
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:59,758
out there that are consuming cannabis

174
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,919
not everybody's owning a business and

175
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,598
looking at the tax regulations and some

176
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:06,879
of the research that might be coming out

177
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:08,159
in in medical side of things um we're

178
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:09,439
actually going to be the cannabis viewer

179
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,120
going to be launching now in ireland as

180
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:13,199
the irish platform so we've got a lot of

181
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,199
lawyers going to be writing articles and

182
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,280
djs and people all giving in different

183
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,478
types of playlists and food but do you

184
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:20,159
think there's going to be a number of

185
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:22,079
mergers and acquisitions now over the

186
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,360
next couple of years in cannabis media

187
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:25,758
where there's a dominant player in

188
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,199
europe or do you see there being still

189
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:31,199
territorial publications that are

190
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,319
still just specific to each individual

191
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,120
country

192
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:38,800
yeah media is a complicated um

193
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:42,560
enterprise um as you can see in united

194
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,400
states or in canada a lot of media uh

195
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,319
felt uh

196
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,318
or almost disappear

197
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,360
for example the cannabis

198
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:53,280
who was a legacy media uh has been

199
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,960
bought by a local journal and then

200
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:58,638
closed i times as a lot of difficulties

201
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:01,198
to maintain

202
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:04,478
its business um

203
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:07,280
in canada um lyft was actually pretty

204
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:09,598
known and and almost disappear

205
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:11,359
they are still doing some events this

206
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:14,800
year

207
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:19,038
but as for europe um it could

208
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,918
um it's some major um could happen um

209
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:21,279
but

210
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:26,560
even if we are

211
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:30,239
a united 25 countries uh like big big um

212
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:33,759
uh big uh gathering um

213
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:38,080
we still have a lot of difference uh

214
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:40,879
mainly in in regular regulatory parts um

215
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,158
so you could have something and a lot of

216
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:44,879
language too

217
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:48,480
so it's really difficult to maintain a

218
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:51,360
wall homogeneity of news um talking

219
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,720
about um area and talking to everybody

220
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,759
in europe so i mostly see that uh with

221
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,839
uh

222
00:08:55,759 --> 00:09:01,360
each country will have

223
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:04,880
uh its own media or medias uh with

224
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:07,600
several one and it's that doesn't avoid

225
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:10,320
um some major um

226
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:13,440
between national media to have a

227
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,760
european media group uh it could also

228
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,120
happen um but

229
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:22,480
as for um development of the development

230
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,480
of the media um industries should look

231
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,639
at it too because media is really

232
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:31,200
powerful and important um to not to to

233
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:33,439
do communication or advertising but just

234
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,560
to be objective and spread

235
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,720
um

236
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:39,919
the reality of the cannabis in the good

237
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,720
and the bad and the bad sides um

238
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:46,399
and industries should support the media

239
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,680
because they are yeah spreading

240
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,320
the ideas

241
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:51,679
in really important for europe i

242
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,959
couldn't agree with you more the media

243
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:54,799
is the tip of the sphere in this

244
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:57,759
industry and that's it's how everybody's

245
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:59,199
being informed so the more well funded

246
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,480
and the better content that's been put

247
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,680
out by media companies the better it's

248
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,120
going to be for everybody in the

249
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:05,039
industry because it will create more

250
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,799
awareness and bring that level of

251
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:08,879
professionalism that needs to be brought

252
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:10,559
to some of the media platforms i'm going

253
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:11,838
to jump on to the last topic before i

254
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,159
let you go and it's an overview of

255
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,000
french cannabis now we've talked to uh

256
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:17,679
people before comparison it was a while

257
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
ago now so can you maybe give us a quick

258
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:21,838
overview of the first cultivation

259
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,360
license i saw with overseed were

260
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:27,920
announced um cbd flower on sale and

261
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,759
dispensaries over there or is it still

262
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:30,958
illegal to sell cbd flour because i

263
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,559
think that's one of the

264
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,159
big territories that's going on our big

265
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:36,078
industries that'll happen in europe is

266
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:38,639
the sale of cbd flower been allowed i

267
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:40,319
think is gonna explode in europe once

268
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,439
they get all the regulations in the

269
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,480
place

270
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:47,279
yeah so for the medical side um we have

271
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:51,120
an experimentation with two thousand

272
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:54,480
patients for five uh illnesses um those

273
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:59,799
patients have the right to have uh thc

274
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:02,560
oil and tick flowers now um and they are

275
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:04,559
experimentating for two years

276
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:06,078
one year remaining now

277
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:07,919
um and

278
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:10,239
the country decided to

279
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:11,759
give license to go medical cannabis in

280
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,519
france to

281
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:15,039
once the experimentation will be

282
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,440
finished and

283
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:20,159
medical cannabis reinforced and

284
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,560
authorized in france um

285
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:24,879
to have some french medical cannabis

286
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:26,879
because you don't rely on importation

287
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:29,360
forever

288
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:32,078
so the first company had

289
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:35,519
its license of production they are doing

290
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:38,958
um research and development uh tests for

291
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:41,200
now um but could be ready to have their

292
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:43,199
first commercial grow um at the

293
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,600
beginning of the next year

294
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:49,600
so it's just the first we know that it

295
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:52,959
takes a lot of time um to have a

296
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:56,879
a facility that is running and ready to

297
00:11:52,958 --> 00:12:00,239
um distribute to the patients that

298
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:02,639
friends finally managed to

299
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,680
come forward on something

300
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,839
medical

301
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:06,719
cannabis related

302
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,880
and

303
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,200
as you may know we are the first

304
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:12,240
cannabis user or one of the first in

305
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,278
europe

306
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,600
we are big smoker and big consumer

307
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:19,120
we also have the one of the harsher slow

308
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,440
in france

309
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,839
in europe because you can still have

310
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,720
some fine and some jail for cannabis

311
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:29,920
simple use just processing or smoking on

312
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,959
the streets for example um

313
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:32,159
and

314
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,399
the the

315
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:37,278
difficulty of that and

316
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:40,879
is that for example for cbd we had like

317
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:43,360
2 000 shops opened in like two years so

318
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:47,360
you have cbd shops everywhere on big

319
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:50,079
city in paris you may have like 200 cbd

320
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,560
shops with flowers and everywhere even

321
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:53,838
in the small city including countryside

322
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:56,479
you can

323
00:12:53,839 --> 00:13:00,240
shop cbd or to the tobacco shop you find

324
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:03,278
some cbd flower so it's everywhere it's

325
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,519
not really legal right now

326
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:08,799
but it's not illegal

327
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,320
and all the other cbd products are

328
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:12,319
totally okay

329
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,680
but as for the flower we don't have any

330
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:18,160
low so it's a bit far west

331
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:20,239
uh for this kind of business

332
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:21,919
yeah i noticed even over new york they

333
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,680
don't fully legalize until i think it's

334
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:26,078
october and it was over there like a

335
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:27,838
month ago and there's like weed trucks

336
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:29,439
on every single avenue and there's just

337
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,360
seems to be that loophole whereas they

338
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,720
know it's going to be legal so what's

339
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,959
the point in wasting the time with all

340
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,959
