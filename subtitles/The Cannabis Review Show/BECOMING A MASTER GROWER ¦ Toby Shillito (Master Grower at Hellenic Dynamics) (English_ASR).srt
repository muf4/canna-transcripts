1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:03,599
foreign

2
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:17,879
who's the master grower at Hellenic

3
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:20,399
Dynamics how you keeping today Toby

4
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:21,778
how are you very well thanks thank you

5
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:24,979
very much for taking your time to join

6
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:24,980
us I know you're a very busy man

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,278
it's lovely to be really there's no

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,439
finer topic of conversation on the

9
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:33,119
planet this is it right so no better

10
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,799
person to be able to go through this for

11
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:38,599
can you maybe give everybody a quick

12
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:40,859
little overview of how you came into uh

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,820
Hellenic Dynamics and your position

14
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:44,159
there

15
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,399
yeah so the last four years which is

16
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:50,759
basically the the legal medical time uh

17
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:53,640
in the UK for for me uh I've designed

18
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:55,859
five different large-scale medical

19
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,378
cannabis cultivation facilities in

20
00:00:55,859 --> 00:01:00,539
different countries in Europe uh and

21
00:00:58,378 --> 00:01:02,579
coming into Hellenic I was attracted by

22
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:05,338
the idea that Greece has got a really

23
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:08,879
low cost of production uh and it's got

24
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:11,039
land labor and so on uh and it's got a

25
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,899
direct export route to Germany which of

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,000
course is the most exciting Market at

27
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,340
the moment in Europe

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,900
yeah it certainly is even with the scale

29
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,640
back announcement that they made I still

30
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,380
think there's a lot of room for growth

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,359
for uh companies it doesn't have to be a

32
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:26,280
complete waterfall and Deluge initially

33
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:27,900
at the start sometimes refining the

34
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,540
process and having a little bit of delay

35
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,740
could be good for the end consumer yeah

36
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,600
that's right I mean the legalization

37
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:35,519
model is a is a reflection of the

38
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,438
dominant political culture isn't it and

39
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:38,938
in Germany it's quite surprisingly a

40
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:41,639
little they've gone for a much less

41
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:42,899
regulated much less corporate if you

42
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,659
like much less if you suppose

43
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,520
capitalistic model and in my heart I

44
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:48,960
welcome that very much in terms of

45
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,780
spreading the benefits of the plant

46
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:54,118
throughout society as fast and as he and

47
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,140
its inequality as you can possibly hope

48
00:01:54,118 --> 00:01:57,780
for

49
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,478
yeah agreed on to the cultivation side

50
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,640
of things what's the difference between

51
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:04,920
just a normal grower and a master grower

52
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,500
how big of a Chasm how many years of

53
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,000
experience and is it an extra layer of

54
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,459
knowledge let's say a biology or

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,639
chemistry can you explain a little bit

56
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:16,680
on that please yeah great question uh

57
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:19,679
well obviously there's there's no one

58
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:23,040
size fits all exactly but the key

59
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,620
differences will be around scale so uh

60
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:28,620
you're bringing a very different

61
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,120
approach to the HVAC and the fertigation

62
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,400
systems you're just doing everything

63
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,480
much bigger so that's pretty obvious and

64
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,060
fine

65
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:38,219
the other part is the regulations you're

66
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,199
working within a highly highly regulated

67
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:42,419
industry so you're thinking about GMP

68
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:44,939
regulations you're thinking about gacp

69
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:47,639
criteria you're thinking about all of

70
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:51,239
the pharmaceutical processes batch

71
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:53,579
Master records uh Secure Storage and a

72
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,620
lot of the other elements that the you

73
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:58,140
know your legacy grows if you like won't

74
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,060
really have to think about at all uh

75
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:01,799
then you're doing some trade-offs really

76
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,439
in the in the process there are some

77
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:08,300
things in the medical world of of

78
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:10,919
growing of Master growing uh that you

79
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,599
where there are a lot of processes that

80
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:14,219
that you can't you don't have really

81
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:16,799
free choice if you're a legacy grower

82
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:18,959
you make choices you find a line through

83
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,159
the various trade-offs uh about the

84
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,860
equipment and the process you're going

85
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:26,039
to use and you will stick to that line

86
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:28,379
I found less freedom I think to choose

87
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:30,598
for example you're really going to be

88
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:32,818
almost bound to use some substrate such

89
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:35,039
as as Rockwell an inert substrate such

90
00:03:32,818 --> 00:03:37,679
as Rockwall you're probably not going to

91
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:40,919
be using living organic soil which in

92
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,299
some ways is a shame uh because you've

93
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:44,399
got to use that cleanliness you want to

94
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:48,060
think about the labor

95
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,099
um cost of of inputs whereas in the

96
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:53,098
Legacy time you're not thinking uh

97
00:03:50,098 --> 00:03:55,199
you're simply aiming only for for what

98
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:56,579
pleases you and of course in that

99
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,339
process you've got a lot of other

100
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,599
hurdles stability testing uh your car

101
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,000
product can't just come out of your

102
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:04,738
facility and go straight to the consumer

103
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,840
uh it needs to go through a

104
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:09,599
pharmaceutical process of checking a

105
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,979
certificate of analysis uh checking on

106
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:12,539
the stability to see how long the shelf

107
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:15,000
life will be and all of those things

108
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:16,978
that are that are constraining I suppose

109
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,680
but and ultimately irrelevant to the

110
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:21,418
growth so a lot of those intellectual

111
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,978
steps and pharmaceutical steps that

112
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:26,039
you'll need to think about with the

113
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:27,659
ultimate aim of course for uniformity of

114
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,060
the product

115
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,160
um and and thinking about how you can

116
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:35,339
please a a medical pharmaceutical

117
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,740
audience rather than you know I suppose

118
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:39,299
your friends and and so on in in your

119
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,939
community

120
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:44,460
okay very interesting we recently spoke

121
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:48,300
to Professor Anna Schwab and she uses

122
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:49,978
aquaponics in 420 Organics what kind of

123
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,259
cultivation methods do you guys employ

124
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:53,519
that uh make the product more unique

125
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:55,379
than let's say some of the other Market

126
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:56,939
competitors yeah we try and keep it as

127
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:58,800
simple as possible we've got tables

128
00:04:56,939 --> 00:05:00,478
we've got drippers we've got Rock Hall

129
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,720
uh

130
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:05,758
now it's really all about light intent

131
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,500
the three major things that I've

132
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,660
actually got to get right I've got to

133
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,939
get the genetics right I've got to get

134
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:14,520
the lights their intensity and Spectrum

135
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:16,918
right uh and I've got to get the HVAC

136
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:18,599
right so that I can control the humidity

137
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:21,299
and temperature to exactly the right

138
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,280
recipe for those particular genetics and

139
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,800
without the ability to control your

140
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:28,198
genetics to lighting and uh and your

141
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,460
HVAC you know that's taking those are

142
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:31,379
those if you get those right they're

143
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:33,478
taking you I'd say 70 of the way to

144
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:35,939
success and the rest of it the CO2

145
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:38,339
injection the fertilizers and everything

146
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:41,160
else are quite small increments in terms

147
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:43,619
of your success criteria

148
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,800
and so then it comes to post-harvest the

149
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:48,060
Mastery and scientific

150
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:52,139
Artistry that's required for that

151
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:53,639
element of the the shall we say is that

152
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:55,860
something that's gained over time

153
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:57,900
through trial and error is is again is

154
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,639
that kind of the last level of the

155
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:02,099
computer game type thing the ones you

156
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,418
master the the post-processing you can

157
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,180
guarantee your product is going to be

158
00:06:03,418 --> 00:06:08,219
replicable yeah I think I spend more

159
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,900
time worrying about my post Harvest than

160
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,940
I do about the action cultivation the

161
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:14,219
Horticultural bit that might sound a bit

162
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:16,439
strange but a bit like for the wine guys

163
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,660
you grow good grapes you can only

164
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:20,160
destroy their quality as you turn them

165
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,900
into wine in the vinification system

166
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,819
it's exactly the same with cannabis

167
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:26,399
cultivation you can grow great flowers

168
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:29,160
and you can only ever lose their value

169
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:31,560
as you go through the post-harvest uh

170
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,300
and it's so simple we're not after the

171
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,478
flower itself we're after the trichome

172
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:38,038
that very fragile glossy little

173
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:40,680
mushroom-shaped thing on the outside of

174
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:43,399
that plant where all the magic is and

175
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:46,918
those are very very very delicate

176
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:48,478
components of the plant so even just

177
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:50,399
shaking the plant a little in the air

178
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,258
means those trichomes will detach

179
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:53,758
particularly the head of those trichomes

180
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:56,220
will detach and will float in the air

181
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,960
and if they if you're smelling them they

182
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:00,300
have moved in the air up your nostril

183
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:01,978
and it means they haven't then gone into

184
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,079
the product or into the medicine at the

185
00:07:01,978 --> 00:07:06,839
end of the day

186
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:08,339
okay very interesting and

187
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:10,560
what are the kind of some of the biggest

188
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:13,198
challenges that you face as a master

189
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,639
grower in the UK is there are massive

190
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,500
hurdles compared to let's say what's

191
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,120
happening in Greece

192
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,098
um how would you compare the two areas

193
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,439
for the ability to cultivate yeah

194
00:07:20,098 --> 00:07:24,959
interesting they're both emerging areas

195
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:27,000
in the UK you've got maybe a dozen uh

196
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:28,318
cultivation licenses probably only four

197
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,300
or five of which are going to go beyond

198
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,039
the research and development phase and

199
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,759
get into

200
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:35,759
um

201
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:37,319
uh you know into the market now

202
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,479
grief the wonderful thing about Greece

203
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:41,340
is you you've got open export routes to

204
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:43,680
the whole of Europe the real problem I

205
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:46,500
think with the UK cultivators and you've

206
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,800
got a higher cost of of of

207
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:52,439
um production naturally uh B you don't

208
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,319
have any sunlight but really crucially

209
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:56,459
you can't export so that means the

210
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:59,039
success of your business and your

211
00:07:56,459 --> 00:08:01,978
cultivation regime is entirely based on

212
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:05,579
the growth of medical patient demand in

213
00:08:01,978 --> 00:08:08,339
the UK and I think as any most observers

214
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:11,219
would would say that hasn't been as

215
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:13,560
Rapid or as or as solid there's a lot of

216
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:15,539
churn in the market for the patients uh

217
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,240
as we'd all hoped in the last four and a

218
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:19,860
half years that we've been involved

219
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,720
and when it comes to what's happened

220
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:24,259
around Europe It looks interesting now

221
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,819
that it could end up potentially be the

222
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:28,860
grown home laws get approved in most

223
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:30,120
countries for two or three plans do you

224
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,620
see that side of the industry like on

225
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,360
Research I've done already if you do

226
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,700
like the top 10 cannabis Industries in

227
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,800
America like Scott's Miracle Grow must

228
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,959
be two and a half billion bigger than

229
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:41,939
every other cannabis company there is

230
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:43,739
there European equivalent over here or

231
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,839
have they got patents and IPS and

232
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:47,399
processes in place where it's just got

233
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,680
to be doing the exact same as they've

234
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:52,379
done in America over in Europe

235
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:54,179
yeah all the indoor grows you it doesn't

236
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:56,700
really matter where you are in the world

237
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:58,979
you're thinking seriously about your

238
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,360
electricity cost and your labor cost and

239
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,039
those are your major determinants of

240
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,139
success you've got a transportable

241
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:06,599
recipe that you can implant in any

242
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:10,080
insulated space with an electricity and

243
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:12,360
water supply broadly uh more complicated

244
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,519
when you get to Glass House growing

245
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,159
where you've got to be very clear about

246
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:18,899
keeping control over the the the

247
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:21,559
temperature and humidity and I think

248
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:24,299
this is where some non-cannabis Growers

249
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:26,939
tomatoes peppers they'll be very good at

250
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:28,679
producing a very uniform crop at a very

251
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:31,680
large scale

252
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:35,039
um and I think sometimes

253
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:37,559
they they trip over the previous

254
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:39,838
experience in the they don't think

255
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:41,338
clearly enough about the post-harvest

256
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,800
bit that we've just talked about a

257
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:45,300
tomato gets harvested broadly it sits at

258
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:47,039
a certain temperature and humidity in a

259
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:51,059
storage area and it doesn't particularly

260
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:53,879
degrade in its quality uh so you'll see

261
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:57,479
a lot of the American Growers often have

262
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:59,639
an experienced Legacy grower working

263
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,339
alongside a tomato or pepper

264
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:04,259
horticulturalist and that's great but

265
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:06,000
the little question I wonder about is

266
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:08,159
the political one about who actually

267
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,778
really calls the shots out of those two

268
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:11,120
when it comes down to a difference of

269
00:10:09,778 --> 00:10:15,240
opinion

270
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:17,639
yeah very interesting do you see uh the

271
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,959
Czech government doing let's say gone a

272
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:20,039
step further than what Germany have

273
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,659
announced do you think that's going to

274
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:23,338
be on par pretty much similar of what

275
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:26,100
they've done we saw that at the

276
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:29,160
Uruguayan similar model to Uruguay with

277
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:31,139
five grams per day do you have details

278
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:32,519
on that yeah I think that's the check is

279
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:36,299
going to be really an interesting Market

280
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:37,919
but then there's a a a a mass involved

281
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:40,639
here too you've got 10 million people in

282
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:43,500
check you've got 85 million in Germany

283
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:45,838
uh and and so you you know you would

284
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:49,078
expect that the Germans will have will

285
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:51,420
have to produce in in another way too uh

286
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:53,939
what do we really want we want

287
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:57,179
um access for all the people who want it

288
00:10:53,940 --> 00:11:00,120
medical or not really uh at the end of

289
00:10:57,179 --> 00:11:02,699
the day and look at the UK we're a good

290
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,899
probably five or ten years behind some

291
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,100
of those other countries you just

292
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:08,100
mentioned in Europe

293
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,480
a country of 68 million people with I

294
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,180
would say there's no data but I would

295
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,159
say at least 2 million regular consumers

296
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:16,620
of cannabis in the UK now that's an

297
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:18,059
attractive Market to anybody but all of

298
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,220
the larger companies and I talked to

299
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:22,259
many of them regularly from Australia

300
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,720
from Canada and so on they're all

301
00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:26,399
looking at the UK

302
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:29,519
waiting for those trigger points to

303
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:31,559
enter that market and is it when GPS get

304
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,299
to prescribe or is it when patient

305
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:35,518
numbers reach a hundred thousand in the

306
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:37,799
UK whatever it is there are large

307
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,139
companies waiting to count from the UK

308
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:42,479
and I think at the moment really we're

309
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:43,799
very much in the foothills

310
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,560
um and I think we've had four and a half

311
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:48,419
years of experimentation and I think it

312
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:51,838
was a really long way for us to go in in

313
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:54,059
the UK in terms of matching the

314
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,459
regulatory framework with the huge

315
00:11:54,059 --> 00:11:59,039
opportunity to build a new business here

316
00:11:56,458 --> 00:12:03,000
I mean the common everyone knows the

317
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:04,980
common sense reasons for liberalizing or

318
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,379
destigmatizing or decriminalizing or

319
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:09,899
whatever you want to say cannabis it's

320
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:12,139
just so obvious raise some taxes

321
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:15,958
grow an industry

322
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:19,139
use skills of the people stop wasting

323
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:21,059
police time stop the stabbings all of

324
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:23,578
these social and environmental benefits

325
00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:26,759
can be picked up by a sensible

326
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:28,379
Progressive liberalization model and I'm

327
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:31,500
really excited to say that the UK

328
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:35,458
government hasn't got on that at all

329
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:37,679
yeah it's from outside looking in it you

330
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:40,559
try and wonder who's worse for cannabis

331
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:42,179
curious armor or Rishi sunak the boats

332
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:44,099
seem to be charging against each other

333
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:45,778
to to have nothing but negative things

334
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,540
to say about the industry we've got a

335
00:12:45,778 --> 00:12:50,519
Citizens assembly on drugs legalization

336
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:53,159
in Ireland happening at the moment with

337
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:55,440
all the expert politicians and a number

338
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:57,059
of advisors and one of the things that

339
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,339
the guards brought up is the difficulty

340
00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:01,500
that would end up happening with the UK

341
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:04,079
if we went off and decriminalized a

342
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,700
number of different drugs so yeah it

343
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:07,019
seems we're going to be bound by each

344
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,420
other by the decisions what our other

345
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:11,100
makes yeah

346
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:13,439
fundamentally to the heart of society

347
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,300
I'm sitting here half a mile away from

348
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,760
Westminster apparently the seat of all

349
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:19,559
political thought or something look

350
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:21,600
we're way behind

351
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:23,879
um Kia stama has his own reasons for

352
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,860
being clean and getting himself and his

353
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:29,939
and his labor party

354
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:31,980
um elected without any contentious parts

355
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:35,040
of their Manifesto

356
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:38,759
um the conservative party perhaps has a

357
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:41,159
more libertar libertarian side to it but

358
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:43,500
neither party I think is is taking this

359
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:46,199
issue seriously and there's it's not

360
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:48,120
just the threat it's not just the the

361
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,820
stigmatization

362
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,100
um it's the opportunity that that it's

363
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:55,200
heartbreaking to see governments going

364
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,360
year after year without really grasping

365
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,940
this and if we're not careful the states

366
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,579
will liberalize federally at some point

367
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:05,700
and we won't have built an industry on

368
00:14:02,578 --> 00:14:08,039
in this country that can compete with

369
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:10,740
what is to come from North America in in

370
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:13,019
that case so time is against us and the

371
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,339
opportunity is here and it seems a great

372
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,959
shame that neither of the political

373
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:17,820
parties in the UK is really thinking

374
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:19,939
about it sensitively they've set up a

375
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:22,440
framework and good on them fair enough

376
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:24,360
for if you like by exception

377
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:27,480
liberalization if you're exceptionally

378
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:30,600
ill sadly or you can have an exceptional

379
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:33,420
part of the plant CBD and quite right

380
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,519
four and a half years ago in the UK they

381
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:37,559
could no longer hold back the floodgates

382
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,899
of public demand for

383
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:41,939
cannabis based oils for childhood

384
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:44,159
epilepsy for example or the incredible

385
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:47,160
benefits of being able to manage not

386
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:49,139
cure but manage long-term illness like

387
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:51,419
multiple sclerosis or something and

388
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:53,698
perhaps end of life care too and great

389
00:14:51,419 --> 00:14:55,979
it was not possible for politicians to

390
00:14:53,698 --> 00:14:58,139
hold back that time but they didn't go

391
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,940
nearly far enough and there's a big

392
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:01,620
difference between there's no difference

393
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,480
in the plant medical cannabis is the

394
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:05,820
same as any or cannabis right but

395
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:08,278
there's a difference in the approach and

396
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:11,160
the market and and the ability to build

397
00:15:08,278 --> 00:15:13,379
the infrastructure to serve um and to

398
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:14,819
take money away from people

399
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:16,439
um on the criminal side of things who

400
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,120
are not always thinking about the best

401
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,040
social and environmental benefits of

402
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,620
their production systems

403
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:24,299
