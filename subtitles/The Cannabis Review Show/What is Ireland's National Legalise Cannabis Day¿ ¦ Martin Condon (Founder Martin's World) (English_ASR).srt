campaign you created recently um can you

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,719
give everybody a little overview of what

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,640
was the international legalized cannabis

18
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,480
day and the campaign that you brought

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,840
about because it was pretty impressive

20
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:42,878
the response that you seem to have got

21
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,120
from it

22
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:47,359
yeah i suppose uh all credit has to go

23
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:50,238
really to luke ming flanagan who is the

24
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:51,840
real creator of the national legalized

25
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:54,399
cannabis day campaign

26
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,920
he founded it back in 2001 um in

27
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:00,399
november 2001 november 5th 2001 when he

28
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,480
went about and rolled up he said to me

29
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,159
in a recent interview over 400 cannabis

30
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:06,959
joints and sent them to all of the

31
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,439
politicians senators local councillors

32
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:10,478
and media also across the island of

33
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:12,639
ireland

34
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:14,319
and that got a great load of attention

35
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,159
for the campaign at the time he also

36
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:18,719
delivered the cannabis plant to the then

37
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,439
national drugs minister uh in charge of

38
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,879
the drug strategy and he got arrested in

39
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:24,319
the process of doing that he never

40
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:26,560
actually got to deliver the plan to the

41
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:28,879
minister as intended but he got arrested

42
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,840
and following that campaign uh luke

43
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:35,359
mcflanagan told him he got over 65 radio

44
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,799
interviews um so for for me i was i was

45
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:38,000
this was pointed out to me that this day

46
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,320
it was coming up and i was just like

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,399
well this is the 20th anniversary of

48
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,239
that date and so i was like that's a

49
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,359
significant milestone and it's a it's an

50
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:48,640
event that was well worth recreating um

51
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:50,879
so myself

52
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,759
in a joint effort with other campaigners

53
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,679
here relief cannabis cafe r420 uh

54
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,560
supplies and the cannabis activist

55
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,280
alliance and we set about rolling up

56
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,000
over 200 cannabis joints and we printed

57
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,079
out a nice letter which uh highlighted

58
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,239
the aim of the campaign and at the back

59
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:10,318
of the letter also included was 10

60
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,719
reasons why cannabis prohibition should

61
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:15,039
be ended we also included within the

62
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,959
letter then a disclaimer and because

63
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:19,039
within with the letter included in the

64
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,878
envelope was a cannabis joint and a

65
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:22,639
jelly and because we had a lot of

66
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:25,439
hysteria here in the media recently

67
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:27,759
about cannabis edibles so we chose to to

68
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,919
include a jelly just for that

69
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:32,560
side of it but the jellies were mostly

70
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:34,878
haribo from the kids halloween bags and

71
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,640
there was a few cbd gummies put in there

72
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:39,840
as well but uh not too many doses

73
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:41,679
they're a bit pricey um but we sent

74
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,360
those then off to all of the media

75
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,519
across the island of our are the

76
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,280
politicians across the island of ireland

77
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,680
and the campaign was incredibly

78
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,759
successful within a couple of days as

79
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,439
the letters started arriving because we

80
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:55,439
sent them in a kind of um

81
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,719
in a spread out fashion we didn't post

82
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:01,359
all the letters at once from the one in

83
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:03,120
a post box because uh to be honest like

84
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,640
when you had a bundle of 20 of them you

85
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,680
could actually smell the cannabis coming

86
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:07,839
out of the envelopes because they

87
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,000
weren't sealed up in in any way

88
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,680
um so we kind of staggered that that was

89
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,759
what he was looking for we staggered the

90
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,080
post of that going out and then like

91
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:18,318
come the middle of uh the week following

92
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,080
the fifth of november and we achieved

93
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:21,839
what we wanted to which we got the

94
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,840
nation talking about

95
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,840
that the need for change around cannabis

96
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,158
prohibition uh so it was it was very

97
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,560
successful we also then got

98
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:32,560
out another campaigner green tea who

99
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,199
spoke on national radio uh on the

100
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,400
national airwaves as well about uh

101
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,318
what she's doing they're growing

102
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,120
cannabis for her partner who's got late

103
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:43,199
stages of multiple sclerosis so that the

104
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,878
campaign achieved much more than what

105
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,878
it's set out to do we just wanted to get

106
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:48,959
the nation talking but we actually got

107
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:50,479
got a few more campaigners out to the

108
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,799
forefront now and they're standing up

109
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:55,280
and speaking against this uh inhumane

110
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,599
prohibition of cannabis

111
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,959
yeah no that's a it's a very impressive

112
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:00,798
campaign and you haven't had any

113
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,400
kickback yet nobody's come back and said

114
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,159
it to yourself

115
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,360
no kickback it seems like the guys above

116
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:06,798
in the dial are getting more kicked back

117
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,040
to me because apparently they've got

118
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,719
like a 30 million euro security system

119
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,400
in place and and it wasn't effective

120
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:13,438
enough to prevent a couple of uh hand

121
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,079
rolled

122
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:18,079
or even to politicians again they did go

123
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,639
back to the old scare tactics oh my god

124
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,639
what if it was antrax it's like come

125
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,680
here don't don't compare our campaign to

126
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,600
to a move of a terrorist organization uh

127
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,120
cannabis giants and anthrax like they

128
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,439
should not be mentioned in the same

129
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,240
headline at all unless their objective

130
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:35,839
was to try to um

131
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,280
muddy the waters around who we are and

132
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:39,839
what we're doing you know attaching us

133
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:42,159
to a terrorist kind of uh fly no no

134
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:43,439
thanks that was a very poor journalism

135
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,280
that one was

136
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:46,639
yeah i think i seem to think that in

137
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:48,239
ireland at the moment here because the

138
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,759
politicians seem to be broken up into

139
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,439
maybe three or four different groups

140
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,040
you've got to got the the young

141
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:54,478
knowledgeable ones who know all about

142
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,840
cannabis now that there's nothing wrong

143
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:57,758
with it now that's a billion dollar

144
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:59,359
industry and don't want to be the ones

145
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,759
to put their their neck on the chopping

146
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,840
board but will back in industry once

147
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,600
it's it's got the right players involved

148
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:08,799
in it then i think on the contrast

149
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,400
you've got the old people the the civil

150
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,400
servants who might block this in the in

151
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:14,638
the department of health and whatnot

152
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:17,038
that uh are just it's like heroin to

153
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,600
them and it's completely uh

154
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:21,519
uneducated ill-informed opinion on

155
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,800
something so you've got the two of those

156
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:24,799
worlds that are happening i think it's

157
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,639
what's happening in between is the most

158
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,160
interesting one because they might have

159
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,840
come from that world but they're open to

160
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,280
learning and they just don't know enough

161
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,439
yet and it's kind of up to people like

162
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:35,679
us to be doing good content and doing

163
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:38,240
campaigns like you're doing to highlight

164
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,720
how nonsensical the current campaign is

165
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,960
and that they the war on drugs has been

166
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,919
lost long ago that this now needs to be

167
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,000
looked at

168
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:47,680
like every other uh country i think is

169
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,680
starting to pivot into it and it

170
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,280
actually brings me into the next topic i

171
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,600
wanted to bring up to you is germany

172
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:56,559
legalizing what are your thoughts on

173
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,879
this so far and the three uh coalition

174
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,800
parties that uh have come together now

175
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,478
to create a recreational cannabis

176
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,879
industry with first products being sold

177
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:07,120
within 12 months from now i think yeah

178
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:08,879
well i think that the most uh

179
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,199
attractive thing to me about germany's

180
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:12,800
move is their their approach

181
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,439
it's not to make money it's not that the

182
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,079
line of coffers at all it's actually to

183
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:20,399
remove the criminal body that currently

184
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:22,560
exists within the cannabis industry

185
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:24,959
with cannabis prohibited it's in control

186
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,399
of the organized crime gangs so the

187
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:28,799
german government have kind of

188
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:30,799
identified this as being a big problem

189
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,038
um in order to achieve achieve harm

190
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,560
reduction so for for them they've seen

191
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:36,879
the most effective way of achieving harm

192
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,680
reduction around cannabis is to regulate

193
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:41,759
it to control it um in a true sense of

194
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,280
the word control because we talk about

195
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,879
cannabis and all these other drugs is

196
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:46,638
controlled drugs but they're they're

197
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:48,719
anything but under a model of

198
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,319
prohibition so i think that's the most

199
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,400
attractive thing about the conversation

200
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,759
there within germany currently it's like

201
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:56,879
well the money is great you know they're

202
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,639
talking about five billion euro um a

203
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,478
multi-billion euro saving for the

204
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,720
justice department and having to enforce

205
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:04,318
this you know and having to occupy their

206
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,160
prison cells and all of this stuff

207
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,759
that's all great but what i think is

208
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,759
that the best part of the conversation

209
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,319
is that the control of cannabis that the

210
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,479
harm reduction around cannabis and the

211
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,879
removal of the organized crime gangs

212
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:19,199
from the cannabis industry and i think

213
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:21,038
it's great i hope that germany are very

214
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,960
successful over the next four years as

215
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:24,318
it is a four-year trial and at the end

216
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:26,638
of the four years they'll come back and

217
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,879
they'll review it so it's open to change

218
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,439
and but i hope the findings are as to be

219
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:33,279
expected which is that yes ending

220
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:34,719
prohibition regulating cannabis will

221
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:36,719
achieve what they're setting out to do

222
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,319
which is eliminate the organized crime

223
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,919
gangs we don't need these organized

224
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,360
crime gangs in our society there's

225
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:43,758
enough bad players out there without

226
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,598
creating a fictitious system for them to

227
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,840
exist within which is prohibition of

228
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:49,120
cannabis so yeah it's a great thing i

229
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:50,878
think that's going to send shockwaves

230
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,639
then across the rest of europe because

231
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,120
as we're having conversations here then

232
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,639
in ireland and those dinosaurs that you

233
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,560
mentioned within the ranks of our

234
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,960
government um it'll be much harder for

235
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,478
them to discredit the conversation

236
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,318
around this now because like for them to

237
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:05,918
say oh that's a foolish idea they can't

238
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,840
say it anymore because it's like well

239
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:09,279
you send a german government currently

240
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:11,598
as a foolish people that they're making

241
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:13,519
a mistake and because i don't think any

242
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:16,000
of our ministers would want to get on

243
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:18,560
the bad side of germany because they're

244
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,079
a big player ever in europe and so i do

245
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,240
think that this is a great opportunity

246
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:24,478
for us as campaigners here right now

247
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,240
because um the the

248
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:28,478
conversation it's going to be a lot

249
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,720
harder for the prohibition side to keep

250
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:32,158
up their arguments because uh it's it's

251
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,879
like a house of cards start their

252
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:36,559
arguments they're they're falling and uh

253
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:38,559
they're down to the bottom turnout at

254
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,559
the moment like if we're already they

255
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,079
just clean house with them and because

256
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,000
you know next year as we move into the

257
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,920
next chair in our in ireland and we've

258
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,399
got geno kenny's bill we've got the uh

259
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:50,639
citizens assembly coming up and so many

260
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,958
avenues for conversation for change to

261
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:54,639
happen um and the german stuff is just

262
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,719
going to really enrich that conversation

263
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:58,639
now for us and the kind of the

264
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,720
anti-prohibition side

265
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:02,240
yeah i think we're uh they're sandwiched

266
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,320
in there we've got legalization in new

267
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,759
york we've got legalization in germany i

268
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,760
think it's just going to be a slow march

269
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:10,399
in towards us and if they've got any

270
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:14,559
sense it's about replacing the criminals

271
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:17,360
with their uh refined legal industry and

272
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:19,439
uh having a bit of common sense

273
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,879
as they look at this the last topic i

274
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,480
wanted to talk to you just before you

275
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:24,320
move on to the last one it's just worth

276
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,920
to be saying as well that like germany

277
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,040
are not alone within europe that we've

278
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:30,719
luxembourg there's malta we've portugal

279
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:32,958
there's many countries now we're in the

280
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,040
european union looking at changing their

281
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:36,239
laws around cannabis and a lot of them

282
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:38,240
are restricted because of the

283
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,799
international narcotics control board

284
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,799
which is why germany are choosing to to

285
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:44,719
use the phrasing it's a research uh

286
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:46,319
period a four-year research period

287
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,759
because the international narcotics

288
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,160
control board would kind of control the

289
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:51,679
laws around narcotics within europe um

290
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:53,679
they wouldn't allow a country to

291
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:55,439
actually legalize uh cannabis because

292
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:57,359
that's the problem brought up by gino

293
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,519
kenny there recently as that would be in

294
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,480
violation european law but a research

295
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,240
project uh that's within it um but yes

296
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,839
germany aren't alone we've uh big waves

297
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,399
being made over here in europe next year

298
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,519
from from many countries so yeah sorry i

299
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,278
just wanted to get that in before you

300
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,039
went down to the last topic

301
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:14,958
not at all you're you're completely

302
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:17,039
right so um

303
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:20,319
the next topic that i did want to jump

304
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:22,078
in on was the first mcat patient there

305
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,399
was a lot of headlines recently there a

306
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:26,559
lot of pizzazz and jazz about behind all

307
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,159
this how much of a a

308
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,799
step forward do you think this is or is

309
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:33,360
it more pressing headlines and publicity

310
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:35,759
i i think it's it's a great step forward

311
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,200
in one sense because no patience some

312
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:39,039
you know again we could talk about the

313
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,399
mediterranean access program and it's

314
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:43,120
like get the most

315
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,879
it's a regime that north korea would our

316
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,399
program north korea would be proud of

317
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:48,078
because of how restrictive and

318
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,240
controlling it is and because

319
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:51,439
effectively you know no patients are

320
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,879
able to get access through you know

321
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,040
you've alicia marrow they're suffering

322
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:57,278
with chronic chronic pain living on

323
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:58,879
alicante and gets access to cannabis and

324
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:00,799
it does her tremendous benefit so she

325
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:02,958
won't get access under the medical

326
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:05,439
cannabis access program but for the

327
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:07,599
patients who do this is great this is a

328
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,600
tremendous step forward for them and

329
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,680
they're just tree conditions listed the

330
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,200
nausea associated with cancer the

331
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:15,278
multiple sclerosis but only the

332
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,959
spasticity associated with multiple

333
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:19,278
sclerosis and then there's the

334
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:21,599
refractory type epilepsy now all of

335
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:23,360
those patients have to have undergone

336
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,680
standard conventional treatments and

337
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,919
that treatment has to be unsuccessful

338
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:30,399
for them to be considered accessible to

339
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:32,639
this program so again that this while

340
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,200
having one patient on it it's great it's

341
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,958
a real step forward and but still

342
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,399
there's a long way to go for for the

343
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:41,039
patients who could benefit from this

344
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,958
plan and they recently added and i think

345
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:44,240
this is most the most noteworthy thing

346
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:45,679
actually outside of the the first

347
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,839
patient getting access is they've

348
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:49,359
actually added two cannabis flower

349
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,600
products now to the medical cannabis

350
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,720
access program one of them is a 22

351
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,399
percent thc variety of cannabis from

352
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,560
bedrock bedrocan the other one is i

353
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:01,278
believe a thirteen and a half percent uh

354
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:03,199
thc variety from bedrocan um and i

355
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:05,120
believe they've got a content of cbd in

356
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,959
there in the region of about one percent

357
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,799
as well in both flowers and but what

358
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:11,439
this does again for us as campaigners

359
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:13,599
here in ireland is it's it's more fuel

360
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,880
it's more ammunition for us to use to

361
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,720
counter the arguments of the

362
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,240
prohibitionists how can they tell us

363
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,920
that you know that the cannabis plant

364
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,320
that's being grown by a person who wants

365
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:24,319
to mitigate maybe the onset of their

366
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,040
glaucoma or something like that or maybe

367
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,959
to reduce the effects of their arthritis

368
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:30,480
um how can we tell them that they're a

369
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:33,119
criminal and what they're using is not

370
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,879
medicinal when we now have cannabis

371
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,799
flowers included on it you know is is

372
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:39,439
this cannabis flourish in some way

373
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:41,759
superior it's like if it is please prove

374
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,160
it like because i i can't see how they

375
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:46,319
can justify having one regarded as a

376
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:48,000
medicinal product and and meanwhile like

377
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,278
the other is like no no you're a

378
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,879
criminal and that's a dangerous drug

379
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:52,399
that you're dealing with there

380
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:54,159
it's um

381
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,000
the only one i would say with that is

382
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:58,159
what i seem to think what they've done

383
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,159
is that somebody like denmark has got

384
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:01,838
this ornamental flower

385
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:04,240
pharmaceutical industry so they know how

386
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,320
to grow a rose a million times over the

387
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,159
exact same way and i think this is what

388
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,079
bedrock can't have done is that they've

389
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,240
kind of given a specific

390
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:14,559
method let's say that they can guarantee

391
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:18,000
that every single butterfly is going to

392
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:19,359
be this exact percentage of thc so yeah

393
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,720
i think that's where they're they're

394
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,039
getting around the loophole but that's

395
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,240
not to say that homegrown laws shouldn't

396
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:28,480
be in essence and part of any law or any

397
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,759
industry that comes into ireland

398
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,440
it's a must i think for the whole

399
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:32,958
industry to be able to agree on that

400
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,040
yeah i think they're using maybe a

401
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:37,039
tissue culture method which might be

402
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:38,719
outside of the realms of possibilities

403
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:40,480
for the conventional gardener out there

404
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,800
but still cloning like cloning a

405
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,159
cannabis plant it's uh it's well within

406
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:46,000
the realms of possibilities for for a

407
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:48,000
conventional getter to do that and it is

408
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,839
quite consistent and again if you were

409
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,320
to end prohibition and if you had access

410
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,320
locally to a service that would test

411
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,720
your cannabis then you could see if your

412
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,959
if your growing program your gardening

413
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,278
program a home is consistent in putting

414
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:03,359
out um the variety of cannabis that you

415
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:05,519
need for for whatever conditioners that

416
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,519
you want um and even if it's not again

417
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,919
you know if you as a as a conventional

418
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,120
gardener you might be somewhat uh

419
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,278
um

420
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,278
trained to blend these different

421
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:17,759
extracts and you could again blend them

422
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:19,919
to make your own uh um

423
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:22,559
confine our consistent ratio of

424
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:24,000
cannabinoids there again and so again

425
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:25,518
the prohibition of cannabis is what

426
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,198
makes it impossible for people to do

427
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,720
this currently once we remove

428
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:30,559
prohibition the cannabis will make it a

429
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,199
lot easier i was looking at the medical

430
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:35,919
cannabis access program like and a 50

431
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:37,838
milliliter bottle of um one of these

432
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:40,240
extracts that that's currently under the

433
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,320
can he pulled that that recent i wanted

434
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,079
yeah yeah so going with the 50 ml bottle

435
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,278
which is the most kind of cost saving

436
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:47,759
one because if you go for the lower

437
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:51,439
bottle it's even more expensive but it

438
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:53,679
works out at um it's 450 odd euro for

439
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,839
the whole bottle but with the amount of

440
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:58,559
cannabinoids that are in there it works

441
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:01,360
out at being about 90 euro per gram of

442
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:03,679
cannabinoid so it's like 100 milligrams

443
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,560
of thc for per milliliter and there's

444
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:08,000
five milligrams of cbd per milliliter

445
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:09,359
and when you work it out you know break

446
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,879
to cast down like when you're looking at

447
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,720
just the active ingredients if that's

448
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:14,799
what you're after and going from the

449
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,360
cost of that per gram it's more

450
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:20,159
expensive than gold gold currently is 50

451
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,560
euro per gram and currently our our

452
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,958
government are buying in cannabinoids

453
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:27,439
that are more expensive than than gold

454
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:28,958
know per weight and which is absolutely

455
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,320
crazy when you could grow this stuff out

456
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,599
your backyard and imagine you could grow

457
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,879
something at your backyard and it's more

458
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,480
expensive than gold currently like

459
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:38,159
just fellas turning over mountains at

460
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,159
the moment to get access to gold like a

461
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:41,519
ruining the environment and meanwhile

462
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:43,198
you could pop a few seeds and you've got

463
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,120
something that's just as valuable

464
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:46,719
and more beneficial than gold because

465
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,159
really what beneficial is gold outside

466
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,920
of maybe the computer stuff you do with

467
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:52,159
it but

468
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:53,679
yeah now a great agreed grid i think

469
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:56,319
we've got a lot to look forward to now

470
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:57,838
in 2022 and uh hopefully there's major

471
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,600
steps ahead with gino's bill and a lot

472
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,800
of other things coming what's the number

473
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,800
one thing you're looking forward to next

474
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:04,240
year before we jump off

475
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:06,000
yeah the there's the feederboards

476
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,680
campaign here in ireland we're going to

477
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,278
launch a feed a bird's campaign again

478
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:11,359
where we're going to do some fun events

479
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:13,679
on the run up to it throughout january

480
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,519
our february march and just before we

481
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:17,439
get into that growing period you know

482
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,120
april may and june and stuff and we're

483
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,279
hoping to give away a lot of free seeds

484
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,720
to people to promote the event but the

485
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:23,838
feeder birds campaign if people don't

486
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,480
know about it we're just encouraging

487
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,560
people to use hemp seeds to feed birds

488
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,120
and then hopefully you know these hemp

489
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:32,879
seeds might uh sprout up a few cannabis

490
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,560
plants around the place which might

491
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:36,399
gather the attention again from the the

492
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,159
media and

493
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,360
get the conversation happening again so

494
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:41,360
