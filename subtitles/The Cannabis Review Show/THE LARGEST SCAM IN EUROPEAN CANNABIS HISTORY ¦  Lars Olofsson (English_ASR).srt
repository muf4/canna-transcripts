information to the audience in Europe

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,539
and uh smoke and mirrors that are

00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,859
sources moved can you maybe give

22
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:51,419
everybody just a quick overview what is

23
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:52,738
Juicy fields for the people who have no

24
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,698
idea about it yet

25
00:00:52,738 --> 00:01:01,679
yeah you should feel started in the

26
00:00:56,698 --> 00:01:04,319
spring of 2020 and basically it's an

27
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:08,938
e-commerce platform where you could

28
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:12,359
invest in cannabis plants and they were

29
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:16,139
calling it e-growers and what they have

30
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:20,819
done is to pitch from different kind of

31
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:23,819
business Concepts uh like a crowdfunding

32
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:26,819
concept and an investment concept and so

33
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:29,879
on and what they did was to pick to to

34
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:33,658
put together a concept where you're

35
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:36,359
investing in cannabis plants

36
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:38,520
okay very interesting and who are the

37
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:40,078
main players who set up juicy Fields

38
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:43,379
what territory are they based in in the

39
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:45,239
world yeah uh that's kind of interesting

40
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:48,539
because if you are looking at the

41
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:51,000
website they have had uh they said that

42
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:54,540
they had operations more or less all

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,319
over the world in South America in the

44
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:02,399
Central America in Europe and there are

45
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:06,298
some uh farmers in there in Asia as well

46
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:10,139
so so that this was from day one a

47
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:11,060
global operation uh and then a global

48
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:16,079
Enterprise

49
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:21,239
and uh and uh and uh they they they

50
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:25,319
presented a new way of investing uh in

51
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:27,959
the Cannabis industry and uh and uh and

52
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:29,939
that was the the new disruptive concept

53
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:32,219
so to say

54
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:34,859
okay so the business model was basically

55
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:36,598
getting people to invest in cannabis

56
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,280
Growers around the world and like a

57
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:40,318
co-op that I'll be able to spread their

58
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,659
money together so

59
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:44,458
can you tell me how long did this

60
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:47,098
Enterprise last

61
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:49,560
yeah well it it's

62
00:02:47,098 --> 00:02:53,878
um it's important to know that there

63
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:56,640
have been a pre-planning uh process uh

64
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:58,560
at least that what I have identified is

65
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,899
that they have been working on this

66
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,739
concept for at least two years before

67
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:09,140
they started operation in in April 2020

68
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:11,420
and then the operation uh went on until

69
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:17,279
mid-july this year

70
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:19,378
2022. so more or less uh uh two years uh

71
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,259
two years and a couple of months that

72
00:03:19,378 --> 00:03:25,560
was uh during the operation and when

73
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:28,919
they took in all their investors

74
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,658
and so but that the company there that

75
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:33,619
there are different companies but the

76
00:03:30,658 --> 00:03:37,259
parent company actually started back in

77
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:39,719
2017 as a kind of research and

78
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:42,419
development company so that had been

79
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:45,299
quite a lot of planning before they

80
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:49,199
started operation and also a lot of

81
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:52,080
Investments because that is a very

82
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:54,479
important in this uh in this case uh

83
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,599
because I'm not just a lawyer I'm also

84
00:03:54,479 --> 00:04:00,298
an investor in the Cannabis industry and

85
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:02,039
I invest in startup companies so you

86
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:04,739
could look at

87
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:07,079
um use your Fields like a startup

88
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:10,920
company with all the different kind of

89
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:14,480
elements a startup company have to have

90
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:18,120
a a business concept A business plan

91
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:20,579
financing for starting up operation and

92
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,100
all these elements

93
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:26,040
okay very interesting where was the the

94
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,840
let's say the parent company set up what

95
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,379
location and territory was that company

96
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:35,000
set up in yeah and the parent company UC

97
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:40,079
grow is a German company usually grow Ag

98
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,079
and then they started subsidiaries

99
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:47,120
and in Switzerland and various say uh

100
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:53,280
potentially uh

101
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:56,639
it's a bit it's a bit uh Shady if if

102
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:59,459
there is a company in in Cyprus but the

103
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,079
the parent company is in Germany that's

104
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:04,258
for sure

105
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:07,800
okay and how long have every people been

106
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:09,540
aware of the juicy field scam and when

107
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,340
did people uh kind of highlight that

108
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:14,580
look there's just something that you're

109
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:16,379
not going correctly here yeah uh well uh

110
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:18,839
that were definitely something happened

111
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:22,019
in the middle of July because all of a

112
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:25,500
sudden one day uh the website was closed

113
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:29,939
down everything was shut down uh

114
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:33,418
um emails was disconnected in Mobile

115
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:36,060
telephones was just disconnected so more

116
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:39,180
or less overnight everything was closed

117
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:42,060
down and that's when people started to

118
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:45,478
think about well what is this is this

119
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:48,660
just a technical problem uh is it's just

120
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:51,659
something temporary or have all the

121
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:55,139
people uh just left the company so that

122
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:58,259
was the the first starting point of the

123
00:05:55,139 --> 00:06:00,418
process is this something that is still

124
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:04,379
going on but there is some kind of

125
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:07,319
technical problems or is it the scam and

126
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:10,560
and this is interesting because I've

127
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:13,259
been investigating investment scam for

128
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,199
the last 15 years and I've been involved

129
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:20,538
in the investigation and helping victims

130
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:24,478
for more than 30 of these International

131
00:06:20,538 --> 00:06:28,199
Investment scams and I I and I could see

132
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:30,719
a pattern a kind of Playbook that all

133
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:33,300
these scammers are using and one of the

134
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,479
things they are doing and this is smart

135
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:40,860
because if you shut down everything from

136
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:44,279
from uh and disconnect everything people

137
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:47,180
realize that yes this has been a scam

138
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:51,719
but if you are leaving someone behind

139
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:55,319
and posting things uh like this in this

140
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:57,479
situation posting things on the website

141
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:00,240
that yeah this is just a temporary

142
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:02,939
problem we have had some internal

143
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,939
conflicts between the founders of our

144
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:09,240
company we are going to soon start up

145
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:12,060
again and you are going to be able to

146
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:15,600
refund your Investments and all these

147
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:18,839
kind of information then people are

148
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:21,780
living under hope that yes I'm not being

149
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:25,138
scammed and that is the psychology of

150
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:26,719
these scammers and they know this for

151
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:29,519
sure

152
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,160
okay very interesting and is there

153
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:34,258
annual returns for the companies or the

154
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,139

155

I could tell you that I have identified

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:53,400
something about 125

162
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:55,800
000 investors for more or less all

163
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:59,098
countries all over the world so this was

164
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:01,259
just not just them and a European

165
00:07:59,098 --> 00:08:03,538
operation this was a global operation

166
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:06,240
about 125

167
00:08:03,538 --> 00:08:11,818
000 and that business was done between

168
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:16,038
the investors and a the Dutch company UC

169
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:20,460
Fields be they and Yusuf is BV

170
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:23,399
they had that account in Cyprus and so

171
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:26,459
that's where all the money uh was sent

172
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:29,638
from the investors to Cyprus that would

173
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:32,458
say Lithuanian Bank also involved but

174
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:36,120
that that was just a few percent of all

175
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:39,359
the cash flow so so the main bulk of a

176
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:42,299
cash flow was from the investors to a

177
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,839
bank in Cyprus and the bank account was

178
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:47,879
hold by this uh Dutch company

179
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,560
very interesting there is a word going

180
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:51,919
around that it was basically just a very

181
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:54,299
Advanced money laundering scheme

182
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:56,099
conducted by the Russian mafia is there

183
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:59,939
any truth to that

184
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:02,339
um well yeah yeah definitely because in

185
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:05,660
all these first of all I should say that

186
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:09,360
when I looked into this and I came into

187
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:13,019
one of my clients contacted me in the

188
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:15,539
end of them of July and explained his

189
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:18,899
situation and that was one of my clients

190
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:21,958
from Sweden I should correct you that I

191
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:24,120
have now about 800 clients from all over

192
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:27,539
the world more than more than 50

193
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:29,940
countries all over the world and that

194
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:32,159
when I looked into this I saw

195
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:34,680
immediately again that the pattern that

196
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:37,620
kind of Playbook the template for these

197
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:42,838
kind of scams and all the different

198
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:45,240
elements and um and and this is uh also

199
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:48,720
very interesting because in all these

200
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:52,139
criminal activities the criminals also

201
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:55,680
use different kind of source of incomes

202
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:58,559
it's very seldom just one kind of crime

203
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:01,259
they are using this infrastructure they

204
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:03,958
have been built they have built to use

205
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:07,500
for different kind of purposes so the

206
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:12,179
investment scam of having people send

207
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:15,839
money to Cyprus to invest in in cannabis

208
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:18,179
plants is just one of a different kind

209
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,720
of businesses of a different kind of

210
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:25,500
criminal activities because inside the

211
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:29,220
use you feel scam I have identified also

212
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:31,919
a number of things that point in the

213
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:34,920
direction there had been a money

214
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:38,099
laundering scheme as well and the money

215
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:42,719
laundering scheme could be free or maybe

216
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:46,620
four times as big as the investment scam

217
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:49,980
in size of the the kind of money that

218
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:51,919
was involved and I should also say that

219
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:57,000
I have identified

220
00:10:51,919 --> 00:11:00,958
something between 1.5 and 2 billion

221
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,720
euros has been lost by the investors and

222
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:06,479
I think the sum is closer to 2 billion

223
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,759
than 1.5

224
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,620
very interesting is there a specific

225
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:12,539
country that has the most amount

226
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,459
investors that have allows the most

227
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:18,299
amount of money or is it spread out

228
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:22,559
across the globe yeah it's interesting

229
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:26,519
to see that that top that that the

230
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:30,179
numbers are very very uncertain and what

231
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:34,259
I have uh with all the contact I have

232
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:36,359
had and as I said I have 800 clients but

233
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:38,778
I've been in contact in one way or

234
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:42,060
another me and my team we are 12 people

235
00:11:38,778 --> 00:11:46,439
uh being in contact with more than 20

236
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:49,139
000 investors and that when I add up all

237
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,180
the different countries and uh what I've

238
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:53,278
been talking to people and the

239
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:55,500
information they have been giving me

240
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,539
that's when I come up with a number

241
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:00,899
about 125

242
00:11:57,539 --> 00:12:04,259
000. Germany is definitely one of the

243
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:08,220
largest something between 10 and 11

244
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:10,980
000 investors has lost money a Spain is

245
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:13,800
a very large country something nine ten

246
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:16,560
thousand Portugal the neighboring

247
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:19,559
country from Spain that there is seven

248
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:23,099
eight thousand I have a lot of clients

249
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:26,939
in Mexico I have more than 60 clients in

250
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:29,519
Mexico and I think Mexico might be one

251
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:33,779
of the biggest countries actually and

252
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:36,720
France as well so so that so so there

253
00:12:33,778 --> 00:12:39,259
are thousands of thousands of people in

254
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,420
more or less every country

255
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:44,759
it's crazy the overarching reach of this

256
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:46,559
scam you have said previously that

257
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:48,600
you're sitting on documents that

258
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:52,078
basically points the finger at certain

259
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:54,240
facilitators is there a case that some

260
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:56,338
of these facilitators were completely

261
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,500
unaware of what was going on at the

262
00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:00,180
company or is their actual factual

263
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,578
evidence that would stand up in court

264
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:03,679
that when the finger has been pointed

265
00:13:02,578 --> 00:13:06,599
that there is

266
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:10,679
irrevocable uh proof that they were

267
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:12,720
involved yeah yeah my legal strategy not

268
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:15,958
in just this case but in many other

269
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,720
similar cases is that I know for sure

270
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:21,838
that the criminals they have been

271
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:26,160
planning this for years there have been

272
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:28,620
as I said a a pre-planning process of at

273
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:31,500
least two years and then the operation

274
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:35,159
during more than two years since on top

275
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:38,339
of that and and if you have and that is

276
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:41,399
the logic if you have planned this and

277
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:44,959
invest a lot lot of money and time into

278
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:51,120
this and actually steal two billion

279
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:54,299
euros I I I I could I could be 100 sure

280
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:57,600
that they had planned the exits as well

281
00:13:54,299 --> 00:14:01,620
to keep the money there is no logic in

282
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:05,339
stealing 2 billion euros and not trying

283
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:09,000
to keep it as much as possible so my

284
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:11,760
strategy is in all these cases not to go

285
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,339
after the criminals because they are so

286
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:18,139
far ahead and they have planned their

287
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:21,120
exit so carefully so it's more or less

288
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:24,480
impossible to find the money

289
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:27,200
so what I'm doing in all these cases is

290
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:30,778
to look who helped them who has

291
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:33,300
facilitated for them to do the sales and

292
00:14:30,778 --> 00:14:36,600
marketing and that's why I'm targeting

293
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:39,719
some of the large social media companies

294
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:44,040
some media companies that have allowed

295
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:46,800
user fields to actually promote to do

296
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:51,198
sales and marketing and these companies

297
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:56,099
they cannot just say that we didn't know

298
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:58,859
they need to actually talk to people and

299
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:01,440
do some kind of due diligence of who

300
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:04,740
they are doing business with and they

301
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,740
should have asked two very simple

302
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:10,799
questions because everyone who is

303
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:13,079
working within the Cannabis industry if

304
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:16,559
you are a farmer if you are a producer

305
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:18,719
if you are a Trader whatever it is you

306
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:22,379
need to have a license

307
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,600
everybody who is handling cannabis in

308
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:28,078
one way or another need to have a

309
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:32,940
license and if you're giving investment

310
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:36,479
advices or managing people's money to to

311
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:39,420
get money and then put money into some

312
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,278
kind of investment then you also need to

313
00:15:39,419 --> 00:15:44,759
have a license

314
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:47,820
so there should have been two very

315
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:51,059
simple questions asked to the people

316
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:54,600
from use of field do you have a license

317
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:57,778
to trade in cannabis and do you have a

318
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:01,320
license to give investment advices or

319
00:15:57,778 --> 00:16:03,600
during investment management and neither

320
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:07,320
of these companies who I'm calling

321
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:10,639
facilitators has even asked any of these

322
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:12,778
two basic questions

323
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,000
okay very interesting so it's

324
00:16:12,778 --> 00:16:17,399
facilitators from everybody from legal

325
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,039
advice to conferences to Media companies

326
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:22,440
to news networks the owners was on them

327
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:24,419
to ensure that they were dealing with a

328
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,300
reputable company and everything was a

329
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:30,479
book board yeah yeah and especially the

330
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:35,240

336
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:55,019
industry works all these people I have

337
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:59,278

338
00:16:55,019 --> 00:17:03,120
than 40 companies who has in one way or

339
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:06,119
another being a facilitator for user

340
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:09,838
fields to do the sales and promotion and

341
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:14,338
exposure and on top of that I have more

342
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:17,458
than 70 T people who has individuals who

343

344
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:22,919
Fields with sales and marketing and

345
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,740
these are people who knows about the

346
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:29,400
Cannabis industry and should have asked

347
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:32,099
these two simple questions and how the

348
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:35,160
industry works because it's not just a

349
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:38,819
matter of not having the license the

350
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:41,279
whole concept just doesn't work there

351
00:17:38,819 --> 00:17:45,960
isn't this profit margin that is

352
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:49,440
promised to the to them investors you

353
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:54,000
cannot buy plants like this and there

354
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:57,900
isn't any and buyers all the end buyers

355
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:02,519
doesn't exist they haven't sold one

356
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:06,059
single flower to Annie and buyer that is

357
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:08,879
the pharmaceutical companies

358
00:18:06,058 --> 00:18:10,440
it's a very interesting case to say the

359
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,539
least and is it are you looking for

360
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,460
reparations basically from the the

361
00:18:12,538 --> 00:18:16,319
facilitators to pay back any money that

362
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:18,000
they were owed or is it a case that

363
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:19,980
these are going to court and there's

364
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,819
going to be a settlement uh brought

365
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:27,839
against them yeah more or less in in 95

366
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:30,359
percent of these cases it's going to be

367
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:33,538
a settlement outside Court sooner or

368
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:36,538
later and I've been trying to have a

369
00:18:33,538 --> 00:18:40,500
dialogue with some of these large social

370
00:18:36,538 --> 00:18:43,500
media companies but I have uh just they

371
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:46,859
they had just ignore me so what I'm

372
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:50,700
doing now is to go to courts and I have

373
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:52,979
a legal strategy and it's a solid legal

374
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:55,679
strategy and it's going to be something

375
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:58,558
very very interesting from a legal

376
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:02,759
perspective because what I would like to

377
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:06,000
do is to set precedent for the future if

378
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:10,259
you are a facilitator you just have to

379
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,960
do some basic due diligence of who you

380
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:15,900
are working with and how you are

381
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,419
facilitating for these people and if

382
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:21,480
there is a damage you have to take

383
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:25,020
responsibility for this so I'm not just

384
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:29,058
claiming for the lost money I'm also

385
00:19:25,019 --> 00:19:32,940
claiming for that the mental this

386
00:19:29,058 --> 00:19:36,599
comfort that these people have had this

387
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:41,519
my clients has lost so much money on an

388
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:44,819
average my client has lost more than 32

389
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:47,660
000 Euros and these people all their

390
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:50,399
investors they are not wealthy people

391
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:52,919
that one of the time that what they

392
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,840
targeted was people who was just

393
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:58,020
ordinary people

394
00:19:54,839 --> 00:20:01,019
who wanted to support the Cannabis

395
00:19:58,019 --> 00:20:03,720
industry and they wanted to have the

396
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:06,179
opportunity that the Millionaires and

397
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:10,558
the billionaires had that that was they

398
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:13,919
that was the uh the kind of persona the

399
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:16,980
the set Target on so this is ordinary

400
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,780
people and many other people many of the

401
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,140
investors has lost more or less

402
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:24,000
everything they have

403
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:25,620
yeah it's one of those buyer beware for

404
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,179
every investor retail investor in the

405
00:20:25,619 --> 00:20:28,619
Cannabis industry at the moment I know

406
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:30,179
if I've been in this industry for five

407
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:33,298
years and I know of no company that's

408
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:34,860
paying out 20 or 30X and your investment

409
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:37,079
to date even if you're based up in

410
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:38,699
California or Colorado you're still

411
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:40,759
looking at a small return on your

412
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:44,759
investment until Federation

413
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:47,759
yeah yeah absolutely and in this

414
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:50,038
industry the Cannabis industry that the

415
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:53,879
big return of Investments isn't in

416
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:56,220
farming uh as in as in all kind of

417
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,799
farming it doesn't matter if it's food

418
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:02,339
or whatever it is there is very very

419
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:06,900
small profit margin so so promising a

420
00:21:02,339 --> 00:21:11,099
profit margin of uh about 66 within

421
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:15,480
three months that is an an annual return

422
00:21:11,099 --> 00:21:18,740
of investment of about 250 that is

423
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:23,220
ridiculous that that is just so

424
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:26,759
completely mad so it should have been a

425
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:29,038
a a warning signal not just for the

426
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:34,079
investors because they the investors

427
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:37,919
they had been scammed so so cleverly but

428
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:40,319
all the all the professionals those

429
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,900
where I'm calling their uh the

430
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:46,798
facilitators they should have realized

431
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:48,840
this is a this is an offer that just

432
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:51,480
doesn't exist

433
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:53,639
yeah there's no billion dollar farmers

434
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,440
in cannabis at the moment anywhere in

435
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,600
the world and I think the only real

436
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:01,380
returns from this industry will be IEP

437
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:02,879
protected uh uh companies so it's been

438
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,140
absolutely amazing to offer to hilarious

439
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,659
hopefully I get to touch base with you

440
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:09,059
