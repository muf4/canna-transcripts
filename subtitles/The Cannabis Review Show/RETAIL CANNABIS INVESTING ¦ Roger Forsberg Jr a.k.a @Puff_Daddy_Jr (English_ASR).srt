devices and you guys seem to be uh one

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,559
of the top sources of information when

21
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,640
it comes to the industry outside of the

22
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:49,919

help educate everybody while we can so

25
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,759
i'm going to maybe jump straight into

26
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,000
the first topic and if you could give

27
00:00:55,759 --> 00:01:00,558
everybody a little overview of the

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,759
what's an american msl versus canadian

29
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:05,679
mso and why are uh why would you take a

30
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:08,719
position on one of the other

31
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,360
yeah so we'll start with uh canada um

32
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:13,920
that's basically where i started uh

33
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:16,239
my investing in the cannabis space back

34
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,920
in 2015.

35
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:20,959
in canada we

36
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,599
announced in 2017 that

37
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:26,478
cannabis was going to be legal in in

38
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:26,478
canada and

39
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:34,478
a huge huge opportunity for investing

40
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:36,219
we had companies such as canopy growth

41
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:38,438
aurora cannabis

42
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:41,118
[Music]

43
00:01:38,438 --> 00:01:42,639
hexo t god

44
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:43,920
um

45
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,159
afria

46
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,359
um tilray

47
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,479
all all

48
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:52,399
large uh canadian names and there is

49
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:54,000
quite a bit of excitement going into

50
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,280
legalization

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,078
um

52
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,560
the

53
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:00,078
back then the the big thing that was

54
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,159
driving uh

55
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,599
stock prices especially in the canadian

56
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,159
space was

57
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:08,560
uh licensing

58
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,239
and build outs so it seemed like every

59
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,520
time that

60
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,878
canopy or aurora or tilray announced an

61
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,400
acquisition

62
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:21,519
or expansion of their cultivation or

63
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,400
a new million square foot cultivation

64
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,480
center

65
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:30,319
the stock prices seem to really really

66
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:32,878
take notice and jump up in price

67
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:35,759
unfortunately what happened when the day

68
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:37,919
actually of recreation happened

69
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:41,199
there weren't enough retailers out in

70
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:46,399
the space to actually sell the product

71
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:47,919
so we had an abundance of plant and and

72
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,120
flour to sell

73
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:53,359
but the market because we had not enough

74
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:58,000
retail especially in our larger

75
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,680
provinces such as quebec and ontario

76
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,360
made things really really tough

77
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:06,239
initially on on the large

78
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,400
canadian lps

79
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:12,080
and ever since then they've been

80
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,629
struggling to to get that supply demand

81
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,000
equilibrium

82
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:18,158
[Music]

83
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,360
at a right point and we've seen a lot of

84
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:23,439
closures now with the canadian lps with

85
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,200
the amount of cultivation that we had

86
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:27,280
just too much supply

87
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:30,158
um the demand is there

88
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,400
but uh the amount of supply that we had

89
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:37,519
in canada so

90
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,519
back in 2018 um the us

91
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,920
name started popping up on on stock

92
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:46,318
exchanges like the csc and the otc

93
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:49,119
now obviously it was the beginning

94
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:52,479
stages there were some some states that

95
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,480
were recreational such as california

96
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:57,199
um colorado

97
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:59,039
that uh had huge markets but there's

98
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:00,479
lots of opportunities in the medical

99
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:03,519
space

100
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:05,598
certain states had medical programs some

101
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,840
states had medical and recreation

102
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:09,199
programs and that's where

103
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,000
i thought it was a good time to

104
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:14,798
transition from the canadian names

105
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,519
to the us names so that's when i really

106
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:20,959
started to change my focus to us msos

107
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,199
yeah it seems interesting from the

108
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,199
outside it seems with canada that

109
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,639
the way to move your stock price is

110
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,400
basically growth that if there's no

111
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,960
consumers to buy your product then it's

112
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:32,719
acquisitions of

113
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:34,159
facilities or growth of facilities where

114
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,160
i think america seems to be complete

115
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,880
opposite where there's a huge consumer

116
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,800
base ready there and i think it's about

117
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:43,519
getting the product to those consumers

118
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,800
as opposed to the flip side of canada

119
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:48,719
yeah and and like canada was a different

120
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,840
bird in the fact that

121
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,919
basically you had all these licenses and

122
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,359
cultivation licenses

123
00:04:53,918 --> 00:05:00,560
awarded before the program started and

124
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,199
so you had this massive buildup of like

125
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,439
i say cultivation but you didn't even

126
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,120
really know what your market was going

127
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,918
to be in canada

128
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,680
and

129
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:14,799
at that time the the canadian lps were

130
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:18,240
being handsomely rewarded with

131
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:21,520
you know uh straight up arrow uh stock

132
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,280
price moves of like 20 30 percent a day

133
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,680
i mean that was the golden age of

134
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,679
cannabis where you know an announcement

135
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,759
of an mna deal

136
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,160
between two companies for three billion

137
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,639
dollars uh you know companies like

138
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,479
canopy would go up like thirty percent

139
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,360
forty percent in a day

140
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:43,360
um and that seemed to really really be

141
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,960
the talk of the town uh back in 2017

142
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,160
2018

143
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,959
excuse me

144
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,280
so

145
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:50,399
uh in the us it's a lot different

146
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:52,159
because

147
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,319
it's a lot more restrictive especially

148
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,639
when it comes to medical licensing

149
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:59,759
there's typically limited amount of

150
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:02,560
retail licenses awarded uh typically

151
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:05,520
limited amount of cultivation licenses

152
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,319
awarded so it kind of keeps in check

153
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:10,399
um the amount of retail

154
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:13,199
and and the amount of cultivation

155
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:15,439
available so typically that that helps

156
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,000
keep keeping prices

157
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:20,560
pricing a bit stronger

158
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,959
longer term now eventually supply will

159
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,519
catch up to that demand and you will see

160
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:27,439
a little bit compression on pricing

161
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,799
but then there's the opportunity for

162
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:31,199
some of these

163
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,120
medical markets to turn recreational and

164
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,960
then you're opening it up to a whole new

165
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,120
consumer base so

166
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:39,279
it's very interesting it's very complex

167
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,560
still in the states and obviously we've

168
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:42,638
seen the last

169
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,000
14 15 months

170
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:48,800
some price compression uh in the us

171
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,279
and i think that's mainly due or a lot

172
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,240
of us feel that a lot of that's coming

173
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:56,318
from the lack of federal um

174
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,800
legislation or

175
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,840
or help by the the federal government

176
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:05,598
especially the democrats to get anything

177
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:08,318
uh done to uh to move uh

178
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:10,800
move the industry along so

179
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,280
yeah do you tell me is the big thing

180
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,038
between them the access to capital do

181
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:16,879
you think is that the the site bank

182
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:18,159
connect is the hindrance because one of

183
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:20,399
the next topics i want to talk about was

184
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,479
the m a activity and i've been kind of

185
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:25,120
wondering is the access to capital in

186
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:27,279
canada going to allow for those

187
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,079
companies to do mergers and acquisitions

188
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:32,959
in the us space and take their footprint

189
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:34,719
via that model or do you think the

190
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:36,638
the likes of new york legalizing now

191
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,319
with everything on sale from september

192
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,918
the capital markets are generally in new

193
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,680
york and you'll get access to capital if

194
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,719
you're a company based on that uh

195
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,879
territory

196
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,680
yeah so like when it comes to safe

197
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,720
banking and access to capital i think

198
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,759
uh

199
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,759
you know you've got almost two different

200
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,400
two different things going on in the us

201
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:59,360
you have your top msos we call them tier

202
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:03,758
ones your your top say five

203
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:08,000
uh msos from cure leaf uh green thumb

204
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:10,479
uh truly cresco labs uh verano and you

205
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,560
can even add another company or two in

206
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:13,680
the in the mix but typically those

207
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,120
companies

208
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,240
their access to capital they seem to be

209
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,000
you know

210
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,879
able to to

211
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,598
you know raise money through debt or

212
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,520
if they wanted to do uh shares but at

213
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:29,439
this point because the share prices have

214
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:31,519
been compressed a lot of them have

215
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:34,958
issued debt debt and they're getting

216
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:39,120
rates around eight percent um if if safe

217
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:41,119
banking was was uh available chances are

218
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,360
the rates would have been a a little bit

219
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,679
lower than that could have been you know

220
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,639
four or five percent at the time

221
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:48,239
but

222
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:50,319
those companies aren't struggling for

223
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,278
capital i think where you're seeing the

224
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,920
the big uh issue is when you start

225
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:59,200
talking about social equity

226
00:08:55,919 --> 00:09:03,439
licensing and smaller business when they

227
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:06,240
don't have access to loans from banks to

228
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,880
you know start a dispensary or open up a

229
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,360
store it makes things really tough and

230
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:13,200
even if they do have access the rates

231
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,480
that they're paying are a lot more than

232
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,800
the top

233
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,240
uh tier uh us msos at eight percent you

234
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:21,599
i've seen

235
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,680
i've seen companies that have been

236
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,040
getting like 25

237
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:27,679
30

238
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:29,919
which is almost loan shark pricing

239
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:33,679
so and that's and that and that's if you

240
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:34,399
can even access that uh type of capital

241
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:36,719
so

242
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,559
um yeah

243
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,399
there is a bit of a

244
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:43,599
divergence but i mean

245
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:47,600
still being listed on the otc and cse

246
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,040
has given uh the publicly traded msos

247
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,360
access to

248
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:53,278
capital that's allowed them to expand

249
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,959
quite a bit over the last two three

250
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:56,879
years

251
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:58,479
very interesting next topic i wanted to

252
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:01,360
talk to you about is your market

253
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,120
position have you looked at all in terms

254
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,879
of the european sector obviously you

255
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,240
probably know about germany legalizing

256
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:08,559
over here or is it still a couple of

257
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,240
years away for retail investors like

258
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:13,838
yourself to be taking positions in

259
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:16,159
european companies yeah obviously uh

260
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:19,600
with the announcement in germany that

261
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:22,958
opened a lot of eyes um

262
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,759
i i have looked into the the european

263
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:28,000
market i think it's still a little bit

264
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:29,360
early not saying that getting in a

265
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
position now

266
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,759
um depending on your your timeline right

267
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,919
like if you're looking

268
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:38,799
two to five years down the line getting

269
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:40,319
it getting uh starting a position now

270
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:41,439
certainly uh

271
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,399
um

272
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,480
might be

273
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,039
prudent considering like you say the

274
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,360
germany situation because i think

275
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:52,159
as germany goes you'll see other just

276
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,399
like in the us you'll see

277
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:56,480
you know gradually you'll see

278
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,879
different states and and in europe

279
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:02,639
you're going to see different countries

280
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:05,360
follow probably germany israel um going

281
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:08,240
forward expanding those those markets

282
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,079
and it's a huge opportunity

283
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,839
yeah now i agree do you think

284
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:13,838
that some of these

285
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,640
american msls are going to have their

286
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,519
way

287
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:20,319
would you guys forecast with growth in

288
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,720
europe into your investment or you guys

289
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,640
strategically focus look if we make x

290
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,959
return across full legalization

291
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:28,720
federalization in america that's enough

292
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:30,719
for our position to make sense anything

293
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,240
after that is going to be a bonus

294
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,879
yeah i mean right now i think that

295
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,680
for me anyways or my investment thesis

296
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:42,480
is that the u.s market is still you know

297
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:45,838
in its emphasis and has a long ways to

298
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:48,720
go to maturity and uh i think

299
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:51,839
you know we're talking like rhode island

300
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:55,680
just announced they're the 19th state to

301
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:57,760
uh go recreational in the in the

302
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:00,239
um i think there's going to be large

303
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:02,799
opportunities and and and places like

304
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,120
florida to go recreational

305
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:08,078
um you know two three years down the

306
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,560
line pennsylvania could be fairly close

307
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:12,159
in in in the next year or two

308
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,638
um so

309
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:18,480
for me right now my focus is still on

310
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,759
the u.s there are some canadian lps and

311
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,079
also

312
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:23,200
companies like cure leaf

313
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:26,399
that have

314
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:29,200
um some european um

315
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,919
assets and and uh

316
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,639
are starting to expand or or

317
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:36,639
focus a little bit more on europe but i

318
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,278
think right now because the market's

319
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,560
still um

320
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:42,320
you know

321
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:44,559
the announcement with germany i'm not

322
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,480
exactly sure a hundred percent

323
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:48,559
um how quickly

324
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,360
uh that's gonna

325
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:53,518
take a place and then what kind of rules

326
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,600
and regulations they're going to have

327
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,120
so they came back the other day saying

328
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,200
that the new minister for health is

329
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,799
going to rush it through this year he

330
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,079
came back last week saying that he's

331
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,439
going to try and push this through and

332
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:06,159
have something ready for the start of

333
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,360
2023. and and that would be and that's

334
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:10,719
great but

335
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,879
two when it comes to something like that

336
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:16,480
the amount of time it takes to build a

337
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:18,879
cultivation facility and then on top of

338
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,959
that like you have to get all your ducks

339
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:23,838
in a row when it comes to environmental

340
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:26,319
reviews and permitting and stuff like

341
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,639
that and then on top of that once you

342
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,959
finally get your facility built it could

343
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,959
take three to six months before you'll

344
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:35,759
have an effect you know a product that

345
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:38,000
you can sell to the consumers so it's

346
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:41,519
great and i know there's existing

347
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,600
facilities already but

348
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,679
if it happens like that eventually the

349
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,680
businesses will catch up but it'll take

350
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:49,359
some time right that's a lot of capital

351
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:51,278
that's going to be required to build

352
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,000
those facilities and i'm sure there's

353
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:55,519
lots of money available whether it's

354
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,399
private companies

355
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:01,120
um to take the the opportunity forward

356
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,958
but uh yeah that's great like you say

357
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,879
the the quicker the better and and

358
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:06,958
that's some of the problem we see with

359
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:09,759
the u.s market is that

360
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:12,159
um politicians don't do what's best for

361
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:14,879
the constituents that they

362
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:19,120
um that they're leaders for and

363
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:21,360
sometimes delay things and and and uh

364
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,600
and it ends up just making it very

365
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,159
cumbersome like new jersey had probably

366
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,320
four to five month delay when they were

367
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:31,039
supposed to start wrecking and that had

368
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,639
an impact on a lot of companies that had

369
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:36,240
ramped up production

370
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:39,240
uh ex with the expectation of uh of

371
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:42,639
sales probably you know january february

372
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:44,879
2022 and ended up being you know may

373
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,120
before they got the

374
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:48,958
got to open some stores so

375
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,720
but yeah it's an exciting time for sure

376
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:53,599
and i think it's there's a long way to

377
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:56,800
go especially like you say uh europe's

378
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,278
probably you know the dominoes will fall

379
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:01,439
just like in uh in the us when it comes

380
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:04,000
to individual states so

381
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,199
yeah well i think you and i by you see

382
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,360
the same there's going to be a couple of

383
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:08,958
dominant brands in about 10 years time

384
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,320
that'll have merged and that was uh

385
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,679
acquired pretty much everything out

386
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,440
there and it's whether you've got your

387
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:15,519
dollars behind the coca-cola of this

388
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,000
industry or the mcdonald's or whatever

389
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,519
the large-scale operators may be it's

390
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,120
going to be an interesting ride to see

391
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,720
who that ends up being

392
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:27,120
yeah for sure and like you say uh um the

393
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,959
brands and and companies like i think

394
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,600
the news in germany definitely opened

395
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:33,838
some eyes and i i wouldn't be surprised

396
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,959
if you do see maybe a few american

397
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,279
companies

398
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:38,559
uh start to focus a little bit more on

399
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:41,039
what's going on

400
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:43,359
on europe you know there is an abundance

401
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:46,719
of opportunities still in the in the us

402
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,039
that it's early stages but uh

403
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,440
yeah europe could be a huge opportunity

404
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:54,799
and obviously a country the size of

405
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:57,040
germany going uh going recreational i'll

406
00:15:54,799 --> 00:16:00,319
probably really start kickstarting the

407
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:01,120
uh the cannabis craze and uh in europe

408
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,879
so

409
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,320
