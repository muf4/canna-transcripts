00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,960
who's a co-founder of cannabis

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:21,198
technology house over in israel and tel

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,439
aviv greg how are you keeping today

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,720
i'm doing great how are you i'm very

9
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,160
well thank you very much mate thank you

10
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,479
very much for taking your time to come

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,000
on so you've already had a wealth of

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,119
experience in the industry from bringing

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,640
a product direct per product at altria

14
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:36,159
already can you maybe give everybody a

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,679
quick little overview of how you got to

16
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:39,119
where you are with

17
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:41,119
the company you're in at the mobile

18
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:42,959
cannabis technology house

19
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:45,038
for sure i

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,719
joined a company in israeli company that

21
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,439
was called green smoke

22
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,439
they were in the e-cigarette space

23
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:53,280
that company later on got acquired by

24
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:55,519
altria which is the largest tobacco

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,160
company in the united states

26
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,640
and we really focused on innovation

27
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:02,398
creating new products ways to help

28
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,320
people convert from

29
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,840
combustible cigarettes that are the most

30
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:10,079
harmful to parts that are reduced harm

31
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,920
and a few years ago

32
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:13,760
me and a few colleagues so what's

33
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,600
happening in the cannabis space and we

34
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,520
decided that we want to be

35
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:18,719
entrepreneurs for this opportunity not

36
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:20,640
employees

37
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:23,359
so we basically took all the knowledge

38
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,719
we got in terms of how you create

39
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:28,640
innovation for regulated space what how

40
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,879
do you balance out the consumer the

41
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,359
regulator and the business side

42
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:35,359
and we wanted to apply it to the

43
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,519
cannabis space

44
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:40,879
and that's basically how we

45
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:43,039
came up with our product it's named kube

46
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:46,399
it's a heat not burn product

47
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,640
um we want it to go to heat not burn

48
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,159
where basically you heat up the flour

49
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,478
instead of burning it but you're still

50
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,240
using authentic flour you're not using

51
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,399
artificial liquids or something like

52
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,319
that because we've seen that that

53
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,239
platform is the most successful in terms

54
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,158
of converting people from combustion

55
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:03,280
products to something that's less

56
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,759
harmful

57
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,719
so we have these little cubes

58
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,719
inside there's about 0.2 grams

59
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:12,639
of cannabis flower

60
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:14,560
and all the user needs to do is put them

61
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,719
in this device

62
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,318
give it a little press

63
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:21,199
and they're ready to go

64
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:23,199
so the device is ready to use

65
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:25,119
and it switches off automatically once

66
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:27,199
the session is completed there's no wait

67
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,159
there's nothing involved in that

68
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:30,238
um

69
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:32,079
and when they finish they just

70
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,439
dispose of the capsule

71
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,440
they can pop

72
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:38,719
another one right in so there's no

73
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:40,318
cleaning no hassle involved um and we're

74
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:43,120
planning to commercialize this in the

75
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:46,159
united states this year

76
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:49,120
okay sounds amazing some real innovation

77
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:50,479
in the space of consumption inhalation

78
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,080
so you're telling me there is this going

79
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:54,560
to be like espresso pods where i can

80
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,920
just clip in a cartridge boom i don't

81
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,920
have to clean it i don't have to get rid

82
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,000
of any of the the nastiness that

83
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:01,839
normally comes with putting flour flour

84
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,080
into a vaporizer

85
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,640
you nailed it like the nespresso model

86
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,480
is exactly what we're going for

87
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:10,318
i acknowledge it there's a lot of people

88
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,079
who are officianados they like the

89
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:13,598
hassle they like dealing with the big

90
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,959
vaporizers

91
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:17,199
but we think there's a large audience

92
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,199
that just want the experience and when

93
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:21,759
we saw that there's this huge innovation

94
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,679
in terms of strain you can now find a

95
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:25,598
strain that at least claims that they

96
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,560
can solve every problem

97
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:30,798
but really in terms of how to consume it

98
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,598
half of the markets are still

99
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,280
joints and dried flour in jars

100
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:36,719
and we're mostly focused on the

101
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,479
recreational space but even in the

102
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,639
medical space it doesn't make a lot of

103
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:41,359
sense you go to the doctor and you say

104
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:44,719
well

105
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,480
i have a health problem and he goes okay

106
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:48,000
here is cannabis it can help you but

107
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:49,679
your way to consume it is going to

108
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,598
long-term create another big health

109
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,000
problem for you

110
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:56,079
yeah okay so you guys have this

111
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,120
consumption method inhalation method can

112
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:02,080
you explain the heat not burn parts that

113
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,039
uh that is a core component of the

114
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,080
product

115
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:05,519
um

116
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,599
is it the fact that it's just the

117
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,120
capsule that's being connected to it is

118
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:11,119
allowing some of the heat to happen or

119
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,400
what is the exact engineering behind the

120
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,239
process

121
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,560
for sure so i'll speak a little bit

122
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,000
about the technology itself so heat now

123
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,000
burn is a technology that's already

124
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,319
being applied in the

125
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,800
tobacco space mostly by

126
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:27,360
icos that was developed by philip morris

127
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,360
international i think it was the one of

128
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,000
the first products that were approved by

129
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,720
the fda is a reduced risk product and

130
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,639
was authorized to uh be on the u.s

131
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:41,040
market and the idea in heat not burn is

132
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,400
okay we want to get the sensory

133
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,720
experience right because if the

134
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:46,159
experience is now right people are not

135
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,840
going to shift to our product so it

136
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,360
doesn't matter how

137
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:50,560
less harmful it is people are just not

138
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,919
going to use it

139
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,600
so

140
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:55,599
basically the idea is saying let's take

141
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,639
real authentic tobacco but instead of

142
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,840
burning it

143
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,680
we'll just heat it up to the point where

144
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:04,079
all the components all the oil is

145
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,519
released and a person can inhale it but

146
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:06,800
we never bring it to the point of

147
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:09,359
combustion

148
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,280
where all the main harm is created the

149
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,759
mean harm from smoking

150
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:15,519
is uh not necessarily nicotine it's

151
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,960
mostly the people are inhaling something

152
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:18,079
that was combusting something that is

153
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:20,799
burned

154
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:24,000
so our logic was we wanted to apply the

155
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,000
same technology in the cannabis space

156
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,279
but in a smarter way because it has been

157
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,519
applied

158
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:32,079
through vaporizers like pax and mighty

159
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:34,879
and crafty and the main issue we saw

160
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:38,319
there is um

161
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:40,560
really for the consumer you spend a lot

162
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:42,879
of money they're not cheap the devices

163
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,879
and then basically you work

164
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:46,000
uh for the device the device doesn't

165
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:47,918
work for you

166
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,279
you work cleaning it all the time and

167
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:50,959
then you get to a point where it doesn't

168
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:52,559
matter how much you clean it

169
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:54,319
you know the experience is not the same

170
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,478
as it was in the beginning

171
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,399
also not great for regulation we saw

172
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:01,120
that in nicotine

173
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:04,239
the open tanks that are defined by the

174
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,879
fda's open systems they basically told

175
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,240
um retailers that if you sell this

176
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:10,240
you'll need to apply by the same

177
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,560
standard as a manufacturing and we saw a

178
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,600
lot of kind of vape stores go out of

179
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,800
business because they just couldn't

180
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,560
comply

181
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,560
and also bottom line it's not good

182
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,000
business because

183
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,720
you spend all these efforts selling

184
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,918
people this expensive device but then

185
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,280
you can really uh offer them your own

186
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:29,599
flower

187
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:30,399
so we wanted to solve a couple of issues

188
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,400
one

189
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:33,679
what we did we moved the heater from the

190
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:35,839
device

191
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,400
so what you would see a lot and packs

192
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:40,239
and crafty you have a very large device

193
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,478
and there'll be like an oven inside we

194
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,000
moved it to the consumable so each one

195
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:45,839
of these capsules have their own little

196
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,600
heater

197
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,679
that allows us to significantly reduce

198
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,520
the size of the device and also the

199
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,598
consumer is getting a fresh experience

200
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:56,000
every time because it's a fresh heater

201
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:58,159
every time

202
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,918
and it also took away everything that

203
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,360
has to do with cleaning

204
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:04,318
so really we wanted to create something

205
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,560
that's 100 focus on the consumer

206
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,120
uh he doesn't have to clean anything all

207
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,399
he needs to do is charge the device pop

208
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,560
in a capsule

209
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:15,038
um good for business because it's very

210
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,038
kind of classic razer and blades model

211
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:19,439
and it also good for regulation because

212
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:20,719
we know exactly what goes inside every

213
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,199
capsule

214
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,960
we control it it's very easy to measure

215
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,520
how many were sold

216
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:28,879
and so on and so on

217
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:30,478
yeah i know the more you kind of picture

218
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:31,839
in your mind the more genius it is and

219
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:33,439
you can see a future where instead of

220
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,679
going into boy 20 cigarettes you're

221
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:37,279
going in and selecting from cartridges

222
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,439
that have different flower and different

223
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:41,359
various cannabinoid and terpene profiles

224
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:43,038
in them so if you're a silk or blue

225
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,560
smoker at the moment or a jam player

226
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:46,878
book or to be a relevant

227
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,199
strain and application to pop into your

228
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,879
own individual consumption

229
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,960
exactly and it's very similar to what

230
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,720
you said with the nespresso association

231
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:57,758
you look at the capsules and you know

232
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,759
that you know the brown one is stronger

233
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,680
and the green one is decaf so long term

234
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,919
that's where we want to get so another

235
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,840
big component we integrated inside this

236
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:07,038
it's a technology called topography

237
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:07,839
basically

238
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:10,240
um

239
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:12,000
allows us to know when did the consumer

240
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,840
took above how long was the puff and

241
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,720
create kind of the ideal

242
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:19,198
temperature profile for each strain so

243
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,199
later down the line what we want to do

244
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,960
is basically let's say you buy a red

245
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,079
capsule and that's a certain strain of

246
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:25,519
thc

247
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:28,000
and you know what the effect is the

248
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:30,079
device would recognize the capsule

249
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,320
and automatically adjust the performance

250
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:34,319
setting of the device so again really

251
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,320
going taking as far as we can the

252
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,399
strategy of the consumer doesn't need to

253
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,680
do anything this is the experience for

254
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,679
the consumer

255
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,679
while at the same time obviously making

256
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,919
sure that it's something that can pass

257
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,399
for future regulations and something you

258
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:49,919
can build a scalable business on

259
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,320
yeah because i think you've got

260
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,399
regardless of what consumer bracket you

261
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,640
fit into as a canvas consumer

262
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,799
you're going to have your at home

263
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:00,639
smoking profile your traveling smoking

264
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:02,958
profile your profile with your friends

265
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:04,879
so i think that the voice can fit into a

266
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,719
number different scenarios

267
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:09,200
not trying to overtake one or the other

268
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,839
they all have a place in the ecosystem

269
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,759
uh absolutely and there's always a i i s

270
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,760
a story i tell when people try to better

271
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:16,799
understand the useless scenarios and i

272
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:18,559
say

273
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,719
every person who have kids

274
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:23,679
they know that there's a time and it's

275
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,360
right after your um kids go to sleep and

276
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:27,599
it's right before you collapse because

277
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,519
you're exhausted and then that point of

278
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,120
time you would like to relax

279
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,360
but not to the extent that if your kids

280
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,360
wake up you're not really able to deal

281
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,399
with that so that's how the idea of

282
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,959
really you know working in cubes

283
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,839
that have a very small 0.2 gram inside

284
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:45,919
of them uh came to mind so how do you

285
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,839
decide if your tea or coffee is sweet

286
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,319
enough you put a sugar cube inside and

287
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,920
you taste it and here we basically took

288
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,278
the traditional

289
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:57,838
joint and just broke it down to five

290
00:09:55,278 --> 00:10:00,399
cubes and you can decide if you want a

291
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,959
fifth of a joint two-fifths or you won

292
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,519
the entire experience so this is another

293
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:06,799
layer of kind of intuitive control for

294
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,600
the consumer

295
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:11,599
instead of you know letting them

296
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,879
study on on their own how to adjust

297
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,240
resistance and what's the right

298
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,879
temperature

299
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,720
we just felt it's a more intuitive way

300
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:20,799
yeah now what i think a big part of

301
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,040
getting this to be a global uh

302
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:25,120
consumer industry will having the dosage

303
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,958
right for people who don't know or have

304
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,278
no education in the industry that they

305
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:30,879
can feel safe knowing that they got here

306
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:33,919
making me jealous taking a hit off that

307
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:36,480
thing yeah we can organize shipments to

308
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:38,399
ireland talking regulation we we had to

309
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,200
experience some issues with the pact act

310
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:44,240
in the united states but europe luckily

311
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,000
is is a much more understanding market

312
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,000
so then let me move on to the last topic

313
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,958
the regulatory process that you guys got

314
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,440
to go to is it the equivalent of fda

315
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:55,199
approval eu approval you're getting

316
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,279
certain territory or is it individual

317
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,040
countries that you have to get approval

318
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:01,439
from for the device

319
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:03,838
so really it's one big mess right now

320
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,600
because even the united states it's one

321
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,120
country but it's different regulations

322
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,680
in every state

323
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,560
what we did we basically took everything

324
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:14,239
we know from uh regulation of

325
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:15,759
the fda defines electron nicotine

326
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,919
delivery systems

327
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:19,360
and there's a process of pre-market

328
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:21,199
approval for that

329
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,200
so we basically took that as our

330
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,560
blueprint for what we need to take into

331
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,800
consideration

332
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,559
so we knew that

333
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:31,359
it needs to be a closed system where the

334
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,799
consumer can just put anything inside

335
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,039
we knew that there are certain tests we

336
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:36,639
need to do we know that we need to show

337
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,639
uh that this is not going to appeal to

338
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:41,120
the wrong audiences

339
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:43,039
so we just proactively kind of did an

340
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,799
exercise at the early days of saying

341
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:46,559
okay let's just replace

342
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:47,919
the fda regulation of electronic

343
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,078
nicotine delivery system let's just

344
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:52,240
replace the word nicotine with cannabis

345
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:54,799
and see where we land and that really

346
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,919
what drove our regulatory strategy from

347
00:11:54,799 --> 00:12:00,799
day one so yes at the moment there are

348
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:03,199
you know regulations in every market but

349
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:05,120
usually what happens is the fda will

350
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,200
eventually regulate this once it becomes

351
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,399
federally in the united states

352
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,800
and then there'll be kind of standard

353
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,759
regulation and usually other countries

354
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:15,599
would follow whatever the fda does so

355
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:17,759
right now in the united states there's

356
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,320
nuances to each market

357
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:22,399
but the most important thing

358
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,959
it's not to you know sit down and read

359
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,639
every law it's to understand the logic

360
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,319
and what the regulator is trying to

361
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,759
prevent and the regulator's trying to

362
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,240
prevent

363
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:35,200
a few things one and the most important

364
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,959
thing is that this is used by the target

365
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,480
audience that you don't end up in

366
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,000
situations where

367
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,079
some um

368
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,720
e-cigarette company landed where you

369
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:46,399
know the marketing basically kind of

370
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,000
jeopardized the entire business because

371
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,159
they intentionally or unintentionally

372
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,600
reached the wrong audience so that's one

373
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:54,480
the second one you need to make sure

374
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,560
that you know what's inside and that

375
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,750
that's consistent

376
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:59,359
and then um

377
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:01,440
[Music]

378
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,320
most most importantly

379
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,560
is that people are really going to move

380
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,920
from a harmful product which is

381
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:10,239
combustion

382
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:12,399
and it's no different from cannabis but

383
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,720
basically for nicotine the fda has a

384
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:17,120
spectrum of harm where not smoking is

385
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,278
obviously the best and a combustible

386
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,959
cigarette is the worst you need to show

387
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:22,958
that you're actually your product is

388
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:24,559
gonna help people move from something

389
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:27,119
that is more harmful to something that

390
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:27,838
is less harmful and not just gonna you

391
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,039
know

392
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:33,040
for an example uh have them use both

393
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:35,199
joints and reduce harm products so the

394
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:37,599
idea is to really show conversion which

395
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,000
was also one of the reasons we felt heat

396
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,639
not burn is the best way to go

397
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,799
amazing excuse me can you add cbd flower

398
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,480
or hash is is to

399
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:48,399
what you put into these things relevant

400
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,560
or is it coming specifically from your

401
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,559
own

402
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:55,519
anything you can put in a joint

403
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,519
i'll clarify not everything you could

404
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,639
put android anything you should put in a

405
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,039
joint

406
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,519
you could put into the system so we we

407
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:05,919
operate as a technology company so we

408
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:09,039
partner up with cannabis companies that

409
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:11,198
have cultivation uh that have that and

410
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:15,360
we work with them to identify kind of

411
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:17,919
the perfect settings for their blends

412
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,199
amazing and and then we just set it up

413
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:20,879
um

414
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:23,120
yeah theoretically even in the earlier

415
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:26,240
days we we even tested it with tobacco

416
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,919
just you know as a startup

417
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,079
also as a category you can't really

418
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:32,479
taste cannabis and stay focused for too

419
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:34,078
long so tobacco is a good alternative so

420
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,159
even worse with tobacco not that we have

421
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:38,719
any plans to go into this space

422
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:40,799
but yeah essentially um

423
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,079
any type of flower springs whether it's

424
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:46,799
cbd or thc works well with the device

425
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:48,799
amazing it seems like one of the proper

426
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:50,879
innovations that i've seen over the last

427
