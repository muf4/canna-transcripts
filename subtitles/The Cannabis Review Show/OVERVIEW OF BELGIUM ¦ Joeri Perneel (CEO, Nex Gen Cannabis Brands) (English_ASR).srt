Europe and the rest of the world first

39
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:51,839
topic I'm going to jump on to is an

40
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,439
overview of Belgium can you maybe break

41
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,200
down for everybody what are the exact

42
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:58,839
regulations in Belgium is there a a

43
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,680
thriving market for the flour under 0.2%

44
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,240
is there a big Medical program what's

45
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:06,399
the political Outlook like in

46
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:10,959
Belgium H it's a typical Belgium

47
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:14,400
situation um today um I think it's all

48
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:17,680
very clear today the flowers below 0.2%

49
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,480
THC can be sold as a tobac substitute

50
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,680
that means uh from a bounded Warehouse

51
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:26,079
with a with a tax stamp on it like

52
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:30,200
cigarettes are sold so that's very clear

53
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:33,239
um so um next to that we have a CBD

54
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:35,679
markets where Cosmetics Cosmetics are

55
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:39,360
allowed like in any any other European

56
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:42,719
country um and CBD and oil uh is

57
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,840
forbidden due to the Nova food so but

58
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:47,800
there's

59
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:51,158
a an amount of CBD oil is sold uh but

60
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:53,400
not uh for intake uh you can sell it but

61
00:02:51,158 --> 00:02:57,199
on the packaging uh you have to mention

62
00:02:53,400 --> 00:03:01,599
that is not for uh intake so uh that's

63
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:04,878
the situation on CBD or canabo business

64
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:07,318
if you see the business of uh THC

65
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:11,000
flowers um there's a lot of noise for

66
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:13,359
the moment um on the Belgium Market uh

67
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,080
like in the rest of Europe uh Belgium is

68
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,440
watching what's happening in Germany

69
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,400
what's happening in Czech Republic

70
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:23,158
what's happening in Switzerland um if we

71
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:27,680
see the polit politic landscape today

72
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:30,239
and there has to be vote um it's in

73
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:34,519
favor of the legalization

74
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:36,480
um but some politician have to enter a

75
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:40,438
low proposition what's not the case for

76
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:43,438
the moment and will not be the case this

77
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:46,318
this for the moment because next year we

78
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:48,878
have um we have elections so everybody

79
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:52,078
is looking at the elections um what we

80
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:55,840
see in the paper that a lot of politic

81
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:58,439
parties uh or or other uh parties who

82
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,959
who are involved in this uh giving their

83
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:03,199
opinion that we have to go to

84
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:07,878
regularization to decriminalization

85
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:11,919
Etc um we are working on a blueprint uh

86
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:14,759
that we're going to launch uh next month

87
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:17,399
with the with the European cannabis

88
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:20,279
Summit in Belgium uh we're going to

89
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:23,758
launch also our blueprint how we see it

90
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:27,399
and a full uh closed system that has

91
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:30,280
fully control of the government um so we

92
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:34,000
believe that there's a there's a market

93
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:37,478
for regularization of the THC business

94
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,279
um and we have uh therefore we made a a

95
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:42,680
blueprint that we're going to propose uh

96
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:45,159
and launch in

97
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:47,280
October and when it comes to the medical

98
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,039
side of the market is there a thriving

99
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,679
medical cannabis industry or is it

100
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:51,959
limited by the amount of patients that

101
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:57,360
can access

102
00:04:51,959 --> 00:05:02,000
it in Belgium uh you can buy uh

103
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:05,680
CBD as a maestral uh but it's it's not a

104
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:09,639
big Market uh next to it THC flowers we

105
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:12,600
don't have medical THC flowers

106
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:14,319
uh in my opinion there's not such a

107
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:18,240
thing as

108
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:19,879
uh Med medical and and recreational it's

109
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,960
all the same flower it's all the same

110
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:23,759
plant uh the only thing it's it's

111
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:27,519
cultivated differently and and more

112
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:29,879
strict if it's medical um but in Belgium

113
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:32,318
uh the pharmacist are not selling

114
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:36,519
flowers as it's not for it's not legal

115
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:40,840
to sell flowers um THC flowers above

116
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:44,000
0.3% THC uh even medical so it it isn't

117
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:46,000
existing in Belgium on the Belgium

118
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,879
market and when it comes to the

119
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,800
political overview is there one dominant

120
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:52,360
party in Belgium or as you said with the

121
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,840
elections next year is it going to be a

122
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:58,479
coalition of parties and if so how many

123
00:05:54,839 --> 00:06:00,478
of those parties are pro cannabis

124
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:05,038
legalization

125
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:07,000
um as you know Belgium is is a very uh

126
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:09,120
there's almost three countries and one

127
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,680
country so we have two countries and one

128
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,199
country um the southern part the French

129
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,560
speaking part uh is run by the

130
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:19,280
Socialists uh they're in favor of

131
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:23,199
legalization last week also

132
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:24,799
the the minister uh uh did an

133
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:29,520
announcement that he he he wants to

134
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:33,240
legalize uh cannabis THC cannabis in in

135
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:36,240
Belgium uh on the flamish part um we

136
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,240
have the Socialists who are um Pro

137
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:43,120
legalization we have the liberals who

138
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:45,000
are pro uh and then we have nvea and

139
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,199
vlam block who

140
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,279
are right and extreme right parties who

141
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:55,400
are against it um so everything will

142
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:59,000
depend uh on the elections next year

143
00:06:55,399 --> 00:07:02,839
um but it's up to the to the Commerce to

144
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,879
us to come with a plan that nobody uh

145
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:08,799
the market is there so we we we I think

146
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:12,039
we're obliged to to to to regulate it

147
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,879
legalization I don't I don't like to use

148
00:07:12,038 --> 00:07:17,318
the word legalization because in my eyes

149
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:20,039
it's legal the market is there um I

150
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:25,479
think in Belgium we have about six ton

151
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:27,478
uh of illegal sales um by month uh if we

152
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:30,240
if we do a comparation with the with the

153
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:32,959
Dutch Market I think Belgium

154
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:37,478
six ton every month again we have six

155
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:39,120
ton of of illegal THC assault uh and 80%

156
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:43,598
of the of the sales is to non

157
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,759
problematic uh users so I don't see why

158
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:49,478
we cannot regulate this Market because

159
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:52,639
now it's illegal and it's uh but there's

160
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:55,918
a nobody do does something against it if

161
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:58,120
we if we can focus on the 80% of the

162
00:07:55,918 --> 00:08:00,918
nonpr problematic users to bring them in

163
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:05,199
a framework where they can buy uh

164
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:08,120
controlled uh THC with labo tests Etc on

165
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,919
it uh I think everybody is a winner in

166
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:13,079
this

167
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:14,478
situation and do you see in Belgium that

168
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:16,158
everybody's kind of waiting for one of

169
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:17,478
the EUR European countries whether it be

170
00:08:16,158 --> 00:08:18,680
Germany or the Czech Republic or

171
00:08:17,478 --> 00:08:21,038
Switzerland as you mentioned is

172
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,759
everybody kind of just keeping a step

173
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:24,918
back and seeing what comes out first or

174
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,000
do you think they're actually very

175
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:31,120
driven to create their own policy and

176
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,559
framework I I think yes you have to look

177
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,120
and you have to be aware what's

178
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:37,000
happening in the other countries on the

179
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:40,519
other hand every country has its own

180
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,360
background and way of of handling uh the

181
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:47,320
situation and uh and and narcotics Etc

182
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:49,800
um I I strongly believe that Belgium

183
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,959
doesn't have to look at what they didn't

184
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:53,679
do with CBD the legalization with

185
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:56,278
flowers to put it as a tobacco

186
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:59,599
substitute that's the first country in

187
00:08:56,278 --> 00:09:01,919
in Europe who did it in 2019 followed by

188
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:06,159
Luxembourg now Luxembourg is going from

189
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:10,120
0.2 or 0.3 THC to 1% THC like the Czech

190
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:12,159
Republic um Belgium is is is keeping 0.2

191
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,839
so I don't believe Belgium has to look

192
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:18,360
they have to look but they have to draw

193
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:21,120
their own uh legal framework on the

194
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:24,159
regularization of of of

195
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,799
THC moving on now to the nextg story

196
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:27,319
you'd mentioned that you come from a

197
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:29,278
tobacco background and you saw the

198
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,959
opportunity here you guys also

199
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:33,679
successfully had some investment in 2021

200
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:35,199
do you mind to maybe give everybody a

201
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:37,559
quick little run through of the story of

202
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,040
NextGen from the start to where you guys

203
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:40,119
are now as one of the dominant players

204
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:43,078
in

205
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,320
Europe um so next gen was founded in

206
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:47,599
June

207
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,240
2019 uh due to the legalization of uh of

208
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:54,040
of of the legal framework of

209
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:56,360
selling uh CBD flowers or cannabis light

210
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:58,480
flowers are below 0.2% as a tobacco

211
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,639
substitute I used to work for Imperial

212
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:05,278
tobacco and gaher uh in the tobacco

213
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:08,799
industry uh so I I know how to handle

214
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:11,439
bounded warehouses tax stems Etc um we

215
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:14,679
jumped on this business um we get

216
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,959
supplied by this DH um after three

217
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:19,799
months we took over also our importer

218
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:22,039
and our we did only the distribution so

219
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:26,278
three three to six months later we took

220
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:30,078
over DH who was the Importer um we

221
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:33,559

222
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:36,879

224
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:43,799
2,500 shops that we deliver our flowers

225
00:10:40,278 --> 00:10:46,078
to um next to that we launch pure CBD as

226
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:50,479
as a wellness brand where we sell to the

227
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:52,838
CBD stores and to the to the to the

228
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,159
pharmacies and Par pharmacies as a small

229
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:56,880
Market that's growing uh it's growing a

230
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:59,799
little little by little and people get

231
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:02,519
more and more aware of of of of of the

232
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:06,838
benefits of using CBD or cannabinoids in

233
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:08,759
in their healthy lifestyle um we open we

234
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:10,920
took over also over one point of sales

235
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:14,360
Flora point in the meantime we have five

236
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:17,838
of them uh because that gives us access

237
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:19,560
uh to the consumer uh to have data and

238
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,040
and and insights what we don't have in

239
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:24,838
this market um and also we want to

240
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:27,838
create we want to be uh in pole position

241
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:29,720
if legalization happening if uh we can

242
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,920
sell through uh

243
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,920
Point of Sales that we already have our

244
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:36,679
Network that's that's one of the main

245
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:39,000
reasons of of Flora point and to have a

246
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:44,759
fully integrated

247
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:47,120
uh fully integrated uh uh structure um

248
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:52,439
we we've been sold I I've sold my shares

249
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:54,720
to always pure Organics in 21 um always

250
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,839
pure organic was a Manchester based

251
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,160
company um white label private label due

252
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,800
to the brexit Etc they were looking for

253
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:07,159
a a European food ground they took us

254
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:10,319
over um but the deal didn't happen uh

255
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:12,838
and the story is that today APO is is is

256
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,160
in bankruptcy and I bought back the

257
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:19,399
company uh I took back the company in

258
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:22,759
May 2022 so we restructured it and uh

259
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:26,159
today the company is in on the one hand

260
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:29,799
uh in hands of of myself and uh on the

261
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:33,240
other hand in hands of Laban um cure

262
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:34,679
support we're the majority shareholders

263
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,959
of the

264
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:38,559
company you guys look to be very well

265
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,479
positioned for the coming years for a

266
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:42,399
lot of m&amp;a activity that may happen

267
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,879
across the brands and the distribution

268
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,039
and the retail sort of things are you

269
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:47,679
hopeful that we're going to see a

270
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:49,480
cannabis industry over the next five

271
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:55,559
years in

272
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:58,360
Europe yeah what we saw in 20 21 20 till

273
00:12:55,559 --> 00:13:01,000
the end of 21 a lot of m&amp;a activities

274
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:07,039
happening a lot of crazy prices were

275
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:10,600
paid for uh CBD uh businesses uh I think

276
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:14,360
we're today in a normal situation uh

277
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:18,000
where m&amp;a activities are happening with

278
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:20,800
with companies with a positive eida with

279
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,600
a brands with with a with a vision with

280
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:28,278
a with a mission and and not anymore on

281
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:31,040
uh on dreams and uh so yeah I believe

282
00:13:28,278 --> 00:13:33,559
that again there there there are three

283
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:37,879
two two axes in this business there's

284
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:41,159
one is the smoking smoking axe uh where

285
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:44,799
I believe tobacco companies can be very

286
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:47,120
interesting in U in jumping on on on

287
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:50,319
this on this business uh some of them

288
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,720
already jumped in or or are closely

289
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,160
looking at jumping into this business

290
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,600
and on the other hand we have the the

291
00:13:55,159 --> 00:14:00,958
CBD business who has a 50 Shades of Gray

292
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,399
uh in the wellness sector

Pharmacy big Pharma companies are

295
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:13,519
looking at it um some of them are are

296
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:16,278
want to take uh um yeah

297
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,399

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,759

yeah it seems we brands are going to be

316
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:18,120
the winner of this industry One Last

317
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,079
Thing Before I Let You Go when it comes

318
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,039
to the actual main supplier side of the

319
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:23,799
ingredient things there's been a lot of

320
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:25,719
talk about using fermentation

321
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:28,879
engineering to be able to produce these

322
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:32,040
molecules in large scale batches do you

323
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:33,720
see a scenario where Europe actually is

324
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:36,360
dominated by a couple of Biotech

325
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,680
companies that can do 5,000 lers a day

326
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,360
of a pure molecule and that's the main

327
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:44,120
ingredient do you always see a

328
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:49,360
cultivated um oil always going to be

329
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:52,399
available I I believe both both both uh

330
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:55,600
both ways uh what we see that we receive

331
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:59,519
from the Cosmetic and from the Pharma uh

332
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:02,480
because we deliver uh raw material also

333
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:05,399
and we see more and more demand of of of

334
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,000
synthetic uh because there you have

335
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:10,278
proven stability of the product what you

336
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,839
don't have if if if it's not coming out

337
00:16:10,278 --> 00:16:15,639
of the label um if it's from Growers you

338
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:18,600
don't have the stability and in in

339
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:22,360
cosmetics and in food

340
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:26,199
uh it's difficult working with a

341
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:28,519
non-stable stabilized product yeah very
