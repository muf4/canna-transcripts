Cannabis industry and to be able to

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,539
bestow some information on to everybody

17
00:00:40,378 --> 00:00:44,339
can you maybe give everybody a quick

18
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:45,899
little overview of how you came to be

19
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,820
part of the Philippine Society of

20
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:51,539
cannabinoid medicine

21
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:55,079
well uh it uh the Philippine cannabis

22
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:58,500
movement started uh was jump started

23
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:03,840
because of the uh weed documentary and

24
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:05,819
CNN by Sanjay Gupta that uh it uh was a

25
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,820
very famous here in the Philippines so

26
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:12,359
it basically catapulted the Philippine

27
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:14,219
cannabis movement and uh shortly after

28
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:18,060
that time

29
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:22,560
um my late sister was diagnosed with a

30
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:26,700
stoma cancer so uh that's when I started

31
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:30,659
uh looking into this uh medicinal

32
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:33,780
cannabis and uh that's when I started to

33
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:38,159
uh network with other like-minded

34
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:41,819
doctors and that's how the society began

35
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:45,859
um So currently we are lobbying for the

36
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:48,359
uh legalization of uh medicinal cannabis

37
00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:53,399
interestingly here in the Philippines in

38
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:57,078
two since 2002 it's already legal to

39
00:01:53,399 --> 00:02:00,540
import uh medicinal cannabis

40
00:01:57,078 --> 00:02:04,199
pharmaceutical uh from abroad uh but

41
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:07,740
unfortunately only one out of six

42
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:12,539
applications have been granted so of

43
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:15,299
course uh importation uh from uh to a

44
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:18,659
third world country is a very expensive

45
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:22,860
idea and very unsustainable that's why

46
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:26,400
we are pushing for and advocating for uh

47
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:28,200
access a full utilization of cannabis

48
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,480
here in the Philippines

49
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:31,859
okay thank you very much so the first

50
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:33,238
topic I wanted to just do a quick

51
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,739
overview of the Philippines to go

52
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:36,599
through a couple of different items to

53
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:38,039
see how it's comparable to different

54
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:39,959
parts of the world so you guys have a

55
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:43,079
medical cannabis program you've been

56
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:45,719
able to import medical cannabis what is

57
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,420
the list of ailments that sits on your

58
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:50,459
medical cannabis program is it chronic

59
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:53,098
pain neuropathic pain or is it Trafford

60
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:54,959
syndrome and and seizures and it's it's

61
00:02:53,098 --> 00:02:57,959
restricted to that

62
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:01,199
so uh the Philippines of course has uh

63
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:02,939
one of the most notorious uh drug laws

64
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:06,299
in the world

65
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:07,098
um they put uh they put the

66
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,519
uh

67
00:03:07,098 --> 00:03:15,060
entry in there where you can uh import

68
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:18,239
uh any Dangerous Drug uh for medical use

69
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:21,000
as long as it is approved in the country

70
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,939
of origin it's called the compassionate

71
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,780
special permit but it turns out it's not

72
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:29,340
that compassionate at all because uh the

73
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,519
the

74
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:36,780
the requirements uh it's very difficult

75
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:40,140
uh to uh first of all you have to find a

76
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:44,039
neurologist and you and it is only for

77
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:47,878
uh those with intractable epilepsy so in

78
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:50,780
short uh only those with the drave

79
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:53,759
syndrome and Lennox gasto syndrome can

80
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:57,719
uh apply for a permit and the

81
00:03:53,759 --> 00:04:01,560
requirements are very difficult for a

82
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:04,259
normal Filipino to attain so uh as for

83
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:07,259
the qualifying condition that's uh the

84
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:10,378
only condition intractable epilepsy and

85
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:14,098
only neurologists can prescribe it so

86
00:04:10,378 --> 00:04:18,000
not so unlike uh other uh epilepsy

87
00:04:14,098 --> 00:04:22,639
medications where uh any uh doctor can

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,959
prescribe uh for epidiolex only

89
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,540
neurologists can prescribe it so it's

90
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:30,719
very very strict even though it's

91
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:33,360
accessible on paper it it's still uh

92
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,460
virtually inaccessible

93
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,080
yeah it seems to be the pattern across a

94
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:38,879
number of territories in Ireland it's

95
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:40,978
very restrictive as well we've got a

96
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,540
pretty what seems to be an open cannabis

97
00:04:40,978 --> 00:04:44,639
program but when you actually peel back

98
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,680
the layers that a doctor has to get

99
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,478
permission from a consultant there's

100
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,040
only a handful of diseases five

101
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:52,379
different diseases that fit on the

102
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,300
program so it seems to be that a lot of

103
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:57,540
the countries are taking baby steps

104
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,819
towards a fully fledged market so use

105
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,740
that only neurologists are allowed to

106
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:03,899
prescribe over in Philippines that's

107
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,819
basically the only rule that they have

108
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:08,339
no regular practitioner no regular

109
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:09,839
doctor can let's say advise a patient to

110
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:10,978
go to a neurologist they have to book

111
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:12,779
appointments straight with a neurologist

112
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:16,019
is it

113
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:18,359
uh yes uh here in the Philippines uh you

114
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:21,418
can go straight to a neurologist uh

115
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:26,939
unfortunately it is very difficult to

116
00:05:21,418 --> 00:05:31,139
find a neurologist that is willing to or

117
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:34,680
has a faintest idea about medicinal

118
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:39,180
cannabis so that's another hurdle to

119
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:40,680
cross and if you find a neurologist uh

120
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:45,900
uh

121
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:49,860
the cost of importing epidiolex uh

122
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:53,279
the cost of epidiolex is a

123
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:57,960
uh already like uh almost one month

124
00:05:53,279 --> 00:06:00,538
salary of a normal uh Filipino family so

125
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:03,418
they can only afford the medicine if

126
00:06:00,538 --> 00:06:06,060
they don't eat for a month so uh that's

127
00:06:03,418 --> 00:06:08,879
uh one of the that's the main reasons

128
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:13,680
why uh we are really pushing for locally

129
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:15,959
produced uh uh medicinal cannabis

130
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,060
yeah what we saw from Jaws pharmacals

131
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:20,779
really recently published at their own

132
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:24,360
course to turn over a billion Euro in

133
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:26,698
epidiolex sales and at 163 million in

134
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,840
the last quarter alone so it does I

135
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:30,300
don't think that they seem to be making

136
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,638
it a product or uh that can be

137
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,680
satisfying the world needs do you see a

138
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,019
locally sourced version of a product

139
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,759
like epiglax or dravenol being created

140
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:43,079
in your part of the world

141
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:44,660
uh yes uh there is a bill now uh it has

142
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:47,399
been it's already

143
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:51,060
the medicinal cannabis compassionate

144
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:54,959
bill I was first filed uh three

145
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:58,379
presidents ago in uh 2013. uh

146
00:06:54,959 --> 00:07:00,538
unfortunately it doesn't get passed uh

147
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:03,240
but basically it's

148
00:07:00,538 --> 00:07:07,019
um about uh establishing medical

149
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:11,840
cannabis compassionate centers uh which

150
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:15,060
controls everything from cultivation to

151
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:19,739
manufacturing and dispensing you know so

152
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:22,038
if the that's uh What uh is up in the

153
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:27,478
Congress right now so government

154
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:31,259
produced uh medicinal cannabis so uh we

155
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:34,620
are seeing a bit of uh light right now

156
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:37,439
because uh majority of the Senators and

157
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:40,879
majority of the congressmen

158
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:44,959
um have uh allegedly

159
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:49,079
supported it and uh our new president

160
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:51,659
uh uh allegedly also uh is very

161
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:54,779
supportive of it uh of course uh

162
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:57,360
everyone uh knows uh what's happening in

163
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:59,758
Thailand what's happening in Thailand uh

164
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,000
the bill here actually

165
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,460
the Philippines was the first to file a

166
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,839
medical cannabis bill but unfortunately

167
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:12,959
uh Thailand has overtaken us uh and in a

168
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:15,538
blink of an eye with a pandemic they

169
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:19,799
have gone from medicinal to now

170
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:23,818
recreational so uh I think

171
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:27,120
um the Philippine policy makers uh have

172
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:29,400
noticed that and also as well when we

173
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,339
talk with the other Southeast Asian

174
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:34,139
Advocates uh we know some of them uh

175
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:36,839
just like in Malaysia where death

176
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:41,098
penalty is uh

177
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:44,399
um uh applicable for cannabis they I

178
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:47,220
think they're about to do also a 180

179
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,919
degree turnaround so from uh death

180
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:53,639
penalty to Nato legalization so it's

181
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:57,299
very uh nice and uh of course uh it's

182
00:08:53,639 --> 00:09:00,958
long overdue so uh yes we see a locally

183
00:08:57,299 --> 00:09:04,199
produced uh not just CBD only but uh

184
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:06,599
hopefully all the uh medicinal

185
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,660
properties of the plant can be uh

186
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,800
locally produced uh in pharmaceutical

187
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:12,240
grade

188
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:13,859
yeah that was going to be my next

189
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,659
question where you guys are positioned

190
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,659
in the world you've got Australia below

191
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:19,740
you and Thailand above you to the left

192
00:09:17,659 --> 00:09:21,419
do you think that they will have an

193
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,459
influence on the Philippines government

194
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:25,620
because Australia seems to have a pretty

195
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:27,778
successful program currently running at

196
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,820
the moment Thailand if they ended up

197
00:09:27,778 --> 00:09:31,439
going and enacting what they say could

198
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,240
be one of the biggest tourist hot spots

199
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,380
when it comes to the industry do you

200
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,879
think that they will have an effect on

201
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:38,159
Philippines or is the Paul of somebody

202
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:41,039
like China in that area who have a

203
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:42,899
pretty strict uh no rule when it comes

204
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:45,299
to even CBD we'll have more influence

205
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:48,740
over those two other two territories

206
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:51,838
uh well yes uh the Philippines is a very

207
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:56,039
globalized country uh we're one of the

208
00:09:51,839 --> 00:10:00,240
most hospitable to uh uh foreigners and

209
00:09:56,039 --> 00:10:04,860
others that's why uh we we are uh aware

210
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:06,240
of the of the uh uh developments uh

211
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,700
abroad

212
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,820
um that's why uh we think uh we are

213
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:16,740
coming around unfortunate uh most of the

214
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:19,620
uh uh literate population I think is

215
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:23,580
open to the idea unfortunately uh the

216
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:28,860
Philippines is still a country uh where

217
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:32,519
majority is uh in the uh class D and E

218
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:34,980
social economic class so we we have a

219
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:39,539
lot of educating to do

220
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:41,639
um but uh uh well first of all uh the

221
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:45,679
previous president with the harshest

222
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:49,500
drugless Rodrigo duterte he uh publicly

223
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:52,859
uh claimed to use cannabis

224
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:55,679
um and uh the former president Gloria so

225
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:58,560
Gloria Arroyo also which is now Speaker

226
00:10:55,679 --> 00:11:01,739
of the House admitted so I the Philip

227
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:05,338
the Filipino politicians and much of the

228
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:09,240
uh educated uh open-minded Filipinos

229
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:12,240
there are uh very willing but uh uh

230
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:15,620
unfortunately uh we have a lot of uh

231
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:18,060
educating to do as we the uh

232
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:20,879
other countrymen of course the

233
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:23,899
stigmatization of a cannabis the

234
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:27,778
demonization is still a very present

235
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:31,320
surprisingly The Mastermind of the uh if

236
00:11:27,778 --> 00:11:36,059
you're aware with the modus of the uh

237
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:39,019
police before of the the previous uh the

238
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:43,379
previous chief of police now Senator

239
00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:46,159
Robert uh I mean Ronald De la Rosa he's

240
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:48,838
The Mastermind of the drug operations

241
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:53,519
responsible of course for the thousands

242
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:57,839
of uh uh uh allegedly uh victims of

243
00:11:53,519 --> 00:12:02,100
drugs he uh is now in support of uh

244
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:06,600
medicinal cannabis so it's very very uh

245
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:10,320
it's very very uh inspiring and we hope

246
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:12,600
also to do some modifications in the bin

247
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,379
because again the bill now is already

248
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:19,320
eight years old and we have seen uh it

249
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:23,639
was patterned uh eight years ago and

250
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:27,959
because of the developments uh around uh

251
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:31,439
the world we want to somewhat

252
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:33,838
um uh see some modifications on it uh

253
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:38,040
the lessons that other countries learn

254
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,880
we want to uh apply it into the current

255
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:41,059
bill

256
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:41,059
foreign

257
00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:48,060
was the Cannabis and the central nervous

258
00:12:44,578 --> 00:12:51,000
system do you see the real breakthrough

259
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:53,699
in medical cannabis coming from research

260
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,500
that targets specific parts of the

261
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:58,200
central nervous system utilizing

262
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:03,480
cannabinoids

263
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:07,200
well uh of course uh uh the CB1 receptor

264
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:09,360
is the most abundant g-coupled protein

265
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:13,139
receptor is more abundant than a

266
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:17,159
dopamine and opioid receptors so uh we

267
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:20,820
really think this will uh have an uh uh

268
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:25,458
it will really disrupt the uh how we

269
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:30,000
treat uh neurological problems and uh

270
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:31,739
uh hopefully uh with other uh diseases

271
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,519
as well

272
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:38,100
um of course uh if one will study really

273
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,980
cannabis we will know that uh it was

274
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:42,420
used as a Panacea or like uh for a

275
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:47,100
cure-all

276
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:48,599
um but uh it's not just uh with the

277
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:52,320
discovery of course of the

278
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:56,639
endocannabinoid system is uh uh proof

279
00:13:52,320 --> 00:14:01,278
that uh it uh has a mechanism of action

280
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:04,500
in this uh in these uh diseases so uh

281
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:07,740
the neurological diseases will be a big

282
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:09,240
part of it but uh also other diseases as

283
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,519
well

284
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,579
yeah that's it it seems to be okay for a

285
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,578
while

286
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:29,459
