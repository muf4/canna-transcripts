this I know you're a very busy man and

19
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,760
uh hopefully we get to bestow some

20
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:46,020
information on the audience can you

21
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:48,299
maybe give everybody a quick little

22
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,219
brief overview of how you ended up at GW

23
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:52,140
Pharma as their first employee and your

24
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:54,539
position in the industry

25
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,120
yeah happy to do that

26
00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:00,000
um yeah I'm a the pharmacist and

27
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:04,618
pharmacologist by by education and after

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,359
my PhD I started my business life in big

29
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:10,260
Pharma for more than 20 years and then

30
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:12,000
in 2017 I joined GW to

31
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,400
launch

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,319
um the first cannabis derived

33
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:22,159
anti-epileptic drug in rare childhood

34
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:25,919
epilepsies so that's what where I

35
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:28,799
joined GW then

36
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,200
very interesting so the topic of this

37
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,060
episode is what are orphan drug trials

38
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,280
can you maybe give everybody an overview

39
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,140
of what is an orphan drug trial and why

40
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,299
are they important in the industry

41
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,900
sure

42
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,299
um

43
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:46,020
yeah often drug trials

44
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:50,640
um that that's a clinical study

45
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:52,618
in a in a rare rare disease rare disease

46
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,939
is defined

47
00:01:52,618 --> 00:02:00,180
less than five people affected out of

48
00:01:56,938 --> 00:02:02,099
ten thousand so we're talking really few

49
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:06,259
patients here that are suffering from

50
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:10,079
really sometimes very serious

51
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:11,098
diseases with no effective treatment

52
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,040
here

53
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:15,238
so in this case you start the clinical

54
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:16,799
study

55
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:20,239
to to

56
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:24,980
uh prove the safety and efficacy

57
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,980
in this rare disease

58
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:31,859
in some cases

59
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:34,200
these are a few few weeks only the for

60
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,300
this for this study

61
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:37,500
um and then some sometimes in some cases

62
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:41,939
it's

63
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:44,280
um taking you even a couple of months in

64
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:46,620
order to start and then finish

65
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,459
to study

66
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,519
um

67
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:53,939
at the end of this trial then

68
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:58,019
usually you publish the results of the

69
00:02:53,939 --> 00:03:02,818
study in a peer-reviewed journal so this

70
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:05,400
is this is all about a often drug trial

71
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:06,899
okay very interesting so this seems to

72
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,360
be one of the Avenues that for

73
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,459
cannabinoid derived pharmaceutical

74
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,760
products that orphan drug trials are

75
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:15,900
maybe one of the best avenues for for

76
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:17,939
biotechnology and technology companies

77
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,519
to be taken is that correct

78
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:22,139
uh absolutely I'm convinced that that's

79
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:25,140
the the way to go

80
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:26,458
um you have to to prove uh again safety

81
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:29,219
and efficacy that's important for

82
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:32,158
patients and their their families uh of

83
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:35,098
of anything that that would become a a

84
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:38,459
reimbursed drug in the end for for the

85
00:03:35,098 --> 00:03:41,280
sake uh of of these these patients

86
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:44,219
yeah and I suppose the objective is to

87
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,959
make evidence-based medicines and the

88
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:51,000
the evidence needs to come from trials

89
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:52,500
absolutely correct I just can Echo what

90
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,719
you what you just said it's all about

91
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,360
the evidence-based based medicine and

92
00:03:54,719 --> 00:04:00,180
for this you need the data in improving

93
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,319
statistically proven

94
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:07,019
um public published peer-reviewed

95
00:04:03,318 --> 00:04:10,318
randomized trials so there's nothing

96
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:12,780
nothing else than that

97
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:16,079
okay next topic I wanted to jump on to

98
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,519
was launching up at the OLX and a lot of

99
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,199
patients and a lot of consumers out

100
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,600
there I don't think would have a

101
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,720
complete understanding or Nuance to

102
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:28,020
overview of how a product like epidelex

103
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,479
is created and when it comes to the

104
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:33,079
launch of epideotics what was the exact

105
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:35,099
process what's the kind of time frame

106
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:36,180
that you guys would have been working

107
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:40,800
under

108
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:43,319
yeah so uh this is basically once you

109
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,139
have started an orphan drug trial it has

110
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:48,439
been successful and published then you

111
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:50,759
go into the next phase to launch a drug

112
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:52,620
and this is then all about you bring

113
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:55,620
these studies

114
00:04:52,620 --> 00:05:01,139
um to The Regulators in the US it's the

115
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:03,120
FDA in Europe it's the IMA and they you

116
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:05,699
compile all your data you have in in our

117
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,959
case with epidiolex

118
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:13,020
um it has been five successful studies

119
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:17,478
to launch this product into

120
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:17,478
uh rare childhood epilepsies

121
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,900
all five were successful and showed

122
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,000
exactly the same safety and efficacy so

123
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:25,859
so we put everything together and

124
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,620
brought it then to the in Europe to the

125
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:31,439
EMA and in again as I said in the in the

126
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:36,000
US to the FDA

127
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:38,519
um and this uh they take they take from

128
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,100
the moment you submit your data until

129
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:43,639
they give you their assessment

130
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:46,320
um it takes you one year

131
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:48,360
roughly depending on the outcome and

132
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:49,740
depending on the results you you can

133
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:54,060
offer

134
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:57,360
um and once and we did that in Europe to

135
00:05:54,060 --> 00:06:02,759
to say that we did that in Europe

136
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:06,240
um in 2018 and then one year later we

137
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:10,439
received the approval in September

138
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:14,579
um to launch this truck in Europe so

139
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:16,399
that is really the the milestone for for

140
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:21,659
any drug

141
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:24,060
to be available for patients in Europe

142
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:26,580
yeah it seems to be very successful so

143
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,800
far and everybody understands or knows

144
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:31,500
about the Jazz Pharmaceuticals purchase

145
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,020
the GW when it came to the research and

146
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:37,259
development of epidemics was was that a

147
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:39,599
decade-long or indeed process because if

148
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm not mistaken episiotics is derived

149
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:45,660
from a strain of hemp that has a high

150
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:50,160
potency of CBD is that correct yeah I

151
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:51,740
mean epidiolex is a purified

152
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,300
um cannabi dial

153
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:56,900
drug

154
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:59,340
so it's THC free

155
00:06:56,899 --> 00:07:02,638
this is important to note because many

156
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:04,500
people might combine THC CBD cannabis or

157
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,918
mix everything together though so this

158
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,660
is really pure kind of cannabidial

159
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:12,839
um

160
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:13,800
grown in in the UK grown in the in the

161
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:16,439
UK

162
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:19,199
um purified in the UK and manufactured

163
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:21,839
in in the UK so uh that's true exactly

164
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,419
it's a has been the second drug out of

165
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:27,299
the GW research the first one

166
00:07:24,418 --> 00:07:31,198
um has been sativax a mixture of 50 50

167
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:35,160
mixture of THC and CBD cannabi dial for

168
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:37,259
the treatment of specific symptoms in um

169
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,419
in Ms

170
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:41,460
and when it comes to excuse me the

171
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:43,139
future obviously the Blends and

172
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:45,659
formulations of getting the rare

173
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:47,699
carnabinoids and terpenes and having

174
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,319
perfect Blends and creating products at

175
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:51,660
it that is is the objective in the

176
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:53,340
future do you see the biosynthetic

177
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,259
companies playing a big part in that

178
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:57,538
role because obviously with plant matter

179
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:58,919
you can't isolate as a specific amount

180
00:07:57,538 --> 00:08:01,259
of the cannabinoids that it's going to

181
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:04,620
have to be criticized or fermented in

182
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:08,340
some way in a bioreactor you you're

183
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:12,360
tipping on on a critical topic maybe for

184
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:14,939
for Paving the path in the future for

185
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:18,720
um cannabis industry

186
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:21,620
um I'm sure that there is much more to

187
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:27,900
to investigate and research and find

188
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:30,780
into the the various kinds of uh noise

189
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:33,120
and

190
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:36,418
indeed the quicker you are you to

191
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,759
isolate different molecules the quicker

192
00:08:36,418 --> 00:08:41,519
you can dive a bit deeper into the

193
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:44,819
effect of these different molecules and

194
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:47,819
for the sake of of patients in many

195
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:50,879
other diseases to come

196
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,680
yes very true very true so last step I'm

197
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:54,419
going to jump onto Before I Let You Go I

198
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:57,299
know you're very busy manners ax Market

199
00:08:54,419 --> 00:08:59,159
has access requirements I noticed on my

200
00:08:57,299 --> 00:09:02,399
research that you guys in Germany have a

201
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:04,079
process called the amnog process can you

202
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,419
maybe give everybody an overview what is

203
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,040
that process and does every country have

204
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:10,159
their own version of that or is it

205
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:13,919
something unique to Germany

206
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:16,259
uh yeah you are you're uh you're closing

207
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:19,500
the German journey of of a drug

208
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:23,519
basically uh in in all countries after

209
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:26,700
after the studies and after the

210
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:30,419
um approval in Europe you need obviously

211
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:33,420
a price in in your Market the process is

212
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:35,579
looking different country by country and

213
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:40,079
in Germany we have the so-called amnoc

214
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:41,639
process uh which is which takes roughly

215
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,700
one year

216
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:47,039
and it's a it's a two-step process if

217
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:50,700
you like and it starts

218
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:54,240
um with a with a new dossier you have to

219
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:57,360
prepare based on your data and you

220
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,039
submit this dossier to the federal Joint

221
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,639
Committee

222
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:04,980
and they give you an early benefit

223
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:07,439
assessment a benefit assessment that

224
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:10,200
that brings your drug a little bit into

225
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,420
comparison and contacts with existing

226
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:16,320
drugs on the market

227
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:19,439
um not all not only in terms of data but

228
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,440
more so also in terms of price

229
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,600
so and based on this on this assessment

230
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,339
based on the dossier that you have

231
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,440
prepared

232
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:31,380
um you get you get one of

233
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,640
um a five scale

234
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:34,439
um benefit

235
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:36,958
and with this with this benefit

236
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,040
assessment you step into into the second

237
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:41,759
phase

238
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:44,039
in the second phase uh is a discussion

239
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:46,139
and a negotiation with the with the sick

240
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:50,759
funds in Germany

241
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:52,980
and uh depending on the on the scale you

242
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:54,480
get on the on the rating you get

243
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:59,100
um you have

244
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:02,459
um the chance to discuss and negotiate a

245
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:04,440
price that is finally reimbursed then in

246
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:06,719
the market and with this you have not

247
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:10,260
only an approved drug

248
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:13,500
um but also a reimbursed price to make

249
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:15,360
the the product available in the market

250
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:20,039
it is important to note in Germany that

251
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:22,200
still an exception in in Germany uh the

252
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:25,139
the day the day one after after the

253
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:27,540
approval you can you can bring this drug

254
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:29,939
to patients you can bring this drug on

255
00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:31,679
on the market however the price is

256
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,060
negotiated afterwards and then you get

257
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:35,539
the full reimbursement

258
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:39,179
and that's the the third important step

259
00:11:35,539 --> 00:11:40,199
uh to be mentioned and to be kept in

260
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:42,359
mind

261
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,459
very interesting and to your knowledge

262
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,039
does every country around the world have

263
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:49,259
their own process like the amnog process

264
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,699
that you have in Germany yes absolutely

265
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:54,480
absolutely

266
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:55,740
um UK has the famous uh nice nice

267
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,740
process

268
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:03,000
uh France has a different one and Italy

269
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:07,440
comes again different uh so these are

270
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,778
many different kinds of setting the

271
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,160
reimburse price in depending on the

272
00:12:09,778 --> 00:12:13,799
country

273
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:15,838
very good but it's been great talking to

274
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:17,939
you one question before I let you go in

275
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:22,940
terms of the German recreational Market

276
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:25,320
from a scale of one to ten confidence

277
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:28,079
that the government are going to be able

278
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,820
to actually bring a recreational Market

279
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:31,559
to fruition

280
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,560
okay

281
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:33,559
um

282
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:42,240
I I go I go I go on five

283
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:44,939
giving me a bit space uh up and having a

284
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,278
bit space down I think devil is in the

285
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,839
detail here the willingness is there to

286
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:50,879
do that

287
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:53,279
um I think here really uh the the

288
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:55,919
question comes about the source of

289
00:12:53,278 --> 00:13:00,120
delivery the quality

290
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:03,958
um and in the day in in the end uh how

291
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:07,139
strongly they want to keep an eye on on

292
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:10,679
quality batch to batch consistency and

293
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:13,860
we discussed it earlier on data

294
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:16,379
yeah yeah very true it's it seems to be

295
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,579
a lot of hurdles ahead and for uh for

296
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:19,320
the good at the European industry

297
00:13:17,578 --> 00:13:21,838
hopefully Germany can be the leading way

298
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,120
but we saw a Czech Republic bring in a

299
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,519
set of rules there the other day so I

300
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,139
think uh how blue we've got a an

301
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:29,519
interesting industry ahead for the next

302
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:31,560
five to ten years

303
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,179
absolutely

304
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:34,379
it's been amazing talking to you lots

305
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:36,059
thank you very much hopefully we get to

306
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:37,559
chat again in the near future and we can

307
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:39,179
get an update from everything that

308
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:40,619
you're up to but for now thank you very

309
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:42,620
much guys for watching and we'll see on

310
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:46,110
