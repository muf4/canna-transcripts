20
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:50,279
little brief for um maybe 30 seconds 60

21
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:52,378
seconds of how you ended up at origin

22
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,739
nature and your your history in the

23
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:58,378
industry absolutely so I have over 17

24
00:00:55,738 --> 00:01:01,738
years of cannabis experience I did start

25
00:00:58,378 --> 00:01:03,780
in Europe uh France Holland Belgium and

26
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:05,219
then I came back to Canada of course the

27
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,879
laws in Canada allowed for medical

28
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:10,739
license I quickly help people go that

29
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,239
had a medical situation basically

30
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:15,239
acquire their license and grew their own

31
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:17,459
medicine from there I evolved to Aurora

32
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:19,859
cannabis that was strictly medical at

33
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:21,298
that time we did the first JCP GMP

34
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:25,079
conversions and some of the first

35
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:26,820
cannabis to Germany Italy and so on from

36
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:30,000
there I moved on to title Health

37
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:33,719
Solution where we had more of a medical

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,118
Focus towards Veterans as well as having

39
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:38,459
a veterinarian on the board so we were

40
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:40,680
very inclined towards that we moved on

41
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:42,359
to topical and gummies language required

42
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,579
a lot less biomass my passion is

43
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:46,739
cultivation so at that point I joined

44
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:50,639
the origin nature team which is you know

45
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:52,798
my uh the the one I I really love it was

46
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,140
really uh a shot to the heart when I saw

47
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,399
that team and that origin nature it's

48
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,899
really a team of passionate people

49
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,560
everybody loves canvas everybody

50
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:03,780
understands cannabis and that's why I

51
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,040
think that's the secret of doing it well

52
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,718
is actually being passionate about

53
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,219
cannabis at all the levels in the

54
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:09,840
company

55
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:11,520
thank you very much it's a wealth of

56
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,200
information you seem to possess I'm

57
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,640
going to jump straight on to the top uh

58
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:17,219
first topic I want to talk about and

59
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:19,559
it's basically you can crowned Canada's

60
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:21,359
top grower there's a number of obviously

61
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,860
different factors that one needs to take

62
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,200
in consideration when you're judging

63
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:28,020
something like this sustainability

64
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:30,899
Innovation profitability how hard is it

65
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,700
to keep all of these metrics at the

66
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,860
Opera Echelon so your business is

67
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:36,780
thriving because surely one or two of

68
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,120
those being out of place would uh would

69
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,219
negate a company fitting into the the

70
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,219
spectrum that you guys are put into

71
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:46,859
oh absolutely so it was really the

72
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:48,719
complete puzzle that was lucky enough so

73
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,640
first off Canada top growth for me is a

74
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,019
team award it's not an individual award

75
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,359
this really thanks to the entire team

76
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:57,319
that we got it and really what set us

77
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:00,120
apart was our operational excellence

78
00:02:57,318 --> 00:03:01,619
understanding the workflow from seed to

79
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,239
cell you know growing the campus during

80
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,560
the campus processing the campus

81
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:06,840
packaging it getting it to stores

82
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,659
getting into medical clients and other

83
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,759
retailers and that's where we were

84
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:13,199
awarded we simply so which what you need

85
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,658
to understand with cannabis and the

86
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,339
entire workflow is cannabis is one of

87
00:03:15,658 --> 00:03:18,959
the plants that reacts and adapts the

88
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,180
most to its environment

89
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,098
so getting consistency and getting a

90
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,780
consistent product is extremely hard

91
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:27,060
because when you're growing outdoor when

92
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,680
you're growing indoor anything like a

93
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,300
piece of equipment failing or

94
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,519
fluctuation in the temperature and the

95
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,439
humidity in the irrigation will be

96
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:37,080
standardize your entire crop and your

97
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:39,000
result so being able to cultivate rooms

98
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,360
that put out a product that standardized

99
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,539
time and time again is what got us that

100
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:48,360
award and that award came to Simply

101
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:51,179
outworking everyone in the sense that we

102
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:54,120
do our checks every day we rely on one

103
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:56,459
another we work strongly with the team

104
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,759
at origin nature we have four core value

105
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:01,799
which is family Street Smart fashion and

106
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:04,560
social Consciousness everything we do

107
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:07,140
how we promote how we hire revolves

108
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,878
around this we also Implement a system

109
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:11,339
where we get the information from the

110
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:13,259
bottom and not from the top down so we

111
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,120
strongly believe that the experts in the

112
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:17,159
field are the one actually doing the

113
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,379
work so we do have meetings every week

114
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,780
where everybody has to be open and

115
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:23,579
honest and we're here to make things

116
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:25,799
better everybody can have a good idea

117
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:28,198
everybody can participate we're not here

118
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,879
to attack anyone we're here to call out

119
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:32,460
the problems and find Solutions together

120
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:34,139
and that's what made us that strong is

121
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:36,239
that everybody is passionate everybody

122
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:38,280
is involved everybody's understand the

123
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,160
process and we've been refining that

124
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:43,319
process to make it as efficient and ask

125
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,720
assistant as possible and that comes

126
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:48,000
with a true understanding of cannabis

127
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:51,419
also at the consumption level if you

128
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,800
only treat cannabis as a new good like

129
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:55,139
any other good that you would just

130
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:59,220
package and sell and expect people to

131
00:04:55,139 --> 00:05:01,439
buy it will not work cannabis is I would

132
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,060
say the illegal culture that is the

133
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:06,240
strongest and the most developed in the

134
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:09,180
world since easily the 1970s you cannot

135
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,319
take consumers or idiots you cannot tell

136
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,900
them who they're supposed to be

137
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:15,839
consuming so we took the time to listen

138
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:18,839
to the consumers and basically create a

139
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:21,119
product that they requested and then was

140
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:22,918
able to deliver it consistently time and

141
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,079
time again and that's where we got

142
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:27,659
awarded Canada Brewer we don't grow

143
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:29,519
better cannabis than other people we

144
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,919
grow the right cannabis at the right

145
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:33,299
quality and then because of our workflow

146
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:35,339
we're able to sell it that the rice

147
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,680
Price Right Price Point it's very

148
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:39,899
important to understand there is no bad

149
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,240
cannabis there's only badly priced

150
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:44,399
cabinets

151
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,478
very interesting point one for a very

152
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:50,758
interesting point and so when it goes to

153
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:53,459
picking a team let's say to to start a

154
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:54,900
cultivation operation what are the two

155
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:56,038
things like let's say if you're opening

156
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:58,258
up a restaurant it's probably going to

157
00:05:56,038 --> 00:05:59,399
be the chef and the the maitre d what

158
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:01,139
are they like maybe two biggest

159
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:03,299
positions that you think need to be

160
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:05,699
filled in a top tier cultivation

161
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:08,699
facility

162
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:10,800
um so I would say there's more than two

163
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:13,379
because that's the thing the canvas

164
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,180
facility is a complete machinery and if

165
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:18,600
one of the step doesn't work nothing

166
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:20,939
works your QA quality insurance person

167
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,580
that is responsible for everything

168
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:26,459
that's standard operating procedure is

169
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:28,978
extremely important we are dealing with

170
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:31,258
pharmaceutical grade production levels

171
00:06:28,978 --> 00:06:33,779
for a product that people are going to

172
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:37,500
be smoking or ingesting their safety is

173
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:40,258
at risk now this is a new industry if

174
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:43,319
you have the wrong QA because a QA can

175
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:45,960
be legally responsible for what happens

176
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:47,639
and you need to have a QA that's swollen

177
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:50,279
to try to make things work for the

178
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:53,460
company and not simply blatantly protect

179
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:55,258
themselves at the small little

180
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:56,638
risk factor that could come along

181
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:59,819
because they do not fully understand

182
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,620
cannabis a q a wrong qap can cost you

183
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:04,800
millions of dollars and block your

184
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:06,120
entire facility so the qap is key you

185
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,879
need the right QEP that's going to

186
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,560
understand cannabis and they don't need

187
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,600
to know cannabis but they need to be

188
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,379
willing to understand cannabis and make

189
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:18,060
that step your master grower and not in

190
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:21,719
the part that

191
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:24,379
he's a legendary grower often good

192
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,819
basement grower do terrible transition

193
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:29,279
to the legal Market

194
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:32,160
because you need to realize that we are

195
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:35,038
we're not a cannabis company we're a cpg

196
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,580
company a consumer package good company

197
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:39,899
right so

198
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:41,758
understanding the workflow understanding

199
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:44,698
the regulation having someone that's

200
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,800
willing to read the rule book and then

201
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:49,319
play with that rule book and play with

202
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,439
the rules to get the best out of it is

203
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:54,240
the best if you get a a a grower that

204
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:56,399
does incredible product in his basement

205
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,860
but doesn't understand cost of

206
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:00,179
production operational workflow you're

207
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,098
going to end up with techniques that

208
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:05,879
don't make sense that require way too

209
00:08:02,098 --> 00:08:08,038
much Personnel to achieve and at the end

210
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:09,959
of the day in cannabis your cost of

211
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:11,939
production the biggest cost is the

212
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:13,799
salaries the more you have people the

213
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:15,538
higher you produce the higher you need

214
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,120
to sell your product well your product

215
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:20,219
might be good if you're selling it at 25

216
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,620
bucks per tree and a half if you're

217
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:25,680
selling it at 45 it's suddenly not as

218
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:28,259
good so there's that fine balance but

219
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,939
you are dealing with a lot more

220
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:31,919
Equipment Technology so when you find

221
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:34,259
someone that's truly passionate willing

222
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:37,019
to learn understand how to do proper

223
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:38,939
tests without Jitter putting in Jeopardy

224
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:40,918
the entire facility like if you're

225
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,300
running new nutrients you don't run that

226
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:44,338
in your big commercial room that's

227
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:46,439
supposed to be selling next week you're

228
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:49,860
going to have test rooms or so on so the

229
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:52,560
master group The qap the VP of operation

230
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,539
is extremely important because once the

231
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:56,759
growing is done and we process the

232
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:59,819
product it's trim while it still need to

233
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:01,620
be packaged in a timely manner with the

234
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,720
right environmental condition as to not

235
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:06,179
damage the product during that step and

236
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:08,339
then dispatch to the retailers so it's

237
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:10,620
sold fresh you don't want to sell four

238
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:12,860
or six months old cannabis you want to

239
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:15,659
sell maximum you know

240
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:17,039
five to eight weeks old cannabis because

241
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:17,879
you want a little bit of curing to

242
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:19,980
ensure that there's been the

243
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:21,539
transformation from let's say the

244
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,278
chlorophyll to its gaseous form so it

245
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:24,599
doesn't taste and smell like hay so

246
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:25,919
there is a certain time but you don't

247
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,200
really want to go over that because

248
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:31,259
after it's cannabis degradation and it's

249
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:33,240
just it's a nerve it's not made to be

250
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:36,120
consumed when it's old right so the

251
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,700
workflow that comes after the entire

252
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,980
cannabis growing and processing is just

253
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:43,200
as important because if we're not

254
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,759
selling the product my dry rooms are

255
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,700
filled and my trim rooms are filled if

256
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:50,939
that's filled I can't Harvest Right

257
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:53,278
so if we're not selling we can't grow

258
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,620
and everything is linked together so

259
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:59,519
those three positions as well as the CEO

260
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:02,100
the CEO if he doesn't care about

261
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,899
cannabis and he's only treating this as

262
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:07,200
another business venture and it's just

263
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:09,958
like any other cpg that's probably a big

264
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,600
problem cannabis is not like any other

265
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:14,639
cpg and the CEO and the leadership team

266
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,339
needs to understand that and needs to

267
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:19,500
respect the very very strong culture and

268
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:21,120
knowledge base that exists in every

269
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,360
single country in the world regarding

270
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:27,539
cannabis so when those four position

271
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,399
align and truly understand the workflow

272
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:31,860
and the rule book that are given by

273
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:34,259
government on how to grow cannabis

274
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,639
then that's how you will perform

275
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:38,278
amazing

276
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:40,439
incredible insights into uh how a real

277
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:42,299
operation is to run I'm going to jump on

278
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,760
the next topic I want to talk about you

279
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:46,620
guys are based in Quebec and you hear a

280
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:49,559
lot of noise over in Europe about uh

281
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:52,560
craft Growers taking market share from

282
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:54,239
the larger msos is this the case in the

283
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:56,399
Canadian market and what's like the

284
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,379
Quebec cultivation for the overview

285
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,778
looked like for you guys

286
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:03,299
um well I would say absolutely in Canada

287
00:11:00,778 --> 00:11:06,179
we are considered craft grower we are

288
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:08,519
craft Growers uh more you know we only

289
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:10,319
produce about eight to nine tons per

290
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:13,679
year so this is a smaller size facility

291
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:16,320
for Canada and yes it's absolutely

292
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:18,299
happening so what we're seeing is I mean

293
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,360
a lot of big companies that had a lot of

294
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:23,219
money early on but you see the Opera

295
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,200
operational issues that I've been pretty

296
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,600
much listing since the beginning of the

297
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,360
podcast and that's where there's been a

298
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,278
big disconnection now you need to

299
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,100
understand the history of Quebec in

300
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:36,778
Canada to understand why those microbes

301
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:39,480
and those crap Growers are now taking

302
00:11:36,778 --> 00:11:43,679
the business share right we have medical

303
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:46,139
license since 2001 allowing us to grow x

304
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:47,578
amount of plants electricity is very

305
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:50,939
cheap here we pay three cents per

306
00:11:47,578 --> 00:11:52,799
kilowatt hour and there's a lot less on

307
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:55,019
the south of us there was the entire

308
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:57,539
United States looking for products so

309
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:59,459
historically speaking on the west coast

310
00:11:57,539 --> 00:12:01,379
I like to say what happened is there was

311
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:03,059
a consumption expertise that was part

312
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:04,919
because everybody could throw seeds and

313
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:06,958
grow cannabis plants in their backyard

314
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:09,719
because the climate was very nice and

315
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:12,479
they really understood more you know how

316
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,500
to be sommeliers versus on the East

317
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,800
Coast

318
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:18,539
we were always extremely operational

319
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:20,338
people were doing it for the money

320
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:22,199
people were doing it for mass production

321
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:24,000
we were the only supplier for all of

322
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,040
East Canada and all of the east of the

323
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,958
United States when I say we I don't say

324
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:30,299
me I mean quebecers that were in the

325
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:32,699
black market at that moment and that's

326
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:35,278
where an expertise of how to produce

327
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:37,680
very efficiently with minimum costs and

328
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:39,539
very good technique was born and that's

329
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:42,599
where you're seeing very strong LPS

330
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:44,519
licensed producer come out of Quebec and

331
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,220
those smaller ones basically when

332
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:49,560
legalization happened all eyes were on

333
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,720
Canada right so we started with a very

334
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:54,059
restrictive legalization because we

335
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:57,180
needed to ensure safety of consumers and

336
00:12:54,059 --> 00:13:00,419
then we're alleviating regulation as we

337
00:12:57,179 --> 00:13:02,278
go right so as those regulations are

338
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:03,899
alleviated you need less Capital to

339
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:06,179
enter the Cannabis industry and that's

340
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:09,539
where you see the smaller player that

341
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:11,399
have rooted Legacy experience come in

342
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:14,458
and really put out an amazing product

343
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:16,139
that's a very good price segments that

344
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:18,479
allow the consumers to move to those

345
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:20,039
products and truly appreciate them and

346
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,399
that's where the market shares are

347
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:25,259
moving away from mass production where

348
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:27,659
quality is not necessarily understood or

349
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:30,120
controlled and the price point that

350
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:32,338
doesn't necessarily make sense and you

351
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,440
know when we process canvas we do

352
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:36,839
everything by hand every single step we

353
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:39,360
Harvest by hand we bug by hand trim by

354
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:41,100
hand package by hand every single one of

355
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,959
those steps is a quality control step

356
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,940
for us we ensure that the product that

357
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,619
goes out is going to be up to our

358
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:49,320
standard when you're dealing with mass

359
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:51,060
production it's all automatize uh big

360
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,760
machines everything gets destroyed the

361
00:13:51,059 --> 00:13:56,099
product gets damaged dried out so on and

362
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:58,078
that's where the consumers are not

363
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,759
idiots they understand cannabis they're

364
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:01,859
knowledgeable cannabis and they're

365
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:03,720
simply switching over to the better

366
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:06,539
product at the right price

367
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,339
amazing Before I Let You Go I'd be

368
00:14:06,539 --> 00:14:09,719
remiss to ask what's the what's your

369
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:11,639
favorite strain or your favorite

370
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,079
genetics or favorite flavor that you've

371
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:15,539
ever had

372
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:16,939
in your time

373
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:20,219
um honestly

374
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:23,100
I have so many it depends on the time of

375
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:25,019
the day I'm a big hash smoker I I truly

376
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,700
enjoy hash

377
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:28,620
um I've had some amazing hash from some

378
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:32,399
good hashmasters but as far as train

379
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:34,078
goes I'm more old school I I don't like

380
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,000
cannabis that has extremely strong

381
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:38,879
potency right the race to the highest

382
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,559
THC in my opinion is just promoting drug

383
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:44,278
abuse you shouldn't be looking for 30

384
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:47,338
THC I enjoy smoking also but the

385
00:14:44,278 --> 00:14:50,278
original Amnesia core cut or the Amnesia

386
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:52,740
Super Silver Haze Fino or The Exodus

387
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:56,100
cheese that came out of the UK are

388
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:57,839
strains that I absolutely love and if

389
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,180
anybody listening to that podcast still

390
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,760
has the Exodus cheese cut I would love

391
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:04,379
to get it I would be very happy but yeah

392
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:06,480
I love the old school streams with the

393
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:09,059
right third profile that are enjoyable

394
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:12,060
to smoke you I don't like to I'm not

395
00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:14,338
chasing to be super high I chase that

396
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:16,679
enter as experience with the terpene and

397
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:19,440
really appreciating the moment when I'm

398
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:21,120
consuming it rather to see it you know

399
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,959
when I'm smoking 30 for me that's like

400
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,399
pounding Shooters of vodka right well I

401
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:28,078
prefer a fine wine

402
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,759
yeah same over here you've got a lot of

403
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:31,500
Nature and outdoor activity over here

404
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:34,379
that I think a lot of cannabis consumers

405
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:36,299
here prefer a lighter uh heavier than

406
00:15:34,379 --> 00:15:38,039
heavier THC quantity than something that

407
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:39,899
could be used during a daily basis while

408
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:41,939
I would enjoying activities with their

409
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:42,958
friends I could talk to you all day mate

410
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,699
I think you've got a wealth of

411
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,439
information we'll have to get part two

412
00:15:44,698 --> 00:15:48,539
