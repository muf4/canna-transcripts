point yeah absolutely um I uh I I don't

feel like people follow me a lot so it's

19
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:44,839
always weird and humbling to hear that

20
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:46,878
but thank you I appreciate it um

21
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,120
freelance cannabis journalist I've been

22
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:52,839
working in the space for about seven

23
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:54,640
years now um I do uh articles for place

24
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,120
like High Times Rolling Stone Business

25
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,280
Insider benzinga bunch of other

26
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:02,839
Publications um some place out there uh

27
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,560
I do copywriting for various cannabis uh

28
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,200
companies as well um you know that pays

29
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,000
the bills so I can keep in the news

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,519
media world and it's a a precarious

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,079
balance but it's been a fun one over the

32
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:15,679
last few years do a lot of blogging web

33
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:18,560
copy the sort of the SEO backend sort of

34
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,920
stuff uh on that side of things and uh

35
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,240
yeah I got into the space uh about seven

36
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,560
years ago after I got laid off from a

37
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:25,959
freelance job I or from a full-time job

38
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,920
I should say I was looking to go

39
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:31,359
freelance but I really wasn't ready for

40
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,960
it when I got laid off in January 17 and

41
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:34,799
it took me a couple months to try to

42
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,319
figure out what Market I wanted to go

43
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,360
into and I was almost actually going

44
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:41,078
back to fulltime um because I was not

45
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:42,799
sure where I wanted to go and I was

46
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:44,519
about to smoke a bowl one night I saw an

47
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,840
interview with Dave R of the Foo

48
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:48,718
Fighters and he basically said you know

49
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,359
find someone who will pay you for the

50
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:52,199
job that you love doing that you're not

51
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:53,599
getting paid for at the moment and uh

52
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,039
that's kind of what I took a shot at and

53
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:59,478
I used some of my startup uh industry

54
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:01,000
work to push my sales experience and

55
00:01:59,478 --> 00:02:02,239
kind of highlight one or two articles

56
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,280
that I've written for back in the day

57
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:05,438
about cannabis and kind of took off from

58
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,879
there and I've just been really

59
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:10,359
fortunate to kind of ride the wave and

60
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:11,878
be adaptable along the way and leave me

61
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,720
here and you know now I'm doing a little

62
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:15,359
bit more on YouTube in the media side

63
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:17,000
because I'm kind of seeing the Tea

64
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,760
Leaves of people not wanting to read as

65
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,400
much news and you know just trying to

66
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:22,560
get accessible and reach out to people

67
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,280
so just staying adaptable and you know

68
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,959
keeping up in the space and I've written

69
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,719
a few books too but those you know those

70
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:29,039
are just other things so yeah doing a

71
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:30,959
bunch of stuff I'm just trying to stay

72
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:33,639
as flexible this taable in this wide

73
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,400
world of weed yeah how you distribute

74
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:37,279
the content seems to be a juggling act

75
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,000
over the last couple of years of what

76
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,280
platform what size content how long a

77
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,759
multitude of

78
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,439
variables yeah I give C I give credit to

79
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:48,598
anyone who can actually break through on

80
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:50,680
that I'm trying myself at this point and

81
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:53,238
I'm getting you know maybe about 40 50

82
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,200
views on a YouTube video and a couple

83
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:57,239
subscribers here and there and that

84
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,598
feels like good Gams but you know seeing

85
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:00,759
these people that go viral and get the

86
00:02:58,598 --> 00:03:02,639
news out there I've it's hard because I

87
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:05,039
don't want to ever prioritize getting

88
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:06,559
that big news out there but it is pretty

89
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,679
important as well so it's kind of you

90
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,759
know you have to look at it from like

91
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,599
some part of the the process but at the

92
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:13,919
same time you have to just take the news

93
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:17,039
and approach it and hopefully people

94
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:18,559
will take notice yeah I couldn't agree

95
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,878
with you more for anybody who's not

96
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,519
following uh Andrew on Twitter already

97
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:23,919
canor riter the canor riter is this

98
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:25,760
handle I highly recommend checking them

99
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:27,518
out it seems to me at the moment the

100
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,359
content creators in cannabis who seem to

101
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,158
be getting the pop are as you said

102
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,360
either investigative journalists who are

103
00:03:31,158 --> 00:03:34,639
working in the industry and they're

104
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,200
breaking news or they're a personality

105
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:39,000
or trying to turn themselves into a

106
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:41,119
brand with consumer friendly content

107
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,479
should I say when you're covering the

108
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,000
business side of

109
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:46,759
things it seems to me that like a top

110
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,719
junk of the industry are already keeping

111
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:52,039
up to date with everything so there's

112
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:53,719
not really as big a a viewing pool when

113
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:56,359
you're approaching legalization as to

114
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:58,840
opposed to when full legalization comes

115
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,319
I think there's a you're kind of stuck

116
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,000
between a rock and a heart place over

117
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:04,438
the coming years until the industry is

118
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,400
fully professional and fully matured and

119
00:04:04,438 --> 00:04:07,680
there's an exact consumer base to Target

120
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,200
with exact type of

121
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,879
content yeah absolutely you know I think

122
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:13,078
that you know you pretty much you nailed

123
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:14,798
it on the head with the investigative

124
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:16,759
journalists and the personality side of

125
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,040
things um you know you kind of have to

126
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:20,759
go one way or another and I personally

127
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,079
you know I think there's a room for both

128
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:23,800
sides as long as it's good quality

129
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,560
journalistic work the problem is with

130
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,280
the personality sides I've noticed is

131
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,759
there's a lack of editorial oversight

132
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:30,758
and not many of them have gone to a

133
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:32,400
journalism know education whether it be

134
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:35,360
an actual journalism degree or just even

135
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:37,439
some courses on journalism um there it's

136
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,038
kind of I don't know from my side I've

137
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:40,600
you know I was a creative writing degree

138
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:42,079
I wasn't a journalist but I worked in

139
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,400
the journalism space and kind of had

140
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:45,599
those understandings when I came into it

141
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,758
and there are some people that are

142
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,039
lacking on you know the quality and the

143
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,639
research that I did see on the

144
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:52,879
investigative side but on the converse

145
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:54,360
you know the investigative side is

146
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:56,000
really tough uh there's a lot of people

147
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,280
like you said covering the same stuff

148
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,560
there a lot of people covering the same

149
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:01,559
news and um unless you're catching

150
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,199
breaks and Scoops you know it's you're

151
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,800
not really doing much I feel like other

152
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,400
than just regurgitating the news out

153
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,840
there so that was kind of where I found

154
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:10,839
myself conflicted on it and um I'm just

155
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:12,719
not the passion of being a Breaking News

156
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:14,319
writer I would much rather sit down and

157
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,520
do a profile and make sure I got my

158
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:17,918
sources and you know kudos to anyone who

159
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:19,519
can do the breaking news it's just not

160
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:22,159
my thing and that's why I'm kind of

161
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:24,439
finding myself like into the personality

162
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,919
side I'm not so much try I've been

163
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:27,800
saying for months now I'm not trying to

164
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:29,639
be an influencer but I'm 100% using the

165
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,639
Playbook on how to be an influencer to

166
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:33,478
try and get news out there and make it

167
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:35,240
accessible to like you said those folks

168
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:36,560
that have that top level information you

169
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,120
know they're on top of the news but

170
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,959
there's so many people that aren't on

171
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,800
top of the news and whether they're

172
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:43,918
industry folks or just you know casual

173
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,639
consumers and I'm hoping that's kind of

174
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:48,038
where I'm looking at to kind of find my

175
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:49,400
Niche now at this point and we'll see if

176
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:50,719
it works and in a few months I could be

177
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:52,839
entirely wrong and this could all be out

178
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,479
of date I don't know but um you know

179
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:57,239
yeah the the world of news is growing um

180
00:05:55,478 --> 00:05:58,758
even though there isn't a ton to cover

181
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,319
so you know you really got to find your

182
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:02,720
space in it because I feel like you know

183
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,280
you if you're telling the news even then

184
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,000
you still got to be unique because

185
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:07,638
otherwise why would they not go to the

186
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,478
best investigative journalists out there

187
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:11,038
so either be the best or find a nich in

188
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:13,038
there where you are the best and

189
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:15,879
actually start educating

190
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:18,199
people yeah very good when it comes to

191
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:20,159
cannabis media content we I think we all

192
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:22,400
grew up at High Times kind of being the

193
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,599
Pinnacle of the media landscape in

194
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:27,719
cannabis but I think everybody agreed

195
00:06:24,598 --> 00:06:30,839
that they've Fallen a far away way from

196
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:34,039
their Heyday and their early days who is

197
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:36,359
the top cannabis media content platform

198
00:06:34,038 --> 00:06:39,079
in America as far as you're

199
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:41,560
concerned well I will say I do freelance

200
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:43,719
for high time so I'm not GNA uh throw

201
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,918
some daggers on them just much but I do

202
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,880
understand the fit the blowback they've

203
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:48,399
gotten and I mean you know changes in

204
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:50,399
leadership over time definitely give

205
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:52,519
people some opinions on it and uh you

206
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:55,239
know I've seen it in the comments and I

207
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:57,240
I totally understand it um I do I would

208
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,199
push a little bit back and say it's a

209
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,680
lot more about the individuals that are

210
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,199
right writing it you know whether it be

211
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,240
High Times whether it be other

212
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:05,598
Publications you really got to make sure

213
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,120
most of these Publications it's the

214
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:09,199
individual who's writing it so really

215
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,120
follow the by line and you know make

216
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,720
sure it's people either of the culture

217
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,120
or of a respectable journalism

218
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,720
background or you know really who's done

219
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,598
their research um so really watch the by

220
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,240
lines but to that point to give you some

221
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:22,839
actual uh guidelines and you know some

222
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,519
my favorites it really depends on what

223
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:26,279
you're looking for if you're looking for

224
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:28,758
American politics coverage marijuana

225
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:31,159
moment is my favorite no doubt I think

226
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:32,800
Tom angel K Jager Ben Adin the rest of

227

231
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:44,318
amazing work um there's Jeremy Jeremy

232
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:46,719

233
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,039

234

235
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:53,478
and he is a great mix of business and

236
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,959
politics uh and a little bit of culture

237
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:57,359
as well if you're looking for the

238
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:59,158
business side of things um MJ bis daily

239
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,319
marijuana Business Daily is one of the

240
00:07:59,158 --> 00:08:04,199
best as um cannabis business times is

241
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:05,840
also really good um some people will say

242
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:07,400
benzinga I did use to write for them so

243
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:09,239
I don't want the Stelling sour grapes

244
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:10,478
but you know a lot of that is like press

245
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,560
release stuff so if you're trying to

246
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:12,839
keep up with the industry on the press

247
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,639
release side that's really good but if

248
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:16,119
you're looking for more in-depth

249
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,759
business recording and things like that

250
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,720
you might want to steer to the one that

251
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:23,360
I already mentioned um that said you

252
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:25,360
know um High Times I still do read uh I

253
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,598
think herb has some stuff but a lot of

254
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,280
it I think is also just going to YouTube

255
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:32,080
and social media and finding these

256
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:34,120
influencers um the LA times did a a

257
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,320
feature on Friday about this influencer

258
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,759
named mahak who is also working for

259
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,719
normal and doing a bunch of other great

260
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:41,799
stuff in the space and you know she's

261
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,560
not getting she's not a writer but she's

262
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:46,079
getting the news out there so I would

263
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:48,039
say look for the Publications um but you

264
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,160
also can look beyond that and just

265
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:50,639
really find the individuals that are

266
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:53,519
trustworthy and that's a really big

267
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:55,679
thing for me at this point okay very

268
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,720
good I want to move on now to an update

269
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:59,759
on New York it seems to be Ever Changing

270
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,278
landscape as the weeks go up

271
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:03,319
can you maybe give everybody just a

272
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:05,679
quick little overview of in the last

273
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:09,040
couple of weeks what has really changed

274
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:11,838
from the last update we had the court

275
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:13,958
case was brought the card L License were

276
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,720
suspended and now we have a gap in

277
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:17,078
between then and now so maybe if you

278
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,160
could fill everybody up on what's going

279
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:21,278
on yeah absolutely I'm glad you

280
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:22,879
specified which court case because there

281
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:24,919
it could be easily answered what court

282
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:26,679
case because New York is just adding

283
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:29,759
more and more as the days go by it seems

284
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:32,399
like um so yeah the the court case was

285
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:35,039
the injunction it was about 400 or so I

286
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,679
believe licensed retailers um that were

287
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:38,919
in limbo and many were really close to

288
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:40,639
opening up the shop and the injunction

289
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:42,559
was placed I know there was a couple

290
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:44,360
files to trying to get some of those I

291
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:46,679
think it was like a 30 or so to get

292
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:49,320
emergency injunctions to get them in and

293
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:51,519
the case was or the uh judge pushed back

294
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:54,640
on that uh given the you continuing to

295
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,919
block their access um and yeah it was

296
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:57,480
stuck and the court was going to the

297
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:59,439
case was moving on I think they said

298
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,680
probably late September early o October

299
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,079
would be the earliest we would get any

300
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:06,120
sort of decision and I uh the state I

301
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:07,519
guess decided that we're going to fold

302
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,278
on that and finally open up the

303
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:13,278
licensing to everyone and uh yeah we're

304
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:15,519
here now um it's starting October 4th

305
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:18,159
the licenses or the applications can be

306
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,320
officially submitted and everyone can uh

307
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:22,319
submit to put in so you know it does

308
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,399
take a massive blow to the social Equity

309
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,079
Advocates and those hoping to see more

310
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,600
Equitable shops opening um and you know

311
00:10:27,078 --> 00:10:30,679
that's a very fair argument but at the

312
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,240
same time the argument is that New York

313
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:36,159
has failed miserably at opening up shops

314
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:38,079
and people are drowning in business debt

315
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:40,559
and people AR getting access to their

316
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:42,559
cannabis and it's just a whole mess so

317
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:44,638
it's it's a really big nuanced argument

318
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,719
and you know that one seems to now be

319
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,399
settled but there's a Floodgate Of other

320
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,200
ones from advertising to specific local

321
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:54,200
regulations that are now being contested

322
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,600
so I I'm no legal expert but I just from

323
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,920
the history of things we're probably

324
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,120
going to see a lot more coming in the

325
00:10:56,919 --> 00:11:00,799
next couple weeks and months yeah it's

326
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,240
seems to be that everybody was in favor

327
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:04,000
of the card license and I don't think

328
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,399
anybody would disagree with trying to

329
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,360
get that done it seemed like the right

330
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:09,159
thing to do but you then left yourself

331
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,200
with this stretch of time where the

332
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:12,958
cultivators who had product there was a

333
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,440
multitude of businesses that were highly

334
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:16,399
leveraged and either were ruining

335
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,720
product or were going out of business

336
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:22,519
and the delay was affecting them do you

337
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,360
think that this explosion of retail now

338
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:26,679
is going to usher in a new dawn in the

339
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:30,399
New York industry or is that explosion

340
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:32,319
of retail stores still a little bit away

341
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,278
um I mean it really depends on how quick

342
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,000
we can get the applications approved and

343
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:37,720
the roll out from you know what I saw

344
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,278
with some of the card applicant you know

345
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,600
there was a seemingly quick turnaround

346
00:11:40,278 --> 00:11:42,639
you know maybe a couple weeks couple

347
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,480
months and really heard that there were

348
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:45,519
shops close to opening but you know it's

349
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,440
probably going to be a couple month

350
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,200
process um I'm not too certain on how

351
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,519
the roll out is going to be but I do

352
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,879
expect the the proliferation of shops

353
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:57,278
legal license shops to happen within the

354
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:59,078
next six months I think uh New York the

355
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:02,159
governor a lot of people are really

356
00:11:59,078 --> 00:12:03,439
going to try to save their image to be

357
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:05,439
completely honest with you I don't think

358
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,519
it's really about making cannabis right

359
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,279
or any or you know any sort of moral

360
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,600
Endeavor and honestly I think from the

361
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:11,600
lawmaker perspective it probably wasn't

362
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,240
even that way when they were doing it

363
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,839
with social equity for a lot of them

364
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,198
it's just to look good uh the governor

365
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:19,320
is catching a lot of flak finally for

366
00:12:17,198 --> 00:12:21,359
the failed roll out of this so I could

367
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,920
totally see them trying to expedite the

368
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,199
process and make those retail shops open

369
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:26,240
real quick but I wouldn't confidently

370
00:12:25,198 --> 00:12:29,120
say it's going to happen but I can

371
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,720
definitely see that portion for it I the

372
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,360
scale of products obviously the hemp

373
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,680
farmers were allowed to grow first with

374
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,680
cannabis what's the state of the the

375
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:41,039
cultivation season over there is there a

376
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:43,879
huge excess of flour and where the hemp

377
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:46,198
Farmers managed to to do a good job with

378
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:48,799
the first patch or should of real uh

379
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:51,879
adult use commercial grow operators been

380
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:54,479
allowed to get in there first uh so it's

381
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:57,240
you know I'm no expert grower but I am a

382
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,800
pretty regular consumer for the last 18

383
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,959
or so years so from my own perspective

384
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:03,559
perspective the product that pardon me

385
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:06,278
that came out originally wasn't that

386
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:07,518
great a product it was even compared to

387
00:13:06,278 --> 00:13:09,439
the elicit Market where you could buy

388
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,519
your products from it was you know not

389
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,399
really all that vibrant colors the smell

390
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,879
the aroma really wasn't there it wasn't

391
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:16,399
bad but you know for the price

392
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,879
especially with the high tax markup it

393
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,399
just wasn't really of quality um and

394
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:21,838
that was a big push back that came in

395
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,919
the early days of the market around

396
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:27,680
December January of 22 23 when this

397
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:29,439
Market opened um a lot of people I to

398
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,319
met at that time were you know give it

399
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,959
till April the second wave of crops the

400
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,320
second wave of licenses are going to

401
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:36,919
bring better products and you know we're

402
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,360
going to see better pricing and

403
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:40,159
supposedly that has been the case I've

404
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,680
gone to a few licensed dispensaries but

405
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:43,519
to be completely honest I've still stuck

406
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:46,638
with the Legacy market and even some of

407
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,360
the unlicensed shops that I I trust um

408
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,399
for product because to be completely

409
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,320
honest a lot of them have better product

410
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,639
um not a lot of them they're select

411
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,120
shops that have those products so you

412
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,839
know I think the license Market is

413
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,639
getting there and I know from my own

414
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,120
personal opinion more their products and

415
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:03,959
their pric and they are starting to Peak

416
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,919
by interest um so you know I think the

417
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:08,399
initial roll out of the Hem cultivators

418
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:10,479
is argued by a lot of folks and I'll

419
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,879
leave it up to them to say you know if

420
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,720
it was the right or wrong I think New

421
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:15,799
York fumbled the ball in so many ways

422
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,920
with the regulations that it probably is

423
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:20,439
worth scrutinizing this decision but the

424
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:22,479
problem is that New York really you know

425
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:24,600
kind of just they damaged the hemp

426
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,360
Farmers because they didn't open up the

427
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,040
shops they created all these regulatory

428
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,639
hurdles that there was hundreds of

429
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:32,039
thousands of pounds of biomass that

430
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:34,039
never even reached the market so these

431
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:35,879
farmers were just they had a Year's

432
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:38,719
worth of crops they were just sitting in

433
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:40,679
silos basically and just dying so if any

434
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,519
of it hit the market it was months late

435
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:44,359
and it was just you know kind of aged

436
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:45,639
product and a lot of it just never even

437
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,199
reached the market for anyone to even

438
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:52,440
try and Sample and give an opinion of um

439
00:14:48,198 --> 00:14:54,039
during the um the public hearing uh the

440
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,279
public hearing session that went on with

441
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:58,439
the latest ocm uh decision before they

442
00:14:56,278 --> 00:15:00,439
opened up the licensing to everyone tons

443
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,759
of hem farmers were there talking or

444
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,399
tons of hem Farmers as well as other

445
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:04,800
cultivators were talking about the

446
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:07,000
problems in the market you know they now

447
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:08,599
have two seasons of crops that are

448
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,720
sitting there because they can't get in

449
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,199
out um the one farmer um she talked

450
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,639
about having to sell her tractor in

451
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:17,639
January to keep the Farm open and now

452
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:20,799
it's August when they did this window

453
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:23,198
and she had nothing else to sell um some

454
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:24,639
people talked about you know self harm

455
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:27,439
and you know you know really taking

456
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,680
grave outcomes because of this so it's

457
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,160
it's really sad so my my takeaway when I

458
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:33,078
did a recent article on the product

459
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:34,879
quality is yeah you can scrutinize the

460
00:15:33,078 --> 00:15:36,679
start with the hemp Farmers some will

461
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:38,198
say yes some will say no to that but I

462
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:40,078
think really the biggest problem is that

463
00:15:38,198 --> 00:15:42,439
The Regulators once again made massive

464
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:44,559
mistakes over promised the situation and

465
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,880
now I don't know what they can do they

466
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:47,278
got to give money to these people or

467
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:49,000
help them because there's a lot of

468
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:51,000
people that are just I don't know it's

469
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
it's a really ugly

470
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,720
situation yeah it's uh it'll be a Keen

471
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,198
Eye what keeping an eye on everything

472
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,680
that happens over between now and

473
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:00,559
Christmas and hopefully we get a lot of

474
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:02,758
good news for both sides of the coin in

475
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,599
the New York industry H it's been great

476
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:06,440
talking to Andrew hopefully we get to do

477
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:09,519
