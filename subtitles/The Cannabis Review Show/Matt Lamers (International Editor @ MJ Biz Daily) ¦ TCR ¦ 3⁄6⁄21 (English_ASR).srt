following all your articles regularly

13
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,198
you're one of the great sources of

14
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:28,719
information in the industry

15
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,160
and do you want to basically maybe give

17
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,399
you got into the industry and where you

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,759
are

19
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,239
at mjbiz sure yeah just briefly i guess

20
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:38,159
i

21
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:39,519
i've been a journalist for almost 20

22
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:42,159
years um

23
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,559
uh actually i'm canadian but i grew up

24
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,839
uh

25
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:47,439
outside of canada for the a lot of my

26
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,600
adult life and now i moved back to

27
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:52,000
canada about four years ago

28
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,558
uh specifically to take this job to be

29
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,320
the international editor for mj biz

30
00:00:54,558 --> 00:01:02,078
so i live near toronto here

31
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,679
okay amazing and uh how do you think the

32
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,439
industry's grown so quickly in

33
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:06,879
in the time that you've been interest do

34
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,239
you see the media side of things

35
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:09,759
starting to ramp up a little bit more

36
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:12,000
that seems to be the slowest side of the

37
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,439
industry i've seen so far

38
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,799
i think the media side uh grew too fast

39
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:21,519
and speaking in canada anyways the media

40
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,880
uh grew faster than the actual industry

41
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:29,039
in 2018 and 2019 so unfortunately

42
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:32,478
um quite a few cannabis journalists

43
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:35,118
lost uh lost their jobs which is

44
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:36,478
which is really sad right so there were

45
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:37,280
a lot of people reporting on this

46
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:38,959
industry

47
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,040
a few years ago but there's not very

48
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:43,679
many of us left in canada

49
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,720
um the industry needs more reporters

50
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,799
right it needs

51
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,000
it needs more light than ever shine and

52
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,118
it needs

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,478
um a lot of analysis it needs just

54
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:57,438
um rigorous um analysis

55
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:59,200
and that's kind of one thing that uh i

56
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:00,959
might be missing in other countries

57
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,880
in canada we have a bunch of journalists

58
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,000
doing this but i'm not sure how many

59
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:05,759
dedicated

60
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,159
journalists are reporting on the

61
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,680
cannabis industry in europe or

62
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:13,280
in in australia they probably need more

63
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,719
yeah i couldn't agree with you more and

64
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,239
let's hope we see

65
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:17,359
a lot of people take up the button now

66
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,719
over here because you're starting to see

67
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,920
the momentum in europe

68
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,239
i'm going to kick things off with the

69
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,479
first topic of conversation and it's the

70
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,719
fate of the canadian lps

71
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,399
it's been a roller coaster even as of 18

72
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:30,560
hours ago the stock seemed to be sent

73
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,319
soaring by the news from amazon

74
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,318
how do you see the fate of the canadian

75
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:36,639
lps do you see them develop each other

76
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:39,199
until there's just one dominant company

77
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:39,919
or do you see the mergers that have

78
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:42,159
happened

79
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:43,518
recently uh then being able to just

80
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:44,799
compete for a market competition

81
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,319
themselves

82
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,040
well that's a great question um firstly

83
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:51,598
though

84
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,159
i would warn people against tracking

85
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:54,878
this

86
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,359
the stock market and concluding that

87
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:58,318
that's

88
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,840
kind of uh a barometer for the the

89
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:02,238
health of companies

90
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,680
um the stock market and the health of

91
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,920
cannabis companies

92
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,239
are not connected at all and we've seen

93
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:10,079
that in the last five years when

94
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,800
all the cannabis companies in canada

95
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,080
that were publicly traded

96
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,080
sword evaluation

97
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:20,079
even though they had no fundamental

98
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:22,878
reason to do so

99
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,840
so uh i don't follow the stock market

100
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:26,719
very much i

101
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,598
check in i check in on cannabis stocks

102
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:32,479
approximately once a month maybe less

103
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:34,878
i never report on it um it's a it's a

104
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:37,759
distraction it's noise

105
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:38,079
and it's not helpful for businesses or

106
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,199
for

107
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,040
investors because like i said um the

108
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:45,280
fundamentals of the companies

109
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:47,679
are so separated from how they're

110
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,640
actually

111
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,640
performing from the stock market there's

112
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:56,158
no there's no correlation at all

113
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:57,279
so um i i think that you need to really

114
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,719
get to know

115
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,959
um who's on the board of directors

116
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,560
um you need to get to know the ceo and

117
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,920
when i say get to know i don't mean

118
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,640
picking up the phone and calling them

119
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:10,318
and talking to you i mean you know

120
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,318
reading up on his background like has

121
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:15,280
the ceo ever done this before

122
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:16,798
um how what does the board of directors

123
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,759
look like does the board of directors

124
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,599
have people

125
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,799
who have been successful in their

126
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,199
careers

127
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,399
in this industry or an adjacent industry

128
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,160
in the past

129
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:28,399
um and most for most companies the

130
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,360
answer is no like most companies

131
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:32,079
um are led by ceos who have just never

132
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,800
done this before

133
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:36,560
um the boards of directors have people

134
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,879
who have never done this before and

135
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,478
and you see them struggling now but i'll

136
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,800
say there's

137
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:44,478
one thing that that doesn't apply to is

138
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,079
is founders okay so if you're going to

139
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:47,279
found a cannabis company

140
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:48,959
that doesn't mean you don't know what

141
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:51,119
you're doing but at some point the

142
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:54,560
founder has to step aside

143
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,319
for someone who has done that before to

144
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,478
bring the company to the next stage

145
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:00,079
and that's something that almost all the

146
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:01,758
canadian lps failed to do

147
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:03,680
most of the founders stuck around for

148
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,038
years too long so i don't even have to

149
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,800
say the names here we all know who they

150
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:08,000
are right they stuck around too long

151
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,520
and now their companies have lost

152
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,160
billions of dollars that was one of the

153
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:14,478
key mistakes they made

154
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,840
yeah no all i agree one of the voices i

155
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:17,599
love listen to the most in the industry

156
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,599
is a guy called rob mcpherson

157
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,039
i think he's based out of canada as well

158
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,560
and he always makes the point that a lot

159
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:23,599
of these companies are in the consumer

160
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,680
goods business

161
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,039
they're not in the cannabis industry and

162
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,038
stuck in your board or having the

163
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:31,038
expertise of consumer goods

164
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:32,879
uh makes complete sense but when you

165
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:34,719
look at the leadership of the companies

166
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:35,918
there's pretty much little to no people

167
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,039
who have actual

168
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:40,560
experience in these exact industries

169
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:42,319
that they're trying to target

170
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,120
which kind of leads me into this next

171
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,879
topic now leadership in cannabis

172
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,478
give me the top three qualities you

173
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,879
think a ceo

174
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:52,159
for a cannabis company need and it's not

175
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:53,759
the founder now the person that the

176
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,160
founder should be bringing in to run the

177
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,520
ship

178
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,199
what are the top three qualities you

179
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:59,918
think they should have

180
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,720
well first he has to he or she has to be

181
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:03,680
uh

182
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,440
they have to have a vision um so you

183
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,600
can't just come in

184
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:09,680
even if you're an experienced cpg

185
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,479
executive you can't just come in

186
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,280
and run your cannabis company company

187
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:15,359
like you would

188
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:16,719
any other cpg company without any kind

189
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,199
of vision like

190
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,960
what's your goal you know what company

191
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,960
what customers are you looking for

192
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:24,959
are you looking to delight you can't be

193
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:25,359
you can't be looking to delight everyone

194
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,719
and

195
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,400
that's another mistake a lot of

196
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,039
businesses make here in this industry is

197
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:30,799
that

198
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:32,560
they're like oh we want to have we want

199
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,680
to be the market share leader but what

200
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,600
market exactly

201
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,280
you know you can't just want to be the

202
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,560
canadian marketeer leader

203
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:42,879
without specifying which customers

204
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,319
in canada specifically you want to meet

205
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,000
meet demand for because you can't meet

206
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:49,039
demand for everybody if you do

207
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,038
you'll try and lose um

208
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:52,560
so you have to have a vision a very

209
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:54,719
specific vision

210
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,079
um you have to be disciplined i think is

211
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,360
the most important one

212
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:03,439
and that's something we we haven't seen

213
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:05,759
much of uh i say maybe in 2018 to 2020

214
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:07,360
maybe lately we have like some a lot of

215
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,720
ceos now

216
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,960
um they do have the discipline probably

217
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,280
that they needed a couple years ago

218
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:16,000
so rather than pulling the trigger on

219
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:19,359
that 800

220
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,399
million dollar m a um you got to step

221
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,080
back and be like

222
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:23,918
what's this really going to accomplish

223
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:25,758
for my company

224
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:28,000
should i buy should i pay 800 million

225
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,879
dollars for this company that has no

226
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,038
revenue

227
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:36,399
is that really a good idea probably not

228
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:37,839
um i mean the third one i don't know

229
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:39,038
the first two are probably the most

230
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:39,598
important the third one i don't know

231
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:42,399
maybe you

232
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:43,199
need to be a little bit flexible and

233
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:46,638
adaptable

234
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,520
and in how you're planning your business

235
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,280
because

236
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:52,639
if you're just going to bank on on one

237
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:55,679
market

238
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,960
you might you might get burned although

239
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,038
when i say that out loud it doesn't

240
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:59,758
sound that great because what you need

241
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:01,120
to do if you're

242
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,038
if you're an executive is you really

243
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,759
need to focus on where you can actually

244
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:04,959
make money

245
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,598
real money like where are the real

246
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:10,799
markets today uh not the markets that

247
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:10,800
are in your investor deck

248
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,199
so a lot of companies a lot of publicly

249
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:17,038
traded companies will have

250
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,800
a slide in their investor deck that says

251
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:21,120
there's a global opportunity that's

252
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,919
three or four hundred billion dollars

253
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,280
but that's not

254
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:28,318
real right that's not accessible

255
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:29,679
like here not none of that is accessible

256
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,560
to your business so why is it in your

257
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,158
investor deck

258
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,440
so maybe the third the third most

259
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:34,240
important thing is just that you have to

260
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,479
be realistic

261
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,918
and be honest with yourself and your

262
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,000
investors because that

263
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:41,439
300 billion dollar slide in your

264
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,360
investor deck is not

265
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,440
honest with yourself or your investors

266
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,800
it's not real it's fake

267
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,880
i don't even think it should be legal to

268
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:50,240
be honest with you because 99 of that

269
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:51,838
market isn't addressable for the

270
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,480
business so why is it there

271
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,040
why are you even talking about it you

272
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,360
know what i mean

273
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,559
yeah i agree i i completely agree with

274
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,560
you that's one thing in europe we're

275
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,799
lacking there's good financial analysis

276
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:05,119
and reports of the industry over here

277
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:06,399
you get a lot of the the usual the

278
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,759
industry will be worth

279
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:12,240
100 billion by 2024 but realistically

280
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:14,159
like it's not 2024 now we want to know

281
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,159
what it can do now for the investor

282
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:18,079
and for the entrepreneur setting up the

283
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:20,639
company out for the consumer

284
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,519
i'm gonna end with the last topic which

285
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:23,838
is basically

286
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,120
m a's in 2021 do you think this is the

287
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,640
year where we're going to see most of

288
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,360
the m a's or do you think

289
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:29,679
the us having a nationwide industry will

290
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,159
be

291
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:32,799
that year that happens will be the real

292
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,719
year of m

293
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:36,639
a's and what's your thoughts on the hexo

294
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,080
red car deal

295
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:41,919
um just broadly i guess it's in canada

296
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,600
all the lps are talking to each other

297
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:45,838
about m a like everyone's talking to

298
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,240
everyone

299
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,440
but what's slowing it down i guess is

300
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,839
that

301
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,839
um

302
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:56,319
there's not a lot of successful lps

303
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:58,480
right like a lot of them are struggling

304
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,278
there's some successful llps

305
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,000
uh but they're the quiet ones and i

306
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:05,679
think

307
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,720
earlier you asked about traits of

308
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:10,719
a ceo and i would say that

309
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,040
the most successful ceos that i've seen

310
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,560
in canada are the quietest ones

311
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:17,278
um and that's usually uh the guys that

312
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:19,039
are

313
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:22,240
privately owned right the publicly

314
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:24,078
traded c ceos are usually noisy

315
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,278
and they're doing interviews they're on

316
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:27,759
msnbc

317
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:29,039
and they're on bloomberg all the time

318
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:30,958
but

319
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,480
i think that's mostly a distraction for

320
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:36,000
people

321
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,959
um so i think you know get down to

322
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,360
business and just

323
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:40,799
and just run your business rather than

324
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,360
uh trying to

325
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:46,000
talk about your stock so much that was a

326
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:49,278
big distraction for companies for years

327
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,360
so what was your question again and

328
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:52,320
basically do you think that 2021 is

329
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,159
going to be

330
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,320
yeah yeah the m a's or do you think like

331
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:59,278
when the states basically have

332
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,560
statewide access and the big boys and

333
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:01,519
there started gobbling up the

334
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,518
competition

335
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,879
do you see that that year that that

336
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,440
happens is going to blitz

337
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:08,159
the the year that we're having so far

338
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,120
because there's been

339
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,639
you know i don't know it's a really good

340
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,360
question but it's hard to say

341
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:17,519
because it's also dependent on what

342
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:21,278
happens in congress right

343
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:23,120
uh there's like a i guess m a in the u.s

344
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:25,039
is slowly picking up but it's not really

345
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,519
picking up as much as you might

346
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:28,879
expect it should be because and that

347
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,078
makes sense because if you're if you're

348
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:33,200
a ceo of

349
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:35,919
a big american cannabis company

350
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,278
uh investing a lot of money in another

351
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:40,078
business

352
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:42,320
comes with the risk that your investment

353
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:45,039
might be moot

354
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,519
a year from now if depending on how the

355
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:48,078
us

356
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,240
legalizes cannabis and depending on what

357
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:53,199
regulations come into place

358
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,079
so you're kind of taking a a big risk

359
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,079
right now if you're

360
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:58,078
if you're spending a lot of money on mna

361
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:00,958
in the states the business you buy

362
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:01,919
could be useless one or two years from

363
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:04,638
now

364
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,360
um but at the same time maybe you might

365
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,600
be

366
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,120
getting a pretty good deal on that m a

367
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,000
because it might be a lot more expensive

368
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,639
in a couple years when

369
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,159
you know what the regulatory landscape

370
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,159
is going to look like

371
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:18,159
in canada it's a little bit different

372
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:19,039
the regulatory landscape is pretty

373
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:20,559
settled

374
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:22,240
the problem is we don't have a lot of

375
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:26,879
successful lps and

376
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:29,200
competition is so cutthroat um

377
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,320
that a lot of m a just isn't happening

378
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,440
right now

379
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,560
in terms of hexo's deal for reticam or

380
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,480
reedcam

381
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:41,759
um i think that was a great deal because

382
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,920
there weren't there weren't a lot of lps

383
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:45,600
in canada that grew their market share

384
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:46,879
in 2020.

385
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,480
actually i should take that back there

386
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:49,439
were quite a few but they were the

387
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,560
smaller ones

388
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:56,000
but rita can probably

389
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:58,000
one of the few large lps

390
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,320
that expanded its market share and i

391
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,078
think their market share doubled

392
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,079
um i'm going off memory here but i think

393
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:06,559
it was approximately three or four

394
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:09,838
percent to seven or eight percent

395
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:11,838
and that's a pretty significant um

396
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,959
portion of the market it's a successful

397
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:17,440
company

398
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:20,719
um that's probably profitable um

399
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:23,600
that expanded its market share

400
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,720
it has loyal customers it has a good

401
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,680
reputation it's

402
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,639
it was a great acquisition by exo i i

403
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,519
i'll go on

404
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,639
i'll go on and live and say it was

405
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,039
probably the best

406
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,639
acquisition by a canadian lp in the last

407
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:39,360
three or four years

408
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,159
because how many lps can claim to have

409
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,560
bought

410
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:44,639
another lp that was profitable and

411
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:47,278
that's growing market share

412
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,720
uh not very many i not come to mind

413
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:49,600
right now but there might have been a

414
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,278
couple right

415
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,839
so i think that was a great deal was it

416
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:55,600
expensive at almost a billion dollars

417
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,440
um yeah i mean that's it was really

418
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,120
expensive but like i said

419
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,480
the company is growing so i think i

420
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,600
think it's worth it

421
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,240
um the other two deals that sebastian

422
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,480
made

423
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,839
were a little bit rusty so i wonder if

424
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,879
because he also bought

425
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,079
a couple of smaller lps this year and so

426
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:14,559
i wonder if he would have pulled the

427
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:18,479
trigger on those two smaller mmas

428
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:21,518
if he um had known that this deal

429
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:24,720
with retican was going to go through but

430
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,000
you know i mean i give i give sebastian

431
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,639
credit because he's

432
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,078
he's he's going for it in canada he

433
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,680
wants to be the biggest

434
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:33,439
or the he wants to be among the top

435
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:35,519
three lps in canada

436
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,120
and he's going for it whereas companies

437
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,440
like like tilray

438
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,039
and canopy i'm not going to say they're

439
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,279
ignoring the canadian market

440
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:44,639
but they really have their their focus

441
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:46,799
squarely

442
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,759
on the u.s market and the european

443
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:53,919
market which is extremely risky

444
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:58,319
um and i don't invest in stocks so

445
00:14:53,919 --> 00:15:01,838
but if i did i think i would probably

446
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:04,879
bet on the company that was that had

447
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,440
had a higher probability of success in a

448
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:09,198
market

449
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,560
that's defined and i wouldn't say

450
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:12,639
for somebody like that he's getting all

451
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:14,319
the patents going

452
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,680
yeah right so they have a defined market

453
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,560
right they know what their customers are

454
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:18,319
and

455
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:20,000
but i wouldn't say the us market is

456
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,120
defined yet because

457
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,839
we don't know what the rules and

458
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,519
regulations are going to look like

459
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,199
and the rules and the regulations kind

460
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,679
of set the boundaries

461
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:31,120
for where businesses can compete in and

462
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:33,198
they also set the

463
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,039
limit for where the market believe the

464
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:37,919
legal market can reach

465
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:38,879
um and in canada for example you

466
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:40,399
couldn't

467
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:42,480
you couldn't sell edibles in the first

468
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,919
year so yeah

469
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,759
basically for the first two years really

470
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:47,439
but so so the limit of the market the

471
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,879
ceiling was relatively low

472
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,720
but now that we're getting more and more

473
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:52,559
products the ceiling the mar the ceiling

474
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,278
for this market is growing

475
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:57,439
um the european market there's more

476
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:59,759
that's unknown that then that's known

477
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,279
so every business that's participating

478
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,360
in the european market

479
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:04,559
is taking a massive risk but i think

480
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,079
everyone knows that

481
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:08,078
although i don't think most investors

482
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:09,758
realize that the executives

483
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:11,359
sure are aware of that though look at

484
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,919
even denmark for example

485
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,519
the denmark market was doing very well

486
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:18,240
in 2019

487
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:21,039
uh in 2018 and 2019 and then just fell

488
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,639
off a cliff in 2020 because regulators

489
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:24,078
i'm not going to say they stopped caring

490
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,799
but they took their eye off the ball and

491
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:27,039
this is

492
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:27,838
an example of if you're competing in a

493
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:29,919
regulated

494
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,600
medical marijuana market what your

495
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:34,719
regulator is doing

496
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:37,759
is absolutely essential so

497
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:41,360
for some reason the jerk the the danish

498
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:43,759
the danish regulators kind of started

499
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,800
promoting this bizarre export strategy

500
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,480
for the country

501
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:48,159
so you have this weird situation in

502
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,278
denmark now where

503
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:53,120
uh danish producers are selling medical

504
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:56,078
marijuana that was made in denmark

505
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,159
in germany and there's no locally made

506
00:16:56,078 --> 00:17:00,479
medical marijuana in denmark

507
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:02,319
so they have only like five or six

508
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,078
hundred customers in the last quarter

509
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,480
which is nothing it's drop in the bucket

510
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:06,480
right

511
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,519
so this is just a sign that the local

512
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,038
population

513
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:13,279
is just completely ignoring um that

514
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:14,318
that pilot that pilot scheme is an

515
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:16,879
example of how

516
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:18,078
regulations can be extremely risky in a

517
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,039
in a hyper

518
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:21,759
regulated market like medical marijuana

519
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:23,359
and

520
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:24,959
another point i want to make in terms of

521
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,240
the global cannabis industry to put

522
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,679
things in perspective

523
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,798
just getting a little bit off topic but

524
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:34,480
i think this is important um

525
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:36,798
we're very very early in in in this

526
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,558
in this medical marijuana not i'm not

527
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:40,160
going to call it an experiment but

528
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:41,599
in the medical marijuana and the growth

529
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,440
of the medic the global medical

530
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:46,719
marijuana industry

531
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,960
um if you look that i can like

532
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,480
look at it australia for example their

533
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,919
market was only worth a hundred million

534
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,200
dollars last year

535
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:57,038
100 million dollars divided by uh

536
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,480
dozens of companies competing for that

537
00:17:57,038 --> 00:17:59,359
hundred million dollars and there's not

538
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,038
much left over

539
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:02,479
right which is why you have so many

540
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,038
companies that are losing money right

541
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,519
now

542
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:06,480
in australia and in canada it's the same

543
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:09,759
situation

544
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,919
um but to put that into perspective and

545
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:13,839
like how early how young is the global

546
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,360
medical marijuana market in australia

547
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:18,399
and germany everywhere

548
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:19,439
the canadian military reimbursed their

549
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,798
veterans

550
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:25,919
about 120 million canadian dollars

551
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:26,720
last year that is more money that than

552
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,038
was spent

553
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,079
in all of australia's medical marijuana

554
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:32,000
market

555
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:34,079
so the canadian military if it was a

556
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,480
country would be one of the biggest

557
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:38,399
medical marijuana markets in the world

558
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,640
now that's not saying the canadian

559
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,038
military is spending too much money

560
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,880
because they would either be reimbursing

561
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:46,879
veterans for medical marijuana or they

562
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,280
would be reimbursing them for opiates

563
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,280
so obviously medical marijuana is better

564
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:53,599
for you than opiates everyone knows that

565
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:55,119
who looks into it it's just an example

566
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:57,119
of how young the industry is and how

567
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:59,199
much potential there is for growth in

568
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:01,678
australia and germany and elsewhere

569
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,319
the canadian military reimbursed their

570
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,360
paid their

571
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:07,359
their veterans something like 14 000

572
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:09,759
kilograms

573
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:10,479
of medical marijuana last year which is

574
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:13,279
more

575
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,759
than the entire european medical

576
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:19,200
regulated medical marijuana industry

577
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:21,119
for unapproved medical marijuana so

578
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,919
there's rupert growth tons of room for

579
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:25,599
growth but people have to be aware of

580
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:27,759
how early we are

581
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:29,839
in this and things are going to go wrong

582
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:32,240
like in denmark

583
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:33,759
overall things are going to go wrong

584
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,960
things are going to rise probably right

585
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,519
you can only assume that

586
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,038
but you have to plan for setbacks if

587
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:40,240
you're a business if you're an investor

588
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:41,919
you're not going to

589
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,200
you're not going to count on perpetual

590
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,280
growth it's not going to happen it's

591
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,360
impossible canada's been doing this for

592
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:49,038
for over 20 years so canada has the

593
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:50,879
biggest regulated

594
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:52,879
federal federally regulated medical

595
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,120
marijuana market in the world

596
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,919
um but it's taken us 20 years to get to

597
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:58,399
this point

598
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,679
so a country that legalizes medical

599
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,519
marijuana let's just say

600
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,960
say for example i know france is doing

601
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:04,720
an experiment but

602
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,400
but say they end the experiment tomorrow

603
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,679
and they're like screw the experiment

604
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,440
we're just going to legalize medical

605
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,038
marijuana and we're going to regulate it

606
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,519
it's still going to take over 10 years

607
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:15,759
for that market to develop and to grow

608
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:17,839
and to even come close to its potential

609
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:19,200
so all these forecasts that the european

610
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:21,918
medical marijuana market

611
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,600
are unregulated uh for regulated

612
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,480
unapproved medical marijuana is going to

613
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:27,519
be some

614
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,960
crazy number by 2024. none of those

615
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:32,319
predictions are going to be accurate

616
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,480
they're all going to be wrong yeah no i

617
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:36,158
agree very wise words

618
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,599
i'm going to end it there for everybody

from somebody who's been talking to

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,120
everybody in europe things are going to

628
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:54,079
ramp up pretty quickly here and it'll be

629
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,879
a

630
