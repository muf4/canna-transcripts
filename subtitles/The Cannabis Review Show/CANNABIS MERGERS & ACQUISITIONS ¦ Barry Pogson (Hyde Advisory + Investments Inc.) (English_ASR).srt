sure yeah so it's it's a bit of a long

24
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:59,218
story and it comes from uh a personal

25
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:00,899
background my uh my daughter was my

26
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,780
reason for for entering the Cannabis

27
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,760
space uh she was she was born nearly 10

28
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,320
years ago with a condition called

29
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,719
Gervais syndrome

30
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:11,519
um the same as Charlotte figgy head of

31
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:14,158
Colorado

32
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,959
um and uh you know much like their

33
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,180
family we were scrambling for answers

34
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:22,618
and uh unfortunately this was kind of

35
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:24,540
just around the time uh 2012 2013 where

36
00:01:22,618 --> 00:01:25,618
um the CBD industry was starting to take

37
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,259
shape

38
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:30,118
um we we didn't have any access to it

39
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:33,180
here in Canada we did actually a little

40
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:34,500
bit of media at the time on on Kate's

41
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,360
behalf but we ended up moving to

42
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:40,319
Colorado

43
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:43,078
um got Kate started on CBD and um and

44
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:45,899
kind of uh was there at the uh you know

45
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:47,758
uh Ground Zero when things uh started

46
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:52,680
picking up in Colorado ended up working

47
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:54,118
with a larger the largest uh CBD company

48
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,640
um at the time

49
00:01:54,118 --> 00:01:59,399
um spent the last uh nine or ten years

50
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,680
with them in various positions

51
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,140
um ended up uh in the last few years

52
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,780
doing m a work on the Canadian side

53
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:09,959
trying to get them into Canada

54
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,539
um you know it as happens often in the

55
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:15,719
Cannabis space uh you know a strategy

56
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:18,539
shift uh you know regulations change

57
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:21,000
um Canada no longer became uh kind of

58
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:22,799
part of their uh long-term plan so I

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,318
looked for

60
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,660
um you know opportunities elsewhere and

61
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:30,238
uh David Hyde who's a big name in the

62
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:33,180
Canadian cannabis space who I'd worked

63
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:36,239

side it's um

76
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:09,679
you know always exciting uh looking into

77
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,360
new countries with regulations changing

78
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,580
Industries coming online

79
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,019
um and uh you know working with people

80
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,360
that are looking for either investment

81
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:20,519
or partners and and people that are

82
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,700
looking to acquire or put a stake into

83
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:24,900
an up-and-coming company

84
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:27,060
yeah holiday advice you've got a great

85
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,920
reputation around the world for sure in

86
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,840
the industry and first thing I wanted to

87
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:33,059
jump on to you and talk about was

88
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,560
Cannabis merger Acquisitions now I've

89
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,780
got a couple of questions that I want to

90
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,658
fly through on this topic but first and

91
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:42,180
foremost do you see cannabis mergers and

92
00:03:39,658 --> 00:03:45,179
Acquisitions only really start to take

93
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:47,280
place when the US federally legalized

94
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,799
cannabis because you have an opportunity

95
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,598
then for maybe the the core brand to

96
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:53,459
come to the for True mergers and

97
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,979
Acquisitions of small medium-sized

98
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:57,840
competitors or do you see Canada more

99
00:03:55,979 --> 00:04:00,119
looking towards Europe and looking

100
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,759
towards M A's in Germany and Portugal

101
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,799
and some of the the entities that are

102
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:07,139
already set up over here

103
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,299
yeah well I think it's a lot about

104
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:11,458
people hedging their bets

105
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:13,500
um on on the U.S side it's you know

106
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,219
there's no real

107
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,040
um

108
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:18,720
you know transparent future where uh

109
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,160
it's about to come online you know it

110
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,139
could be next year it could be five

111
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,419
years it could be ten years

112
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:26,819
um whereas in the EU and the rest of the

113
00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:28,740
globe there's there's real legislation

114
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:30,659
happening and real you know real

115
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,519
progress being made you know we know

116
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:35,400
Germany is is bringing their wreck

117
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:36,959
Market in we know southeast Asia is

118
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:39,239
starting to come on board we know

119
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:41,039
Australia is getting serious in South

120
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,319
America so

121
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,020
um until you know we see some kind of

122
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:47,819
movement in the U.S it's really just uh

123
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:49,859
still very much a pipe dream

124
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:51,360
um so in the meantime you know uh

125
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,979
especially Canadian companies they're

126
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,720
forced to look

127
00:04:52,978 --> 00:04:55,560
um to the EU and to the rest of the

128
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,720
world

129
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,000
um it's not to say that Canadian

130
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,340
companies aren't dipping a toe into the

131
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,379
U.S market but it's on is still very

132
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:07,739
much on a state-by-state basis you know

133
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:09,418
nobody's looking for a nationwide uh

134
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,160
strategy in the U.S because we just

135
00:05:09,418 --> 00:05:13,560
don't know what it's going to look like

136
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,120
yeah because it seems kind of nervous we

137
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,399
have the leg up I think on everybody

138
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,139
with the access to Capital I think a lot

139
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:20,579
of the the brands let's say in the

140
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:22,680
states even the likes of cookies and

141
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:24,599
some of the larger operators access to

142
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,459
Capital wouldn't be as free-flowing in

143
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,740
Canada as I'm am I writing saying that

144
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:31,859
or are these U.S companies able to

145
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:34,340
access Capital outside their territory

146
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,740
um it's it's

147
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:39,538
twofold really yeah

148
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:41,280
regulatory wise in Canada is very easy

149
00:05:39,538 --> 00:05:43,500
to access Capital

150
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:45,538
um but they kind of Crash and Burn of

151
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,519
the uh the pub codes in Canada have

152
00:05:45,538 --> 00:05:50,279
really left a bad taste in Canadian

153
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:53,159
investors mouths so while it's

154
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:55,679
free-flowing capital in Canada

155
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,539
um you know there's not as much appetite

156
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,240
here anymore whereas in the U.S you're

157
00:05:57,538 --> 00:06:02,639
right there's regulatory hurdles

158
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,620
um but a lot of U.S investors are

159
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:08,340
chomping at the bit for ways to invest

160
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:11,220
in in you know new cannabis Ventures

161
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:12,959
um you know so so it is it is out there

162
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,460
it's just it's uh you know there's

163
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:15,839
roadblocks in their way so there's

164
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:18,418
they're they're very different animals

165
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:20,099
Canada and the US in terms of access to

166
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:22,680
Capital

167
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,479
very interesting and tell me this if

168
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,879
you're let's say a piece of advice for a

169
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:29,519
cannabis company that's growing what is

170
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:31,978
the right time to merge and what is the

171
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:34,439
right time to acquire is there a

172
00:06:31,978 --> 00:06:36,300
attempted or a specific Golden Rule that

173
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:40,019
you generally tend to companies to look

174
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:41,579
for or is it on a case-by-case basis

175
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:43,799
um I mean certainly there's a

176
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:47,099
case-by-case element to it

177
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:49,199
um but uh you know and if I was thinking

178
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:51,060
on general terms in a global m a

179
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,038
opportunity

180
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:55,860
um if I'm somebody that's looking to be

181
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:59,939
acquired I find there's um there's a bit

182
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:03,060
of a uh you know a bit of a wave so to

183
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:04,079
speak in your in your uh in your life in

184
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,660
in your

185
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:09,300
in your lifespan um there's the early

186
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:11,340
startup phase where you know you're

187
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,079
raising capital or you have lack thereof

188
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:15,599
and you really just have you know these

189
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:17,399
big wonderful plans to build a facility

190
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,379
you you know you have some of the right

191
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:22,560
people in place and you know the the

192
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:24,300
groundwork for uh the licensing and a

193
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,280
decent relationship with the government

194
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,840
you know you're

195
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,399
um you know you're stuck between a rock

196
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:31,859
and a hard place in terms of your

197
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:34,679
financing maybe that's the opportunity

198
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:36,840
to bring somebody in uh that has some

199
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,340
experience that has some capital and

200
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:40,679
you're going to give away a bit more of

201
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:43,318
your company to to you know make it to

202
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,060
the next level but if you're able to

203
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:48,000
navigate that hurdle

204
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:51,180
um and you know get an operational

205
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,879
Facility have some historical Revenue

206
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,740
um really be at the top of your of your

207
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:58,079
game and have something that's

208
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,598
attractive uh you know a good example of

209
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:02,698
that right now is uh you know a facility

210
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:05,939
in the EU that can do post-harvest

211
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:08,160
processing and it's GMP certified you

212
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:10,079
know that's not easy to find it's very

213
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,960
attractive a lot of people want it and

214
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:15,120
and now is the perfect time to to look

215
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:18,719
to be acquired um you know a company

216
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:21,060
like Materia uh did just that

217
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,400
um and then there's the later stage and

218
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,680
you're seeing that a lot in Canada where

219
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:26,939
you know you've you've laid the

220
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,000
foundation you've built something

221
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:32,338
beautiful it's been operational

222
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,839
um but you know for whatever reason your

223
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:36,060
business model is not working the

224
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:39,300
margins aren't there or the regulatory

225
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:40,859
burden is too great and you can't make a

226
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:43,978
run of it and now you know your sales

227
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:46,440
are declining your your lease uh payment

228
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:47,879
is up for Renewal and and you have to

229
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,560
make an exit or else you're just gonna

230
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:51,240
have to you know put the for sale sign

231
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:53,458
up and sell it as a property and just

232
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,080
abandon the business so

233
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:57,119
um there's kind of three different

234
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,940
stages and certainly the very Middle

235
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,039
where you're you know your revenue is on

236
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,660
point and uh you have something that a

237
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:06,539
lot of people want that would be you

238
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:08,100
know the the Goldilocks time to to make

239
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:10,319
a move

240
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:13,440
interesting yeah talking about victory

241
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,060
of interesting to their project to put

242
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,519
pretty prayer over the last number of

243
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:19,439
years so do you do you see that

244
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:25,220
basically these post-harvest processing

245
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:27,839
facilities are more uh more in in

246
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:29,519
let's say in in point where everybody

247
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,200
compared to let's say the cultivation

248
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,240
facilities it's the post-harvesting

249
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,640
processing you think is where the demand

250
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,560
for Europe is going to be because the

251
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:39,659
ability to ship in low-car's products

252
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:41,939
around the world or do you think the the

253
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:43,980
shipping costs and the ability to ship

254
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,260
and keep a turbine and cannabinoid

255
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,820
profile exact over the course of let's

256
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:51,360
say two weeks shipping over the boat

257
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,740
over the sea is that the way to go or do

258
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,800
you think the cultivation in Europe is

259
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:57,720
going to end up start peeking up

260
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:59,039
um I think in the long term it will

261
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,500
certainly yes

262
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:03,000
um where where people are cultivating

263
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,919
um you know in the in the domestic

264
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,360
Market they're serving but you know

265
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:08,159
right now

266
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:11,278
um there's a lot of people interested in

267
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:13,379
uh you know growing cannabis uh in very

268
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:15,720
low-cost environments like South America

269
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:17,820
and Africa and shipping it to the EU

270
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,680
doing your post harvesting there you

271
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:22,200
know the shipping costs on top of the

272
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:24,059
low cost of production uh are still far

273
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,180
below what it would cost to you know

274
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:29,099
cultivate an EU GMP facility uh

275
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:30,838
somewhere in the EU so

276
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,778
um in the short term I think it's still

277
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:36,360
very much uh part of a lot of companies

278
00:10:33,778 --> 00:10:39,419
business model but the longevity of it

279
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:42,360
yeah it's it's probably not there

280
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:43,740
um you know uh many governments are

281
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,360
probably going to start catching on to

282
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,579
this little uh you know Green wash

283
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,399
technique and and putting in some

284
00:10:47,578 --> 00:10:52,979
regulations to block that

285
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,899
yeah okay next topic I wanted to jump on

286
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,639
to which one pretty much every

287
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:58,679
entrepreneur in the Cannabis industry

288
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,838
would like to get an answer to and it's

289
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:02,219
access to Capital but I'm not going to

290
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:03,660
bore you with trying to tell me where

291
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:06,420
you get access to Capital I want to give

292
00:11:03,659 --> 00:11:08,399
you five different potential businesses

293
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:11,278
that were they were to come in in front

294
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:15,000
of you which one of these five would be

295
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:18,139
most uh likely to obtain funding right

296
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,940
so option one is a biotechnology company

297
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:23,278
biosynthesizing cannabinoids requires

298
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,620
double deck a million shall we say

299
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:27,838
second option would be somebody who's

300
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,759
got a cultivation operation they've got

301
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,740
their own genetics that they want to IP

302
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:33,600
the other option then is somebody who

303
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,820
wants to open up a chain of dispensers

304
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,940
start with CBD obviously in Ireland and

305
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:42,180
moving towards THC and then the other

306
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:44,640
one would be a laboratory that does the

307
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:46,559
testing facilities and those uh

308
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,419
governmental contracts which are those

309
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:51,059
four businesses do you think is right

310
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:53,039
that's that that's the one that I I put

311
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:54,719
my money onto or would you like to split

312
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:57,679
money across all four of them if the

313
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,680
phone came in from you

314
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:01,860
um yeah that's a very good question I

315
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,899
would also be curious you know what the

316
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:06,419
where these markets are I think that

317
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:09,419
would play into it a little bit but if

318
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:11,039
um if we wanted your we call it Europe

319
00:12:09,419 --> 00:12:13,319
because the audience would be European

320
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:15,480
and we're an Irish media Enterprise

321
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,519
let's think of Europe in general

322
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,539
sure yeah

323
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,179
um

324
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:23,039
man I I think if it was me I would split

325
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:24,419
it between the biotech and the and the

326
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:25,980
lab testing

327
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:28,319
um you know that's not something that

328
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:30,240
everybody can do and out of Biotech

329
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,700
you're gonna get you know quite a bit of

330
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,159
Ip and and you know stuff that's not

331
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:38,300
easily duplicated

332
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:40,919
um yeah retail chains are a tough game

333
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:43,439
it's an easy answer in Canada I would

334
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:45,059
stay well away from a retail chain or

335
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,180
cultivation even with their own

336
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:50,458
proprietary strings to be honest but

337
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:53,458
um yeah you know I think the future is

338
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:55,500
biotech so if I'm investing for the long

339
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:58,559
term that's where you know I probably

340
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:01,139
put 80 into biotech and 20 for lab

341
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:02,159
testing lab testing the future is a

342
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:05,459
little bit

343
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:07,919
um you know I think it's a very

344
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:09,059
um important element to the Cannabis

345
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:10,919
industry

346
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:13,559
um but you're very dependent on

347
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:17,159
government regulations

348
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:19,739
um so you could be the most important uh

349
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:21,120
part of the value chain uh depending on

350
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:24,180
what the government requires of

351
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,159
cultivars cultivators or you could be

352
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:28,859
just one of a hundred of you know it's a

353
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:32,299
very simple uh COA that you're producing

354
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:35,039
with THC CBD and you know pesticides and

355
00:13:32,299 --> 00:13:37,919
uh microbials

356
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:40,439
um so it uh it depends you know in the

357
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:42,599
UK uh lab testing is looking like it's

358
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,399
going to be very important for CBD with

359
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,899
with novel Foods in whichever direction

360
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,879
they go there

361
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:50,100
um so yeah I would hedge my bets and

362
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:52,820
have some form of split between the

363
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:54,778
first and the and the last option

364
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:56,519
interesting before I let you go quick

365
00:13:54,778 --> 00:13:58,078
when you mentioned the UK there as

366
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:01,560
somebody who owns another business who

367
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:03,479
deals with the UK post brexit I'm fully

368
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:05,699
too aware of the looking nightmare that

369
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,399
involves dealing your business from the

370
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:10,860
UK to the EU now do investors in North

371
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,799
America see this do they realize the

372
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:15,419
extra added tax that gets involved in

373
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:17,639
the exchange between the European Union

374
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:19,139
and then the UK now or does it matter to

375
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:21,180
them they just see the UK as being a

376
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:23,339
market on its own to be able to set up

377
00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:25,039
its a standalone entity in the UK

378
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:27,720
Standalone in Europe

379
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:31,379
yeah I think the I think the educated

380
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:34,259
North American company appreciates that

381
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:36,480
um their their very separate markets and

382
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:39,539
it would be beneficial to have if you

383
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:43,199
are a truly a global player to have

384
00:14:39,539 --> 00:14:45,120
um an asset in the UK and a second asset

385
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:48,179
in the EU

386
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,759
um but um you know I I know of a few

387
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:52,500
companies that UK is there the UK is

388
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:54,299
their their end goal they don't need to

389
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,519
go beyond that they're happy to just set

390
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:58,979
their put their flag in the UK and and

391
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:03,839
try and make that market work

392
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:07,320
um but uh you know the intrinsics of uh

393
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:10,019
of uh transport between the UK and the

394
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,839
EU no I I wouldn't say your typical

395
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:14,698
North American company would understand

396
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:17,160
everything that's involved there and and

397
00:15:14,698 --> 00:15:19,259
a big part not to digress too much but a

398
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:23,399
big part of a global m a play from a

399
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:25,319
North American company is to have uh not

400
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:27,240
just the asset but a team that's already

401
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,040
in place that either is going to do a

402
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,480
nice long transition so they can learn

403
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:31,919
as much as they can from them before

404
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,100
they leave or somebody that they can

405
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:37,319
retain that has that knowledge about the

406
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,360
markets that they're in

407
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,680
yeah we see Ireland being the footstone

408
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,959
into Europe for a lot of the North

409
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:44,819
American companies with an art Creator

410
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,679
Holly skilled Workforce and only

411
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:48,000
English-speaking entity in Europe at the

412
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:49,979
moment I think Ireland is going to play

413
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,078
a pivotal role over the course of the

414
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,759
next 10 years time and uh we'll be

415
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:55,799
championing Ireland from the Canada's

416
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,240
view over the next few years but thank

emergers and Acquisitions but uh

421
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,220

start it next year and have an update to

423

00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:10,919
