52
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:16,979
of been at the Forefront of this scene

53
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:19,318

look like what is the most prominent

56
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:26,159
sector is it biotechnology is it called

57
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,840
again is Medicore and D well you saw

58
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,598
there that Philip Morris recently

59
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,759
acquired an inhaler company that were

60
00:02:30,598 --> 00:02:37,259
based out of Israel as well

61
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:40,199
yes I'm sure so um you know here in

62
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:42,000
Israel we have quite the

63
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:43,439
quite the experience with medical

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,139
cannabis

65
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:49,079
um first uh Dr Raphael michalam who

66
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:53,359
recently passed away unfortunately but

67
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:56,940
uh having first isolated uh CBD and THC

68
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,220
uh as independent compounds and uh

69
00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:00,120
researching them and

70
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:02,519
um

71
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,140
you know from there we've had a lot of

72
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:07,920
experience

73
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:09,598
um in you know the r d side of things

74
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:12,780
um

75
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:15,780
from clinical trials to

76
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:19,680
um delivery devices as you saw with the

77
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:20,759
psych inhaler uh just getting

78
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,700
um

79
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:28,019
an investment from Philip Morris

80
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:30,719
um and we uh you know right now I I

81
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:33,239
think what's shining is you know the the

82
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:36,739
industry as a whole um we've had a

83
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:39,300
medical program since the early 2000s

84
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:43,519
for patients

85
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:47,519
um being able to access medical cannabis

86
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:51,180
we have you know many local uh

87
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:53,039
cultivators as well as importers and uh

88
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,599
brands that have entered the market here

89
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:58,378
in Israel

90
00:03:54,598 --> 00:03:59,539
um we have 120 000 patients to date uh

91
00:03:58,378 --> 00:04:02,219
on average

92
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:07,318
receiving about 30 grams of medical

93
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:11,098
cannabis uh per month and

94
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:13,878
um you know each each uh patient needs

95
00:04:11,098 --> 00:04:16,039
their prescription from uh their their

96
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:20,519
personalized doctor

97
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:21,180
and uh we've seen just a lot of uh you

98
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,079
know

99
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,019
um

100
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,300
opportunity in that sector

101
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:29,339
um with with Brands looking to enter the

102
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,978
Israeli market and that's really where

103
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:35,159
we're trying to stick our our feet that

104
00:04:31,978 --> 00:04:37,439
really help Brands come to uh Israel and

105
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,800
help them you know navigate the

106
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:44,519
regulation the uh

107
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,040
and and the market as a whole

108
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:49,079
we everybody knows that Israel is a

109
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,660
hotbed for starters especially in the

110
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:54,539
tech med tech space is the capital

111
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:56,639
access for companies who are starting in

112
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,620
this industry are looking to expand on a

113
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,360
global footprint is the access to

114
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,720
Capital there in the in the Israeli

115
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,720
industry

116
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,819
so it's you know it's still medical

117
00:05:06,418 --> 00:05:12,359
cannabis it still has its stigmas

118
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:14,579
attached to it like in every Market

119
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,800
um you know capital is

120
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:20,099
you know definitely drying up in the

121
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,720
Cannabis space and specifically uh here

122
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:25,560
in Israel

123
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:28,199
um you know compared to the tech sector

124
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,879
um it's definitely harder to access

125
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:32,038
um not as many

126
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:33,899
investors

127
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:36,360
um you know feel comfortable with the

128
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:39,060
with the opportunities

129
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:42,300
but um we're definitely

130
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,620
you know we we've seen uh a bunch of

131
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,060
public

132
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,639
um

133
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,439
companies go public in the past uh

134
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:52,560
number of years

135
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:54,478
um so we have you know a

136
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,939
I'd say about five or six of our

137
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,740
companies uh listed here on the Tel Aviv

138
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:01,339
Stock Exchange

139
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:07,019
um as well as other other

140
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:09,839
exchanges such as the NASDAQ and um

141
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:13,740
the CSE

142
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:16,258
um and we uh

143
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:19,860
yeah it's just not you know I think it's

144
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:22,439
an issue in the in the more uh

145
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:25,740
in the broader medical cannabis Market

146
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:29,339
not just here in Israel

147
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:31,800
um an issue of access to Capital

148
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:34,560
yeah it seems to be the regulations and

149
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,960
rules are exactly where Prime investors

150
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,060
want them to be just yet do you imagine

151
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:41,399
that Federal legalization in the U.S

152
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,139
will spur on the Israeli industry like a

153
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:45,239
real Europe

154
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:47,100
a hundred percent

155
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,400
um you know being as I'm from New York

156
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:55,020
and having uh you know many contacts in

157
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:57,478
Industry relationships out in the U.S

158
00:06:55,019 --> 00:07:00,359
um you know seeing markets like

159
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:04,139
California Colorado you know being there

160
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:07,319
uh in person watching them go from

161
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:10,620
medical to recreational and and now in

162
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:14,220
New York just spending some uh about two

163
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:16,079
months in New York uh just uh a few

164
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,039
months ago

165
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:19,318
um

166
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:19,879
you know seeing the

167
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:22,860
the

168
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:26,519
opportunities that that lie in in the

169
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:28,319
regulated adult use markets

170
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:30,659
um is definitely something we're looking

171
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,720
forward to some clarity and and

172
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:35,160
regulation in the U.S

173
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,800
um and I think that will definitely

174
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:40,620
trickle out as uh you know here in

175
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:43,978
Israel we're a pretty small country we

176
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:48,240
are 10 million people we like to uh you

177
00:07:43,978 --> 00:07:50,300
know look at New Jersey as a as a

178
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,300
um

179
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:58,079
you know for analysis purposes but

180
00:07:54,598 --> 00:08:00,418
um you know um being as I'm from New

181
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:03,300
York we're definitely uh and and the

182
00:08:00,418 --> 00:08:05,818
recently uh adult use legalization over

183
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:08,699
there we are definitely looking forward

184
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:11,879
to you know that kind of trickling out

185
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:14,038
into the European markets and we do

186
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:16,379
believe Israel will will head that way

187
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:18,899
in the future

188
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:21,659
I was over in Tel Aviv myself personally

189
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:24,538
in June and I was actually surprised at

190
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:26,639
how many people were smoking cannabis in

191
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:28,978
public and there didn't seem to be any

192
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,740
real pushback is Tel Aviv more of an

193
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:34,319
employer when it comes to Israel or is

194
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,820
this tolerance widespread across the

195
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,300
country

196
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:42,180
yeah so we have uh you know we have

197
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:46,859
passed decriminalization here

198
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:47,519
um in Israel uh about two years ago

199
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,940
um

200
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:54,000
where now you know if you're caught

201
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:56,160
smoking and and uh you know up to a

202
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
certain uh holding up to a certain

203
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:02,100
amount we will not be uh you know you

204
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,019
will just get a fine at the end of the

205
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,040
day and

206
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:08,700
um

207
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:11,099
up to three strikes I believe that is

208
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:13,980
um but you know here in

209
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:16,800
it's it's not just Tel Aviv it's all

210
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:20,759
over the country we have a large you

211
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:24,299
know constituent of of adults

212
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:27,360
um you know between the ages of 18 and

213
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:30,000
and up who are you know who can be

214
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,039
consuming alcohol legally

215
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,700
um who you know are drafted into the

216
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:39,120
military at the age of 18 here and

217
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:43,980
um you know we're seeing cannabis just

218
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:45,240
uh you know open up its uh its doors to

219
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,220
them and

220
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,680
um you know being as we're a Middle

221
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:52,620
Eastern country there's a lot of you

222
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:53,958
know the the cultural

223
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:57,600
um

224
00:09:53,958 --> 00:10:00,559
attachment to smoking is is definitely

225
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:04,620
relevant to this conversation as well

226
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:09,479
and uh you know I I believe they say

227
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:13,379
around 20 to 25 percent of of a at of

228
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:15,959
adults between 18 and and 60 have used

229
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:18,600
cannabis in the last year

230
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:22,679
um so we do have a large

231
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:24,659
you know kind of Black Market uh or gray

232
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:26,399
market and

233
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:29,039
um

234
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:32,778
you know people who who will

235
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,778
um dabble in it

236
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,740
we there's a lot of big companies coming

237
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:40,740
out of Israel we talked to Ilan Sobel

238
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:43,560
from bioharvest Sciences as we mentioned

239
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:46,079
the deal that got to fill up first what

240
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:48,179
is the the tip of the spear when it

241
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:50,639
comes to the Israeli industry is it

242
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:53,759
technology applied to the Cannabis

243
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:56,399
industry is biotechnology is it medical

244
00:10:53,759 --> 00:11:00,740
or D what do you think is the strongest

245
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,740
part of the Israeli calibacy

246
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:07,680
um so so to you know to date being as

247
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:11,278
we're dealing with uh cannabis and it's

248
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:12,659
treated as a narcotic here in Israel

249
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:15,259
um you know we do have a lot of

250
00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:15,259
Regulation

251
00:11:15,419 --> 00:11:19,620
um as well as a pharmaceutical that it's

252
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:22,260
being treated as we do have a lot of

253
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,159
Regulation and hoops and

254
00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:27,000
um

255
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:29,519
you know ways we need to uh Drive the

256
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,839
you know any any devices that are used

257
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:37,980
in delivery uh of this uh of this

258
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:40,019
medicine is considered a medical device

259
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:44,820
um so you know you need to go through

260
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:46,259
classic uh medical device uh approvals

261
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,640
for

262
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:50,100
um

263
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:54,899
you know with the Ministry of Health and

264
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:58,320
and as we see uh psyche medical going uh

265
00:11:54,899 --> 00:12:00,778
for regulation with the FDA

266
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,940
um we uh

267
00:12:00,778 --> 00:12:05,578
you know so so the hoops and hurdles

268
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:08,339
that that we're experiencing are are

269
00:12:05,578 --> 00:12:10,259
definitely very difficult

270
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:12,660
um right now we're seeing a large push

271
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:15,659
on the consumer side and the marketing

272
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:17,899
and branding of of medical of these

273
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:20,399
medical brands that are coming to Market

274
00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:23,519
uh but I do believe in the future that

275
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:26,759
there's a lot of r d and a lot of you

276
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,339
know more uh Pharma focused

277
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:30,539
um

278
00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:33,540
pharma-focused companies that will come

279
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:36,299
to the Forefront as uh you know clinical

280
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:38,879
trials become more more prevalent in the

281
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:41,458
Cannabis industry and

282
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:45,360
um people start really focusing on the

283
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:49,018
Pharma and medical side of this plant as

284
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:52,860
well as you know as opposed to where we

285
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:57,000
have it now which is this quasi

286
00:12:52,860 --> 00:13:00,300
um you know medical uh Slash adult use

287
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,600
conversation where uh we're not we're

288
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:06,899
not getting you know down to the to the

289
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:10,320
real uh to the real values of of where

290
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:13,980
we could be bringing this plant uh both

291
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:17,160
in the adult use aspect as well

292
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:21,000
um you know with the Pharma approach

293
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:23,578
which I I strongly believe in

294
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,078
yeah I think there's a huge value in

295
00:13:23,578 --> 00:13:27,299
that side of the industry and those

296
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:29,638
people who can create formulations and

297
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:31,620
blends and terpenes and cannabinoids and

298
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:34,259
employ them to whether it's CB1 or CB2

299
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:36,299
receptors or inflammation or chronic

300
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:38,338
pain whatever it may be that seems to be

301
00:13:36,299 --> 00:13:39,958
the big leap that's going to happen in

302
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:42,180
the Cannabis industry globally over the

303
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:45,299
next five to ten years

304
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:47,759
yeah yeah and I think unfortunately you

305
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:50,759
know we're we're missing a little bit of

306
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:53,578
that due to uh you know the the hurdles

307
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:58,139
that uh we're we're experiencing as an

308
00:13:53,578 --> 00:13:59,879
industry uh along the different markets

309
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:02,278
um so

310
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:04,679
I I do believe in the next five to ten

311
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:08,399
years we we will start to see a lot of

312
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:10,799
Biotech companies and uh a lot of these

313
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:14,659
you know we we have a very well-known

314
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:14,659
terping company here in Israel

315
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,600
um

316
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:22,200
you know uh with with Botanical

317
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:25,980
um terpenes that are you know really

318
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:28,139
leading the way in in in r d around the

319
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:30,778
terpenes

320
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:34,620
um and the effects that it could have

321
00:14:30,778 --> 00:14:37,200
um along with you know CBD THC and

322
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:39,299
um the other cannabinoids

323
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,759
yes there's benefits to page instead of

324
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:44,039
yet to be re brought to Market and

325
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:45,600
showcased as of yet and I think that's

326
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:48,179
where the most exciting part is going to

327
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,100
be what is the future plans for at this

328
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:53,219
kind of Consulting and is there anything

329
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:55,680
they would like to tell the audience

330
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:58,740
yeah we're you know we're continuing

331
00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:01,198
helping companies look into Israel as a

332
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:04,620
market opportunity

333
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:06,419
um we are actively pursuing capital on

334
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,459
behalf of different companies as well

335
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:11,399
and

336
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:14,458
um you know trying to look into Europe

337
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:16,500
as uh Australia you know the the

338
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:19,919
emerging markets and really try to

339
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:22,259
connect the dots uh myself being from

340
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:25,259
North America and and New York you know

341
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:28,319
the U.S really I think there's a lot of

342
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:31,559
opportunities uh between cat you know

343
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:34,879
Canada and what's been done in Canada

344
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:38,278
um the U.S wants Federal legalization

345
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:41,698
right Federal Regulation exists let

346
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:44,399
alone uh legalization and

347
00:15:41,698 --> 00:15:46,439
um you know Europe becoming uh the

348
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,600
market that it's gonna be we all know

349
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,100
it's gonna be

350
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,519
um I really believe there's a large

351
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:55,860
opportunity in in uh you know connecting

352
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,679
the dots and you know that's our goal at

353
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:01,680
Atlas County Consulting is really to

354
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:03,719
help companies uh you know connect the

355
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:06,419
dots and new markets whether it's

356
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,220
fundraising uh finding distribution

357
00:16:06,419 --> 00:16:09,000
Partnerships

358
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:12,240
um

359
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,539
you know and and uh looking at JV

360
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:18,060
opportunities to uh help further the

361
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:19,198
market and help develop you know the

362
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:21,899
market

363
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:24,000
um as we're in this growth stage it's a

364
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:27,360
little painful of course you know during

365
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,399
this this time but I do believe that you

366
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,639
know the coming years where you know

367
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:34,620
things will start shining again and

368
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,198
um you know investment Capital will

369
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:40,198
start coming back and um we'll really

370
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:43,439
see you know the the Cannabis industry

371
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:45,240
really develop into what we know it can

372
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,579
be

373
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,560
yeah I think the industry is the

374
00:16:47,578 --> 00:16:50,939
Quagmire that everybody's in at the

375
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:52,379
moment is going to get rid of some of

376
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:54,420
the people who are just here for a quick

377
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:56,100
book and I think the next three to five

378
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:58,319
years you'll see the real professionals

379
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,699
come into this industry and stay in this

380
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,860
industry and they'll be the ones that

381
00:16:59,698 --> 00:17:04,259
will be able to foresee the future

382
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:06,480
growth of this sector globally not just

383
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:09,019
locally

384
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:12,720

um the real you know the real market

387
00:17:15,058 --> 00:17:20,720
makers will start to emerge and uh we're
