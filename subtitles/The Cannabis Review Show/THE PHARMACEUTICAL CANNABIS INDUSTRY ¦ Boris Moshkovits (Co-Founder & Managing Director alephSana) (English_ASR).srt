7
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,939
pharmaceutical wholesaler importer and

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,740
exporter they've been providing the

9
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:28,320
supply of individual cannabis therapies

10
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:29,698
for patients since 2019. Boris how are

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,980
you keeping today

12

all good thank you for having me I'm

13
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,100
delighted to have you all now a man

14
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:36,419
who's a Cornerstone of the European

15
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,160
industry at the moment it's great to

16
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,719
maybe get you out and give everybody an

17
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:40,979
overview of some of the things that are

18
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,600
happening do you want to maybe give

19
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:44,339
everybody a quick little review of how

20
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,200
you ended up co-founding a managing

21
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,719
director of Alabama

22
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:52,200
sure it's been a ride I mean we started

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,120
in 2019 we found it out of uh Zan as a

24
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,239
pharmaceutical wholesaler I myself I've

25
00:00:54,119 --> 00:01:00,238
been in this industry since 2016

26
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:02,640
um as let's say an activist of a voice

27
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:04,319
in the industry uh why at that point it

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,000
wasn't even an industry but it was a

29
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,759
group of people fighting for the right

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,519
to have a medical cannabis as a therapy

31
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,340
so by 2017 the law came about in Germany

32
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:16,259
that was the moment when uh it was legal

33
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,579
to prescribe it and uh receive it

34
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,740
through the pharmacies and then that

35
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:20,879
time I found my first company for

36
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:23,699
cultivation

37
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,739
um didn't work out that tender uh was

38
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,740
thrown out in court so I started this

39
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:31,199
company elizana has been in the industry

40
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:33,298
since 2019 we got our licenses and since

41
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,359
2020 we're selling a pharmaceutical

42
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:38,820
cannabis to Pharmacy supplying patients

43
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:41,159
all over Germany there's 22 000

44
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:43,078
pharmacies in Germany and more and more

45
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,299
pharmacies are getting uh the hang of it

46
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:48,179
are understanding that there's a say

47
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:51,540
it's a legit and and viable uh

48
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,460
medicine that is being provided

49
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,720
yeah it seems to be Germany's going to

50
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:56,039
be the Cornerstone of the European

51
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:57,658
industry and what happens there should

52
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,280
have good Ripple effects across the

53
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,840
industry I'm going to start straight

54
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,659
away with the first topic which is the

55
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,118
pharmaceutical cannabis industry and a

56
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:08,459
pretty straightforward question where is

57
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:10,139
the most playing near pioneering in the

58
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,819
pharmaceutical cannabis industry is it

59
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:17,399
North America or is it Europe

60
00:02:13,818 --> 00:02:18,780
I believe we do take impulses from all

61
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,580
over the world in Germany but the

62
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,378
advantage of Germany is to know that we

63
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,819
have started we're looking at Canada at

64
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:26,459
North America but we're also looking at

65
00:02:23,818 --> 00:02:29,579
Israel where uh pharmaceutical cannabis

66
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:32,459
is uh basically all over the place in

67
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,860
every Pharmacy and um I would say that

68
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:37,378
we have a lot of innovation here and the

69
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,599
sense of providing to patients and then

70
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:41,039
just the system because we have the

71
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:43,439
first system that is reimbursing

72
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:45,560
medicinal cannabis for patients so they

73
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,519
apply and they get it and no matter

74
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,340
where they stand

75
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,959
um but from a research point of view I

76
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,700
believe that there's a lot to be learned

77
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,439
in the modes of delivery and this is

78
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:56,759
something that we see more in Israel

79
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,459
than we see in North America North

80
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:01,979
America is especially looking at the

81
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:05,340
United States it's still a lot flower

82
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:07,378
driven maybe extracts uh but um the

83
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,300
future is more in formulations finished

84
00:03:07,378 --> 00:03:11,459
products medical devices so there's a

85
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,900
lot to do and a lot to be learned and

86
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:15,420
gathered and I think in that regard

87
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,819
Germany's can be the Melting Pot of all

88
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:19,919
influences from around the world

89
00:03:17,818 --> 00:03:21,899
okay very interesting mentored Blends

90
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:23,518
and formulations there it's one of the

91
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,260
key things that we think is going to be

92
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,819
the future of the pharmaceutical side of

93
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:28,378
the industry and it brings me on to the

94
00:03:26,818 --> 00:03:30,598
next topic I wanted to talk about which

95
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:33,299
is the thought of biosynthesis so you

96
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:36,378
guys Supply dranabadal which is a

97
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:39,180
synthetic THC product do you see

98
00:03:36,378 --> 00:03:41,459
biosynthesis becoming a Cornerstone of

99
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,260
the pharmaceutical cannabis industry or

100
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:45,239
is it still a number of years away from

101
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:46,560
being perfected

102
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:48,900
look from

103
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,479
from where we stand we've been talking

104
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,980
to Partners who are investing in in that

105
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:54,899
sector of the industry and they're

106
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:56,699
investing in clinical studies because in

107
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:00,120
the end it is about creating

108
00:03:56,699 --> 00:04:01,500
formulations isolating more synthesizing

109
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,658
um those formulations

110
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,818
um that we can match with indications to

111
00:04:03,658 --> 00:04:08,039
do that we need the clinical studies and

112
00:04:05,818 --> 00:04:10,378
that is an investor traditionally in the

113
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:12,900
Pharma industry where you can protect

114
00:04:10,378 --> 00:04:14,878
your intellectual property

115
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,319
um and in the past this has been the

116
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:17,399
difficulty in the Cannabis industry

117
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:19,439
because there was nothing to be

118
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:21,959
protected but Brands

119
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:23,879
um so I do believe that the medical

120
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,399
space we will see more of that coming

121
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:28,079
and the next two or three years

122
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,579
um definitely more so and that's going

123
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:32,099
to happen as well as in the states as

124
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:35,099
well as in Europe

125
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:37,500
um we will be providing and that to

126
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,479
patients by securing marketing

127
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,459
authorizations licensing products but

128
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:43,379
we're not doing the research ourselves

129
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:46,739
or development but we're on the on that

130
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:49,199
end um or of the say Market access and

131
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:51,720
distribution marketing provider

132
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,000
okay so biosynthesis seems to give the

133
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,340
producer of the end product much more

134
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,620
protection whether it's on the process

135
00:04:56,339 --> 00:05:00,539
that they create the substrate that they

136
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,399
use and then the potential for medical

137
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,139
trials coming from an already

138
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:05,039
pharmaceutical grade company is that

139
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:06,840
correct

140
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,400
absolutely

141
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:11,939
um I think somewhere in between what we

142
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:13,799
see is the the organic formulation so

143
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:16,500
what we call extracts and which we see

144
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,300
now as as oils and and eventually

145
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,699
vapable oils

146
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,720
um tinctures this is the the go-between

147
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:25,080
step

148
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:28,560
um biosynthesis will will just be

149
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:30,060
more of a scalable process and thus we

150
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,000
will see big Pharma getting involved and

151
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:35,280
then creating real alternatives to pain

152
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,560
medication and possibly other

153
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:39,478
indications that we just have to explore

154
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,280
secure and really reliable uh

155
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:44,459
communicate at this point there's a lot

156
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:46,500
of guessing and a lot of uh No Label

157
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:48,239
prescriptions or off-label prescriptions

158
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,120
I mean what the most successful product

159
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,180
is a pedial x which is a high CBD

160
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,800
tincture that is for seizures uh as a

161
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,139
first line medication but at the end

162
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,319
it's being prescribed for a wide range

163
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:04,139
of indications as an off label and with

164
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:06,779
flower we know it's it's No Label uh

165
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:09,180
prescription all together so why since

166
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:11,758
he says well just um streamline the

167
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:14,220
whole process be more uh focused and and

168
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:17,600
more clear to all everybody involved

169
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:19,680
doctors pharmacists patients and uh and

170
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,020
careful takers

171
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,120
yeah and it seems to be in the biosity

172
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:25,680
space so it's corporate the Innovative

173
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,199
companies we see are targeting the

174
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,660
actual CB1 and CB2 receptors themselves

175
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:33,900
and based on some research this the

176
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:36,660
focus of 30 of all FDA approved drugs

177
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:38,939
are are focused on receptors so do you

178
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,380
see that as being a new Avenue let's say

179
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:43,259
for the Cannabis industry that is

180
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:45,000
basically untouched as of yet uh for the

181
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:46,379
companies to to do more research and

182
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,079
development and develop products that

183
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:51,120
are going to be able to take patients to

184
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:52,978
the next level of care

185
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,120
um it's not an entirely new approach I

186
00:06:52,978 --> 00:06:57,180
mean the the research of the

187
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:00,418
endocannabinoid system has been going on

188
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:02,819
since uh I guess the 50s but uh more

189
00:07:00,418 --> 00:07:04,978
recently uh we do look not only at the

190
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:07,800
cannabinoids themselves but also at the

191
00:07:04,978 --> 00:07:09,240
Inhibitors and other forms of and or

192
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:13,340
enhancers

193
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:16,620
um to uh to utilize these receptors more

194
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:18,239
effectively also in the context of other

195
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,220
medications because it's rarely that

196
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,800
it's just a cannabis therapy it's it's

197
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:25,020
often a mixed form of therapy so we have

198
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,918
to understand how these receptors

199
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:31,379
interact with other forms of medication

200
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:33,120
and thank you so the next topic I wanted

201
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:35,159
to jump onto was sourcing the best

202
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,259
products you guys are a wholesaler

203
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,120
importer and exporter is there a

204
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:41,220
specific process that you guys go to

205
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,139
just try and find the next best product

206
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,639
that's coming to the market or is it

207
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:46,560
generally a case of the the

208
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,000
manufacturers themselves have got good

209
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,160
marketing campaigns or have got good

210
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,959
Outreach programs where they're able to

211
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,840
find the companies like yourselves and

212
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:57,359
you can marry the two companies together

213
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:59,879
and we continue to scout the industry uh

214
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,060
worldwide and and that we're doing a

215
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:05,219
couple of levels on one level is

216
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,319
getting the best flour dried flour

217
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:10,139
because currently still two-thirds of

218
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:13,080
the market in Germany has dried flowers

219
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:14,759
and um there we had questions of quality

220
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:17,060
and we still do

221
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:19,379
um as you know eugnp in Germany is to

222
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:22,740
required quality level but at the same

223
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:24,479
time we see gcp to GMP hubs

224
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,918
um spread

225
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:27,300
um all over Europe and the world and

226
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:29,399
bringing in

227
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,900
flower at different levels of quality

228
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:33,418
and this is something where we're very

229
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:35,098
cautious of what we choose because we

230
00:08:33,418 --> 00:08:37,319
have the responsibility towards the

231
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:39,959
patients so this is one

232
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,520
um in tinctures and extracts we also

233
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:43,799
look at the process how is it being

234
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,419
processed where's it coming from what's

235
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:48,000
the original what kind of biomass is

236
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:49,319
used has it been irradiated before or

237
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,679
not

238
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,778
um and then lastly what we do is to set

239
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:57,359
this we look at research we don't do the

240
00:08:54,778 --> 00:09:00,778
research ourselves but we initiate

241
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,879
processes like inhalators uh patches

242
00:09:00,778 --> 00:09:04,620
things that we believe will be an

243
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:07,200
important part in the future of the

244
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,339
medical cannabis world or medicinal

245
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,500
cannabis World

246
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:11,580
um and these are things where we Source

247
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:15,299
the right

248
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:17,700
companies the right Technologies and see

249
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:20,819
how we can Implement these Technologies

250
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:22,560
and cannabis because when you look at it

251
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:25,200
pharmaceutical we do have already

252
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:27,359
established mechanisms of modes of

253
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,839
delivery for other

254
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,180
um medications and sometimes it's just

255
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:34,800
about understanding that parallel and

256
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:37,559
introducing that to the Cannabis world

257
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:39,899
and that's let's say I would say the the

258
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:42,719
third stream of our actions in providing

259
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:44,639
the best sourced medications and

260
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,620
therapies for patients and then

261
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:49,379
pharmacies and doctors

262
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,539
we recently saw a sneak preview of some

263
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:53,278
of the German laws and I was interested

264
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:56,399
to ask you as somebody who actually

265
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:58,379
holds sales and imports this where do

266
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,419
you think is currently producing the

267
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:02,100
best medical cannabis flower in Europe

268
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:04,139
is it the ornamental flower up in

269
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,879
Denmark is it the likes of material

270
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:07,458
ventures in Malta who are bringing in

271
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:10,919
low-cost product from South America

272
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:12,719
Portugal and where do you see the best

273
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:15,299
flower currently being made because we

274
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,560
saw the rules that the German law looks

275
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:18,299
like you have to cultivate within

276
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:20,939
Germany that it doesn't look like

277
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:23,519
there's going to be any Imports

278
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:27,180
yeah that's well now you're referring to

279
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,620
the bullet um points paper of the

280
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:31,079
government regarding the legalization

281
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:32,759
for the recreational market and that is

282
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,800
due to the international treaties that

283
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:36,179
we have the single U.N convention and

284
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:37,799
the Schengen treaty that we're not

285
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:39,359
allowed to import for recreational

286
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:42,559
purposes and we

287
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,480
will have to at least for the time being

288
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:47,819
cultivate in Germany that law may change

289
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,440
by the time they finally come to uh to

290
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,820
terms with legalization but let's say it

291
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,200
is that way

292
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,940
um that's only for recreational medical

293
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,920
cannabis will be still imported from

294
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,300
around the world

295
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:59,939
um currently I believe the best

296
00:10:57,299 --> 00:11:02,819
operation when you ask me in Europe

297
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:05,220
um we see very good reliable product

298
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,839
from Portugal again it depends who you

299
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:09,600
talk to Portugal and what

300
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:11,160
uh who your partners are we have a very

301
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,720
strong partner with the state-of-the-art

302
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:15,179
facility

303
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,980
um the best post Harvest services so we

304
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:18,539
get our product from Portugal we don't

305
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:23,039
also have products from Denmark from

306
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:24,659
Netherlands and um I believe and works

307
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:28,620
prone currently the opportunity to

308
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:31,620
import also from Switzerland eugnp the

309
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:34,919
main thing is it has to be really EU GMP

310
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:37,440
um and not just been let's say gcp grown

311
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:40,019
and then tried it packaged in a ugp

312
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,820
facility that's theoretically that's

313
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:43,740
enough but practically you have to look

314
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:46,620
at a couple of other aspects for it to

315
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:48,600
really match our quality standards okay

316
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,399
so that's a good bit of clarity so when

317
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,620
it comes to the medical cannabis you'll

318
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,299
still be able to import European

319
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,980
cultivated cannabis it's only the

320
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:58,500
recreational industry where it's going

321
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:01,019
to have to be cultivated within Germany

322
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,820
absolutely because the treaties stand

323
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:06,000
and we are already imported for the last

324
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:08,278
uh two three years um so this is a fact

325
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,860
that has been never challenged and uh

326
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:13,139
there was nobody who well in the right

327
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:17,039
mind would minimize the medical uh

328
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:19,259
market and uh providing to to patients

329
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:21,659
less product I mean we do have a tender

330
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:23,220
we had a tender we had three cultivators

331
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:25,199
in Germany who also provide to the

332
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,240
German Market at a set price

333
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,680
and that's fine and it's about two and a

334
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,019
half tons from what I understand per

335
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:34,019
year in an overall Market that has now

336
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:36,839
grown to around 10 tons of flour I think

337
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:39,240
we imported last year 20 tons but let's

338
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,800
say some of it has been extracted some

339
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,200
of it goes to other countries some of it

340
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:45,359
is being destroyed because of say end of

341
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,100
stability so around seven to ten tons

342
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,500
apparently last year were sold as dried

343
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,300
flower so there's two and a half tons

344
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:55,500
bedroom can there's two and a half tons

345
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:57,179
of German uh grown uh from dimikano or

346
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,519
nafria that leaves still at least five

347
00:12:57,179 --> 00:13:01,439
tons that need to be imported

348
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,560
in the growing market so we see a

349
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,240
tendency a necessity also to enable that

350
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:08,338
and just make sure that the quality

351
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,259
standards are being uh

352
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:11,339
say or people stick to the quality

353
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:13,200
standards

354
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:14,880
amazing I know you're a very busy manner

355
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,860
when you're reaching our time so I don't

356
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:19,320
keep it too much longer if you could

357
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,879
predict one good thing that you think is

358
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,680
going to happen in the German Market

359
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:24,059
over the next 12 months what would be

360
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:25,199
the one thing that you'd like to see

361
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:27,539
happen

362
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,339
yeah or the next 12 months well

363
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:31,078
hopefully they will go through from

364
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:33,660
discussing uh the law to actually

365
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:36,059
drafting the law and and passing it

366
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:38,639
through the Senate by Fall that would be

367
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:41,939
exactly 12 months then we would have uh

368
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:44,220
reached a lot and established a lot and

369
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:45,600
will be at a different place but in the

370
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:48,060
meantime I also believe there will be

371
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,740
home grow and Social Clubs so these are

372
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:50,699
things not necessarily

373
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,980
um

374
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:55,079
um best for the industry but good for

375
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:57,539
the patients and and and good for those

376
00:13:55,078 --> 00:13:59,278
who won't have access to the plant

377
00:13:57,539 --> 00:14:00,719
