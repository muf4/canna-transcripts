maybe want to give everybody a quick

30
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,519
little overview of how you got so

31
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:10,379
quickly to Bristol extracts and the the

32
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:12,239
original first step into the industry

33
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:14,158
yeah absolutely

34
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,919
um yeah thanks again for having me but

35
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:20,340
uh really started right place right time

36
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:23,219
in Boulder Colorado in 2009 a mutual

37
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,719
friend put me in touch with a guy who

38
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:26,640
was had started one of the first

39
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,560
dispensaries

40
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,540
um and I grow to support it he wanted to

41
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,640
do Edibles from the trim and that was

42
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:36,420
kind of the mindset on processing at the

43
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,219
time and then we ran with that

44
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,079
um he sold the dispensary in the grow a

45
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:43,500
couple years later we focused on the

46
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:46,279
brand marcaha out of uh Denver we moved

47
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,959
it to Denver then we expanded that in

48
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:52,879
2014 into the Nevada and Illinois

49
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:56,158
markets and really just owner operator

50
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:59,879
grew that we spun tree frog Consulting

51
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,560
off of that just as a small consulting

52
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:03,060
company that focused on processing we

53
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,859
always said from the plant was cut down

54
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,240
until products were shipped so we'd

55
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:07,978
worked with teams we were very

56
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,500
successful with the teams that we got

57
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:13,080
put in Medicine Man Technologies and

58
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,239
different security teams and uh we were

59
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,640
successful in winning applications uh

60
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:18,959
competitive application licenses in 10

61
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:21,779
states

62
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,539
um so it was a busy uh few years there

63
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:27,419
and then you know life changes and covet

64
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:29,579
happened and I grew up on the East Coast

65
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:33,238
um and I moved my family back here in

66
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:35,640
July of 2021 a year ago Bristol extracts

67
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:38,819
brought me on to help them enter into

68
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:42,139
the THC markets or Bristol extracts uh

69
00:02:38,818 --> 00:02:46,018
hemp cultivator and processor since 2018

70
00:02:42,139 --> 00:02:48,479
in Upstate New York uh grew 30 acres of

71
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:50,159
hemp for multiple years uh the hemp

72
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:53,699
Market kind of you know CBD markets in

73
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:57,060
the U.S have taken a big drop in the

74
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:58,919
last few years along with covid so they

75
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:02,098
pivoted brought myself in brought a

76
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:04,919
chemist in from Oakland California and

77
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:08,339
12 or 13 months later we were awarded

78
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:09,719
the conditional processor license and we

79
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,959
are anticipating the conditional

80
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:15,000
cultivator license uh in October so here

81
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,439
we are incredible that's the kind of

82
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,360
first topic I wanted to talk about so

83
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:20,340
you just recently got your NYS Auto to

84
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,440
use conditional processor license can

85
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,140
you maybe outline to everybody what does

86
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:27,840
that basically entail and allow Bristol

87
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:30,000
extracts to do in that stage yeah

88
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,019
absolutely so the conditional processor

89
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,219
license

90
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:38,340
um there was a lot of lobbying to allow

91
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:41,280
uh the hemp Growers and processors kind

92
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:44,039
of first run at the New York Market uh

93
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,539
that's one of the pillars of the these

94
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:48,179
conditional licenses the dispensary

95
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:49,859
license being the other for uh folks who

96
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,860
were directly impacted by the war on

97
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:55,620
drugs and so with the processor license

98
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:57,659
uh we qualified it for it for already

99
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,658
holding a hemp processor license and

100
00:03:57,658 --> 00:04:03,000
having a cgmp certified facility which

101
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:05,098
is a good manufacturing uh third-party

102
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,699
audit and certification

103
00:04:05,098 --> 00:04:08,759
um

104
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:11,280
so there are two tiers within even the

105
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:14,158
processor license uh one allows a

106
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,879
company to extract the plant biomass

107
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:20,519
into concentrates or extracts the other

108
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:22,740
simply allows you to manufacture so one

109
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,319
allows you to extract and manufacture

110
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:28,019
the other allows you to manufacture so

111
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:30,240
we are fortunate to be able to extract

112
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:33,899
and manufacture and goods and then

113
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,280
wholesale them to licensed dispensers in

114
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:37,258
the state of New York

115
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:39,000
okay incredible so you guys are going to

116
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:41,639
be one of the main players when it comes

117
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,319
to let's say an Edibles brand or a vape

118
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:45,060
brand to say they want to get into the

119
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:46,680
market you guys have the expertise for

120
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,199
them to be able to fulfill all their

121
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,660
needs all in one space sure and you know

122
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,699
we've been approached by uh several if

123
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:56,580
not dozens of

124
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:58,680
um West Coast Brands and some that I go

125
00:04:56,579 --> 00:05:01,978
back a long time with and very

126
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:05,220
successful Brands Bristol has not

127
00:05:01,978 --> 00:05:06,899
licensed or chosen to license these or

128
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,600
work with these brands at this point

129
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:13,258
kind of our philosophy right now is the

130
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,900
next 12 to 24 maybe more months in New

131
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:17,040
York are going to be difficult it's as

132
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:20,159
the market

133
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:22,139
we see how these dispensaries open what

134
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,759
kind of capital there is uh to even

135
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:25,379
purchase wholesale

136
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,120
we don't really want to bring other

137
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:29,819
people to the table I don't know how

138
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,079
great of Partners we would be or anyone

139
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:34,079
would be that

140
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:35,939
as the chaos of the Market opening

141
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,339
happens you know I've been through this

142
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:41,038
uh three times now and then a couple

143
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:42,839
other times as a consultant

144
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:45,240
um you know there it's just one strategy

145
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:47,219
you know the other uh folks that have

146
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,918
these licenses are choosing to license

147
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:53,000
Brands and you know that they may be

148
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:53,000
successful doing it so

149
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:58,139
and bring them out

150
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,079
to see what happens in the future and

151
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:02,819
how many New York auto processor

152
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:04,258
licenses are there going to be so you

153
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:06,800
said there's tier one and two tier are

154
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:10,500
they split evenly 50 50.

155
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:13,978
I believe it was if you had a cgmp

156
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:16,978
certified extraction room prior to

157
00:06:13,978 --> 00:06:18,418
January 1st of this year then you could

158
00:06:16,978 --> 00:06:20,339
roll that into the conditioner

159
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:23,758
conditional process if you were awarded

160
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:25,560
that license there's 39 total

161
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,900
um at least that's the last number that

162
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,699
I had read about a month ago 39

163
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:32,279
potential processor a conditional

164
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:34,139
processor licenses in New York I want to

165
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:35,579
say it's roughly half of those of a

166
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:38,579
little less

167
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:40,918
um can also extract but those numbers do

168
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:42,659
change a little and so

169
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:46,500
you know and then there's a smaller

170
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:49,380
number of you know let's say it's 20

171
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,959
that can extract and manufacture I

172
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:55,019
believe there's like 12 to 14 that can

173
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:57,779
also grow out of those companies

174
00:06:55,019 --> 00:07:00,299
um which is you know great but it's also

175
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:01,859
a lot of it's it's a lot of balls in the

176
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,900
air it's very

177
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,699
advances so sometimes you get what you

178
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:08,239
ask for you know especially when the

179
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:10,319
Market's not open and we don't know

180
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,780
really when the Market's going to be

181
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,419
open we hear it's going to be open

182
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:16,918
December of 22. I think that we can all

183
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:19,978
agree that that it's not going to happen

184
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:22,198
maybe there's a political uh uh hey we

185
00:07:19,978 --> 00:07:24,779
awarded we awarded licenses in this year

186
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:28,080
and that's great and good for them

187
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:31,619
um but an actual operational Market is

188
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:33,839
is several months out

189
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,098
yeah it's uh it's definitely going to be

190
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:36,839
interesting to see I think I was reading

191
00:07:35,098 --> 00:07:39,060
something in the last 48ers about that

192
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:40,560
they're gonna have 900 different uh

193
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,680
dispensaries it's going to be

194
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,660
interesting to see the the shareholding

195
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,579
how many individual entrepreneurs are

196
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,860
there how much capital is is brought to

197
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:51,538
the market initially at phase one but I

198
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,038
think the it vertically integrated

199
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:54,719
companies like you just kind of

200
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:56,399
described there I think he's seeing

201
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,500
candidate that that didn't work his

202
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:00,418
specialization seems to be the key to

203
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,759
any successful business in any industry

204
00:08:00,418 --> 00:08:04,139
and I I think a few New York companies

205
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:05,160
might learn that the hard way like

206
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:08,280
Canada

207
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,900
yeah I I mean the Cannabis industry in

208
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,638
general has taken a lot of bumps and

209
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:14,098
bruises here it's kind of correcting to

210
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:16,978
pre-covet plus some

211
00:08:14,098 --> 00:08:18,659
um and you know money is a little more

212
00:08:16,978 --> 00:08:20,939
expensive to come by these days and it's

213
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,759
a very Capital intensive

214
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:25,620
um business and the goal over these next

215
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:29,098
two years is that the state will issue

216
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:32,278
150 dispensary licenses

217
00:08:29,098 --> 00:08:35,639
um but I mean you can do a whole episode

218
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:37,979
on how dazny and the New York state ocm

219
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:40,199
is a licensing these dispensaries and

220
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:42,778
how they're it's a public-private fund

221
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,278
to help get them going and there's a lot

222
00:08:42,778 --> 00:08:49,019
of you know

223
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:50,700
it's it's a great uh Equity focused

224
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:52,440
um something different than any other

225
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,740
state has done I think we all support

226
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:58,740
that there is also the reality

227
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:00,480
of business that we really are looking

228
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:04,200
for more of a communication between

229
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,700
licensed industry and state government

230
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,459
um because you have a thriving gray

231
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:11,100
Market in New York and you know it's

232
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:12,659
legal no one should be arrested for for

233
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,540
marijuana

234
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:17,159
um but there is a challenge of when you

235
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:19,019
have tax paying companies and companies

236
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:21,838
with massive overhead competing with

237
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:24,120
companies that are selling

238
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,700
product that they're not paying any

239
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,620
permit fees or license fees and that's a

240
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,839
that's a big Rubik Cube that will see

241
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,580
how New York

242
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:34,740
uh how they handle that you know yeah

243
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:36,420
well I was over in New York there in May

244
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,180
and I was actually blown away but they

245
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:42,539
went to CBD stores that had cookies and

246
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:44,699
all sorts of different uh brands from

247
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:46,379
the West Coast not under the trucks as

248
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,300
well but we we did an all episode in the

249
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:49,620
license and the trucks just to clarify

250
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:51,659
one thing you said the government to

251
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,879
look at open up 150 dispensary license

252
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:55,139
is that the equity licenses that they're

253
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:57,539
given to basically people who've been

254
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:59,759
penalized by law that's right so they

255
00:09:57,539 --> 00:10:02,278
that window just closed in the last I

256
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:03,559
think 48 hours they received 908

257
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:06,360
applications

258
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:09,719
250 licenses will be issued out of that

259
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:12,120
pool there will be what's being referred

260
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,800
to as standard licenses issued in the

261
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,440
future I think that the last Chris

262
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:18,599
Alexander executive director of the ocm

263
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:22,019
said that those would be their timeline

264
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,159
now is kind of mid mid next year so who

265
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:26,879
knows

266
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:29,278
um so we're still years out from the

267
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:31,139
real standard Mark what that's going to

268
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:32,759
look like how many of those licenses are

269
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:34,319
they going to give out per tier what

270
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:35,278
restrictions are they going to have on

271
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,920
them

272
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:39,240
um this first wave that's at least two

273
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:42,299
years long

274
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:45,959
the hemp Growers uh I think last count

275
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:48,359
there were 300 around 300 licenses

276
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:51,299
issued Maybe

277
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,680
200 plus of those got plants in the

278
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:55,199
ground

279
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:58,620
um and then the light the processor

280
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,940
licenses I think there's 22 issued as of

281
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,278
today so

282
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,540
yeah it's it's very exciting I used to

283
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:05,278
live in New York it's that I'm gonna

284
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:06,958
have my eye on continuously over the

285
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:09,360
next couple of years but if ever there's

286
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:11,099
an estate with a multitude of different

287
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,778
nationality and entrepreneurs and

288
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,879
connections that there won't be just one

289
00:11:12,778 --> 00:11:17,220
size fits all in that one that's so

290
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:20,639
exciting you nailed it I mean I lived in

291
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:23,160
Denver the Last 22 years of my life and

292
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:25,019
you know and I moved to Rochester New

293
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:26,819
York so we're I'm six hours five and a

294
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:30,778
half hours from the city down there

295
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:32,820
every couple months but um just the uh

296
00:11:30,778 --> 00:11:34,860
the diversity but also just the

297
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:37,620
interaction with people is is different

298
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,720
in New York I mean people want to

299
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:42,299
network they want to talk they want to

300
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:46,019
learn I mean they have hustle and it's

301
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:48,059
it's really refreshing to see

302
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:50,039
yeah it is it's one of the few places

303
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:51,659
that I've noticed as well where some of

304
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:53,699
the guys from the banking and finance

305
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:54,958
industry are posting about the Meetup

306
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,640
events that they're having and they're

307
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:57,958
all they're all smoking away whereas

308
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,399
they seem to be a lot of more churches

309
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:01,799
are more refined and don't seem to be as

310
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:02,639
braggadocious I think New York is going

311
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:04,979
to have

312
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:07,379
the shoulders swing and then there won't

313
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,820
be any apologetic Behavior or a new

314
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:11,399
billion dollar industry coming to the

315
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:13,980
city yeah I mean people are bold and

316
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:15,179
it's exciting man I mean even even the

317
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,740
well I don't know what you call it now

318
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:18,239
the gray Market I don't think it's

319
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,560
called The Legacy Market I think that's

320
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,839
something different that's my personal

321
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:23,518
belief but like that's exciting and

322
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,680
that's amazing and what a world to live

323
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,740
in that people are not being arrested

324
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:30,958
for cannabis it's the you know it's the

325
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:33,419
job of these municipalities and the

326
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:35,099
government to what do they want this to

327
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,719
be and they want it to be taxed they

328
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:39,480
want it to be regulated they want it to

329
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,820
be licensed so how are they going to to

330
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:44,339
manage that you know for companies like

331
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:47,399
us that will be hit with 280e tax

332
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:49,500
federal tax which is substantial I mean

333
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:51,778
it's hard to be a profitable cannabis

334
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,578
industry in the United States

335
00:12:51,778 --> 00:12:57,059
um you know that I think I just read

336
00:12:53,578 --> 00:13:00,120
last night that with the the top 10 or

337
00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:01,439
12 msos in the country only one of them

338
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,459
is profitable

339
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:09,060
um but they collectively owe the IRS

340
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:11,578
over uh 550 million dollars and they're

341
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:13,500
choosing to just take the interest rate

342
00:13:11,578 --> 00:13:15,958
that the that the government will give

343
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:18,480
them on paying back those taxes rather

344
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:20,159
than borrowing money or selling assets

345
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,860
to pay it off because it's cheaper to do

346
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:24,419
that but I mean that's those chickens

347
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,820
will come home to Roots like that's

348
00:13:24,419 --> 00:13:28,319
that's a house cards you know yeah and

349
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,639
that's even something like truly would

350
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,440
have been swimming in cash if it were

351
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:33,899
not for the recent acquisition that

352
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,519
whoever was in charge of that one should

353
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:38,100
be losing their head as far as I'm

354
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,860
concerned so you know I bring that up

355
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:43,259
because for us where we're at right now

356
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:45,360
we have a 20 000 square foot facility we

357
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:46,200
have 30 acres of land

358
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,600
um

359
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,459
we have a lot of overhead you know we

360
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,980
have product lines we're developing out

361
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:54,958
Brands we're unloading more equipment

362
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:58,320
and more extractions very Capital

363
00:13:54,958 --> 00:14:00,479
intensive but the goal is to keep it as

364
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,760
lean as possible and that goes the lead

365
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,399
manufacturing of you know the Six Sigma

366
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:08,220
mentality using Consultants to help our

367
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:10,200
current team but also not trying to do

368
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:12,360
everything at once it's a long game you

369
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,100
know it's going to be years before this

370
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,800
Market is open

371
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:19,200
um so how do we strategize and approach

372
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:21,778
that by by staying profitable

373
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:24,019
yeah staying a little bit hungry and a

374
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:26,338
little bit cold I think is the the

375
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:28,379
motherboard cannabis business for the

376
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:30,060
next few years I think you know to be

377
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:31,559
getting too comfortable I've got so many

378
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:32,638
things that I didn't get to talk to you

379
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:33,778
about because we're nearing the time but

380
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,839
there's one thing I definitely did want

381
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:41,759
to ask you've won the Cannabis Cup twice

382
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:42,959
uh those both generic wins and uh yeah

383
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:45,059
so we

384
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:47,099
um we because I don't want to take all

385
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:49,439
the credit I had a with the company mark

386
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,940
haha we we won two medals which are on

387
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,220
the wall behind me I'm super proud of

388
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:56,339
the team that did that those were both

389
00:14:53,220 --> 00:15:00,420
Edibles that was our focus at the time

390
00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:02,279
um that was 2013 and 14 I believe in

391
00:15:00,419 --> 00:15:05,039
Denver Colorado

392
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:08,759
um one was a drink a blueberry chamomile

393
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:11,219
and one was a gummy I believe with so

394
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:13,319
many products um but we had a great team

395
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:16,440
there that company I had my core

396
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:18,660
management team for nine years uh you

397
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,300
know I was with that that you know

398
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:23,819
founded and and was grew that company

399
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:26,159
for over 11 years

400
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:28,920
