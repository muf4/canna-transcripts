you can hear I'm

15
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:48,920
French uh I'm a faradi with 10 years

16
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:51,198
experience in canabo especially CBD so I

17
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,719
discovered canabo 10 years ago in

18
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:57,280
California and I bring it to Switzerland

19
00:00:53,719 --> 00:01:00,320
where I start my company so uh we I was

20
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,679
involved so the seed to extract uh we

21
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,280
have our hor plant we made our hor

22
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:08,079
extract and uh then we uh distribute

23
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,200
this extract and we have the first one

24
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:13,560
to do that in Pharmacy in Switzerland so

25
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,799
this Pharmacy is Pharmacy benu it's a

26
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:20,759
chain of Pharmacy of 1,500 Pharmacy so

27
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:22,640
after this Swiss experience uh I was

28
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,759
focused on French market and I'm working

29
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:29,000
on French market now since two years as

30
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,840
a advisor from my company advisor for

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,519
pharmaceutical labs

32
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:37,520
uh so some are famous some are less

33
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:40,399
famous so I quick explain a quick uh

34
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:43,359
little quick explanation about my job so

35
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:45,718
the the first part uh what I'm doing is

36
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:48,159
uh to advise to have good quality

37
00:01:45,718 --> 00:01:51,359
product which uh which is super

38
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,439
important at the moment uh to to have a

39
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:56,039
really good quality product so I I go to

40
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:58,879
choose raw materials producer

41
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:02,840
manufacturer I advise for example about

42
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:07,158
the low regulation I work so with uh

43
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:11,000
marketing department or um scientific

44
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:14,200
Department as well and uh and two I how

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,400
to make promotion in Pharmacy so it's a

46
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:19,719
free really 360 service the second part

47
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,200
which is really crucial for me and I

48
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:25,318
introduce that a bit later than the

49
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:27,839
first part it's to train pharmacist I

50
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:31,359
realize that training pharmacist it's

51
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,479
really uh the key for CBD success and

52
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,959
especially in Pharmacy because the

53
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:40,639
pharmacist miss a bit the train actually

54
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:43,120
compared to uh CBD shop or over sailers

55
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:45,238
and they are scientist and they realize

56
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,280
that they have a lack of knowledge at

57
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:50,319
this moment and they really want to

58
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,280
increase their knowledge about CBD

59
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:57,598
product and especially about over the

60
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,959
the counter CBD product so uh I will

61
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:02,799
start to to talk about the French

62
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:05,959
cannabis now Market in France where we

63
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,879
are a little quick update so that's

64
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:10,199
basically an incredible career you had

65
00:03:07,878 --> 00:03:11,919
to date the first topic that I wanted to

66
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:13,359
talk about was an update on medical

67
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:16,439
cannabis in France and if you could

68
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:20,120
maybe give everybody a breakdown of what

69
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:21,959
the size of the market is um yeah where

70
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,959
where it's alled to be prescribed what

71
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:26,360
conditions are included and any other

72
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:28,759
perent information that you think yeah

73
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,920
sure sure sure sure

74
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:34,399
sure

75
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:38,359
so about French uh cannabis in France so

76
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,519
uh the French medical cannabis right now

77
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,400
so after the experimentation during

78
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:45,759
three years

79
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,840
uh Pharmacy will be allowed next year

80
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:50,479
for

81
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:52,280
2025 uh to deliver CBD product on

82
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:57,039
prescription so it will concern for

83
00:03:52,280 --> 00:04:00,878
example like high CBD do or THC actually

84
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:03,239
what you can find uh on on the mark Mark

85
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:07,280
concern and especially in Pharmacy or

86
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:10,360
even in shop it's low CBD product okay

87
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,959
so this this kind of product are allowed

88
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:17,959
under two main condition so it's a daily

89
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:20,639
dose of 50 milligrams so per day and a

90
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:23,519
concentration of Maximum 20% with

91
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,720
sublingual oils for example so this

92
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:29,680
these two main condition are from the DG

93
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:33,240
DG guidelines it's a governmental

94
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:36,160
organism attached to health Ministry so

95
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:39,478
it's a bit better because it brings more

96
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:42,280
clarity for the market and uh we cannot

97
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:45,279
Ure CBD product low lowd do CBD product

98
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:48,918
because actually it concern six millions

99
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:51,719
people in France so uh it's a big

100
00:04:48,918 --> 00:04:54,799
challenge it's a challenge for pharmacy

101
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:57,919
uh to to distribute this kind of of

102
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,478
product uh why because most of customers

103
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:03,159
at the moment find their product using

104
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:06,680
internet or they go in a CBD shop or

105
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,919
even in tobacco shop so with potential

106
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:12,478
quality issues so there's no tracability

107
00:05:08,918 --> 00:05:16,799
there's poor advice or there's even not

108
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:19,079
at all advice by seller at the moment so

109
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,918
this this is a big problem the quality

110
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:23,318
is a big problem at the moment the

111
00:05:20,918 --> 00:05:25,680
traceability of the product has a big

112
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:28,280
problem and there's a really interesting

113
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,280
studies about Mila or Mila it's an

114
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:32,879
organism attached to our prime minister

115
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:36,519
uh it's really important organism in

116
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:38,680
France uh about drugs and addiction and

117
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:40,918
the their mission is to fight against

118
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:45,000
drug and addictive behavior and they

119
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:48,079
made in 2023 a study about CBD product

120
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,240
and the result was just a catastrophe

121
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:54,038
like 80% of CBD product actually in

122
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:57,400
France are not compant they don't answer

123
00:05:54,038 --> 00:06:00,519
to what they propose this is the

124
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:02,758
situation on about a French medical

125
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:06,198
cannabis right

126
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:09,879
now very interesting um when it comes to

127
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:11,879
the numbers of patience how far are you

128
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:14,038
guys behind let's say Germany or how far

129
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:16,719
you head from the UK is there a specific

130
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:19,800
number that everybody knows

131
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:23,720
of uh how far I I I don't really know

132
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:27,360
about how far we are compared to uh uh

133
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:29,560
German or or or UK uh I think we are a

134
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,960
bit late compared to this Market as

135
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:36,240
especially UK uh but uh we start to uh

136
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:40,159
with this kind of guideline what I told

137
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:43,079
you which now since one year I think we

138
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:46,800
the market are increasing uh I

139
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:50,038
bet it's it will increase in the next

140
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,478
months or the next years uh through and

141
00:06:50,038 --> 00:06:52,759
I'm particularly sure about that through

142
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:56,478
the

143
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:58,520
pharmacy and do you see the one of the

144
00:06:56,478 --> 00:07:01,000
areas of growth happening within France

145
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:02,598
is the discovery of formulations and

146
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,399
some of the big biotech and farmer

147
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:06,360
companies able to find these perfect

148
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:08,359
blends of cannaboids and Turpin to be

149
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:12,080
able to deliver a finished product to

150
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,720
the market so yeah maybe probably I

151
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:16,639
don't know I I don't have a crystal bow

152
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,560
for that but what I what I'm sure it's

153
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,319
like we need to to

154
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,199
work of course about the quality but

155
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:26,280
about for about the bu avability of the

156
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:28,560
product so I'm always looking for for

157
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:31,559
example for really good materials and

158
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,519
create pills or or tablets to increase

159
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:37,199
the the B availability but at the moment

160
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:39,959
if we talk about for example teint or

161
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:43,120
CBG or CBN to Pharmacy I think it's a

162
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:46,878
bit early we're at early stage of to

163
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:49,158
introduce CBD in Pharmacy so um let's

164
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,840
let's you have to be simple for moment

165
00:07:49,158 --> 00:07:55,560
to train Pharmacy so to be simple it's

166
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:57,638
CBD okay they they are okay now with CBD

167
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:01,319
like if you talk to a pharmacist three

168
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:02,918
four years uh earlier about CBD uh they

169
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:05,400
they will they will not take you

170
00:08:02,918 --> 00:08:07,038
seriously now they take you seriously so

171
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:10,878
it's a first step it's a it's a main

172
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:14,318
step that uh we are doing and and maybe

173
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:16,960
later and I hope we will introduce a bit

174
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,879
more uh interesting product maybe with

175
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:23,680
CBG with CBN and uh depends about the

176
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:25,599
regulation too so let's see as you were

177
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,240
stating one of the big hurdles seems to

178
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:29,120
be the educating of doctors and

179
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,800
pharmacies can you maybe tell us about

180
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,200
some of the work that you're currently

181
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,759
doing when it comes to uh bring this

182
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,640
forward in France yeah yeah yeah yeah

183
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:40,759
yeah H how how is I told before when I

184
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:42,799
was presenting myself so one of the big

185
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:45,759
part of the job is quality the second

186
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:49,120
big part is education education

187
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:52,319
pharmacist so uh what I I'm doing right

188
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,639
now for example so I'm doing training

189
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,000
live training so tomorrow I'm going in a

190
00:08:54,639 --> 00:09:00,240
city close to m city and I'm going to

191
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,839
train a group between 30 and 4 Pharmacy

192
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,720
during the afternoon so how to use CBD

193
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:09,800
product uh in the pharmacy so it will be

194
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:12,680
super interesting for them M for me um

195
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:14,679
and two I'm doing online training um I

196
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:18,159
didn't think that it would be it will be

197
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:20,519
so s successful I'm really surprised uh

198
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:22,919
and uh they they are they are super

199
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:26,039
interesting most of them are pharmacist

200
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:28,399
manager which are are coming so it's not

201
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:32,799
just the the second or third hand of the

202
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:35,839
pharmacy uh so yeah and um uh if they

203
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:38,719
realize that they have to offer

204
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:41,519
complient products and to advise a

205
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,560
patient uh they realize that CBD

206
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:48,399
customers need strong support even for

207
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:51,639
lowd CBD uh quality okay is crucial but

208
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:55,440
offering correct advice to patient I

209
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:58,078
realize is vital uh so for example for

210
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,839
example if I I tell you some training

211
00:09:58,078 --> 00:10:03,359
goals I will tell you some

212
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:06,680
about our training uh it's first how to

213
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:09,519
identify good product so provide Basics

214
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:13,000
on cannabinoids to to to make difference

215
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:16,560
between CBD THC broad spectrum full

216
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:20,120
spectrum or even the the vehicles use

217
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:22,958
the oil vehicle which is used in product

218
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:25,839
um and and one of the main parts and I

219
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:28,958
realize too that uh Make This Little

220
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,760
Light in the brain of of the pharmacist

221
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:32,879
not to talk directly about the product

222
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:35,200
yeah like this is better than the other

223
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:36,759
okay it's one point but what they are

224
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,800
really interesting at the moment it's

225
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:42,679
the Uno canab system we are super

226
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:48,159
interesting so about how CBD can Works

227
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:51,799
uh in the body so uh why it's A New Path

228
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:53,039
of healing actually so integrate CBD

229
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:56,159
product into

230
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:58,679
Pharmacy recommendation uh with several

231
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:00,759
practical case are really interesting

232
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:02,759
for them to because they just hear about

233
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:04,919
cbbd okay it's too calm or something

234
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:07,838
like that may I introduce that they can

235
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:10,679
use or they can advise CBD for

236
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:13,920
inflammatory uh problems or to prevent

237
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:17,479
inflammatory problems or about immunity

238
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:20,639
and it's it's open really a large a

239
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:23,519
large possibility for them the Synergy

240
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:25,399
of CBD with other products too so they

241
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,240
they are super interesting to to keep

242
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:30,000
back the the market in in in their

243
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,759
Pharmacy and that's my goal actually

244
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,958
it's my goal CBD in pharmacy even low do

245
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:39,559
uh another another point where I I

246
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:42,599
really push on it it's to raise

247
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:45,199
awareness about interaction because like

248
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:49,360
okay CBD at 50 milligrams a day it's

249
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:52,839
safe everybody is C about quite safe but

250
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,600
you you are not um it's possible there's

251
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:56,959
some Auto medication at home and to

252
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,959
double or triple ver do is quite easily

253
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:03,319
and at this problem like CBD it's it's

254
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:05,719
an inhibitor of ctoom P 450 so uh it's

255
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:08,480
it could be a subject of many

256
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:11,680
interaction so that that's really the

257
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:14,159
role the role of the pharmacist to to

258
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:18,120
prevent people about that only only a

259
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:21,759
pharmacist can do that uh so yeah so we

260
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:24,560
we insist on the quality we insist uh on

261
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:27,679
uh how to advise and for me both points

262
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:30,479
are really crucial about prescription or

263
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:33,638
non-prescription CBD and about the CBD

264
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,039
in general CBD future so yeah I can I

265
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:37,639
can conclude that but education

266
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:41,879
education is the

267
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:44,759
key when it comes to the CBD is it just

268
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:47,120
coming from plant matter so it's 95% or

269
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:49,559
is it an applied pharmaceutical radient

270
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,720
where it's around 99%

271
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:55,719
Purity um it depends about it depends

272
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:59,320
about the prod of sure CBD at 99% it

273
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:01,199
will be more interesting uh uh uh than

274
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:04,360
pure CBD it's more interesting but it

275
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:07,359
depends if you if you promote

276
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:10,199
oils and you work with a broad spectrum

277
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,959
CBD it should be really interesting uh

278
00:13:10,198 --> 00:13:15,879
about the Entourage effect so it's it's

279
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:18,638
another subject because I'm not against

280
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:21,919
this theory of Entourage effect but I'm

281
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:24,560
not pro about this theory of Entourage

282
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:26,599
effect it could be used in a bad way

283
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:28,518
like in a marketing way okay there's

284
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,320
probably a Synergy between cannabinoid

285
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:32,639
so it's could be interesting there's

286
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,800
some different canabo working together

287
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,680
I'm okay with that but this magic effect

288
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:40,039
like I don't really like the magic you

289
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:42,479
know magic is not it's not

290
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:46,679
pharmaceutical uh the other way what I'm

291
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:49,360
waiting really strongly it's the API uh

292
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:51,879
CBD so you have some now on the market

293
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,199
uh for me and they are a bit overpriced

294
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:56,240
but it will come it will decrease I bet

295
00:13:54,198 --> 00:13:58,559
with the time and it should be really

296
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,959
interesting to to maybe to have more

297
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:04,879
quality product and I already heard

298
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:08,399
about some different CBD natural one

299
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:11,480
that the bio avability can be um

300
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,039
increase by two or 2.5 and I'm super

301
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,480
interested about this kind of product

302
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:18,759
that I can I can promote to some

303
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:22,199
manufacturer in France and then after to

304
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:24,600
create a really nice uh drug on

305
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:26,479
prescription or without

306
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,159
prescription it's been absolutely

307
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,480
fantastic I'm talking to you Julian it's

308

310
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:35,359
going to be a big prominent Market when

311
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,959
the whole medical landscape is uh is

312
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,919
developing and evolving over the next

313
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:41,479
