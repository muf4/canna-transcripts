00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:32,039
maybe give everybody a quick little

14
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:33,600
overview of how you came to work with

15
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:36,179
them and how you dipped your toe into

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,219
the Cannabis industry yeah so your

17
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:40,378
honors uh what we call a strategic

18
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,660
research agency so that means we produce

19
00:00:40,378 --> 00:00:44,280
kind of data on an annual basis and

20
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:46,439
across range of Industries we're not

21
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,620
like a tactical agency so we don't have

22
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:51,299
Scan data like a Nielsen Woods uh we're

23
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:54,419
not doing kind of big consumer tracker

24
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:56,099
panels Etc but we produce kind of annual

25
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,800
data sets on about 30 different

26
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,079
Industries I was started working for

27
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,659
your manager about a decade ago kind of

28
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,579
fell into it by accident it was uh doing

29
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:07,798
some legal training

30
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:09,780
um by background and kind of took a

31
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,420
break from that and ended up starting to

32
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,579
work uh temporarily where what I thought

33
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,519
was temporarily and then I started

34
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:21,060
working within the tobacco space

35
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:22,679
um and until about 2016 I was doing that

36
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,240
exclusively looking at the tobacco

37
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,740
industry sort of seeing kind of the

38
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,780
clients we have on the tobacco side

39
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:29,699
which are a mix of

40
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,739
kind of industry clients so the big

41
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,960
tobacco companies but also some of the

42
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:36,060
the public health agencies

43
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:39,478
um governments Etc

44
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,680
um and then in around 2016-17 I started

45
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:43,200
looking at the Cannabis industry

46
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,600
initially from the perspective of what

47
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,600
impact legalization that space was going

48
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:50,578
to have on on the tobacco space but I

49
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:52,259
very kind of quickly realized that you

50
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:53,578
know the Cannabis industry was something

51
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:55,618
that was going to be extremely

52
00:01:53,578 --> 00:01:57,959
meaningful across a range of the

53
00:01:55,618 --> 00:01:59,640
industries that we look at Within within

54
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:01,140
Euro monitor

55
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,060
um and you know a lot of the kind of

56
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,739
structural problems if you want to put

57
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,600
it that way

58
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:08,159
um that we were seeing in Industries

59
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:09,478
like tobacco but not language it's

60
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:11,759
tobacco if you look at things like

61
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,440
alcoholic drinks you know consumer

62
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,719
health

63
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:18,840
um you know all those kind of those big

64
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:21,479
monolithic Legacy Industries you know

65
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,920
consumers were disillusioned with what

66
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:25,079
those industries were producing what

67
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:27,000
those companies were

68
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,219
um we're delivering you know if you look

69
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,139
at you know to a certain extent tobacco

70
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:32,459
but but you know you can see it very

71
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:34,679
clearly I think the alcoholic drinks

72
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:37,140
industry some of those big alcoholic

73
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,599
drinks producers are really kind of an

74
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:42,119
exercise in financial engineering as

75
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:44,399
much as you know kind of delivering to

76
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:48,239
what consumers really really want and

77
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,459
need and we kind of very quickly

78
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,319
um came to the conclusion that the the

79
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:54,060
legal cannabis Industries it then was

80
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,219
had a lot of potential to kind of

81
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,800
address a lot of these kind of issues

82
00:02:56,219 --> 00:03:00,419
that consumers had with existing kind of

83
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,019
product offerings across a range of

84
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:06,238
spaces so we kind of myself and in

85
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:08,280
particular my equivalent on on the ad

86
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,019
side Spirit smile and drakas kind of

87
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,699
started to developing the the research

88
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:15,300
we were doing on the Cannabis space

89
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:17,399
almost in our spare time really

90
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,739
um and started to kind of expand and

91
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,360
unwiden that we began to work with

92
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,759
clients in that space it took a lot of

93
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,800
persuading internally in the company

94
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:27,899
um but this was something that was kind

95
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,900
of serious that had commercial potential

96
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:33,959
for us Etc and we've now brought a Ford

97
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:36,959
kind of from that sort of start and

98
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:39,239
about 2016 to here where we now have a

99
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,739
kind of fully fledged cannabis database

100
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,599
that sits alongside all of the other

101
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:43,620
data sets that we have within the

102
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:45,840
company

103
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,180
I always tell people you know one of the

104
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,439
things that obviously the industry talks

105
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,019
about a lot and that we talk about in

106
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:53,340
the industry is the idea of normalizing

107
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:55,920
cannabis but I mean within Euro monetary

108
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,959
cannabis is now and quite proud and

109
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,219
pleased to say fully normalized it sits

110
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:01,378
alongside all of those other industries

111
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:03,780
that we research

112
00:04:01,378 --> 00:04:05,158
um and we try to look at the kind of a

113
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,719
space as an industry in its own right

114
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:09,719
but also through the lands of those

115
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:11,219
other Industries as well very good for

116
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:13,139
somebody as big as you guys I'm sure

117
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:14,818
like cannabis after a little bit of of

118
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:16,738
niggling with the bosses I know you guys

119
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:20,099
were set up in the 70s which is a good

120
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:21,839
while ago that kind of across consumer

121
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,060
package Goods such as across

122
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,039
Pharmaceuticals Cosmetics there's a

123
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:28,199
number of different disciplines so how

124
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,759
quickly did you guys get into the the

125
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,919
Run of things have been able to create

126
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,860
reports was it a year or two of due

127
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:36,539
diligence or was it a a information that

128
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,160
is already stacked up in time for the

129
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:40,500
first report what was kind of the

130
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,840
process of getting the the sector a Euro

131
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,000
monitor off the ground yeah

132
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:46,258
um I mean the first thing for us that we

133
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,199
really wanted to do was kind of

134
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:51,500
understand the industry very well I mean

135
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,780
as I said I did a lot of the work with

136
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:56,939
Spirits as someone who uses cannabis uh

137
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:58,258
you know me not so much but we were

138
00:04:56,939 --> 00:05:00,300
coming at it from different angles and

139
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:01,800
we really wanted to understand you know

140
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,720
the industry in terms of the regulation

141
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,160
around the space

142
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,660
um you know what companies that are

143
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,580
currently operating or at that time

144
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,080
we're currently operating in in the

145
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:12,240
industry what you know what they're set

146
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,758
up like what they do how they produce we

147
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,699
want to supply Finance all of that sort

148
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:19,020
of stuff so you turn sometimes due

149
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:21,120
diligence which is basically doing a

150
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:24,359
research I mean we're a research agency

151
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,978
so that's what you know we were

152
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,740
um we started off doing was just making

153
00:05:25,978 --> 00:05:30,719
sure that we fully understood

154
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,639
um the industry speaking to people that

155
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,259
you know we reached out to all anyone

156
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,478
and everyone that we could find working

157
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:37,979
in the space who would speak to us

158
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:39,418
um to get a sense of what the industry

159
00:05:37,978 --> 00:05:41,279
looked like and we went to some of those

160
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:43,560
early conferences

161
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:45,059
um that were often and around in London

162
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,978
and so on

163
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,660
um to get a handle on it and then after

164
00:05:46,978 --> 00:05:50,459
about six months or a year or so we

165
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,840
started really writing some of the

166
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:53,758
briefing work that we were doing and

167
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:56,939
working more closely with clients and I

168
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:59,038
think you know as you said what sets us

169
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:00,240
apart I guess is that we have cannabis

170
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:02,099
sitting alongside all those other

171
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,439
Industries you know there are a lot of

172
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,419
very good research agencies and data

173
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:09,779
providers particularly in North America

174
00:06:06,418 --> 00:06:12,478
obviously who are providing very very

175
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:15,839
granular data from this industry that's

176
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:18,240
not something we do but what we can do

177
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:21,119
um is put cannabis in the context of all

178
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,740
of the other kind of consumer verticals

179
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,360
that there are and you know consumers

180
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,460
are neither one thing or another

181
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,660
exclusively Economist consumer is not

182
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:29,399
just consuming cannabis they're

183
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:32,039
obviously consuming other areas as well

184
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:33,779
there's obviously the potential

185
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:36,418
I think most importantly or most

186
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:39,299
crucially we feel for phenomenally to

187
00:06:36,418 --> 00:06:40,799
compete with products that are existing

188
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,660
in other areas and kind of win over

189
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,520
consumers who are already consuming

190
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:47,160
those spaces so we started looking you

191
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:48,599
know those adjacent Industries

192
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,939
um you know particularly things like

193
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,340
obviously tobacco alcohol consumer

194
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:55,139
health as well you know packaged Foods

195
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:57,239
those kind of spaces the soft drinks

196
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:59,939
industry and bringing all of that into

197
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,519
into the equation as well

198
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:03,839
yeah I've been looking at this industry

199
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:06,000
for a couple of years now and kind of

200
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:08,579
started this off as a data Gathering

201
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,560
exercise to see who was full of [ __ ] who

202
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:12,599
was into or The Operators who was and

203
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,280
and it seems to me that we're splitting

204
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,960
into the industry North America's got

205
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:17,399
their whole industry book the way it

206
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:19,859
looks to me is that Europe is going to

207
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:21,299
turn into biotech companies and

208
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:24,300
synthetic cannabinoids are going to

209
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,860
dominate Cosmetics food and beverage uh

210
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,660
Vapes tinctures a number of other

211
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,460
different projects purely because the

212
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,860
molecule is safe it's replicable a

213
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:34,318
million times over it has to pass the

214
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:36,840
stringent of rules and it looks now even

215
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,939
with Germany's uh announcement there

216
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:40,739
last week that I always read that the

217
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:42,300
social club model was where the wreck

218
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:44,160
industry was going we were never going

219
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,319
to have these dispensary stores all over

220
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,900
Europe that it seems to be that the

221
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,580
European industry is now splitting into

222
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:53,279
farm and biotech dominating the

223
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:55,620
ingredients side of things and then the

224
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:57,899
Social Clubs giving to the let's say the

225
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,280
activists and the consumers what it is

226
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:01,679
that they actually want which is right

227
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:02,879
to grow being able to buy a product at a

228
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,439
specific price and not being price

229
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,439
scheduled do you think the industry in

230
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:09,240
Europe has gone away I think it is uh I

231
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:11,038
mean I think certainly on the on the

232
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,259
more if you want to put a therapeutic

233
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:15,360
side or that kind of CBD in this side I

234
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:17,460
think that's definitely correct

235
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,098
um you know there's a lot of kind of

236
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:21,239
precedent for regulation at the EU level

237
00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:24,240
if you look at kind of devices

238
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,978
regulation or medicines regulation

239
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,660
um you know for the the way that might

240
00:08:25,978 --> 00:08:29,519
move

241
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:32,099
um you know certainly the initial

242
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:34,559
um kind of Regulation CBD around you

243
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:36,658
know novel foods and making sure that

244
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,399
there's an Evidence base there and that

245
00:08:36,658 --> 00:08:40,860
there's licensing and so on I think

246
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:44,639
we'll we'll see more of that

247
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:46,200
um and in general again Europe is you

248
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:48,958
know to just broaden it out in general

249
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,339
Europe tends to be more restrictive I

250
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:53,099
think in terms of the way they they

251
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:55,260
regulate uh substance consumption and

252
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,000
somewhere like in North America so I

253
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:58,500
think that's certainly true

254
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,480
um it does seem like in the short term

255
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,879
in the rack side that the the social

256
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,500
club model is is the way it's it's

257
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:06,059
moving and obviously you know again

258
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,220
there's priests and for that in terms of

259
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:09,539
what's happening in Spain

260
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,120
um there are social clubs and some of

261
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:14,278
the other European markets already I do

262
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,799
you know somewhat Wonder ultimately

263
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:17,519
whether that's going to

264
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,500
um

265
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,080
you know kind of expand the industry in

266
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,458
the way that that that perhaps uh the

267
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,259
industry itself would want perhaps even

268
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:27,000
the way governments would want in terms

269
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:28,980
of you know being able to deliver an

270
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,500
excise Revenue base and all that sort of

271
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:34,440
stuff and and really develop an industry

272
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:38,339
that employs uh significant numbers of

273
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:41,580
people and so on so I'm slightly

274
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:44,459
I'm still slightly hesitant uh in terms

275
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:46,320
of the not not in terms of the social

276
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:47,458
club model itself I think as you say

277
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,860
that's obviously something that will

278
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:52,319
deliver to Consumers what they want you

279
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:55,200
know the the flower at the right price

280
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,700
and so on and strip away a lot of what I

281
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,100
guess you could describe as the nonsense

282
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:01,500
that goes on in North America

283
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:03,240
um but I do think there's a you know

284
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,759
there's a cost of the social club model

285
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,899
in terms of

286
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:09,179
where do you really get that investment

287
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:11,600
that maybe is needed in the industry to

288
00:10:09,179 --> 00:10:14,939
develop things like format

289
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:17,639
innovation technology

290
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:19,200
um you know to develop kind of Brands

291
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:21,000
Etc that are going to bring consumers

292
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,759
who aren't already engaged in the in the

293
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,940
Legacy Industries into the space

294
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:28,259
um so it may be you know as looks like

295
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,959
it's going to happen in Germany maybe

296
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:32,879
that the first wave of of legalization

297
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:35,159
the rack side in Europe will be oriented

298
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:37,320
around the social club but I I do think

299
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:38,100
ultimately it may well go further than

300
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,740
that

301
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,720
um just because there there's a short

302
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,579
coming there in terms of of Industry

303
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,800
development I think

304
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:49,078
do you think the retail model in Europe

305
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:51,059
will be dominated by the North American

306
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:52,439
brands like cookies I've already seen

307
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:54,299
some transactions where people have

308
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,120
acquired the rights to cookie stores in

309
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:59,338
Europe already yeah do you that's going

310
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,899
to be the case just with the they've got

311
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:03,660
a decade of experience they'll have the

312
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:05,159
retail know-how or do you see that there

313
00:11:03,659 --> 00:11:07,799
is going to be capital in the European

314
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:09,419
markets and there is going to be Brands

315
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:11,399
and let's say retail stores as big in

316
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:13,319
Europe as they are in North America and

317
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:14,458
we end up exporting over to North

318
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,420
America with some of the brands we

319
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:18,239
create

320
00:11:15,419 --> 00:11:19,559
I I mean I I do think that there will be

321
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,940
North American brands that have the

322
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:23,399
potential to penetrate in Europe whether

323
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,079
it's going to be cookie specifically

324
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:26,458
um you know I don't know I think

325
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:28,139
obviously there's

326
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:29,518
that there there's some kind of first

327
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:31,199
move or Advantage there in terms of

328
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,578
brand equity and name recognition all

329
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,720
that sort of thing I know that for

330
00:11:32,578 --> 00:11:35,639
example in the

331
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,560
in the medical cannabis Market in

332
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:38,819
Germany there's there's you know

333
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:40,500
patients that that are looking at

334
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:43,079
cookies and and there's already a

335
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:46,379
certain Equity there but uh you know I

336
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:48,838
think if you look at again for example

337
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:50,879
the an adjacent market like the alcohol

338
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:52,380
Market or the tobacco market there's a

339
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:54,240
number of local Brands within the

340
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,139
European space that there has been you

341
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,820
know over a number of years and

342
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:58,740
particularly if you if you think about

343
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:02,820
that sort of smaller scale Social Club

344
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:04,259
model I think that implies really more

345
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,300
local

346
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:07,919
um more indigenous Brands and at least

347
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:10,740
initially within the space and I think

348
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:12,719
again look at Berlin which is likely to

349
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:14,700
be you know whether there's full

350
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,639
legalization Germany or whether it goes

351
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:19,740
to some kind of regional pilot or or a

352
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:23,220
combination of that and Social Club

353
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:25,799
you can really imagine the kind of I

354
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:28,139
guess unique culture of of Berlin you

355
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:30,838
know developing some strong and

356
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:33,360
interesting local cannabis Brands

357
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:35,519
um out of that and again they look at

358
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,740
something like Frisco or whatever you

359
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,720
know one of the only colors in Europe

360
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:41,579
that has strong Equity that competes

361
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,320
with a with a big Global North American

362
00:12:41,578 --> 00:12:46,019
brand coming out of Germany I think

363
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:48,180
there will be those types of of brands

364
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:49,200
in the Cannabis space in Europe so I

365
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:51,239
don't think it's going to be all North

366
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,680
American brands and I think you know if

367
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,360
I was someone who was looking at

368
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:56,519
licensing over a North American brand

369
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,899
right now to enter into a European

370
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:59,100
environment that we don't know what

371
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:00,778
that's actually going to look like I

372
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:03,000
think I would be probably thinking twice

373
00:13:00,778 --> 00:13:04,679
about that to be quite honest

374
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,480
another one of the questions I want to

375
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:08,879
ask you you're based in the UK and I

376
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,980
have a lot of experience over there what

377
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:13,139
are the things I started to see a lot of

378
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:15,180
is the the media entities and let's say

379
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:17,220
some of the companies in the UK they

380
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:18,539
some they still seem to seem that

381
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,339
they're part of Europe and that the

382
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:21,778
trading between the UK and Europe and

383
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:24,240
the Cannabis industry is going to be

384
00:13:21,778 --> 00:13:25,740
fine I own another company that trades

385
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,299
with the UK and it's the biggest [ __ ]

386
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:29,339
show I've ever dealt with since brexit

387
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:31,379
came in the Pack's getting added do you

388
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:34,019
see the UK cannabis companies being at a

389
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:36,120
disadvantage to the to the main European

390
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:38,519
entities in France and Germany and and

391
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,440
Spain and countries like that yeah I

392
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:42,480
think that potentially will will become

393
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,980
more of an issue over time I mean

394
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,899
obviously there isn't you know there

395
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,940
isn't a huge industry right now

396
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:49,500
obviously there's there's a certain

397
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,880
infrastructure around the Legacy space

398
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,440
but there isn't a huge industry right

399
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:54,000
now so maybe it's not as apparent as it

400
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,339
will become but I think that's certainly

401
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,259
the case I mean obviously traditionally

402
00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:00,360
or over the last number of years I think

403
00:13:58,259 --> 00:14:02,100
the UK industry has grown up as much

404
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,379
around

405
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:07,500
um you know while there is sort of

406
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:09,299
strong consumption of CBD and so on in

407
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,379
the UK Market I think the industry there

408
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:11,939
has grown up around the fact that

409
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:13,919
there's some of the capital is based in

410
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,480
London and and some of that is happening

411
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:17,399
in that space and industries have grown

412
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,920
up around that so I think they haven't

413
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,419
really tested that trade flow between

414
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:24,179
the UK and Europe and I think you're

415
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:25,759
right you'll find that over time you

416
00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:28,620
know as that infrastructure develops

417
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:30,600
that if you want to call it isolation

418
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,339
will be will become kind of more

419
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,560
pronounced in the Cannabis space and

420
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:36,779
again there are strong

421
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:38,338
European companies increasing in the

422
00:14:36,778 --> 00:14:40,379
space obviously we we notice on the

423
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:42,060
market companies that are in Germany um

424
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,500
you know the likes of sanity and so on

425
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:45,659
you know there's a strong for example

426
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:48,059
again in Spain and I just came back from

427
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:50,519
ICBC in Savannah as you can see like a

428
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:53,219
strong kind of industry beginning to

429
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:55,320
develop in Spain you know there are

430
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,399
um you know there are there are seed

431
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,379
companies there for example that are

432
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,940
amongst the biggest Employers in in the

433
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:01,559
locations in which they're based and so

434
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,820
on so I you know I don't think the

435
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:05,399
European industry is going to be waiting

436
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:07,320
for UK companies to come across and

437
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:09,958
and deliver to them I think there'll be

438
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,100
plenty of of European mainland-based

439
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:13,439
companies that will be able to do that

440
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:15,180
for themselves yeah yeah and I'd be

441
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,920
remiss if I didn't ask about Ireland

442
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:19,559
before we go we had a cannabis summer in

443
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:21,899
the RDS there like six weeks ago sold a

444
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:24,000
great event and it was pitched as Dublin

445
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:26,039
is going to be the the debate for Europe

446
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,720
for any North American company that if

447
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:29,338
you're doing cultivating in Portugal or

448
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,680
extraction Romania whatever it may be

449
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:34,260
that Dublin should be the main base of

450
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:36,179
Europe do you see Ireland being one of

451
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:38,100
the like biggest winners of let's say a

452
00:15:36,179 --> 00:15:39,599
European cannabis industry because the

453
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,000
North American companies are coming here

454
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,740
they all seem to be geared up for it and

455
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,019
why would they move into a non-english

456
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,820
speaking territory that has a couple of

457
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:49,560
disadvantages why wouldn't they follow

458
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,899
the remit that Mark Zuckerberg and Tim

459
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:53,578
Cook and the CEO of Pfizer of all doing

460
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:54,778
it and setup base here do you see us

461
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:56,458
being one of the big winners of this

462
00:15:54,778 --> 00:15:58,198
yeah I think that there's certainly an

463
00:15:56,458 --> 00:16:00,119
argument for that and obviously there's

464
00:15:58,198 --> 00:16:01,500
a there's underlying fundamentals there

465
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,940
that you've just kind of adverted to in

466
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,698
terms of what makes Ireland attractive

467
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:08,399
for any kind of company it's that um you

468
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:11,879
know time zone

469
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,259
language it's the tax as well we should

470
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:14,939
we'd be remiss if we didn't mention that

471
00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:16,919
it's the levels of Education you know

472
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:19,019
the sort of Labor Force that's there Etc

473
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:21,059
so I don't think the Cannabis industry

474
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:23,220
is any different to that and

475
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:25,379
particularly when you talk about you

476
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:27,540
know the European market likely to be

477
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:28,919
one that is focused around biotech and

478
00:16:27,539 --> 00:16:30,240
all of that kind of

479
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:31,559
um aspect of it I think that there's

480
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,680
certainly a strong argument for that

481
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:36,958
obviously I think you know obviously the

482
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:38,578
the drug policy or the Cannabis policy

483
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,799
that's in place there probably feeds

484
00:16:38,578 --> 00:16:42,359
into it as well I'm interested to see

485
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:44,099
now what's going to happen with the kind

486
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,379
of citizens assembly I think you know

487
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:49,259
there seems to me to be you know again

488
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:50,698
coming out of uh coming out of a

489
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:52,919
historical background where obviously

490
00:16:50,698 --> 00:16:55,019
you wouldn't have put Ireland as a big

491
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:56,458
candidate for for liberalization in

492
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:59,039
terms of cannabis policy I think there's

493
00:16:56,458 --> 00:17:00,419
something interesting Brewing there

494
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:02,759
um you know if you look at public

495
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:04,918
perception around around what we should

496
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:06,599
be doing in the space I think that you

497
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:08,280
know there could be movements as well

498
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:10,619
from a policy point of view that

499
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:12,418
actually just enhances that overall kind

500
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:13,500
of business proposition as well so I you

501
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:15,600
know I certainly think that that's

502
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:18,779
that's an element here and that Ireland

503
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:20,219
uh probably could be an oversized player

504
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:22,859
in the European industry as well I mean

505
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:25,439
it already is to some extent you don't

506
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:27,119
have to look far for an Irish face in

507
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,798
the European cannabis industry so

508
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,178
there's there's plenty of you know

509
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:31,918
there's plenty of ours presence as it is

510
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:33,600
and I think some of that's gonna gonna

511
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,179
reflect are going to come back in terms

512
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:38,819
of you know actual physical presence of

513
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:40,320
companies in in in in Ireland

514
00:17:38,819 --> 00:17:41,639
