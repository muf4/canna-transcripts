1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,198
foreign

2
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:21,778
thank you good day to you and to all

3
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:23,160
those who are following the podcast

4
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:24,600
thank you very much for joining us it's

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,920
very much appreciated I think you're a

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,320
man who's kind of a wealth of knowledge

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,880
and information for everybody today so

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,679
do you want to maybe give everybody a

9
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:33,600
quick little overview of how you came to

10
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:34,920
be nominated for European Parliament for

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,359
Malta

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,820
sure

13
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:39,899
um so I'm a member of the labor party in

14
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,359
Malta

15
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,520
um well our elections in 2019 as the

16
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:46,259
rest of the European Union so all member

17
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,140
states elected their members of the

18
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:50,579
European Parliament and I was one of

19
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,939
those elected on behalf of the labor

20
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:55,739
party throughout this uh mandate so the

21
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:59,519
Mandate is now coming to a close next

22
00:00:55,738 --> 00:01:01,078
year so it's our last year as members

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,280
um I'm part of the Socialist and

24
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,040
Democrats here in the European

25
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,960
Parliament and my main committee is the

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,000
environment and public health committee

27
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:12,239
but then I'm also a substitute in the

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,299
committee on civil liberties Justice and

29
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,259
home Affairs as well as the committee

30
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:19,260
unconstitutional Affairs of the European

31
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:22,080
Union so many topics that from one

32
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:24,840
aspect or another could relate

33
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:27,900
um to cannabis both as cannabis for

34
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,000
medical use and also on cannabis for

35
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,680
personal use

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,299
very good so I'm hoping you're going to

37
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,079
be the perfect man to answer some of the

38
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:38,939
questions that I'm about right now so

39
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:41,219
basically which country of the European

40
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:43,139
Union is the most advanced when it comes

41
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:45,359
to Canada policy

42
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,879
well it's very difficult to say because

43
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,859
different member states have different

44
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:52,500
approaches

45
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:55,200
um we could discuss and speak which

46
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,000
would be the best approach

47
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,399
um that said I think that different

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,680
approaches could work in different ways

49
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,920
in different number of states

50
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,259
um I think that uh what we did in Malta

51
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,699
is something which is quite

52
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:11,159
revolutionary to a certain extent in the

53
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:13,439
sense that we are

54
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:17,098
um one of the few member states in the

55
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:18,840
European Union and that have not only

56
00:02:17,098 --> 00:02:22,378
the criminalized Canada this but have

57
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:25,500
also legalized it in a certain way in

58
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:30,120
the sense it is not possible for anyone

59
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:31,919
to go to a shop and buy candidates which

60
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,500
is not MediCal or which is not in

61
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:36,719
certain products

62
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,239
um obviously I'm saying this in order to

63
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:41,939
simplify things as well but you can grow

64
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,680
your own cannabis and we have a system

65
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:47,519
where we have removed profit from

66
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,099
Cannabis so the individual would grow

67
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:53,159
their own

68
00:02:49,098 --> 00:02:56,339
plant would grow their own cannabis and

69
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:58,560
at the same time if you do not have the

70
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,680
ability to grow your own then you can

71
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,080
pull together in an association with

72
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,680
other people and you would have what

73
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,140
maybe we are used to usually in other

74
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,180
language called Social Clubs we have

75
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:15,238
called these associations where a number

76
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:18,540
of people can join together in order to

77
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:20,819
pull their five plants per person and

78
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:23,039
therefore be able to grow the plant in

79
00:03:20,818 --> 00:03:25,439
an environment which is more suitable

80
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,840
for the plant to grow or else if someone

81
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:30,598
would not have space within their own

82
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:34,439
homes or apartments they would be able

83
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:36,299
to do so in in a in a pooling of

84
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:38,579
resources let's say in order to grow

85
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:42,000
your own plant and we are seeing that

86
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:44,159
different member states are now moving

87
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,780
forward on the determinization and

88
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:47,158
legalization of cannabis we'll see

89
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,378
what's happening in Germany at the

90
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:52,259
moment what was happening in Luxembourg

91
00:03:49,378 --> 00:03:53,939
but which was post for some time

92
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:55,620
um different the different approaches

93
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:58,079
that in Germany and that somewhere the

94
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,840
thinking is more of legalizing cannabis

95
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,120
in a way that people would be able to

96
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,060
buy and sell

97
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:09,480
um certain strands or a certain type

98
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:12,420
let's say of cannabis within their own

99
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:15,238
member State this brings on a number of

100
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:18,659
problems which we might be able to speak

101
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:20,939
on later on problems or challenges that

102
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,919
come up because of European Union

103
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:26,360
legislation with regards to the

104
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:29,519
schengenaki so the way that

105
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:32,340
we move freely let's say and can move

106
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:35,099
goods and products and services freely

107
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:37,500
between EU member states but when it

108
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,540
comes to cannabis that would be a bit of

109
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,759
a problem so there are some challenges

110
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:44,160
chopping up in the way that other

111
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,620
countries are thinking going and moving

112
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,960
forward their legislation I myself as a

113
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,939
socialist would also find a problem in

114
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:53,039
the fact that big pharmaceutical

115
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:56,219
companies will that would end up taking

116
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,379
control of the market of such uh of

117
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,240
cannabis basically

118
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:01,918
yeah it seems to be very interesting the

119
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,019
way things are panning out we had a lot

120
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:05,459
of word from Luxembourg about a year a

121
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:07,139
year and a half ago they made a lot of

122
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:09,839
ways it seems to be the Czech Republic

123
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:11,879
are now the darling of Europe and may

124
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:13,739
say for surpassed Germany and have a

125
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:15,839
legal adult Market before then do you

126
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,819
think this is a capability with the

127
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,560
Czech Republic to surpass Germany and be

128
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:21,959
the first

129
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,660
um I'm not surprised because

130
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:26,219
um I the the well is it surprising or

131
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:29,460
not at the same time because the current

132
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:30,720
governing Coalition uh in uh the Czech

133
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:33,418
Republic

134
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,220
um has the Czech pirates in it uh

135
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:37,620
they're a green party

136
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:40,080
um they're quite revolutionary and uh

137
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,939
they work a lot on such issues so that

138
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:43,560
does not surprise me the interesting

139
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:45,538
thing is that they're in Coalition with

140
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:48,240
uh

141
00:05:45,538 --> 00:05:49,740
I wouldn't say a government coming from

142
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,000
the right because it's not even center

143
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,460
right

144
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,139
um so that is a bit surprising however I

145
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:57,899
guess when they were discussing the

146
00:05:55,139 --> 00:06:00,900
parties of the government and the

147
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:03,359
Pirates probably uh pushed a lot one

148
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:05,758
this as one of their main priorities for

149
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,800
the new government and the fact that it

150
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,020
has surpassed Germany

151
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,840
um not surprising either I mean today in

152
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:15,779
Germany has a very Progressive Alliance

153
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:17,519
governing the country

154
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:19,258
um however Germany being the biggest

155
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,538
member State

156
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:24,000
um also I'm not saying that other

157
00:06:21,538 --> 00:06:26,038
countries do not do this but what I'm

158
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,019
seeing is the approach in Germany is one

159
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:29,879
that is leading and the German

160
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:30,899
government to first of all make sure

161
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:34,019
that

162
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:36,179
they are in line with the United Nations

163
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:38,939
convention on psychotropic substances

164
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,439
the 1971 convention that what they're

165
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:42,600
doing therefore then would be in line

166
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:45,120
with the framework decision of the

167
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,500
European Union law which is linked to

168
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,600
the Schengen

169
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:52,319
um agreement of 1990 so basically what's

170
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,460
happening is this Germany is testing the

171
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,100
waters

172
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:57,959
it's testing the legal waters before

173
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,699
going on to

174
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:01,560
um this step of actually legalizing

175
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:03,180
cannabis

176
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,300
um something which

177
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:08,160
might not have been done by others is it

178
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,720
do you need to do that if you want if

179
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,880
you want to consider

180
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,740
legalizing within your member State and

181
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:16,978
having trade only within your member

182
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:19,139
state that might not be necessary but if

183
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:21,180
you want and this is obviously something

184
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:23,340
that would happen that there would be

185
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:25,918
trade within the European Union so let's

186
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:28,679
say cannabis is legal in Luxembourg and

187
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:31,318
it's legal in Germany and the German

188
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:34,220
Luxembourg share a border so what

189
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:36,840
happens there can you move with your

190
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:39,180
cannabis product for your personal use

191
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:41,758
from Germany to Luxembourg

192
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,800
according to Union law you can't

193
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,900
according to the United Nations you

194
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,220
can't

195
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:49,978
so that is what

196
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:52,860
Germany is looking at at the moment

197
00:07:49,978 --> 00:07:56,639
okay so facilitation the Commerce and

198
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:58,439
the the the logistics of the product or

199
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,819
the capital in the industry is what

200
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:01,560
Germany seemed to be focused on because

201
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:04,080
as he said if they can do everything

202
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,120
within house the only reason to go for

203
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:07,620
these extra rules would be for thinking

204
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,300
ahead to be able to say look we want to

205
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:13,379
be able to ship from Spain to France to

206
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:15,598
Germany and uh them do that

207
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:18,418
one of the issues that Germany is seeing

208
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:20,038
is that it might not have the most

209
00:08:18,418 --> 00:08:22,079
favorable weather

210
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:25,019
to grow cannabis

211
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:27,300
and therefore they believe that they

212
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:28,859
there should be a European Union system

213
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,199
in which there could be free trade

214
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,940
between the member states as we have on

215
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,038
all other products

216
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:37,680
and therefore they are thinking in

217
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:40,439
advance on how would this work

218
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:42,359
and with the current legal framework

219
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,760
from what we're Gathering it would not

220
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:47,220
work so that is what they're looking at

221
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:49,799
and what we need to change in order for

222
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,778
this to be able to happen

223
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:53,579
one of the things that may be able to

224
00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:55,799
facilitate that happening is something I

225
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:59,580
wanted to ask you about is the European

226
00:08:55,799 --> 00:09:02,399
wide testing program or a standard for

227
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:05,459
CBD and cannabis that's in place or is

228
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:07,740
that something that needs to be produced

229
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:09,419
and and build from the ground because

230
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,039
surely that's kind of the main

231
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:12,419
components of facilitating commerce

232
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:14,519
between the different countries is that

233
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:16,799
we've got a standardized testing for

234
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:18,959
every product that uh we can be insured

235
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:22,099
that not nothing too strong or too weak

236
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,099
has been shipped within countries

237
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:25,799
um that process is something that then

238
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:27,539
would be discussed within the

239
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:28,919
environment committee

240
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:32,639
um because it includes also public

241
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:34,379
health and probably but I I think I'm

242
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:37,740
not the most qualified person to speak

243
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:38,939
on this aspect of the legislation

244
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,919
is

245
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,540
saying what happens within the European

246
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:44,179
medicines agency I guess that I am not

247
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:47,039
sure about that so I'd rather not

248
00:09:44,179 --> 00:09:49,739
comment on something which I'm not too

249
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:52,519
technical on so I'd rather focus on the

250
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:56,399
law no problem whatsoever

251
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:58,820
a scenario in Europe where biotechnology

252
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,500
companies that can produce purified

253
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:03,360
biosynthesized carabinoids end up taking

254
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,899
the larger market share and we're then

255
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:09,360
left with a a flower an ornamental

256
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:11,100
flower industry and a social club where

257
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,959
the industry almost spits perfectly in

258
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,278
half that this is the recreational model

259
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:15,479
now and this is going to be everything

260
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:17,759
else

261
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,700
yeah yeah that is something which I'm

262
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:24,360
concerned about and I think we really

263
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:25,980
need to look at where where do we start

264
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,659
this conversation where does this

265
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:31,800
conversation start from and I think that

266
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:34,679
the Point of Departure is the fact that

267
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:36,958
um people should have their human rights

268
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:39,838
perspective respected we should have a

269
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:42,179
system where we have harm and risk

270
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,519
reduction as much as possible in various

271
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:47,879
Fields when it comes to

272
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:49,620
um substance use or drug use Etc so this

273
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:51,360
is where we start and I think that one

274
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:55,860
of the main issues that we need to look

275
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:58,320
at is to have uh cannabis users uh being

276
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:01,200
treated first of all with dignity that

277
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:04,019
they're doing no harm to anyone else if

278
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,660
at all it is something which a person is

279
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:09,539
doing within the confines of their own

280
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:11,939
being and not

281
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:14,819
um affecting anyone else everyone has

282
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:18,779
the right to bodily autonomy Etc so this

283
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:22,860
is where I go from and I think that

284
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:26,278
people using cannabis in this sense and

285
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:28,139
Other Drugs in reality should not be

286
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:29,838
imprisoned should not be arrested

287
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:33,659
because they are

288
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:37,140
smoking a joint or whatever

289
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:38,519
um using certain substances and I think

290
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:39,480
that is that should be our Point of

291
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:42,480
Departure

292
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,879
that is where I look at this whole issue

293
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:48,720
and it is in the sense that I really

294
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:53,519
pushed even back home in order to see a

295
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:55,980
system which is not there to profit big

296
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:59,519
pharmaceutical companies But A system

297
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:03,240
that would give each individual their

298
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:06,299
right to body autonomy to

299
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:08,278
um agency their rights to actually do

300
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:11,219
something which does not affect anyone

301
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:14,458
else and which they therefore should be

302
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:17,339
allowed to do and in order to have that

303
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:19,799
my take on this and when the Maltese

304
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:23,279
government came up with the consultation

305
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:24,778
process and before actually proposing

306
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:28,139
the law

307
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:31,200
um we as an office here we submitted a

308
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:33,419
very strong case for the way we wanted

309
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,420
this proposal to be and I was very happy

310
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:38,759
to see that when the actual proposal was

311
00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:40,439
published by government it was very

312
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:44,399
similar to what were proposing

313
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:47,940
originally and though other systems work

314
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:51,240
probably other systems could work would

315
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,800
work but who would benefit from them and

316
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,560
that is where

317
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:58,379
um I might digress from others and I

318
00:12:55,559 --> 00:13:00,599
believe that this should be done for the

319
00:12:58,379 --> 00:13:02,879
benefit of the individual and not for

320
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,459
the benefit of some huge pharmaceutical

321
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:07,159
companies that have already monopolized

322
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:08,778
a number of

323
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:11,939
drugs

324
00:13:08,778 --> 00:13:14,278
medicines therapies Etc

325
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:17,519
um all around the world

326
00:13:14,278 --> 00:13:19,759
um so for me that is the The Point of

327
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,379
Departure and why we should discuss this

328
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:25,139
obviously given the fact that a number

329
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:28,259
of member states are opting for a

330
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:30,060
different kind of legislation like uh

331
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:32,578
the Czech Republic Germany like what

332
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:34,799
Luxembourg was going to do

333
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:37,078
um that obviously

334
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:39,059
brings about other discussions so a

335
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:41,578
discussion on freedom of movement a

336
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:43,859
discussion of trade between member

337
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:46,620
states when it comes to

338
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:49,079
um Canada's being another product like

339
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:51,299
all other products

340
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:54,359
um so over there yes we do need to have

341
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:58,019
a a very strong discussion and it is for

342
00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:00,360
that reason that last year in July a

343
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:02,759
group of us so it started between myself

344
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:05,159
and a member of the European Parliament

345
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:07,458
from czechia Nicolas bestra who's from

346
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:11,159
the pirate party in the Czech Republic

347
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:13,199
we joined forces together to discuss the

348
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:16,319
European

349
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,940
um side point of view of the

350
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,820
legalization of Canada this is a number

351
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:22,200
of member states we started this

352
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:25,500
interest group in the European

353
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:27,600
Parliament where we sent out an email to

354
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,639
all members and asked all those who are

355
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:33,000
interested to join us in this Intel

356
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:35,399
group they have joined and we have now a

357
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,879
very strong Intergroup from different

358
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:40,198
member states and from different

359
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:43,559
political groupings here in the European

360
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:46,198
Parliament so we cover I believe

361
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:47,698
um five out of the seven

362
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:49,919
um political groupings in European

363
00:14:47,698 --> 00:14:52,439
Parliament and we have uh regular

364
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:54,479
meetings where we discuss

365
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,820
um the future of European Union

366
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,339
legislation and what should happen at

367
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:01,199
the European level given the fact that a

368
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:04,079
number of member states have now

369
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:07,198
legalized cannabis and obviously

370
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:08,939
this could be seen as going uh or

371
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,979
conflicting let's say

372
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:15,000
um with the United Nations convention on

373
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:16,560
psychotropic substances and also

374
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,559
um with the

375
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:21,599
the union law framework decision which

376
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:22,799
is linked to Schengen and therefore

377
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,860
linked to the United Nations

378
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:29,338
automatically and we believe that there

379
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:31,019
should be some change in this regard and

380
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:33,480
I know that it is very difficult to

381
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:36,120
bring about this change because uh over

382
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:40,139
here we're not speaking of one small

383
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:42,720
amendment to a law but we would actually

384
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:46,680
need to go into

385
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:49,440
um the union structures basically the

386
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:51,599
union principles Schengen is one of

387
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,540
those very important principles I think

388
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,759
it was one of the most uh popular let's

389
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:59,599
say principle because it has brought in

390
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:03,958
within the freedom of movement of people

391
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:06,600
Services capital and goods however

392
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:08,338
um in it there is this one line which

393
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,159
does not conduct it from it but it comes

394
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:14,160
from the United Nations Convention

395
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:18,179
of 1971 which states that

396
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:21,000
um you cannot cross borders with a

397
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:23,039
number of substances and they list the

398
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,379
number of substances a lot of substances

399
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:27,659
listed as cannabis so there are two

400
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:30,240
options we either remove this at United

401
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:32,698
Nations level so Europe Canada is from

402
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:37,320
being one of those substances mentioned

403
00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:39,778
in the United Nations convention or else

404
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:42,180
um in our agreement and the framework

405
00:16:39,778 --> 00:16:44,759
decision of the European Union

406
00:16:42,179 --> 00:16:46,939
we would make reference to the United

407
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:50,339
Nations convention but excluding

408
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:52,579
cannabis from one of those substances

409
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:56,519
that you cannot

410
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:59,039
move across borders with so that is the

411
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:01,198
current discussion that we are having

412
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:03,240
very interesting indeed I believe our

413
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:05,220
own Luke Flanagan from Ireland is part

414
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:08,279
of the group of politicians that you

415
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:09,900
have going before I let you go

416
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:12,418
um just a couple of questions are

417
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:14,880
raising from one to ten ten being most

418
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:16,799
likely one being least likely which of

419
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,660
these countries is going to legalized in

420
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:23,220
the next three let's see let's say three

421
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:25,500
to five years out of 10 Spain

422
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:27,900
uh it depends on the elections uh in

423
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:30,359
September I think that if we keep on

424
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:32,700
having a progressive government then we

425
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:34,979
can move towards that if the shift goes

426
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,240
towards the right of conservatives

427
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,339
definitely not

428
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,419
okay Germany

429
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:44,418
yes

430
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:44,419
10 10 9 and France

431
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,179
six

432
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,259
then

433
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:53,879
Czech Republic

434
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:56,579
yeah

435
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,500
uh Portugal

436
00:17:56,579 --> 00:18:00,480
interesting as well there were the

437
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:03,599
elections recently once again the

438
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,700
progressives the Socialists have won

439
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:08,219
um I think there's a good chance of them

440
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:11,220
moving towards this and so I would say

441
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:13,259
uh it depends on from which side do you

442
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:15,419
look at it you're halfway but I would

443
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:18,298
say something between five to seven

444
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:21,600
um what about little Ireland

445
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:23,819
well that I think Ireland is an

446
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:26,819
interesting case because I often

447
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:28,859
um make comparisons between my country

448
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:31,379
boys and Ireland because we have a we

449
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:34,740
share a similar past

450
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:37,200
we have very similar routes when it

451
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,819
comes to a conservative Catholic

452
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,298
upbringing

453
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:43,220
um why I see the same for instance

454
00:18:42,298 --> 00:18:45,900
um

455
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:49,259
discussions that Ireland had on abortion

456
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:51,059
that we're currently now having at home

457
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:53,359
um Ireland had a number of interesting

458
00:18:51,058 --> 00:18:56,220
discussions when it came to either

459
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:57,959
lgbtiq rights which we have done back

460
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:00,600
home and we have done that very strongly

461
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:02,160
now and we're we're the first in all of

462
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:05,099
Europe when it comes to agility IQ

463
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:08,400
rights and so we have a similar uh

464
00:19:05,099 --> 00:19:10,558
thinking uh I would be more cautious

465
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,740
about Ireland I think

466
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:15,720
um both the major political parties are

467
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:17,819
quite cautious on this

468
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:21,298
um of course there is the I don't know

469
00:19:17,819 --> 00:19:25,019
what the name of the part is which uh

470
00:19:21,298 --> 00:19:28,558
we're looking Flanagan Mick Wallace and

471
00:19:25,019 --> 00:19:30,119
others form part of this particle but I

472
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:32,220
don't know which one it is the name of

473
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:34,500
it but I think they would be very much

474
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:37,380
in favor I'm not sure about the

475
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,819
mainstream parties let's say in Ireland

476
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,500
yeah Ireland's going to be an

477
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:42,240
interesting one to see whether we end up

478
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:44,759
being the Gateway country into Europe or

479
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,558
North American companies and de facto to

480
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:48,779
the capital and the jobs being created

481
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:50,160
that it made sense to decriminalize and

482
00:19:48,779 --> 00:19:51,720
then legalize the industry but it's

483
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,220
going to be an exciting couple of years

484
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,960
ahead for Europe where there's no

485
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:57,240
stepping stone that's guaranteed to be

486
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,440
solid but all we can do is learn and

487
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,419
sharpen our souls and be ready for

488
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,558
Battleground time comes

489
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:03,780
yeah

490
00:20:01,558 --> 00:20:04,918
obviously look at that there's also a

491
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:07,379
difference over there with regards to

492
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:10,500
which kind of legislation so if you

493
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:12,360
adopt the Maltese model then what you

494
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:15,359
just said would not work

495
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:16,678
um but if you drive up the check model

496
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:18,839
that would be perfect

497
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:21,000
yeah it's going to be interesting anyway

498
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:22,199
sorry I know you're a very busy man so

499
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,779
thank you very much for taking the time

500
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,220
to do this very much appreciated on that

501
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:27,480
all the best on all the political

502
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:30,058
projects you've got for the rest of the

503
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,650
year thank you it was a pleasure until

504
00:20:30,058 --> 00:20:35,129
next episode everybody
