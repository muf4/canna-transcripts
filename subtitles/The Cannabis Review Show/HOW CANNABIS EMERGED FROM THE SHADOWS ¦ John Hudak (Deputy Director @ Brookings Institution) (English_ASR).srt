my pleasure

14
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:33,439
so a couple of topics i wanted to talk

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,880
to you about and maybe first and

16
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:36,640
foremost we'll get the audience up to

17
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,239
speed how did you get involved at the

18
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,480
brookings institute and what was your

19
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:41,839
first initial uh start in the cannabis

20
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,398
industry or covering the cannabis

21
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,160
industry should i say to be honest i

22
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,759
after i got out of graduate school or as

23
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:49,599
i was nearing the end of graduate school

24
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:53,439
i was expecting to go into a teaching

25
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,439
job at a university um and i got uh

26
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:57,198
someone reached out to me from brookings

27
00:00:55,439 --> 00:01:00,479
uh they had an opening to see if i was

28
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:02,079
interested in applying um it uh

29
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:03,519
everything moved sort of quickly i i

30
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,319
didn't expect to be working at a think

31
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,880
tank ultimately uh but that was uh ten

32
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:11,599
years ago and and here i am still uh

33
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:13,839
still uh churning stuff out at brookings

34
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:15,679
uh in terms of how i started in cannabis

35
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,439
that was very accidental i actually had

36
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:22,000
a colleague who who recommended i um

37
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:24,239
take a look at some work that was being

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,478
done around polling in colorado and

39
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,239
washington before those two states

40
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:29,840
legalized cannabis and he said you know

41
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:32,158
you ask a lot of questions in your

42
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,840
research that might be applicable to

43
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,040
cannabis and i sort of laughed him out

44
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,799
of my office truth be told and uh

45
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,640
eventually i took a look at some of the

46
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,479
things he was sending me and i found the

47
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,118
topic really interesting and

48
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:47,759
launched a project in 2014 evaluating

49
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:50,239
colorado's implementation of their legal

50
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,680
cannabis system and and just kept

51
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:52,839
building it into a broader part of my

52
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,040
research

53
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,240
portfolio yeah for those who don't know

54
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,040
the brooking institute is one of the

55
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,959
most revered uh think tanks in the world

56
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,960
and when they release a paper on a topic

57
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,798
it generally moves the needle far more

58
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:06,959
than let's say some of the industry

59
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,239
experts so it was a great review of it

60
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,560
and then your book that you released in

61
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,000
2016 what was the reasoning behind that

62
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,360
you just developed a huge amount of

63
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,598
knowledge

64
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,000
yeah there was a there was a lot of uh

65
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:20,238
research going on if it wasn't being

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,239
tied together i think in a concise way

67
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,800
there were there were some books on on

68
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,640
cannabis that were very laser focused on

69
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,319
specific topics there were other ones

70
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,479
that were hundreds and hundreds of pages

71
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:32,878
long uh and brookings was actually

72
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:35,518
interested in uh putting together a

73
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:37,840
series of books that explained

74
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,280
short histories on a variety of policy

75
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,680
topics and they asked me if i'd be

76
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:45,039
interested in writing one on cannabis

77
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,040
and and i of course was uh and so what i

78
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:50,959
ended up putting together was a policy

79
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:52,560
history largely in the 1900s and 2000s

80
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,640
although some earlier

81
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,598
uh earlier dates appear in the book as

82
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:57,598
well

83
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:59,598
to explain the policy and political

84
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:01,039
history of cannabis largely in the

85
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:02,158
united states although there's a little

86
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:03,679
bit in there

87
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:06,079
about nations abroad that have dealt

88
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,879
with the issue uh and it and it serves

89
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,800
more as uh uh almost like a four dummies

90
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:13,518
book catch you up to speed on what's

91
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,560
gone on in cannabis policy over you know

92
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,400
150 year period uh and it's a light read

93
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,640
an easy read it's a beach read people

94
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,120
tell me um and so

95
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:24,639
obviously i recommend it

96
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,560
yeah everybody the link for the book

97
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,000
will be posted in the description below

98
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,318
you'll be able to click on it and buy it

99
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
directly and so the reason i wanted john

100
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:34,318
i wanted to kind of focus as much as i

101
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,120
can in ireland with your skill set

102
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:38,958
because you guys obviously no federal

103
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,400
legalization yet but there's some way

104
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,840
forward as to what an industry would

105
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,599
look like over in ireland we're still

106
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,840
stuck with a medical cannabis program

107
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:47,679
where even if a doctor prescribes it it

108
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,319
has to be okayed by a secondary

109
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,360
consultant who generally is over the age

110
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:55,518
of 65 70 and doesn't really understand

111
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,680
uh what they might be even remotely

112
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,599
talking about so what first up i wanted

113
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,040
to talk about was how cannabis emerged

114
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:03,438
from the shadows one of the types of

115
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:05,199
parts of your book so how did cannabis

116
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:07,519
emerge from the shadows in america what

117
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:09,280
was the first initial uh

118
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,879
pillar that got the industry out of the

119
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,560
open for everybody

120
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:16,959
you know over during the 1970s and 1980s

121
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,519
early 1980s in the united states

122
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,000
views on cannabis began to shift some

123
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:25,439
and you saw some states stepping up

124
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
to decriminalize cannabis that is to

125
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:31,600
make a cannabis crime the equivalent of

126
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,079
a speeding ticket or a parking ticket um

127
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,600
a few states moved forward with that

128
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:38,959
approach and

129
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,280
it was seen as a re-prior prioritization

130
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:43,599
of police dollars that is that there

131
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:45,519
were more important things for police

132
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,199
departments to deal with than low-level

133
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:50,000
cannabis offenses this was during a

134
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,680
period of um fairly high crime rates uh

135
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,120
in the united states particularly

136
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:57,199
violent crime rates um we went back into

137
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,079
a period of shadows when ronald reagan

138
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:03,360
became president and really began to um

139
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:06,000
re-uh reiterate the war on drugs uh in

140
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,280
the united states but ultimately the

141
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,959
years of

142
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:13,679
racial strife um police power

143
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:15,439
a real focus on on criminalization of a

144
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,639
lot of things including low-level drug

145
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:19,918
offenses

146
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:22,079
began to get displaced oddly enough by

147
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:23,519
the aids epidemic in the united states

148
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:26,159
and what you found was in some big

149
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:27,839
cities particularly in san francisco uh

150
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,120
but also in l.a in new york and

151
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:31,519
elsewhere

152
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,000
uh doctors and nurses and most

153
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:36,639
importantly patients were recognizing

154
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,639
that uh cannabis helped

155
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,199
with uh some of the side effects of the

156
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:44,240
pharmaceuticals early pharmaceuticals uh

157
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:47,038
being used to treat hiv and aids and uh

158
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,879
that began to put cracks in this system

159
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:50,719
where people were looking at cannabis as

160
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:52,639
something not as terrible as the

161
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,320
government was telling them it was and

162
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,000
something that might actually under

163
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,719
certain circumstances have medical

164
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,360
benefits uh and so began the path toward

165
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,280
reform starting really in the mid 1990s

166
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,639
in the united states and really

167
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:08,719
skyrocketing forward to today

168
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,160
okay so great little breakdown there so

169
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,240
what do you think of being the let's say

170
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,080
the two biggest benefits of cannabis

171
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,240
coming out into the main industry market

172
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:19,120
has it been revenue for the government

173
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,199
social equity programs patient access

174
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,800
what do you think if a politician from

175
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,560
ireland is looking at this wondering why

176
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,079
would we legalize it what are the kind

177
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,639
of two pillars that people would be

178
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:30,959
looking at going okay it's worth a room

179
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,199
so when i advise uh state and local

180
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:35,279
governments on on cannabis reform one of

181
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,759
the things i always tell them is to

182
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:40,000
discount the revenue that comes in um

183
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,759
it's never as much as people imagine

184
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,759
it's going to be it's a significant

185
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,400
amount of money no doubt

186
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,879
but it's important to set citizen

187
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:50,879
expectations about how much money that

188
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:52,639
will mean how much money it means

189
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,519
relative to the larger

190
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,639
municipal or state budget uh and and

191
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:57,519
certainly

192
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,360
uh

193
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:01,038
what that money will actually end up

194
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,199
doing in terms of dealing with budget

195
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:05,519
deficits or the ability to fund certain

196
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,720
programs the two areas that i think

197
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:09,758
though uh it is most impactful cannabis

198
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,240
reform

199
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:16,000
first is for patient care there are a

200
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,598
lot of patients in the united states who

201
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,519
will tell you that they benefit

202
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:21,120
significantly from the use of cannabis

203
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:23,359
whether it's for pain management whether

204
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,120
it's to deal with seizure disorders uh

205
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,919
whether it's to deal with a lack of

206
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,478
appetite for a variety of reasons for

207
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:32,719
most commonly associated with hiv aids

208
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:34,478
or chemotherapy treatments for cancer

209
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,319
etc

210
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:38,159
for some people it helps them sleep for

211
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,199
some people it helps them focus there's

212
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,680
a lot of

213
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,720
benefits either demonstrated through

214
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,280
government

215
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,520
regulatory processes or just anecdotally

216
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:48,959
from patients uh that they are getting

217
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:50,478
those types of benefits without

218
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:52,799
traditional pharmaceuticals some of

219
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:55,758
which particularly for pain management

220
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,400
come with significant risks uh and and

221
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,319
obviously uh risks for addiction

222
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:02,719
independence as well

223
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,639
the second uh area in which i think it

224
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,879
has a major impact in the united states

225
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,120
is in the criminal justice space uh the

226
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,879
idea that states are no longer arresting

227
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,918
individuals for low-level cannabis

228
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,840
offenses in mass numbers

229
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:17,839
is huge now one of the problems we've

230
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:19,918
had in the united states is that while

231
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:21,359
the number of arrests in a lot of states

232
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:23,680
that have legalized cannabis have

233
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,759
plummeted the racial disparities and the

234
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,120
remaining arrests remain

235
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,960
and so there's a lot of work to do in

236
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,759
the criminal justice space with regard

237
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:31,598
to

238
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,320
cannabis law enforcement

239
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:37,038
but ultimately we are arresting hundreds

240
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,800
of thousands of fewer people in states

241
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:41,120
that have legalized and that means a

242
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:43,120
different life trajectory for those

243
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,120
individuals who have been spared what

244
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,159
you know five ten fifteen years ago

245
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,560
would have landed them in jail

246
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:52,799
okay so two very good points for uh

247
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:54,799
we've got a a national day of action

248
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,159
over here in ireland on the 23rd of

249
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:57,838
august where

250
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:59,679
patients for safe access everybody's

251
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,760
joining at the department of health so

252
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:03,519
there seems to be a lot of steam coming

253
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:05,759
in the irish industry at the moment do

254
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,360
you guys look at the european sector at

255
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:09,838
all or do you just focus strictly on the

256
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,440
american uh industry

257
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,560
um there's a there's a pretty large

258
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:17,600
focus on uh the american uh industry and

259
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:19,359
advocacy space uh in policy space

260
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,278
there's so much going on here and

261
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,519
changing all the time it takes up a lot

262
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:25,919
of our time but you know i do think that

263
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,560
there are lessons to be learned

264
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:30,639
from the the european model

265
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:32,719
in particular especially with regard to

266
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:34,480
medical cannabis research medical

267
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,200
cannabis research has been stymied in

268
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,440
the united states because of ideological

269
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,480
reasons because of bureaucratic reasons

270
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,160
um and really for nonsensical reasons in

271
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,519
general um

272
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:47,919
research into

273
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,919
medical cannabis and and the efficacy of

274
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:51,919
medical cannabis for a variety of

275
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:54,479
conditions and diseases

276
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:57,278
has really uh

277
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,480
grown significantly in places like the

278
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:02,240
eu in israel and elsewhere where those

279
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,120
types of bureaucratic barriers are

280
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,919
reduced relative to the american model

281
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,679
and what i often tell uh policymakers in

282
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:12,000
the u.s is that europe is having our

283
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:13,519
lunch um we could be doing this type of

284
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,839
cutting-edge research but europe is

285
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,278
doing it for us and

286
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,240
it's it's a real problem but it

287
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:24,399
demonstrates that even in a

288
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:26,079
a peer government like the eu uh the u.s

289
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,078
doesn't have to be afraid of at least

290
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:30,399
allowing the freedom to uh conduct

291
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:32,239
research into this into the substance

292
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:35,039
and better understand what it will mean

293
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,200
for prospective patients

294
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:39,039
yeah and i think that's where europe at

295
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,399
the moment seems to be a little all over

296
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,319
the place when it comes to patient

297
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,078
access so we've got spain is legalized

298
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,079
in a medical cannabis program in the end

299
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:47,838
of december but it's still up in the air

300
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:49,679
as to is it specialists allowed to

301
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,279
prescribe it are they allowed to flower

302
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:52,078
whereas over in ireland you've got maybe

303
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:55,039
seven

304
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:56,559
like neuroplasticity and post chemo

305
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:58,879
nausea that are allowed on this but

306
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:00,479
again a consultant who has nothing to do

307
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:02,159
with the patient that the doctor has to

308
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,800
be the one to sign off and it creates

309
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:06,639
that extra barrier that how would you uh

310
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:09,519
when you you did your paper the report

311
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:11,360
on the medical marijuana mess um what

312
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,120
was that was that paper targeted at

313
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,039
health officials or was it a targeted on

314
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,519
a broader

315
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:19,599
consumer basis yeah it was targeted at

316
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,519
policy makers who work in the public

317
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,000
health sector as well as health uh

318
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,679
health care professionals as well um you

319
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,399
know you had mentioned at the outset of

320
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:30,639
the podcast that uh the secondary

321
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,799
consultants in ireland who need to sign

322
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:34,639
off on uh dr

323
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:36,879
doctor's prescriptions for cannabis are

324
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:38,559
oftentimes older practitioners that's a

325
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:41,200
problem we face in the united states as

326
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:42,958
well um you have entire classes of

327
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,360
doctors who went through medical school

328
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:47,759
being taught that cannabis is bad in all

329
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,839
circumstances it's hard to break people

330
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:51,439
out of that particularly older

331
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,639
practitioners who are more set in their

332
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,399
ways who have rigid ideologies about

333
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,440
these substances that's certainly not a

334
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,078
problem

335
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,320
uh that exists simply in ireland or uh

336
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:03,599
in europe but in uh but in the united

337
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,000
states and elsewhere around the world

338
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,360
particularly latin america as well

339
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,399
and so uh you know what i oftentimes uh

340
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,159
tell

341
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,639
individuals who are working to change

342
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:16,480
laws around medical cannabis is that yes

343
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,320
it's important to change the law that's

344
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,039
an important first step but you also

345
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,839
have to change the culture within uh

346
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:25,679
allied health professions to understand

347
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:28,079
the newest and latest

348
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:29,679
research on cannabis both in terms of

349
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:31,519
medical efficacy

350
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:33,199
but also in terms of the risks and side

351
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,480
effects of it or the lack thereof in

352
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,959
many cases

353
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,560
and to better understand what patient

354
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,719
needs are and what the risks of

355
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:42,799
alternative therapies therapy's

356
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,240
alternative to cannabis would mean and

357
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:46,639
that's particularly important in the

358
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,399
pain management space as i uh mentioned

359
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,759
where addiction and dependence issues

360
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,159
are significant

361
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:55,039
as well as overdose issues but it's true

362
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:56,799
in a variety of areas of medicine under

363
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:59,199
if you have a doctor coming to the table

364
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:01,199
who's not read up well on on medical

365
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,759
cannabis that doctor's not doing his or

366
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,920
her job and so part of

367
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:08,159
the reform around medical cannabis is

368
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,919
not just law and policy but it's in

369
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:11,919
medical education

370
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:15,120
at medical schools but also continuing

371
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:16,958
medical education for practicing uh

372
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,879
doctors and nurses

373
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:20,638
yeah there's a lot of talk about the

374
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:22,240
north american companies taking a

375
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,680
foothold in the european industry but

376
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,519
the one thing i actually see them

377
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:28,239
dominating hands down and having no

378
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,639
competition is the expertise coming over

379
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,278
here to educate the doctors on mass the

380
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,120
peter grimspoons of the world and coming

381
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:36,958
over here and and spreading their

382
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,480
knowledge and expertise i think is one

383
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:40,479
of the biggest monetization points for

384
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,839
the north american industry at the

385
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,000
moment as opposed to them all thinking

386
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,760
they can sell tons of flour in a market

387
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,639
that doesn't even have a solidified base

388
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:48,720
yet

389
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,198
yeah i think that's right and and what's

390
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,120
most important i think uh it's it's true

391
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:56,078
in the united states it's true abroad as

392
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,159
well um is that

393
00:13:56,078 --> 00:14:01,039
individuals who are let's say new to

394
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:03,679
cannabis or or or considering thinking

395
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:05,759
differently about cannabis the messenger

396
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:08,078
for the information is critically

397
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:09,759
important they want to hear from doctors

398
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:11,838
they want to hear from nurses they want

399
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:14,159
to hear from phds they want to hear from

400
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,800
people in suits they're going to believe

401
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:19,439
people who look differently than their

402
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:21,278
imagined stereotype of a cannabis user

403
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,279
or a cannabis advocate

404
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:25,198
and here in the united states we have a

405
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:27,439
sort of mixed bag when it comes to the

406
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:29,519
way the individuals present themselves

407
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,480
while lobbying or advocating in other

408
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,560
settings

409
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,959
for medical cannabis or adult use

410
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:37,439
cannabis and what you see is that the

411
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:39,039
more professionalized that movement is

412
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,600
and the more professionalized that

413
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:43,599
movement appears the more likely

414
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,839
individuals will be receptive to that

415
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,639
message and so that's critical doctors

416
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:51,839
hearing from doctors uh and nurses about

417
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:56,399
their own experience uh clinically uh

418
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:58,240
can not be uh overmatched by you know uh

419
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:01,360
papers that they're reading in academic

420
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,919
journals or uh advocacy messages that

421
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,639
they're hearing that are more uh let's

422
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:08,479
say stereotypical in nature

423
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,399
yeah i couldn't agree with you anymore

424
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,759
and when i was doing my research i came

425
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,759
across myself saying this is one of the

426
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:15,439
most influential voices in american

427
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:17,198
cannabis and you haven't disappointed

428
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,560
her knowledge on it's been absolutely

429
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:20,479
amazing talking to you and hopefully we

430
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:21,759
get to talk again in 12 months time and

431
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,600

432
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:25,039
happening over here in europe but thank
