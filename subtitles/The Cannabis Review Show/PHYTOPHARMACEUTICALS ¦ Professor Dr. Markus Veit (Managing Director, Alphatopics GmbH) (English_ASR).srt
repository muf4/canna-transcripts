00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,320
joined that this episode by Professor Dr

5
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:19,198
Marcus Vice who's the managing director

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,920

to the point can you maybe give

16
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:44,939
everybody a brief overview on your

17
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:48,539
career to date

18
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:51,000
yes I did a normal University career

19
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:53,960
um and I left University when I was a

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,058
young Professor at this time

21
00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:00,359
I took over the general Mana manager

22
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:02,659
position of a small Laboratory

23
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:06,539
um which was founded

24
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:08,759
for a research project and this was the

25
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,680
starting of a founding of different

26
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,560
companies providing services for the

27
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,380
pharmaceutical industry in terms of

28
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,118
quality control and Regulatory Affairs

29
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:22,618
and

30
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:24,780
um and in the meanwhile I'm 63 and only

31
00:01:22,618 --> 00:01:26,938
one company is left and this is Alpha

32
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,219
topics and with this company I do

33
00:01:26,938 --> 00:01:31,319
training

34
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:35,400
for the pharmaceutical industry related

35
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:38,118
to any topic which you can think of in

36
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:42,180
the context of quality control

37
00:01:38,118 --> 00:01:44,219
manufacturing chemistry of all kinds of

38
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:48,079
pharmaceutical products and medical

39
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:49,798
devices and I do also some consultancy

40
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:52,798
but only

41
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,899
in these topics I'm really interested in

42
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,960
and I like and the Cannabis is one of

43
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:00,680
them and and this is also related to my

44
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:02,819
professorship because I'm a professor of

45
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:06,079
pharmacokinancy so

46
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:09,000
um so my um yes University

47
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:11,340
career and education is related to

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,699
Herber medicinal products

49
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:17,400
okay incredible can you maybe explain to

50
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:19,738
everybody the first topic what are

51
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,959
phytopharmaceuticals

52
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:24,920
yes this is something very special in

53
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:28,378
Europe and the European Union uh because

54
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:31,919
we do have um Harbor products as

55
00:02:28,378 --> 00:02:34,079
medicines this is part of our regulatory

56
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,939
environment in Europe This is in

57
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,580
principle also possible in in other

58
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:41,519
regions in the world however

59
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:45,120
um in Europe it's distinct because

60
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,780
um we do have clear guidelines

61
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,019
um

62
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,180
how to deal with these products

63
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:53,060
considering the

64
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:57,599
very specific

65
00:02:53,060 --> 00:03:00,360
aspects related to these products and so

66
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:02,339
any product which is manufactured out of

67
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,720
a plant

68
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,719
um or um

69
00:03:06,378 --> 00:03:14,818
or as a plant material and which is not

70
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:17,400
a purified compound is considered to be

71
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:20,399
a phytopharmaceutical so

72
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,860
um degree of purification is sometimes a

73
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,099
matter of debate so

74
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:30,239
um I would say see Martin could be drawn

75
00:03:26,098 --> 00:03:33,359
at a purity of 90 to 95 if you have

76
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,580
natural compounds of that Purity they

77
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,720
are no longer considered to be phyto

78
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:43,140
Pharmaceuticals so phyto Pharmaceuticals

79
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:46,199
are mainly mixtures of compounds

80
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:48,779
contained in extracts prepared from

81
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:53,060
herbal starting materials and these

82
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:55,860
extracts or other preparations are then

83
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:57,920
manufactured in normal dosage forms like

84
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:02,340
capsules tablets

85
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:05,039
liquid dosage forms and form an own

86
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:08,039
category so-called herbal medicinal

87
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:11,098
product we do have even a distinct

88
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:13,859
committee at EBA at our European

89
00:04:11,098 --> 00:04:15,959
medicines agency this is the herbal

90
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,540
medicinal product committee responsible

91
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:22,259
for this group of

92
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:24,479
products and very distinct guidance

93
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:26,879
documents for these products and also

94
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:28,639
distinct approval procedures in EU

95
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:31,918
member states

96
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:34,740
and those the biosynthesis for your

97
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:37,859
fermentation is that covered under a

98
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:39,900
phyton Pharmaceuticals no there is an in

99
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,160
normal cases there is no fermentation at

100
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:43,620
all so

101
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,620
um a normal phytophobical

102
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:49,259
um you take a plant material

103
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:52,019
um from cultivation or sometimes it's

104
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:55,979
still collected in the wild then you try

105
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:58,319
it then you Mill it and this Millet

106
00:04:55,978 --> 00:05:00,620
material is then extracted the extract

107
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:04,379
might be purified

108
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:08,100
and maybe also standardized to to

109
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:09,918
distinct ingredients and this extract

110
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:12,259
then is

111
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:17,698
manufactured in the dosage form so

112
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:20,340
fermentation sometimes is also um part

113
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:23,038
of the manufacture but these are very

114
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:25,500
rare products

115
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:28,079
and can you explain what are the

116
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:31,160
benefits of phytopharmaceuticals versus

117
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:34,139
let's say a synthetic molecule

118
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:36,439
I think it's difficult to have to have

119
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:39,478
it summarized under benefit

120
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:41,959
it's something different because it's

121
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:45,959
therapy with multi-component mixtures

122
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:48,959
and of course one can pass postulates

123
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:51,180
synergistic and maybe also antagonistic

124
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:53,038
effects in the end it's not a single

125
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:55,199
pure compound so it's a complete

126
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:55,879
different

127
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,100
um

128
00:05:55,879 --> 00:06:01,199
concept of

129
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:03,120
medical use of these kinds of products

130
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,478
and in the end we do have a long

131
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,899
tradition of these products in quite a

132
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:12,418
few EU member states and and this

133
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:15,418
tradition builds the basis to have these

134
00:06:12,418 --> 00:06:18,719
products um as medicines

135
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:22,258
okay can you explain on the second topic

136
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:26,699
what is the European pharmacopoeia

137
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:30,000
so the European pharmaco PR is um

138
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:33,478
um a compendia which is issued by the

139
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,220
Edco m ediko m stands for European

140
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:39,959
directorate for the quality of medicine

141
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:43,740
this Edco m is located in Strasbourg and

142
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:45,418
it's part of the Council of Europe it

143
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,879
has nothing to do with the European

144
00:06:45,418 --> 00:06:51,240
Union because it was founded

145
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:54,418
um after a second world war and at this

146
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:58,379
time there was no uni uh European Union

147
00:06:54,418 --> 00:07:01,198
at all and at this time a decision must

148
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:03,478
be taken which organization in Europe

149
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,460
could be responsible

150
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:06,560
um to build up

151
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:10,318
um

152
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,478
pharmacopoeia which is not dedicated to

153
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,699
a single EU member state or a single

154
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:18,839
state in Europe

155
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:21,720
but is valid in um in any European

156
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:23,519
country and at this time the Council of

157
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,440
Europe was the only organization in

158
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:28,439
place and therefore

159
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:31,339
this organization which is normally in

160
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:34,680
charge for human rights and and other

161
00:07:31,339 --> 00:07:37,500
topics far away from Pharmaceuticals

162
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:40,439
um was assigned to take over this

163
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,180
responsibility and since then

164
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:43,680
um

165
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:46,379
at this time

166
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,538
um there were 12 European countries

167
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:52,139
Switzerland included for example which

168
00:07:48,538 --> 00:07:56,659
is not an EU member State and and they

169
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:58,860
um assigned the so-called European

170
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:03,660
pharmacopoeia convention and this

171
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:06,360
convention was a basis for this European

172
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:08,699
pharmacopoeia today we do have 46

173
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:11,400
European countries following the

174
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:14,478
European pharmacopia and the young green

175
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:17,219
pharmacopoeia provides standards for

176
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:19,279
active pharmaceutical ingredients for

177
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:22,680
packaging material for

178
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:25,978
excipients and a lot of issues related

179
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:29,939
to quality control and the ability

180
00:08:25,978 --> 00:08:31,519
testing of pharmaceutical raw materials

181
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:34,639
and products

182
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:36,379
there is a clear reference in the

183
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:41,718
European

184
00:08:36,379 --> 00:08:44,879
legislative environment making these

185
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:46,860
definitions and requirements in the

186
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:51,480
European pharmacopoeia legally binding

187
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:53,959
for any EU country having signed as the

188
00:08:51,480 --> 00:09:00,000
pharmacopoeia convention and

189
00:08:53,958 --> 00:09:01,399
it is yes a lot of products which are

190
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,659
well known

191
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:09,500
and no longer under patent protection

192
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:12,179
are included into the pharmacopoeia and

193
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,419
quality standards are defined of course

194
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:17,958
there are still National pharmacopors

195
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:23,939
Ireland UK Switzerland

196
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:26,119
a Germany France Poland and other EU

197
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:29,820
states do have still National

198
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:31,620
but as with the time the European

199
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,420
pharmacopoeia gets bigger and the

200
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:37,159
national pharmacopors get smaller

201
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:39,599
because at this time when something is

202
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:42,179
included in the European pharmacopoeia

203
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,060
it will be deleted deleted from the

204
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:49,199
national pharmacopors so when it comes

205
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:51,000
to the role that the EMA plays in drug

206
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,860
Discovery and development can you maybe

207
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,019
give everybody a brief little overview

208
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,700
of if somebody wants to basically

209
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:59,940
develop their own drug or their own

210
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:01,860
active pharmaceutical ingredient does it

211
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:03,959
go through the European medical Agency

212
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,639
for approval and what are the main steps

213
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:08,819
for this to happen

214
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:10,799
so first of all we still in Europe do

215
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:15,000
have not

216
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:18,719
um EU approval for any products so this

217
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:22,980
um eu-wide approval in the 27 member

218
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:25,500
states is only open for certain products

219
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:28,259
um so for example Vex signs everybody

220
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:31,559
knows that because of the pandemic and

221
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:34,740
they need to be approved by EMA and also

222
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:38,699
if you have new zero piece or you have

223
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:41,339
um yes distinct indications like a neuro

224
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:44,600
protective agents

225
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:47,399
um or a neuro degenerative

226
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,259
illness this needs to be approved

227
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:53,700
through this so-called centralized

228
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:56,120
procedure so the normal approval um and

229
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:58,160
this would also be the case for cannabis

230
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:01,919
is not

231
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:05,219
achieved by EMA because for herbal

232
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:07,740
medicine products um they are not

233
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:10,440
considered to be new chemical entities

234
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:13,799
they are considered known herbal

235
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:16,320
products and for this

236
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:19,139
um you have to go through National

237
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:23,100
procedures in single EU member states or

238
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:25,799
you or you can also decide to have

239
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:27,540
um a so-called decentralized procedure

240
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:31,078
which means that

241
00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:33,778
um you apply for approval in a group of

242
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:35,458
EU member states you can select and then

243
00:11:33,778 --> 00:11:38,519
you will select one of the member states

244
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:40,319
as being the so-called reference member

245
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:45,539
State responsible for the whole

246
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:48,300
procedure so if further cannabis Harbor

247
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:50,639
medicinal products will be developed my

248
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:53,159
expectation is that they will not be

249
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,620
approved by EMA as this might be the

250
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:58,919
case if this cannabis medicine will be

251
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:01,799
developed for diseases which have to go

252
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:04,919
through the uh through email for example

253
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:06,838
cancer any cancer product product has to

254
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:09,659
go through email but in the moment there

255
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:14,600
is no uh no cancer indication for

256
00:12:09,659 --> 00:12:18,600
cannabis it is it is more related to yes

257
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:20,820
indications which are not needed to be

258
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,759
approved by email

259
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:25,860
we see a lot of news and reports of some

260
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:28,740
biotechnology companies being able to

261
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:31,200
develop inflammation drugs whether it's

262
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:33,419
for cardiovascular disease or for bowel

263
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,300
disease are these products that get

264
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:38,159
approved by EMA it depends on the

265
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:39,899
indication there's a list of indication

266
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:40,879
but normal

267
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:43,500
um

268
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:46,439
vascular diseases are not part of this

269
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:50,100
list so it it must be a severe illness

270
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:53,700
and um and and an illness for which it

271
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:56,159
was decided that it must be available if

272
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,600
it's developed for all patients in

273
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:01,799
Europe

274
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:04,379
um so um yes I it's just you you can

275
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:06,359
download this list from the internet

276
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:08,519
um and it's uh it's part of a European

277
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:12,180
regulation what needs to go through

278
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:14,519
email what could go through EMA and what

279
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:16,679
could not and and cannabis medicines

280
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:20,278
phytomedicines

281
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:23,819
um will only be able to be approved by

282
00:13:20,278 --> 00:13:27,120
IMA if there is really an indication of

283
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:28,440
an often severe illness

284
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,500
um and

285
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,540
um or for example if if cannabis would

286
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:36,539
be antiviral

287
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:39,419
um then also a centralized procedure

288
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:42,179
could be chosen but in the moment I have

289
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:44,519
no indication maybe often indication

290
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:45,620
often indications must also go through

291
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:48,959
email

292
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:52,139
often means this is an indication of a

293
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:54,778
rare disease and this is also something

294
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:59,839
which is approved by email so this this

295
00:13:54,778 --> 00:14:04,799
could be possible and biotech

296
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:07,320
is not phyton medicine so um there is uh

297
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:09,479
that's very often a misunderstanding so

298
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,519
biotech they develop very often

299
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,019
biological medicines which are not fight

300
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,959
of pharmaceuticals so phyto

301
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:19,278
Pharmaceuticals are characterized by the

302
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:22,559
way of their manufacture I have

303
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:24,360
summarized a couple minutes ago

304
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:25,859
and

305
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,500
let's go with

306
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:30,240
the ingredient side of these helped

307
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,620
their potential new medical products

308
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,019
that are going to be created from

309
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:36,778
cannabinoids and molecules within the

310
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:38,839
cannabis plant is the most advantageous

311
00:14:36,778 --> 00:14:41,778
option synthetic

312
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:43,620
fermented biosynthesis or a

313
00:14:41,778 --> 00:14:45,379
phytopharmaceutical that comes from a

314
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,940
plant which is the most

315
00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:49,399
advantageous route you see happening in

316
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:53,399
Europe

317
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:56,039
advantages depends on what is the um

318
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:57,839
what is the target of development so it

319
00:14:56,039 --> 00:15:00,899
could be both

320
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,120
um so um if you if you look for

321
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:05,399
Innovation

322
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:07,940
and being on the on the edge of the

323
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:11,339
knife regarding innovation of course

324
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:12,839
isolated cannabinoids or maybe also

325
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:15,360
synthesized

326
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:18,300
um molecules which are similar to

327
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,720
cannabinoids of a partial

328
00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:19,819
[Music]

329
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,040
um

330
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:24,600
modified molecules originating from

331
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:27,179
cannabinoids

332
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:30,480
um CIS might be they might be considered

333
00:15:27,179 --> 00:15:33,359
to be Innovative products and the normal

334
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:37,139
extract from Cannabis or other

335
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:39,980
preparation might be more or less more

336
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:42,240
regarded as something which comes out of

337
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:45,778
traditional medicine but which could be

338
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:51,000
further developed of course in a more

339
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:53,578
um in a more advanced context

340
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,440
and lastly Before I Let You Go what are

341
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:57,419
the the things you look forward to

342
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,339
seeing the most over the next let's say

343
00:15:57,419 --> 00:16:02,659
five year period when it comes to

344
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:02,660
cannabis-based medicines

345
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,399
um I'm involved in quite a few projects

346
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:12,059
I'm aiming to develop cannabis medicines

347
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,919
in in different indications and from my

348
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:17,219
perspective this is very important that

349
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:20,399
this is is done because in the moment in

350
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:23,220
these EU member states in which cannabis

351
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,679
medicines are allowed they are

352
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:28,800
distributed to the patients based on

353
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:31,019
single patient prescription and in

354
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:33,240
Germany for example asthma gistro

355
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:37,159
preparations with without any approvals

356
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:41,220
is a kind of a so-called

357
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:43,139
No Label use because there is no real

358
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:46,019
approval process and there is only

359
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:48,060
limited evidence so we need evidence we

360
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:50,240
need approved medicines and with

361
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:53,879
availability of these approved medicines

362
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:55,259
we will then not only have these

363
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:58,559
approved medicines in the approved

364
00:16:55,259 --> 00:17:00,800
indications but we will also have a kind

365
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:03,239
of a No Label use which is better than

366
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:05,119
off-label use because if if you have a

367
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:08,519
No Label use

368
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:12,000
safety has been proven and approved not

369
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:14,639
necessarily efficacy but this is a

370
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,578
important next step to get more in the

371
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:21,199
moment we only have sativax as a

372
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:25,918
phytomedicine and we do have of course

373
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:30,058
epidiolex and and synthesized

374
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:33,419
um a canopy THC products but we need

375
00:17:30,058 --> 00:17:36,298
further cannabis medicines in order to

376
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:38,038
to further establish data on safety and

377
00:17:36,298 --> 00:17:41,099
efficacy in different indications

378
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:43,679
there's a lot of a lot of dream and wish

379
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:44,759
in this whole industry and we need

380
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,880
evidence

381
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:49,679
yeah I couldn't agree with you more

382
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:52,200
fact-based evidence is Paramount now in

383
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,940
the European industry it seems to be a

384
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,919
lot of people picking themselves they'll

385
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,620
put out any real evidence to back behind

386
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,480
their claims

387
00:17:57,619 --> 00:18:03,899
yes we need evidence so

388
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:08,700
um and this is very often very often not

389
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:10,500
given for cannabis medicines and yeah

390
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,120
