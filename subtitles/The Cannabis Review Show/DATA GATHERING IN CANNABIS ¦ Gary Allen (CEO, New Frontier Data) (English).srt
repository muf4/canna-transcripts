00:00:09,448 --> 00:00:11,490
Welcome to the next episode of the Cannabis Review.

2
00:00:11,551 --> 00:00:17,798
I'm delighted to be joined in this episode by Gary Allen, who's the CEO of New Front Deer Data based in America.

3
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:18,579
How are you keeping, Gary?

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,440
Doing well, thank you.

5
00:00:20,501 --> 00:00:26,629
It's a beautiful Friday afternoon, so I'm really excited about doing this with you.

6
00:00:27,658 --> 00:00:28,419
Thank you very much.

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,719
It's the tale of two weathers.

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,322
I'm in Ireland and it's dark and it's cold and it's rainy.

9
00:00:32,341 --> 00:00:36,243
So luckily we get to converse over chats now today.

10
00:00:36,283 --> 00:00:37,445
I'm delighted to have you on.

11
00:00:37,465 --> 00:00:41,847
You guys are one of the most preeminent companies in the terms of data gathering in the cannabis industry.

12
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:48,570
Do you maybe want to give everybody a quick little overview of your history in business and how you ended up at New Frontier Data and how long you've been there?

13
00:00:49,832 --> 00:00:50,112
Sure.

14
00:00:50,212 --> 00:00:54,335
So my career has been, well, started in the middle 90s.

15
00:00:55,743 --> 00:01:16,388
um in in data and technology with uh the you know beginning of the internet um in digital marketing uh bid management for search of a couple of companies uh that i was part of i was a chief technology officer at performix which became double click which became google uh in the mid 2000s um

16
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:40,707
And I, you know, throughout my career, you know, my, I've been really focused on, you know, solving issues with consumer data and with enhancing behaviors through the applications and how to take, uh, how to organize data in such a way that, um, mass marketers enterprises can use it and make relevant decisions.

17
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,221
I've been with New Frontier Data.

18
00:01:45,242 --> 00:01:46,322
That's the second part of the question.

19
00:01:46,742 --> 00:01:51,563
I've been with New Frontier Data since 2016, November of 2016.

20
00:01:51,942 --> 00:01:56,084
New Frontier Data was started by Jadavar Decarcer in 2014.

21
00:01:56,484 --> 00:02:04,007
And really, the idea behind it was, you know, there was an emerging market, you know, cannabis.

22
00:02:04,466 --> 00:02:04,566
And

23
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:17,664
there weren't any real data collection, market research, or market reporting, as you see in some of the much more mature markets.

24
00:02:18,444 --> 00:02:32,170
And so Giada started the company to collect data, vet it, make it professional, make it usable, and then disseminate that data to investors, operators, researchers, policymakers.

25
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:33,972
And we have been

26
00:02:35,342 --> 00:02:42,166
Over the last 10 years, almost 10 years now, we've operated in as many as 64 countries at once.

27
00:02:43,586 --> 00:02:48,108
We've collected data from over 100 countries worldwide.

28
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:52,252
We really focused this last few years on the American market.

29
00:02:52,271 --> 00:03:00,316
The American market is very large and very diverse because there are 30 plus individual markets and ecosystems that have had to be created

30
00:03:03,157 --> 00:03:13,568
And so those supply chains, those consumers, those retail operators needed a lot of focus and understanding of the data that they are generating, collecting and what to do with it.

31
00:03:15,651 --> 00:03:16,412
Yes, very good.

32
00:03:16,712 --> 00:03:28,882
It seems to me like the most important decisions that any good executive team at any company could be using is to implement strategies to gather data and how to read, use computer science to maybe execute on that data.

33
00:03:29,402 --> 00:03:34,526
When it comes to the data gathering in cannabis, what do you see are the best sources?

34
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:41,313
Is the point to sales systems or is there a multitude of tools that you would use to gather data across a multitude of industries?

35
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:52,319
So the question of what is the best source of data for any particular industry is really determined by the use case of that data.

36
00:03:52,438 --> 00:04:01,626
So, for example, for dispensaries, obviously, their point of sale data is the foundation of all of their data collection.

37
00:04:02,247 --> 00:04:07,111
The interesting thing about the cannabis industry is that, again, as I said earlier, because

38
00:04:08,257 --> 00:04:28,095
every single supply chain has to be created in a bubble for every single state there is no shortage of data in this industry we have tons of data from grow data right from distribution from manufacturing from testing uh medical

39
00:04:29,115 --> 00:04:48,836
both patients as well as the administration of that the administering of medical registrations and the doctors that are operating in the medical in the medical market and then of course with the dispensaries you know all of the retail data all you know there there is a there is a plethora of data the the ideal

40
00:04:51,031 --> 00:05:00,915
you know, answer to your question is, you know, depending on the use case and your vertical that you're in within the industry, you know, really will depend on the source of the data that you need.

41
00:05:02,596 --> 00:05:10,579
When it comes to some of the devices from vapes and medical inhaling devices, do you see that as going to be a huge future source of data?

42
00:05:10,598 --> 00:05:20,442
I'm sure the ability to consume the patient's, uh, uh, number of puffs a day and how much they're consuming on a weekly basis is going to be almost like these older rings.

43
00:05:20,963 --> 00:05:24,944
where you can basically get access to this information that doesn't currently exist at the moment?

44
00:05:26,766 --> 00:05:27,066
Sure.

45
00:05:27,185 --> 00:05:30,626
And there actually are a bunch of data sources in and around that.

46
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:36,807
There are a bunch of apparatus data collection that's happening with vape right now.

47
00:05:38,908 --> 00:05:48,692
One of the challenges in collecting data in that manner is that we don't understand yet the prescription.

48
00:05:49,877 --> 00:06:03,841
So we don't really understand yet that you can prescribe other medications by a specific milligram, by a specific dosage, by a specific number of times a day that the doctor controls.

49
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,061
So almost all of that data collection now is user controlled.

50
00:06:08,903 --> 00:06:14,384
It's the consumer, the patient that is giving you that data, and each patient will use it differently.

51
00:06:15,504 --> 00:06:16,964
In order for that data to be

52
00:06:17,565 --> 00:06:37,791
really useful at an enterprise level, we will have to have a far wider standardization of understanding what the prescriptive use of medical marijuana is for the specific ailment or malady that they're trying to cure or they're trying to treat.

53
00:06:41,365 --> 00:06:42,226
Very interesting.

54
00:06:42,387 --> 00:06:52,074
When it comes to the use of analytics and technology to implement the strategies in cannabis, how important is this for a company in your opinion?

55
00:06:53,696 --> 00:06:59,640
Well, I'm, you know, in this day and age, data is, you know, data, everybody says data is more valuable than oil and it is.

56
00:07:01,081 --> 00:07:04,664
And as I said earlier, there is no shortage of data in cannabis.

57
00:07:04,704 --> 00:07:07,286
When we first got into the industry, when the industry first started,

58
00:07:07,673 --> 00:07:15,634
there was a big worry that people didn't really understand how to collect data or how much data would actually be created.

59
00:07:16,175 --> 00:07:19,115
However, that's not our worry anymore, right?

60
00:07:19,495 --> 00:07:24,257
Your question of, is it important for people to use data, right, for their strategies?

61
00:07:24,396 --> 00:07:25,197
Of course it is.

62
00:07:25,336 --> 00:07:29,317
And again, it's all, it's user determined, you know, determined.

63
00:07:29,577 --> 00:07:31,317
Sorry, my dog is in the background.

64
00:07:31,338 --> 00:07:34,499
You're okay, don't worry.

65
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:36,998
So for example, a grower,

66
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:37,740
Right.

67
00:07:38,021 --> 00:07:49,870
LED lights and and nutrient delivery and water delivery is all is all administered now by by, you know, AI and machine learning.

68
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,312
And there's a lot of data that is collected.

69
00:07:53,733 --> 00:08:00,137
And, you know, what is the THC production under certain conditions in manufacturing the same?

70
00:08:00,336 --> 00:08:00,497
Right.

71
00:08:00,517 --> 00:08:05,380
There's a lot of there's a lot of challenges in the in the extraction and manufacturing.

72
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:13,185
that data will in understanding what's happened before and predict being able to predict what will happen during the next growth cycle.

73
00:08:13,644 --> 00:08:16,548
And then during the manufacturing process is really important.

74
00:08:16,968 --> 00:08:20,711
And that filters all the, I'm not going to go through all 70 some odd verticals,

75
00:08:21,172 --> 00:08:38,944
But that filters all the way through to the dispensary, really understanding not only what products are being sold and your profit margin and your operations and your efficiency, but also what products should you be selling to consumers based on the consumers that live around you.

76
00:08:39,524 --> 00:08:41,326
And so data really is

77
00:08:43,755 --> 00:08:54,702
You know, it's really prevalent through every decision that we make and an understanding, you know, what decision you're trying to make and understanding what question you're trying to answer is really important.

78
00:08:55,163 --> 00:08:56,504
And then the data is available.

79
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:05,769
What determines something to become an emerging trend that would make you guys start to keep your eye on it and start covering the data on it?

80
00:09:07,995 --> 00:09:33,615
um well that's a very good that's a great great question um for us it's you know the one of the the ones this year the last you know year and a half obviously the psychedelic market is an emerging trend right um psilocybin has is more understood than even thc um to the pharmaceutical companies even to the federal government and uh to the fda and so there was a there was a new

81
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:39,313
wave of investment and of interest in that part of the market.

82
00:09:39,374 --> 00:09:47,479
And so we will go and collect data wherever the market kind of tells us to go based on the activity within the market.

83
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:51,341
So it's not an exact science.

84
00:09:51,562 --> 00:09:57,787
It's an understanding that we're only as good as the data that our customers need.

85
00:09:58,727 --> 00:10:02,129
So we will go and we will find whatever data it is that they ask for.

86
00:10:03,715 --> 00:10:15,777
When it comes to the emerging European market that looks like it should be in the next however many years is going to kick off, again, what are the metrics that would determine for it to peak your interest?

87
00:10:15,836 --> 00:10:18,317
Obviously, see with Germany, it's stop, start, stop, start.

88
00:10:18,717 --> 00:10:23,998
A lot of the countries might have had a medical program, but it's very limited, like with Ireland, where there's a handful of people on it.

89
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:31,359
What are your short-term expectations for Europe in terms of the ability to be able to gather good country-by-country data?

90
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:31,600
Because

91
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:43,528
I'm sure that data will initially be valuable for North American companies who want to penetrate into these markets and whether they're an edibles company wants to manufacture or sell here or a company wants to get into retail.

92
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:47,531
So I think that question is kind of twofold.

93
00:10:47,792 --> 00:10:55,577
First and foremost, five years ago, we were in almost all of those countries and or collecting data from almost all of those countries.

94
00:10:56,158 --> 00:10:59,061
Europe looked to be lighting up, right?

95
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,582
And with Germany, France,

96
00:11:02,644 --> 00:11:03,785
We were in Romania.

97
00:11:03,905 --> 00:11:06,447
We were actually in the Middle East as well.

98
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:13,072
And obviously England and Great Britain's medical programs, which all started to surge.

99
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:14,754
And then they've all constricted.

100
00:11:16,235 --> 00:11:20,138
And the pandemic, I believe, is probably one of the biggest reasons for that.

101
00:11:20,618 --> 00:11:27,002
And not in the sense of only in the sense of that there were so many other things to worry about.

102
00:11:27,663 --> 00:11:30,784
Lawmakers in those countries were not.

103
00:11:31,277 --> 00:11:32,298
worried about cannabis.

104
00:11:33,778 --> 00:11:39,022
We have good partnerships in Great Britain, as well as Europe.

105
00:11:39,802 --> 00:11:41,062
And we have data.

106
00:11:41,523 --> 00:11:49,348
There are partners over there with prohibition partners that we work with that, you know, as they grow and as they tell us to pay more attention to it, we will.

107
00:11:50,469 --> 00:11:56,012
We continue every year, though, to refresh all of our data from a state, from a country level.

108
00:11:56,893 --> 00:12:00,415
And so, you know, the first quarter of every year, we spend a

109
00:12:01,192 --> 00:12:07,258
a lot of time and money going out to, you know, we survey about 170 countries.

110
00:12:08,378 --> 00:12:11,501
You know, we end up collecting data from about 120 of them.

111
00:12:12,421 --> 00:12:13,902
And we'll do the same this year.

112
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:17,024
And then once we look at that data, you know, we'll look at it every year.

113
00:12:17,144 --> 00:12:24,370
For now, the second part of your question about, you know, American companies that are wanting to expand.

114
00:12:26,311 --> 00:12:34,853
The American market is in such a place right now that people are really driving to profitability and they're driving to efficiency.

115
00:12:35,293 --> 00:12:39,474
They're not driving to market expansion like we saw five years ago, right?

116
00:12:39,533 --> 00:12:40,673
It's not a land grab.

117
00:12:41,153 --> 00:12:52,535
Because the investments in the US have primarily dried up over the last two and a half years, they don't have a lot of R&amp;D money to go out and look at a new country and try to predict.

118
00:12:53,056 --> 00:12:55,557
Lastly, what I'll say is, as you pointed out,

119
00:12:56,274 --> 00:13:02,015
you know, the biggest economy that looked like they were going to actually move forward was Germany.

120
00:13:02,735 --> 00:13:05,376
And, you know, it's a start and stop and start and stop.

121
00:13:05,437 --> 00:13:11,820
And we're at a point now with Germany that almost every word becomes a news cycle.

122
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:25,625
And so incrementally, they're not making enough movement forward for any one of the data companies to kind of launch in there and, you know, kind of put boots on the ground and really start to try to understand that market.

123
00:13:27,235 --> 00:13:28,716
Yeah, it's been very interesting talking to you.

124
00:13:28,736 --> 00:13:37,242
Before I let you go, are you hoping for something in the next 12 months to happen in terms of federal legalization in America, or is this another one?

125
00:13:37,823 --> 00:13:42,687
Everybody, that's one of the big, I'm surprised it took so long to ask that question, to be honest with you.

126
00:13:43,947 --> 00:13:49,492
And listen, part of my answer is New Frontier Data's answer, and part of my answer is Gary Allen's answer.

127
00:13:49,613 --> 00:13:51,274
From New Frontier Data's point of view,

128
00:13:53,110 --> 00:14:03,360
We're here to support the federal government in any way possible and helping them as we have with data and with real vetted research and understanding the industry.

129
00:14:05,062 --> 00:14:13,229
Gary Allen's answer is our political system right now is in such disarray and such

130
00:14:17,335 --> 00:14:39,046
conflict with itself that I don't believe in 2024 with the presidential election, the general election coming up at the end of 2024, with all of the legal battles of the candidate on the GOP side, the kind of misunderstanding of the candidate on the Democratic side.

131
00:14:40,267 --> 00:14:46,630
I don't think that this is going to be a priority for the federal government.

132
00:14:47,096 --> 00:14:50,798
That being said, don't forget that the U.S.

133
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:58,466
Congress somehow passed a law to abolish daylight savings a couple of years ago, and they didn't know they did it.

134

135
00:15:06,754 --> 00:15:13,039
