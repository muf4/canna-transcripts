pretty much delighted to have you answer

14
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:46,019
I was doing I got a bit of research in

15
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:48,780
in media and cannabis and I came across

16
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,039
a load era series and found some of the

17
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,899
hilarious so I thought I'd get you on

18
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,579
and we can get it I have a little

19
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:54,600
discussion on cannabis media do you

20
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:56,340
maybe want to give everybody a quick

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,140
little overview of how you ended up in

22
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,079
the industry and and starting up Panama

23
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,920
TV yeah certainly essentially like most

24
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,558
of us

25
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,060
been smoking since I was about uh 14 15

26
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:09,000
kind of thing consuming the whole time

27
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,280
and uh as time goes on you kind of find

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,180
yourself in a position where you take a

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,040
direction there's things that you're

30
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:18,118
passionate about so uh yeah I just

31
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:20,159
decided to you know bring it into a into

32
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:21,840
something entertainment based so uh so

33
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,380
yeah it's been good the kind of on TV

34
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,880
that's really a consequence of the

35
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:27,780
forethought really so the Cannabis

36
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:29,759
industry has kind of been in this

37
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,079
emphasis the whole time and uh it's just

38
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,819
been emerging with this consuming

39
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:35,039
cannabis is aware that you know it's

40
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:35,758
it's only at the beginning stages so I

41
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,560
thought

42
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,000
apply a passionate element into it I've

43
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,939
always been in the drawing so at the

44
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,759
same time as uh consumer cannabis um I

45
00:01:41,938 --> 00:01:46,739
started to make the comics uh over this

46
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,239
side here you see these Comics here and

47
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:50,219
instead making them and they're

48
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,199
developing it into an animation series

49
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:54,959
and as a consequence of trying to make

50
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,600
it visible to the industry uh create the

51
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:59,699
podcast and uh as a kind of like our

52
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:00,839
trajectory for the animation series and

53
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,880
it's taking a long time to get to a

54
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,740
stage where the animations is ready so

55
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,539
it's only in the past year one halfway

56
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:08,758
through season two so uh so yeah the

57
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,560
engine's running and uh yeah it's good

58
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:12,598
to see where it's going

59
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,280
yeah it's great to see I think once you

60
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:15,598
get into the in the content side of the

61
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,459
things you kind of realize that at 50

62
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:19,500
100 episodes is when you'll actually

63
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:21,360
start to get comfortable living that

64
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,979
it's gone a couple of cool little

65
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,680
questions on your episodes like how long

66
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:28,318
does each episode take to make from the

67
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,120
start to the idea to the end and the

68
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:32,639
production of post-production

69
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,860
a month so it's four weeks four four

70
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,119
solid weeks like essentially I'll hook

71
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,160
up with the idea each the other thing

72
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,319
I'll point out as well at the moment um

73
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,598
I'm working through season two so season

74
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:44,579
two um each one of the animations that's

75
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:46,318
happened at the moment from uh season

76
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,140
one scene one season one and season two

77
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:51,598
is essentially uh an animation adapted

78
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:54,000
from this comic book uh here that one

79
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:55,859
there essentially so there's there's 14

80
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,719
um original kind of man comics that's in

81
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,920
that book and uh that took about 14

82
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,539
months because each one of the comics

83
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:02,098
was a month to make

84
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:03,780
um so then that was the intention the

85
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:04,919
foundation was for the comics that have

86
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,680
then adapted them at the animation

87
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:10,559
series so I'm on episode 11 which is

88
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,120
season two episode four so this is Comic

89
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,620
eleven so I've got three more after this

90
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,420
now we've seen uh season two finished

91
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,620
and I'll be all the original Comics will

92
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:18,958
be done

93
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,000
um of from the original comic books and

94
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,378
uh and I'll be working on season three

95
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,780
um but it's a month per episode for

96
00:03:22,378 --> 00:03:26,699
animation from the idea the storyboard

97
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,840
but essentially because of the fact that

98
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:29,280
these are adapted from the comic book

99
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,039
series I don't need to do a storyboard

100
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,378
because the storyboard comic itself so

101
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:36,239
um so one season three arrives one of

102
00:03:34,378 --> 00:03:37,979
the original Comics are done that'll be

103
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,539
exciting because that'll be completely

104
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:41,878
new content there will be no Comics

105
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:43,199
based on it that'll be like um my

106
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:44,759
intention is to create kind of like a

107
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:47,219
format so each season is seven episodes

108
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:48,539
and uh for scene for season three the

109
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:50,818
seven episodes are going to be in

110
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:52,859
correlation with the seven principles of

111
00:03:50,818 --> 00:03:55,679
the hermetic philosophy and I'm gonna

112
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:57,959
essentially intertwine the uh cannabis

113
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,340
rhetoric cannabis narrative contemporary

114
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:01,319
cannabis information

115
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,640
on top of the seven principles of the

116
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:04,378
hermetic philosophy because it would

117
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:06,000
kind of be you know eventually it'll be

118
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:08,878
fun I find both and passionate about

119
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,580
both and uh and yeah so it's a month per

120
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:14,158
episode and at the moment I'm on uh

121
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,139
comic 11 essentially episode 11 so um

122
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:17,399
but I don't know if you're aware um I've

123
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:18,478
mentioned on a couple of other podcasts

124
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,978
but I'm actually working on the kind of

125
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,060
man movie that'll be ready at the end of

126
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:22,740
August

127
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,918
um and that's I'm only about scene four

128
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,960
and uh scene four of nine and again uh

129
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:30,180
each scene takes a month and this is

130
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:31,918
what's interesting about the process of

131
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,379
creating the comics is that inevitably

132
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:35,579
it's been a uh each comic has been a

133
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:37,439
precursor tip episode and the episode

134
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:38,879
has been a Precast to the scenes so it's

135
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:40,978
really a domino effect

136
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,418
um and it's really a fascinating end

137
00:04:40,978 --> 00:04:44,519
process because it's not exclusive to

138
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:46,740
even animation this is consistent it

139
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:48,539
seems to be with any craft any Endeavor

140
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:50,400
there's a whatever you do in the micro

141
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,560
is representing the macro you know and

142
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,060
the micro in this case is the the single

143
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,978
panel Comics then I went on to the film

144
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,259
comics and then the macro in this sense

145
00:04:55,978 --> 00:04:59,879
is the is the movie which is uh let's

146
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:03,199
say that's going to be

147
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:06,719
that's going to be a belt on nowadays

148
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:10,020
I very much look forward to it and you

149
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,120
also wrote a book a case for cannabis if

150
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:14,219
I'm not mistaken correct that's right

151
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,379
yeah yeah okay what was the reason

152
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,639
behind that was that a long process was

153
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:19,680
it just trying to get your thoughts out

154
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,240
on paper was it a an actual specific

155
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,280
strategic I'm going to convince an

156
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,860
argument to this type of audience

157
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:28,079
essentially the the the case for

158
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:30,960
cannabis was written in 2019 2000 and

159
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:33,839
the end of 2018 2019 and the reason why

160
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:35,339
I wrote it was because uh I was putting

161
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:36,839
the the planning into doing the channel

162
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:39,299
so I was linking to myself with most

163
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:41,038
people that are cannabis orientated if

164
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,020
you promote any form of discussion based

165
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:43,800
on cannabis to the lame and they'll

166
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:45,240
think that you're just promoting

167
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,439
something that you like so inevitably

168
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,519
you're going to be biased so I was like

169
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:49,379
well I don't have any credentials

170
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:50,639
there's no academic background for any

171
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:52,379
form of science or chemistry or

172
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,000
biochemistry so I was like what can I do

173
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:55,620
to provide a foundation of

174
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,300
professionalism I don't have a white

175
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,918
coat that's no that would help and so I

176
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,780
was like well if I create a book and

177
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:02,279
this this academically referenced then

178
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:03,839
I'll be able to promote myself in a much

179
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:05,399
more professional manner when the

180
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:07,379
channel arrives so I was like it took me

181
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,939
four and a half five months to write and

182
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:10,139
the case for cannabis and that was about

183
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:11,219
three months before I started the

184
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:12,360
channel

185
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,880
um and the case with cannabis

186
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,639
essentially is a it's like 10 11

187
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:19,500
chapters each chapter is relevant to uh

188
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:21,120
main talking point in the Cannabis world

189
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,199
so it's essentially the best way to

190
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,139
describe the book is it's a broad

191
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:26,580
spectrum analysis of all the main issues

192
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:28,139
relating to cannabis so you've got a

193
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:29,219
chapter on endocannability system a

194
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:31,319
chapter on

195
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,120
um the terpenes a chapter on cannabis

196
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:34,620
medicinal value a chapter on

197
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,538
recreational Cannabis out sorry

198
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,978
Recreation of substance use and inside

199
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:39,360
that chapter I really enjoyed

200
00:06:37,978 --> 00:06:42,120
researching for that one because what I

201
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,699
found was essentially compared cannabis

202
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,800
consumption and a recreational format to

203
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:48,900
other recreational substances but I used

204
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,280
alcohol but I also use caffeine and

205
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:52,739
energy drinks and the context of

206
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:53,939
caffeine and everybody's aware that

207
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,860
these things are kind of detriment to

208
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:57,060
your health but I had no idea I mean the

209
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,979
caffeinated energy drinks are

210
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:01,019
responsible for deaths you know like

211
00:06:58,978 --> 00:07:02,459
energy drinks have killed people and yet

212
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:03,959
these things are rarely available on the

213
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:07,138
shop and then we've got this cannabis

214
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:09,180
this this very natural plant which is a

215
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:11,699
booster physiology which is still

216
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:13,319
prohibited it's still the information is

217
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:15,900
still being pushed underground

218
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:18,180
intentionally so um so yeah the book was

219
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:19,439
essentially a cathartic release of

220
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,300
information I've been collecting over

221
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,918
the course of years and then I've put a

222
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,598
really concerted effort Focus there for

223
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:26,639
over the course of four months to

224
00:07:24,598 --> 00:07:29,519
complete all the Contemporary research

225
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,199
and put into the book and uh yeah I'm

226
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:32,399
delighted with it to be honest but the

227
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,840
only thing I would say is because of the

228
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:35,638
fact that I had nobody to proofread it

229
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:37,019
when going from one chapter to the next

230
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:38,819
it's kind of intense you know there's no

231
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:40,859
breathing room there's not any like side

232
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:43,319
step or we think it's just intensive

233
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,360
[ __ ] academically reference stuff so

234
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:46,439
so yeah but that's good and you can get

235
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,400
that on Amazon if anybody that's

236
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:49,199
interested

237
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:51,478
yeah definitely we've been putting up

238
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,580
the link to all of the plases of content

239
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:55,258
for Connor in the description on whether

240
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:57,538
it's YouTube or Spotify wherever you are

241
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:59,038
it is funny to see the hypocrisy from

242
00:07:57,538 --> 00:08:01,318
some side of the things we can already

243
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:03,598
point to three and a half thousand debts

244
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:05,759
a year from alcohol in Ireland yet our

245
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:07,978
t-shock is out opening up a Distillery

246
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,740
for whiskey and at the same time trying

247
00:08:07,978 --> 00:08:12,240
to say the Cannabis is bad uh it

248
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,699
resonates I think across the whole world

249
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,740
the hip-hop hypocrisy from one side to

250
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:18,720
the other that's bizarre I mean it's

251
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:21,478
really bizarre and I could see why

252
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,060
individuals who are not informed about

253
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:25,860
the the the chemical basis of the plant

254
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,120
and they have no knowledge of cannabis I

255
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,620
can see why they're kind of consumed by

256
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,939
the rhetoric that cannabis is a drug

257
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,139
it's bad for you all these kind of

258
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:33,958
things because you've essentially got a

259
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:36,120
society that promotes poisonous material

260
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:37,139
under the basis of tax really these

261
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,418
things I mean I don't know I'm pretty

262
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:40,379
certain alcohol the legislation behind

263
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:42,658
alcohol

264
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:44,458
um is based under a category of like

265
00:08:42,658 --> 00:08:46,259
time period I think it's like 80 years

266
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:47,399
ago therefore it's still legitimate I

267
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:49,439
could be wrong

268
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:51,240
um but there's there's peculiar

269
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,279
legislation that's related to substances

270
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,500
which are poisonous and yet there is a

271
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:57,480
suppression of information for for this

272
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,580
plant which is beneficial actually

273
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,800
crucial I mean an interesting thing that

274
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:04,080
I found most explicit when I was writing

275
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:05,399
the book was that cannabis is not only

276
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,959
crucial to your endocannaborating system

277
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:09,059
cannabis and a consequence of

278
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:11,099
researching the plan itself

279
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:13,018
we discovered more about our own

280
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,820
physiology like we didn't know about the

281
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:17,940
endocannabino system we discovered parts

282
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,980
of our body and in a crucial uh the

283
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,200
master controller as a consequence of

284
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,879
cannabis like so we we found out more

285
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,220
about the human race as a consequence of

286
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:27,419
this plant and yet you're still punished

287
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,278
for it you've got people in prison for

288
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:31,199
it and you know people are dying because

289
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:33,059
they can't get access to it you know and

290
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,440
that's why let's say things like what

291
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:36,539
you're doing you know the Cannabis media

292
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,300
thing is so crucial to to kind of break

293
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:41,219
the stigma and uh I think personally the

294
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:44,399
the stigma and then the narrative that

295
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,839
cannabis is a a negative thing will

296
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,580
still be present long after the

297
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,200
legislation's passed and makes it more

298
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:51,720
favorable you know it's had a really

299
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,120
profound impact on the psyche of society

300
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,860
yeah it is guys to take the stuff like

301
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,778
magic mushrooms could just Breeze boy

302
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:01,080
legislation where it's kind of positions

303
00:09:57,778 --> 00:10:03,179
this moral compass of wrongdoing but

304
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,860
that's neither here nor there as you

305
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:06,359
were staying in cannabis media is where

306
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,740
we kind of need to focus and that's the

307
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,360
next thing I wanted to talk about is the

308
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:12,060
Cannabis media and content on a global

309
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,860
scale I don't know about you but it

310
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:15,539
couldn't be more underwhelmed by the

311
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,459
content that comes out of America in

312
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:19,079
Canada from like companies that are

313
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:20,639
supposedly worth tens of millions or

314
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,379
hundreds of millions that they don't

315
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,360
have a couple of thousand to be able to

316
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:26,879
develop good content on a weekly boy

317
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,620
weekly or even monthly basis what are

318
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:31,500
your thoughts on the Cannabis media

319
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:33,179
content uh overview of the global

320
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,220
industry

321
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:36,958
very similar quite honestly I'm kind of

322
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,278
woefully out of touch when it comes to

323
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:40,139
really any entertainment based outside

324
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:41,639
of the UK I mean I don't even really um

325
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,199
pretty much attempt I spent so much time

326
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:45,539
focused on drawing and creating

327
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,040
animation which is kind of in concert

328
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:48,439
with your comment really because at the

329
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:50,699
same time is that there's not really a

330
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,260
significant presence of cannabis media

331
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:55,140
I'm trying to construct it independently

332
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:57,179
yeah yeah so even if you think as we

333
00:10:55,139 --> 00:11:00,480
spoke just before a camera like there's

334
00:10:57,179 --> 00:11:01,919
the the two the duo said and Mike a guy

335
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,240
and a girl from America I think they're

336
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:04,860
in very good work they're really

337
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,019
professional high-end shows some of it's

338
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:09,060
hilarious as well like that but your

339
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:11,459
your scraping that like single digit

340
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:12,899
kind of performers or YouTube channels

341
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:15,419
or whatever it may be not even

342
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:16,740
necessarily main big budget content it

343
00:11:15,419 --> 00:11:19,379
just seems to be that there's not even

344
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:21,000
Brands behind content creators that are

345
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:24,179
sponsoring their channels or wherever it

346
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,879
may be do you think that's just a lack

347
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:29,639
of federal legislation in America and um

348
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:31,200
a lack of clarity in Europe or the

349
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:32,879
budgets aren't just even there or the

350
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,519
people running them just don't have a

351
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:37,559
clue how to run a cannabis business for

352
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,060
the Cannabis consumer industry

353
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:40,679
to be honest I think it could probably

354
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:42,059
be um a mixture of those things

355
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:45,419
legislative but I think a lot of the

356
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:47,879
time the the big mainstream cannabis

357
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:49,319
um like people that are behind these

358
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:50,578
kind of things are kind of it could be

359
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,379
that they're stuck in their ways so the

360
00:11:50,578 --> 00:11:54,059
like High Times or or other individuals

361
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:56,220
that they've been producing content in a

362
00:11:54,059 --> 00:11:58,078
particular way for so long that it's

363
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,278
very difficult to kind of become novel

364
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:01,078
you know it's very difficult to break

365
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:02,939
out of the the discipline in which

366
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:04,559
you've made yourself in the first place

367
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:07,680
and I think that's where

368
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:09,479
um podcasts or um Independent Media they

369
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:12,059
seems so unique and they're so necessary

370
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,820
because that's there that's they came

371
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:17,039
into the the kind of a space with that

372
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:19,620
is their their creative Outlet whereas

373
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:21,059
are these other creative Brands and that

374
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,320
are talking about cannabis they had

375
00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:24,119
something different I'm thinking

376
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,500
predominant predominantly magazine based

377
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,060
really I mean it's very difficult to go

378
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,200
from being a predominantly magazine

379
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:29,699
orientated

380
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,500
um production to then going right let's

381
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,839
now sponsor to do a podcast let's now do

382
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,220
this so it could just be it could just

383
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,959
be aged

384
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,940
um production you know it could just be

385
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,919
that um I do also think as well that

386
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:42,839
it's kind of that there is so much

387
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:45,000
caution around how you speak about

388
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:46,680
cannabis that sometimes either not to

389
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
engage in conversation and sometimes

390
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:50,039
either not to produce that kind of

391
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,059
content because you could maybe make a

392
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:52,319
difference you can maybe make something

393
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:53,578
wrong or something like that so it's

394
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,320
like let's just we'll stick with what

395
00:12:53,578 --> 00:12:57,059
we're doing and that'll be safe we've

396
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,100
got enough numbers and just kind of more

397
00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:00,838
of a cautionary approach than one that

398
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,220
should be Innovative or one that should

399
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:03,899
be more focused on the fact that like

400
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,360
let's break the boundaries of how the

401
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:07,740
discussion has been taken place yeah it

402
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,480
seems to me it's just very strange if

403
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,579
you take something like M A for example

404
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,800
your lab DraftKings will sponsor 10 of

405
00:13:11,578 --> 00:13:15,899
the biggest podcasts and have a blanket

406
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:17,819
let's say advertisement of all the main

407
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:20,578
consumers in that industry you'll get

408
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,959
the same with Coca-Cola and FIFA and a

409
00:13:20,578 --> 00:13:23,939
number of other big Brands it just

410
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:25,500
doesn't seem to be that they either

411
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,360
haven't cut down to the opportunity

412
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,860
that's there because investment from

413
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,019
Brands will help grow a channel which

414
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,759
will help grow the audience and and vice

415
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:35,278
versa I think there's a massive

416
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:37,139
opportunity there for marketing officers

417
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:39,600
or content officers of companies to

418
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:41,339
people like yourself people like Martin

419
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,100
that we spoke about there's a number of

420
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:46,860
other uh top podcasts like the Cannabis

421
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:49,259
conversation with uh aroush and and a

422
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,820
couple of other guys so it'd be good to

423
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:52,379
see some of the money flown in towards

424
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,000
the content creation side of things and

425
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:55,860
pick up the speed in this industry

426
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,720
that's actually a great Point that's a

427
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:59,278
great point and I'm all for somebody to

428
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,660
respond to the Caravan stuff [ __ ]

429
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:02,519
right bring this bring the [ __ ] money

430
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:03,600
over it's necessary because let's be

431
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:06,179
honest we're all doing this for free

432
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,440
this is a this is a passion LED Endeavor

433
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,578
this is like you've got to try and pay

434
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,100
the rent at the same time as doing this

435
00:14:08,578 --> 00:14:12,778
and I think that'd be a fantastic

436
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,800
um boost to what is everybody's doing

437
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:15,480
because you'll provide more of an

438
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:16,799
authenticity if you've been sponsored

439
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,480
but going back to what you mentioned

440
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:19,679
about the legislation barriers that's

441
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,360
potentially the reason why that's not

442
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:23,519
happened so if you're a if you're an

443
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,620
organization and you're sponsoring

444
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,560
uh private

445
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:31,019
um Independent Media that's based on our

446
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:32,399
plan or a substance that's illegal in

447
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:34,019
the region at the projection of content

448
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,399
that's kind of conflicting to your

449
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:37,019
marketing strategy you know it's very

450
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:39,120
difficult to make that you know and as

451
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:41,578
you know when it comes to innocent like

452
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,778
um Financial transactions that's based

453
00:14:41,578 --> 00:14:44,578
in cannabis any form of financial

454
00:14:42,778 --> 00:14:46,679
transaction with cannabis that's based

455
00:14:44,578 --> 00:14:48,479
on a region that's um prohibiting it

456
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:49,739
immediately banks are [ __ ] not taken

457
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,240
out on board you know I mean you're

458
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,039
shutting it down and so I think the

459
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,778
amount of barriers that are in place um

460
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:57,480
could potentially be the main reason why

461
00:14:54,778 --> 00:14:59,278
that's not happened and uh yeah I hope I

462
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,800
hope it changes I really do

463
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:03,659
yeah well I think we're one good piece

464
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:06,299
of legislation whether it be in the

465
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:08,039
Czech Republic be it in Germany be it in

466
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:11,099
federal legalization in the United

467
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:13,980
States away from a lot of M A activity

468
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:16,199
and a lot of more movement and the the

469
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:18,659
consumer being able to benefit from from

470
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:19,799
the the revenue and capital that the

471
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:21,480
companies that are selling them products

472
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:23,639
for should be able to benefit from there

473
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,920
should be Loyalty Rewards content

474
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:27,419
concerts there should be tons of things

475
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:29,819
that are being done for the consumer

476
00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:32,278
that are actually spending the 10 euro

477
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:33,420
or ten dollars per gram on on specific

478
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:35,399
type of flower

479
00:15:33,419 --> 00:15:36,479
I feel I agree and just come back to

480
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:37,740
actually what I said before about the

481
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,800
movie one of the things I'm hoping to

482
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:42,720
achieve is to get um legitimate sponsors

483
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,759
um through a cannabis businesses or

484
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,800
organizations for the movie itself and

485
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:48,659
to then promote it um essentially

486
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:50,458
originally through the UK but also

487
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:51,838
internationally so my intention is to

488
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:54,659
hopefully get into like the Montreal

489
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,639
film festival or Adelaide and I'm hoping

490
00:15:54,659 --> 00:15:58,500
to get it um viewed down product airs

491
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,539
there's a numerous independent um

492
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,458
cinemas around Scotland um in northern

493
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:04,919
England as well that I'm hoping to get

494
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:06,599
viewed because essentially the basis of

495
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:09,659
the movie is going to resonate with

496
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,759
everybody that has any form of knowledge

497
00:16:09,659 --> 00:16:12,958
of cannabis at all like the main body in

498
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,000
the movie people are going to know

499
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:17,759
immediately why he's the body the

500
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,620
fundamental story behind why caraman is

501
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,120
who he is immediately people are going

502
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,820
to be like oh [ __ ] it like this is going

503
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,500
to click so many things for people and

504
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,480
uh and interestingly as well the movie

505
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,698
even though it's got a very explicit

506
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,560
cannabis theme the bad is kind of

507
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:33,359
esteemed two bodies are kind of esteemed

508
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:35,278
actually the heroes cannabis team has

509
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,740
has role before he became kahneman's

510
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:40,620
cannabis themed that is on top of that

511
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:43,919
um undertone essentially underneath that

512
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:45,419
explicit um template is a story which is

513
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,338
based in all of our Journeys in life

514
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:49,019
where each single one of us is walking

515
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,699
through life with a quest of what we're

516
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:52,198
doing here why is it we're doing what

517
00:16:50,698 --> 00:16:53,578
we're doing and it's essentially the

518
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:54,479
Philosopher's Journey that's what you're

519
00:16:53,578 --> 00:16:56,399
dealing with

520
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,959
um whether you're aware of or not all of

521
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,839
us are walking through your life with

522
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:02,399
this existential pursuit of meaning and

523
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:04,318
that's the nature of what the kind of

524
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,599
man movie is it's an existential film

525
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:07,918
and with humor and a you know it's

526
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:09,838
[ __ ] swearing all the way through it

527
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,339
let's be honest and on top of that is

528
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:13,318
that the Cannabis

529
00:17:11,338 --> 00:17:15,178
um story you know pharmaceutical basis

530
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:16,619
and all this kind of [ __ ] so that's

531
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:18,120
going to be a big deal this year that's

532
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,859
going to be a really exciting thing when

533
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:22,198
that's released um and it won't be

534
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:23,698
available online immediately and it will

535
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:26,459
be essentially doing a tour around the

536
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:28,259
UK Cinema wise and then after that most

537
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:29,700
likely it'll be through PayPal or

538
00:17:28,259 --> 00:17:31,558
something like that like a download

539
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,360
subscription thing whatever you can

540
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:34,500
watch at one time and but that's going

541
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:36,058
to be

542
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,200
that's going to be in the same line this

543
00:17:36,058 --> 00:17:38,759
is going to be the Cheech and Chong

544
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,779
animation and 20 years time people are

545
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:42,000
going to be talking about this this is

546
00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:43,558
this is what this is May I absolutely

547
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,119
love it I love it they made the stuff

548
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:46,980
that you've got going on it's great to

549
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:48,599
see in here and as I said if the

550
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,400
Cannabis view can help in any way shape

551
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:52,139
or form promote or get the name out with

552
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,000

553
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,259
there to deal with you I appreciate that

554
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,339

555
00:17:55,259 --> 00:17:58,019
a few months because I'm hoping to do

556
00:17:56,339 --> 00:17:59,220
like kind of like a podcast tour and

557
00:17:58,019 --> 00:18:01,079

558

561

562
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:10,079
gonna have to say goodbye we'll

563
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,700

564
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:13,798
weeks or a month or so when you're

565
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,179
