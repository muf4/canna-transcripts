1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,359
that ireland is going to be one of the

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:04,560
countries that delivers one of these

3
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:05,839
global brands

4
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:07,918
and i'd like to maybe in this little

5
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,839
segment convince you as to why

6
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:11,919
ireland is going to be the european hub

7
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:14,399
for global cannabis companies

8
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:16,160
um i'm sure you'd agree that a lot of

9
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,519
the investment opportunities and the m

10
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,439
a's that are happening some of the

11
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:21,039
london stock exchange stuff is exciting

12
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,399
industry so

13
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,439
i think a lot of the north american

14
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:25,598
companies are definitely going to

15
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,839
position themselves for a european entry

16
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,240
at some stage would you agree

17
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:30,960
absolutely you know i have a a special

18
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,199
place in my

19
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,480
heart for ireland um i i was born in

20
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,000
india when i was eight

21
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:37,519
i actually moved to ireland my parents

22
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,280
are doctors and they they worked there

23
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,120
and i lived there for six years

24
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,719
uh and and you know i was educated

25
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:43,439
partly in ireland and then came to the

26
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,640
us

27
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:48,640
um and i can say you know given where um

28
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,640
ireland has positioned itself the only

29
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,079
uh english-speaking member right now

30
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,878
of the eu uh being known for its tax

31
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,799
benefits to

32
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:58,079
large corporations that have already

33
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:00,558
from other industries

34
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,198
utilize it as such it's a natural

35
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,079
natural

36
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:04,798
landing pad for the larger companies for

37
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:07,760
innovation

38
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,840
around this area for brand creation for

39
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,520
uh interaction with uh

40
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,159
between the us and eu um so i'm very

41
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:15,679
excited

42
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,280
you know i plan on making a business

43
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,920
trip out there and

44
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,599
really getting a detailed sense of of

45
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,280
what the opportunities are

46
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:24,719
but i think you've already got a brand

47
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,239
in that space ireland already has a

48
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:27,840
brand in that space and so it's all

49
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:30,158
about how do you convert that

50
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,280
and how do you convince the regulators

51
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,280
to open up

52
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,519
more business around the cannabis space

53
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,960
and that by the way is just a snowball

54
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,039
effect happening right now

55
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:40,078
if you look at the us and and you have

56
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,079
any kind of doubt

57
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:44,319
about legalization in the u.s just think

58
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:46,078
of the fact that canada and mexico

59
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:47,839
are going to be legal federally and the

60
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:48,398
us is going to be sitting there missing

61
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,359
out on

62
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:54,000
tax revenue dollars in post covid

63
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:55,680
everybody wants to address deficits and

64
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,599
any kind of new source of revenue

65
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,439
generation is golden

66
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:00,959
so i i always you know people in the

67
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:01,438
industry complain that we get taxed too

68
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:02,879
much

69
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:04,158
i think it's a beautiful thing to get

70
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:05,359
taxed too much right now because

71
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,600
eventually

72
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,360
the as a lobbying continues as we go

73
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:10,799
towards legalization and beyond

74
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,120
everybody's then going to start looking

75
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,599
at tax efficiency and ireland's going to

76
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,400
be

77
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:17,759
very much at the nexus of that yeah i

78
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,800
couldn't agree with you more i think

79
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:20,719
there's going to be a lot of the

80
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,439
services will be based in ireland a lot

81
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:24,878
of the

82
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:26,000
kind of b2b business operations will be

83
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,759
based in ireland

84
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,759
granted there might be genetics in north

85
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:31,359
america but i still think it'll make

86
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:33,199
sense over time to have

87
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,720
greenhouses set up in ireland extraction

88
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:36,878
facilities set up in ireland

89
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:39,120
logistic companies that open ireland so

90
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:41,598
i think it's exciting future ahead for

91
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,519
ireland and north america and europe in

92
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:44,878
the next five to ten years and

93
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,239
hopefully we get to chat about this

94
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,799
again in the next few months and we've

95
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,800
got things to progress about

96
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,560
absolutely i hope your regulators in

97
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,040
ireland are watching and they make a

98
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,120
move

99
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,639
in the right direction and uh you know
