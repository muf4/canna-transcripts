cannabinoid research and development

11
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:29,639
company Tetra biopharma how are you

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,859
keeping today Steve good yourself are

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,179
you fantastic mate thank you very much

14
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:34,859
for taking your time to do this I know

15
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:36,780
you're a very busy man so hopefully we

16
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:38,399
can bestow some knowledge onto the the

17
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,960
audience in this episode can you maybe

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,299
give everybody a quick overview of how

19
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,359
you ended up at biopharma

20
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:48,238
yeah well I my third carrier I spent it

21
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:50,878
in the Pharma industry I mean going from

22
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:54,419
Adventist to sharing sharing the Merc

23
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:58,259
divisor Pfizer to Bosh elf I mean I

24
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:00,899
always been a Pharma boy and in 2018 I

25
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:03,179
mean there was a Structure well I mean I

26
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:06,960
was a hand raiser because

27
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:10,019
a big Pharma was injecting a lot of

28
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:12,419
constraint following sucks uh sagas

29
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:16,379
Urban Oxley so I've decided to move into

30
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:18,540
Biotech Industry and for me Tetra was

31
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:21,780
extremely appealing in a sense that we

32
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:25,140
were looking into RX segment

33
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:28,140
um I really believe uh that I can I can

34
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:31,739
emulate the receptor are definitely a

35
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:35,879
diff a very nice therapeutic Target and

36
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:38,339
CB1 CB2 needs to be explored and we know

37
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:41,239
the active right so so it's well

38
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,859
characterized and we know that it works

39
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:45,539
uh we simply need to develop

40
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:48,659
evidence-based medicine

41
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:51,020
uh by evidence being medicine I mean

42
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:55,140
efficacy and Pain Management

43
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:58,319
uh efficacy in other segments than being

44
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:01,140
an antimatter like dronadinol that's it

45
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:03,599
okay very interesting so the first topic

46
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,340
I want to jump on to is carabinoid-based

47
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,379
drug Discovery and development now I

48
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,659
know Tetra our Global leader in this

49
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:11,659
area can you maybe give everybody a

50
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:14,759
quick little overview of what is a

51
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:17,699
cannabinoid-based drug and how long does

52
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:21,239
a discovery and development process take

53
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:23,818
well okay a full DDP drug development

54
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:25,920
plan may take five to six to seven years

55
00:02:23,818 --> 00:02:28,679
and and that's a problem with our

56
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:31,079
investors base I mean when they joined I

57
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,959
mean they felt that we're in LP but

58
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,360
we're nowhere a licensed producer so

59
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:37,759
this takes time because you need to file

60
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,099
develop your

61
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:43,919
non-clinical information then you move

62
00:02:41,098 --> 00:02:47,280
into those ranging then you go into

63
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:50,399
phase one on LT volunteers whether it's

64
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,680
toxic or not you do those ranging and

65
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,719
then you start demonstrating your

66
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,719
efficacy and we're up to phase two right

67
00:02:54,719 --> 00:03:00,959
now the two study that we're running are

68
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:03,180
called reborn and plenitude reborn is

69
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,159
add to add comparison against

70
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:08,360
um

71
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:13,150
quick efficacy morphine things like

72
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:14,580
oxycodone or Hydromorphone or

73
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:18,840
[Music]

74
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:22,500
rapid extremely Rapids morphine sulfate

75
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,780
so so we don't want to displace them but

76
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,539
we want to be an add-on therapy by which

77
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,640
we will this will lead to an appealed

78
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:32,639
sparing effect because because you know

79
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:35,339
the crisis right now the opioid crisis

80
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:38,518
taking place in North America and I

81
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:42,000
think there's also uh consequences in

82
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:44,519
Europe so so we just want to be a player

83
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,340
amongst therapy so that doctor can

84
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:50,640
reduce their doses but it's it's a long

85
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,620
process it's it's five to six years and

86
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,719
by the time you file it may be an

87
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,658
additional year or two before you get

88
00:03:54,719 --> 00:04:00,799
approved we have planned for EMA we have

89
00:03:57,658 --> 00:04:03,298
planned for FDA of course and other

90
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,879
regulatory bodies in

91
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:07,620
okay very interesting can you explain to

92
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:10,679
everybody just a quick little question

93
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,840
what is a biopharmaceutical uh company

94
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,760
what's the difference between that and a

95
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,399
standard pharmaceutical company

96
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:19,798
well biotech of course we have no

97
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:25,198
appetite to run commercial operation

98
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:27,418
right so you develop your drug and once

99
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,699
you're ready you run BD activity

100
00:04:27,418 --> 00:04:32,039
Business Development and you sell the

101
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:34,860
asset to a big Pharma company in

102
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,639
exchange of qualities plus upfront

103
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,400
payment

104
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:40,680
which covers typically for the entire

105
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:43,379
cost of your trial right now I'll give

106
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:46,340
you an example on quick sleeve the asset

107
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:46,339
we're working on

108
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:52,859
well we're up to 60 million Investments

109
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:55,620
so far by the time we finish the

110
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:59,160
complete ddb sorry drug development plan

111
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:02,579
this will be an additional 20 million so

112
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:05,280
so it's not cheap uh but you're going to

113
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:07,859
attract interests from Big Pharma once

114
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:09,779
you complete efficacy trial and you

115
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,120
demonstrate the efficacy

116
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:14,579
so so and and this is what we're getting

117
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,160
right now in reborn we're getting

118
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:20,459
positive signal the code is not broken

119
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,860
yet but we're getting really signal that

120
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:24,239
this works we always knew it it's

121
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,840
working

122
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:32,160
but we need simply evidence right

123
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:34,258
okay so in terms of we've got a six to

124
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,180
eight year period you've got around a 70

125
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:37,800
80 million dollar investment that's

126
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,079
going to be required but at the end of

127
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,180
that phase somebody's developed a blend

128
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:43,918
and a formulation that can be turned

129
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,840
into a pharmaceutical product that could

130
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:48,779
be prescribed by a doctor that could be

131
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:51,299
sold on mass and by a company so this is

132
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:52,799
basically the if you know what you're

133
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,300
talking about in the industry the center

134
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,819
of the industry and the future of the

135
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,259
industry because uh I think the Holy

136
00:05:56,819 --> 00:06:00,418
Grail is going to have your own IP

137
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:02,699
products that are basically go after

138
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:06,659
cardiovascular disease neuropathic pain

139
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:08,879
chronic pain or post a cancer chemo it

140
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:11,280
seems to be the the center of the

141
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:13,079
industry um which will dominate a huge

142
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:15,299
chunk of the space over the next 10 to

143
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:17,879
20 years yeah yeah imagine yourself

144
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:21,418
predict yourself in the future I mean uh

145
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:23,939
take your asthma pump those are dry

146
00:06:21,418 --> 00:06:26,758
powder inhaler or meter dose inhaler

147
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:28,199
just like a ventolin or things like that

148
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:31,819
so but

149
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:36,978
give the label for pain So eventually

150
00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:40,199
once you don't achieve pain relief with

151
00:06:36,978 --> 00:06:42,418
coxib or with an NSAID then you move

152
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:45,780
into second layer of therapy which is

153
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:48,180
Lyrica Cymbalta and if it doesn't work

154
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:50,399
then you'll probably be considered the

155
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:53,280
third options on the top of these two

156
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:57,719
therapies to achieve pain relief so

157
00:06:53,279 --> 00:07:01,019
that's the uh but I mean by then we hope

158
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:04,800
that our Prospect which is called calms

159
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:07,379
synthetic dhccbd will go into a pump you

160
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,600
will inhale it and then you will treat

161
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:13,019
your pain basically whether it's cancer

162
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,720
pain or neuropathic pain the light a

163
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:17,758
nice Dimension by you you're right

164
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,520
likely that our chances are better into

165
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,840
neuropathic pain than in any type of

166
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:23,939
pain yeah

167
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:26,579
okay very interesting and the difference

168
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:29,098
between biosynthesizing the chosen

169
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:31,258
molecule and just synthesizing The

170
00:07:29,098 --> 00:07:33,120
Chosen molecule is there much of a

171
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:35,220
difference in the end result and product

172
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,079
or is there a more scalable option

173
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,759
between

174
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:42,418
synthetic is much more conducive for

175
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:44,699
Pharma so so I mean the idea here is

176
00:07:42,418 --> 00:07:47,399
that you go to your typical Pharmacy you

177
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:49,919
go pick up your prescriptions uh being

178
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:52,379
prescribed by your doc and then you

179
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:54,859
recoup your prescription and your

180
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:58,800
pharmacare plan will cover it

181
00:07:54,860 --> 00:08:01,979
uh that's the idea so it's similar

182
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,720
almost to Medicinal cannabis but there

183
00:08:01,978 --> 00:08:06,360
are Noah pocket costs for the patient

184
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,340
this will be supported and reimbursed by

185
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:11,460
the government that's the vision

186
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:14,399
right now the issue with LG is that

187
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:16,680
there's too much offer to start with and

188
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:19,918
only that they cannot stabilize their

189
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:23,400
gross margin because uh the price per

190
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:25,198
gram keep going down when I started the

191
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:28,978
business it was eight dollar a gram now

192
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:33,200
it's down to two dollars if not 1.5 Euro

193
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:36,418
a gram us we stabilize the gross margin

194
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,879
by having proper IP like you mentioned

195
00:08:36,418 --> 00:08:41,718
we have IP on quick sleeve we've been

196
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:45,659
able to um

197
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:48,778
document the arrow assault so basically

198
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:52,199
you'll have if you wanted to copy me or

199
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:55,620
to generalize my compound you need to

200
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:58,080
exactly replicate the same aerosol which

201
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,639
is unlikely to happen in a half 20 years

202
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,639
protection

203
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:04,439
okay incredible so in terms of that

204
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:07,080
industry do you think it's only

205
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,240
initially now at the start where the

206
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,700
rates for IEP and the race for the end

207
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:15,060
product the consumer will use in 10 to

208
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:17,640
15 years has only just begun or is this

209
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:20,759
a case that North American companies are

210
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:23,278
five years ten years already into this

211
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:25,980
oh y'all knows we've been studying this

212
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:28,080
for quite a while we Acquired panag and

213
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:31,560
there's something like two decades of of

214
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:34,080
studying the molecule basically on any

215
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:39,000
sorts of CBD receptor whether it's CB1

216
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:43,019
or CB2 so our CSO Melanie Kelly is quite

217
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:46,799
uh she is quite advanced in studying CB1

218
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:50,360
and CB2 receptor however there's very

219
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:54,179
few company GW was so the Jazz Pharma

220
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:58,019
zainerba and mad those are the the the

221
00:09:54,179 --> 00:10:01,620
company we're not LP those are company

222
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:05,820
studying CB1 CB2 receptor religiously

223
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:08,940
and making sure that we will produce a

224
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:10,860
good drug asset or drug candidate that

225
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:13,019
will yield a lot of benefits I mean pain

226
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:15,919
management we're talking about sorry

227
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:18,299
sorry about this

228
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:21,240
we're talking about

229
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:24,599
uh three to four billion dollars says

230
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:27,539
Global sales potential if not more

231
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,180
okay so it's not it's not small business

232
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:31,860
right yeah yeah well that's it if you

233
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:33,719
look at even a reserve surgeon decides

234
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,940
that a chronic pain market around the

235
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,740
world and the neuropathic pain that uh

236
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:40,019
those companies that can develop that

237
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:42,299
end product get it protected have an

238
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:44,100
exit strategy into the arms of one of

239
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:45,659
the already established uh

240
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,639
pharmaceutical companies to just either

241
00:10:45,659 --> 00:10:50,219
replace the current offering they have

242
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:52,379
for their patients or uh take it off the

243
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:54,959
market it seems like a very exciting

244
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:57,179
space can you tell me the next one lyric

245
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:59,939
as an example and Erica is selling for

246
00:10:57,179 --> 00:11:02,278
uh four billion dollar U.S sales of uh

247
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:05,060
per year basically not only a global

248
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:07,980
phase yeah Pfizer is selling uh

249
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:11,458
4 billion last time I checked was four

250
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:14,159
billion dollars says uh for for Lyrica

251
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:17,159
and Lyrica got generous size lately so

252
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:20,338
so now they're no longer cashing in on

253
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:22,799
on Lyrica as much as they used to be

254
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:25,680
okay very interesting last topic Before

255
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:27,838
I Let You Go was clinical trials is

256
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:29,278
there a specific term length for a

257
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,899
clinical trial so let's say you've got

258
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:33,059
your molecules you developed your end

259
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:34,740
product you now want to be able to bring

260
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:36,778
it to Market I know you guys are just

261
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,060
working not as a company but clinical

262
00:11:36,778 --> 00:11:40,679
trials how long do they take and what's

263
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:41,899
the kind of rough process for a company

264
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:45,000
like yourself

265
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:46,559
well it depends which label you're

266
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,860
looking for which indication you're

267
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:51,899
looking for right uh it will be longer

268
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:54,600
like in the case of pain management the

269
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:57,240
follow-up May last a two or three years

270
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,399
why because to demonstrate your point

271
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,740
you need a large sample we're talking

272
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:05,759
about maybe three to five thousand

273
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:08,579
patients so any big painter's pain is a

274
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:12,360
high prevalence so high prevalence mean

275
00:12:08,578 --> 00:12:15,719
large sample if it be rare disease like

276
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:19,320
I don't know like our friends at GW did

277
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:22,320
the driver and got stats I mean it's

278
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:24,778
it's a subset element of epilepsy it's

279
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,519
extremely tiny it's small they

280
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:28,200
demonstrate their efficacy in driving

281
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:31,139
and lost that

282
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:34,320
but this is a rare disease this is the

283
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:37,919
prevalence is extremely low then to

284
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,200
produce say a conclusive clinical trial

285
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:42,659
in that segment you don't need a large

286
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:46,320
sample I don't recall exactly how large

287
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:48,319
was the sample for GW but for us in pain

288
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,740
management

289
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,740
it's quite large

290
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:59,039
is longer so you you got to select your

291
00:12:56,458 --> 00:13:01,500
indication in order to determine the

292
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:04,319
time but a good follow-up would be two

293
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,519
to three years yeah and who chooses the

294
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,139
patience is it something that you

295
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,360
specifically choose is there companies

296
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:11,399
that you can go to that can provide the

297
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:15,360
patients or where does the actual uh

298
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:17,839
trial pool come from good question you

299
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:21,778
need to establish your eligibility

300
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:23,880
criteria in our case like I mentioned to

301
00:13:21,778 --> 00:13:27,120
you we do we don't want that this place

302
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:30,360
morphine sulfate or opioid we just want

303
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:34,019
to be an add-on on the top of standard

304
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:36,600
standard care basically so you and our

305
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:39,480
patients who are already on numerous

306
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:43,920
drug and then on the top of that you

307
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:46,079
will hand quick sleep or comps okay so

308
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:49,259
like sauce which are dinner shall we

309
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:52,259
call it in simple terms

310
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:54,059
uh okay well right now we're looking to

311
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:55,620
break through pain we're looking into

312
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:58,679
cancer pain

313
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:01,740
so if if you're effective and cancer

314
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:03,899
pain likely that doctor will prescribe

315
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,759
it in any type of pain

316
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:08,458
okay very important but now you're

317
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:11,278
getting into a Zone where doctor will

318
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:13,979
prescribe it off label they're not

319
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:17,159
supposed to we will not promote it

320
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:21,120
enough label situation however once you

321
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:24,179
establish your drug and cancer pain good

322
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:27,179
for you because likely that doctor will

323
00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:29,719
expand their usage in other pain

324
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:32,219
management indication

325
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,620
very interesting last thing before I go

326
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:39,120
do you think the Blends and formulations

327
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:41,039
of specific products has got a a lot of

328
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,899
room still before people come up with

329
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:44,519
the exact formulas that are going to

330
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:46,919
work in various different disciplines or

331
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:50,278
is it pretty much going to be as you

332
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:52,799
said just a layer on top of current uh

333
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:54,539
medical medicines that you're given by

334
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:55,859
your doctor is there somebody basically

335
00:14:54,539 --> 00:14:57,659
going to come up with a blend of

336
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,820
terpenes blend of cannabinoids B

337
00:14:57,659 --> 00:15:01,559
vitamins all together they've done their

338
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,180
r d in over a couple of years they've

339
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:05,518
perfected this one little tablet that

340
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:09,120
does X

341
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:12,240
well it's way more difficult to displace

342
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:15,959
standard care than uh playing the game

343
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:18,360
of add-on so add-on you limit your risk

344
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:21,958
basically in injecting money like that

345
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:25,560
so eventually guidelines may lead doctor

346
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:28,379
to prefer uh can I be new in derive

347
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:31,138
medicine above a period at this point

348
00:15:28,379 --> 00:15:34,799
will be as effective as so what do you

349
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:38,220
do you select your evil and of course

350
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:42,299
the the likelihood that developing an

351
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:44,940
addiction under a POS is quite high with

352
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:47,879
very dark consequences aside from

353
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:51,540
addiction I mean there's an escalation

354
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:53,399
by which you may land on on errands or I

355
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:56,939
mean things like that so you don't want

356
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:59,100
to go there so doctor and then the

357
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:01,620
doctor will regroup develop clinical

358
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:04,259
guidelines and they'll call a shot they

359
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:07,220
say these therapy are as effective as

360
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:10,860
accordingly they'll be the second line

361
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:13,980
and we'll pay for second line so if you

362
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:17,579
fail on NSAID or coxib

363
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:19,860
you may well deserve receiving a

364
00:16:17,578 --> 00:16:22,078
prescription or can Amino with derived

365
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:24,419
medicine which would be could sleep but

366
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:26,638
then you will need clinical experience

367
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:28,740
with the agent in order to displace

368
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,019
opioid

369
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:35,220
so so this is policy really this is

370
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:38,159
policy change uh it requires solid

371
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:40,560
evidence in order to displace the second

372
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:42,659
line let's say or the third line

373
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:44,698
very interesting it's definitely a

374
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:46,519
sector of the industry to keep your eye

375
00:16:44,698 --> 00:16:48,778
on and I very much looking forward to

376
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:50,220

377
00:16:48,778 --> 00:16:52,078
