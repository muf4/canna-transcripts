can you maybe give everybody just a

33
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,320
quick little overview of how you ended

34
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:10,399
up over in the cannabis industry in

35
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:11,438
california going from music into that

36
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,960
scene

37
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:16,798
yeah um basically um

38
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:19,599
around 95

39
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,520
sometime around then 90 well actually

40
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:23,359
they say in 94.

41
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:26,079
we had started a clothing company it was

42
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:28,239
called uh communion it was the first

43
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:29,280
ever clothing company on the internet

44
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:31,359
um

45
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,799
it was organic hemp

46
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:34,799
back when you couldn't even wear a full

47
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,960
hemp t-shirt you know had to be a mix of

48
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,118
cotton

49
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:40,798
and then we started

50
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:42,000
we we met this group called the cannabis

51
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,640
action network

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,959
in in berkeley they were doing a uh they

53
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,439
had a booth on the street every every

54
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:51,839
weekend and my partner at the time mike

55
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:54,719
mattel he met him and mike's an artist

56
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,880
and he ended up doing some art for them

57
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,560
um for and then we ended up helping with

58
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:59,519
a concert that they did in golden gate

59
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,040
fields

60
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,798
uh um

61
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,280
ended up helping him with the cannabis

62
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,560
cup over in amsterdam for five or six

63
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,919
years from like 95 to 2000

64
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,439
um

65
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,598
did a lot of activist work for them

66
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,439
basically for the further for the group

67
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:17,519
and then

68
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:20,159
and and started doing because we was a

69
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,680
rape promoter we had a lot of experience

70
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:24,079
in putting on events and dealing with

71
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,319
cops and that kind of thing you know and

72
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,640
uh

73
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:30,000
and um

74
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:31,919
so that kind of leads me on the first

75
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,919
topic i kind of wanted to jump into it

76
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:36,238
like you've got such a long story that

77
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:38,000
because probably 15 minutes i'm going to

78
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,680
try and rush different things along at

79
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,159
certain times because i think we can

80
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,400
give you three or four episodes

81
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:46,318
yeah we cover so many things over a new

82
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,200
episode let me just jump straight on to

83
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:50,560
the pcc the success and the longevity of

84
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:52,719
the pcc

85
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,199
why did you start it what's the key to

86
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:57,199
the longevity of success with the pcc

87
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,039
and how can people in europe and ireland

88
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:01,199
learn from the successful things that

89
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:03,199
you've implemented over there

90
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:05,439
great questions

91
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:08,399
we started pcc because

92
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:10,959
we were empowered by cannabis and that

93
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,719
it's the government's lying to you about

94
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:17,039
it not having any medical use um and so

95
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:22,400
we decided we would go for it we opened

96
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:23,519
it up um i was in uh april the 4th 2001.

97
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,959
um

98
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,360
we were i think some of the stuff that

99
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,158
kept us open is that we were political

100
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,319
we

101
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:31,840
we always had some kind of like flyer to

102
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:34,238
give out to people that they could call

103
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,319
their representative or something we

104
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,519
always took care of patients like really

105
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:40,158
took care of them you know we weren't

106
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,480
just in it for money um and one of the

107
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:44,639
big things was that we we didn't grow

108
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:46,798
proposition 215 which is what a lot of

109
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:50,158
dispensaries were based on before the

110
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,680
last change in 2018 pop system 215 was

111
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:52,560
1996.

112
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,760
it was

113
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,719
very gray

114
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:58,560
area type thing in regards to what you

115
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:00,479
could do but it was pretty clear on a

116
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,039
couple of things like you can't have

117
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:06,719
retail and have dispensary car you can't

118
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:08,158
have a dispensary and cultivate so we

119
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,959
didn't cultivate

120
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:13,438
ever and anyone that did cultivate and

121
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,120
had a dispensary pretty soon the dea

122
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:17,199
would come along and [ __ ] lap your

123
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,280
head off no problem

124
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,519
um so i think there were some of the

125
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:23,119
reasons why like patient-centered

126
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,040
political

127
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,439
and and being aware of the environment

128
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,840
and the climate and so what can people

129
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:31,519
in ireland learn uh they're not going to

130
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:33,119
do it the politicians are not going to

131
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:35,680
do it it's as simple as that they're

132
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,040
self-serving the vast majority of them

133
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,600
not unless the people of ireland

134
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,360
actually want it and actually forced

135
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,680
force the issue

136
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,160
writing to your td your senator coming

137
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,199
to one of the pfsa protests

138
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,120
sending an email joining pfsa

139
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,280
keeping an eye on the european news it's

140
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,240
like do you want your mother to have

141
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:58,319
access to medicine when she gets older

142
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,800
and she needs it or your father or

143
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:03,439
someone who gets cancer i mean it's it's

144
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,439
pretty real

145
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:07,680
okay very interesting and i'll move on

146
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:10,560
to

147
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,400
the farms what was the uh the objective

148
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,759
with theirs basically the laws allowed

149
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:15,120
you to change that you could have a

150
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,520
separate entity that would allow

151
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,879
cultivation and you want to basically

152
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:22,879
ensure that the patients had organic and

153
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:25,360
a very high quality product is that

154
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:27,279
right and sends it's very well said yeah

155
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,960
you'd have to add energy to it you know

156
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:30,638
it's like the positivity and the energy

157
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,159
the plant is like whatever you give to

158
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,319
the plant plants going to give back to

159
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,320
you

160
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:39,918
so we wanted to make sure that it's not

161
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:42,159
only grown correctly but curing which is

162
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:44,399
cure growing is about half the battle

163
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,840
curing getting all the gases out and

164
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:47,839
getting into the state where it's like

165
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:50,399
stable and it's the best medicine you

166
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:52,719
can get is a a lot of a lot of people

167
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:55,198
still to this day even more now these

168
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,880
days skip that step it doesn't burn good

169
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,280
it's not good for the patient you know

170
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,680
so we wanted to be able to control that

171
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:02,879
to a certain extent now it's not as if

172
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,680
pcc

173
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:07,279
it just carries foxworthy it's got

174
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,000
hundreds of products you know what i

175
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:12,719
mean but for a certain amount of that so

176
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,240
that that was for pcc but also there's a

177
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,280
lot of dispensaries around so then we we

178
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,199
started

179
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:21,679
our own distribution company called

180
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,280
california cannabis distribution company

181
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,120
maybe i'm jumping head there far i'm

182
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:27,439
sorry

183
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,918
and the reason we started that was so we

184
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:32,839
could distribute our own flower when

185
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:34,719
cannabis flow when the law has changed

186
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:36,399
you

187
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,199
you can't be a farmer and then sell

188
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:43,519
directly to a retailer anymore that's

189
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:45,680
when but to the first of january 2018 um

190
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:48,560
you had to that's you have to as a

191
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:52,240
farmer sell to a distributor so then so

192
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:54,478
we had to retail we had farm then we

193
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,240
started the distribution company so

194
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:59,038
we're vertically integrated and we don't

195
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,360
really need like anyone in in in that

196
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:03,279
regard to get ourselves to a certain

197
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,120
level

198
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:07,679
okay incredible one of them i'm very

199
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,759
curious about is when it comes to the

200
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,160
logistics and the shipping of the

201
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,800
product from from point a to point b is

202
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,199
there a specific license that the drive

203
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,079
is required to have there is there

204
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,560
specific insurance that goes with the

205
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:24,639
trucks or is it basically just

206
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,319
if nobody asks nobody says

207
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,400
no no no i've been shipping wheat and

208
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,800
moving wheat around california for for a

209
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,079
long time before it was legal and like

210
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,079
one of my favorite things about

211
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:35,199
legalization is that you have a shipping

212
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,519
manifest

213
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,520
an fn shipping manifest do you mean what

214
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:41,198
i mean it's like a cop can pull you over

215
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,879
and you're like here you go i'm going

216
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,120
from point a to point b

217
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,879
you know that's a beautiful thing about

218
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,079
it and you have to have

219
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,839
uh it's also on a thing called metric

220
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:54,560
m-e-t-r-c it's an acronym but a state

221
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:56,399
it's a tracking program basically every

222
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,720
gram is tracked everywhere it goes

223
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:01,038
whether it's from the farmer

224
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,039
to the distributor our distributor can

225
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:05,439
sell to a distributor and then what's

226
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:08,318
called the final mile the final mile is

227
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:10,719
like from the distributor to the retail

228
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,240
and then all of that's insured you can

229
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,319
ensure your product these days even

230
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,160
though it's expensive your your vehicle

231
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,720
is in short again it's more everything

232
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,560
is more expensive for your own cannabis

233
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,080
it's a simple that the way it is these

234
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,079
days anyway you know because it's

235
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:25,758
federally illegal so it might be legal

236
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:27,680
at a state level but it's still

237
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,680
federally illegal so insurance and all

238
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,280
of those type of things that this thing

239
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,120
is pretty hard

240
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:35,519
yeah it's a highly valued commodity as

241
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,519
well i'm sure there's a number untoward

242
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,240
characters who have their eye on that as

243
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,560
well so yeah i can imagine so security

244
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,399
detail in licensing and insurance are

245
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,559
all required to be able to ship from

246
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,839
point a to point d including the final

247
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:51,359
mile is that correct that's correct

248
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,880
brilliant right well now i want to jump

249
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,399
onto the main topic that i wanted to

250
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:56,799
bring on this and it's basically

251
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,039
patience for safe access in ireland so

252
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:01,759

253
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:04,159
and the the energy behind this

254
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:06,559
organization the non-pro not-for-profit

255
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:08,559
organization in ireland can you tell me

256
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:11,039

257
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:13,599
up and what the what's the pr primary

258
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:15,039
objective within the next 18 months for

259
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,399
phsa

260
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:21,439
great question uh myself kenny tynan

261
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,440
alicia meyer and martin condon started

262
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,920
patients for safe access a couple of

263
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,160
years ago we we met on zoom for a long

264
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:30,240
time through corvid started the

265
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:32,958
organization like filed for the

266
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,360
non-profit got the bank account and so

267
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:37,518
on and so forth we're planning an online

268
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,680
conference for a while but then like

269
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,679
covert opened up so we ended up aiming

270
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:43,599
to do our first conference there and

271
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:45,439
that was in june the goal of the first

272
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,080
conference was to unite

273
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,839
the disparate groups cannabis activist

274
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,759
groups around the country that was one

275
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,160
of the main goals to get all of these

276
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:57,519
people into the same same

277
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:57,519
chickens outside rooster

278
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,480
my goal the goal was to get all these

279
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:05,278
people into one room so we could all see

280
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,680
we're on the same page and uh

281
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:11,679
unified basically and then and they used

282
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:15,439
to notice uh crown

283
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:17,919
major group for farm tom carl amy brown

284
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,000
uh peter reynolds all these people know

285
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:22,159
are a larger part of patients for safe

286
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,759
access like we have a weekly meeting

287
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:25,360
every week like and

288
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:27,519
it's a larger group

289
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,399
we're taking on larger things you know

290
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,240
um

291
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,839
so that's that's how we started boy was

292
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,839
it started um

293
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:38,799
i've seen cannabis help

294
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,720
a lot of people on the way out it's not

295
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:42,078
you know there's no cure for stage four

296
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,079
cancer let's be real you know what i

297
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:46,239
mean but like it can give a person a lot

298
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:48,799
of dignity on the way out that's a key

299
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,600
thing that it does if it used properly

300
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:53,359
it can help to save and stave off cancer

301
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,000
and be health

302
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,759
efficient in that way uh i've seen it

303
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,600
cure cancer time and time again

304
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:01,039
obviously not stage four

305
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,200

get access to cannabis that's draconian

334
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,320
like the doctor's number one like rule

335
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
is do not ham

336
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,079
where's stephen donnelly in all of this

337
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,679
except for denying it it is an old

338
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:16,239
ireland and there's a new ireland you

339
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:18,559
know we're trying to appeal to both

340
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,480
ireland's because the new ireland wanted

341
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,239
is a lot of people use it and you all

342
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,839
ireland don't want it they're afraid of

343
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,079
priests they're afraid of their doctors

344
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:28,079
let's be real about it you know those

345
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:29,838
days are gone

346
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:31,679
those days are gone

347
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,279
you know so what's our timeline in the

348
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:36,559
next 18 months

349
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:38,399
legalize medical cannabis in ireland

350
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:39,958
add more conditions

351
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,679
chronic pain

352
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:44,479
endometriosis

353
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:45,278
like psychological things

354
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,519
just

355
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:50,078
there's a lot there's a lot it can do

356
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,240
and bring in industry in ireland i have

357
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:54,479
a challenge that you look at my fridge

358
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,519
now right there's barry's tea in my

359
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,680
cupboard

360
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,679
there's kerrygold in my fridge and

361
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:02,479
there's a bottle of tealing and streams

362
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:04,719
in in irish stuff that irish people and

363
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,039
other people buy around around the world

364
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,720
there's way more kerrygolds sold around

365
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:10,958
the world than there is in ireland why

366
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,320
can't irish people have the right to

367
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:15,119
grow cannabis

368
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,839
to have an industry to be a distributor

369
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:21,039
to be a retailer to be a manufacturer to

370
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:24,399
be a cultivator and not just provide for

371
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:26,000
the general public in ireland but also

372
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,759
like germany's got a problem right now

373
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,639
they don't have enough access to

374
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:33,600
cannabis to medical cannabis so that's

375
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,519
where we're coming from

376
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,680
well it's dead matter couldn't uh yeah

377
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,120
it's very empowering i have to admit so

378
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:40,799
basically getting chronic pain

379
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,639
neuropathic pain number of conditions

380
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:45,679
added to the end cap and bolstering and

381
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,839
allowed a much deeper wall of patients

382
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:50,399
to be able to access these medicines and

383
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,079
much be a wider range of pharmacies and

384
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,399
doctors prescribing them and selling

385
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:56,638
them i think is we're all on the same

386
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,559
ball regardless of what company you're

387
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,159
in or what territory in ireland i think

388
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:02,399
that's the objective for us all now to

389
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:04,078
get done over the next 12 months it's

390
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,440
been absolutely amazing talking mate i

391
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:08,000
think we'll have to deal with part two

392
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,760
and a part three would you where we can

393
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,399
i would need to say one more thing if i

394
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:15,039
could sir yeah of course because the

395
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,720
doctors that's the blockage right so

396
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:19,599
it's like write to your td you're

397
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,800
listening to me write to your td

398
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,800
call your td visit your td

399
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:27,039
tell them you want the mtap program

400
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:29,039
that's under review minister donnelly

401
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:31,198
was brought up by two politicians a

402
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:32,958
couple of days ago on the dial

403
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:35,519
and he answered that there it's under

404
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:38,399
review put pressure on your government

405
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:41,759
to change the mcat program to allow

406
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:43,919
cannabis to access for chronic pain and

407
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:46,159
for endometriosis and other and other

408
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:47,679
issues that's they're the first steps

409
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:50,399
and it shouldn't it's just it's it's

410
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:52,879
tied in on a consultant like for example

411
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,078
if you're a

412
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:55,759
person that wants to change your

413
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:59,120
sexuality in ireland

414
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:00,958
there's a 10-year waiting list 10 years

415
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,159
ireland's health system is draconian

416
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:05,039
it's not like it's supposed to be a

417
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:06,719
third world country it's not you know

418
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:08,559
things need to change in that regard it

419
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,278
can't be just consultants but you wait

420
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:13,119
years and years and years to see

421
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:16,000
doctors have got to be able to general

422
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,759
gps like in denmark and in america have

423
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,919
got to be able to have the right to

424
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,360
prescribe that if you see your doctor

425
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,439
talk to your doctor tell them what you

426
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,360
believe we got to empower take our

427
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,440
empowerment and spread our empowerment

428
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,120
to our politicians and our doctors and

429
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,199
