europe and talking to a lot of the

leaders and trying to piece together the

12

entire industry so germany seems to be

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,079
europe and set the kind of blueprint i

cannabis industry and then we'll kick

24
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,719

27
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:03,599
countryside

28
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:04,719
and then germany decided to legalize

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,040
medical cannabis in

30
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:12,640

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,879
developments on medical cannabis and cbd

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,720
came up

34
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:22,239
at the end of the 17th the beginning of

35
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:24,560
18 nobody knew in germany what cbd was

36
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:25,280
and nobody know how to deal with it

37
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,118
legally

38
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,200
what's the legal framework for cbd

39
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:31,359
products and then

40
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,640

national international came to me and

51
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,560
sought advice for the german market how

52
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,240
to enter the german market what's the

53
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,640
legal framework here

54
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:59,920
and since one and a half two years i'm

55
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,200
only doing cannabis

56
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,920
clients cannabis related mandates and

57
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,960
yeah and happy to see what's what's

58
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,920
coming

59
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,959
along this year as well because we'll be

60
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,000
looking for a

61
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:16,239
fundamental reform and or

62
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,878
fundamental change in cannabis policies

63
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,640
but we will come to that later

64
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:22,159
okay brilliant amazing salman with a

65
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:23,598
wealth of experience first type of

66
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:24,959
conversation i want to talk about is the

67
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:26,238
german hemp industry

68
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,840
i was reading up and i've done my

69
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,680
research 1982 to 1996 for some reason

70
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,920
the whole industry was banned

71
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,000
is there a reason behind that ban and

72
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:37,679
what was the reason it got reinstated is

73
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,680
there something people can learn from

74
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,519
that reinstation

75
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,519
from today's legalization

76
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:50,239
yeah so due to the single convention

77
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,519
which was agreed on in 1961 and the

78
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,439
following

79
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:58,800
international agreements

80
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:02,318
from 97 1971

81
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:05,519
and germany had to comply and

82
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:08,399
install rules on cannabis and hemp

83
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,759
and by that time cannabis had a real bad

84
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,039
stigma

85
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:14,158
so they thought we can't even allow low

86
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:17,598
thc

87
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:19,439
cultivation on german soil because it's

88
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:22,719
too complicated the police can't

89
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:26,479
uh distinguish between high thc low thc

90
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:29,759
hemp and so they banned it completely

91
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:33,039
what they then saw was that amp

92
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:36,318
is an excellent and

93
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:39,919
a very versatile plant um

94
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:42,318
because you can make ropes textiles you

95
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:44,958
can make

96
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:46,079
for for for construction purposes you

97
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,680
can you can use

98
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:53,200
ham and that

99
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:56,959
that came back the the awareness of

100
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:59,359
hemp as a as a as a power plant

101
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,719
which you can use for for everything so

102
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,640
they decided in 1995 to

103
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:06,158
have a reform on the cannabis on the

104
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:09,518
hemp rules

105
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:12,158
and they wanted to explore the full

106
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,319
market potential of the hemp plant that

107
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:16,560
was the aim by that time

108
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:17,358
and then the cultivation was allowed

109
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,639
again

110
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:23,758
the strict rules though so

111
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:27,120
the bee farm something like the fda in

112
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,879
america they have to you have to notify

113
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,918
the bee farm that you start

114
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:35,199
growing that you that you seed the

115
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:38,399
the hemp seeds then they come

116
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,639
by and control that you really plant

117
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:41,599
the seeds of the hemp plant because you

118
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,680
get subsidies

119
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,600
from the european union and at the end

120
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,600
of the harvest period

121
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:53,280
you um have to test it and it has to be

122
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:56,960
from the european uh variety catalogue

123
00:04:53,279 --> 00:05:00,239
so it has to be a certified eu's variety

124
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:03,038
and it doesn't it can't exceed 0.2

125
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,519
thc at the moment of harvest 10 days

126
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:06,079
before

127
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:08,159
20 days before and 10 days after and the

128
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:11,758
rules are all laid down in european

129
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,000
um union directives how to test it

130
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,919
at what time and the b farm is coming

131
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,199
and checking if everything is fine and

132
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:20,319
if the

133
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:23,120
eu variety exceeds 0.2

134
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:24,399
two years in a row you can't exceed it

135
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,560
anymore

136
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:28,239
very very complicated and the biggest

137
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,199
problem for the hemp industry in germany

138
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,639
is

139
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,919
that you can't use really the upper part

140
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,240
because due to the novel food

141
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:38,560
regulations you can't

142
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,680
you can't really use the the flowers for

143
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,879
extraction

144
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:46,079
uh as the the extraction

145
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:49,120
or the extraction market for cbd oils

146
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,959
is not yet has not yet fully unlocked

147
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,680
its potential

148
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:54,399
as uh you can't sell so much stuff right

149
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,120
now because

150
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:58,638
the police rates are going after the cbd

151
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,800
shops and stuff like that

152
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,160
so that's a big problem in in comparison

153
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,160
to to canada

154
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:08,240
and the us and even china

155
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,280
that's the problem which all european

156
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,160
farmers and

157
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:13,038
german farmers have as well yeah i agree

158
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,960
i think what

159
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:16,478
you have happening is the law that got

160
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:18,399
passed by the european council that

161
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:19,918
doesn't seem to have been enacted across

162
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:22,079
a lot of the council states we have it

163
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:24,560
in ireland as well and in one side you

164
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:27,359
can understand the police have no idea

165
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,680
what a low thc content plan does look

166
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,479
like until it be lab tested so

167
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,079
it's kind of uh one of those myriad out

168
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:36,879
of uh

169
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:37,839
murky waters at the moment in terms of

170
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:40,639
the regulatory

171
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:42,478
framework in germany how hard is it to

172
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,879
get licensed i have in some other

173
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:48,240
reading i was doing there was 575

174
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:50,719
licensed temperature producers in 2019

175
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,598
do you think that's grown significantly

176
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,120
and if so

177
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:54,959
has it been through an ease of framework

178
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,439
or is it very difficult to apply for

179
00:06:54,959 --> 00:07:00,478
hemp license over in germany

180
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:03,680
for cultivation you mean yeah

181
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:05,038
you have to be a farmer and a full-time

182
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,720
farmer

183
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:08,240
and only farmers are allowed to grow

184
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,520
hemp on the soil and

185
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,400
only outdoor not indoor and it's even

186
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,959
questionable

187
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:16,079
if you can put a tent on the of the

188
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:17,918
plants

189
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:19,839
if you grow it out or so it has to be in

190
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:22,240
the soil and you have to be a farmer

191
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:24,399
uh but as a if you're a full-time farmer

192
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,038
you get the license that's no problem

193
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:27,839
but due to the fact that the the upper

194
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:30,719
plant

195
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:32,478
can't really be used at the moment we

196
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,080
have even the problem with hemp tea

197
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:36,800
empty leaves hemp leaf tea which was on

198
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:40,079
the shelves

199
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,759
for decades in the german retail and

200
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:43,839
law enforcement decided a couple of

201
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,560
weeks ago to go after the hemp leaf

202
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:47,679
traders

203
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:51,280
and shops you can't imagine

204
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,038
because the things are heating up in in

205
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:55,038
on the at the horizon of the federal

206
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:58,079
election because we will

207
00:07:55,038 --> 00:08:00,478
expect a change in cannabis policy so

208
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:01,199
the the old law enforcement the old war

209
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:04,800
on drugs

210
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:07,598
uh warriors uh uh are fighting the

211
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,478
last war so to say but if you can't even

212
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:10,800
use the leaves

213
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:12,079
from the from the hemp land which you

214
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,720
need for your for your margin

215
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:15,839
for your for your uh for your for your

216
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,520
costs

217
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:21,758
contribution that's pretty hard so

218
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:22,639
and for the rest of the plan for the

219
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,520
stem and

220
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,639
the the fibers you need a lot of

221
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:29,918
investments you need

222
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,918
expensive machines to really um

223
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:34,799
yeah to to get the best out of it and to

224
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:37,519
make the the best product

225
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,958
for for for every other purpose so it's

226
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,959
it's very tricky it's a very

227
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:43,038
complicated situation for for hem

228
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:45,518
calculation

229
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:46,720
right and tell me this i have something

230
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,519
i'm trying to figure out across all the

231
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,200
different states

232
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,399
as we know the different extraction

233
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,240
types for getting cbd oil are various

234
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,958
we've found out that across uk and

235
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,039
ireland that a cold-pressed isolate

236
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:00,479
is legal because it hasn't been proved

237
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,399
to be part of the novel food and et

238
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,560
cetera is that the same in germany

239
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:09,039
are you allowed to freely sell a sale at

240
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:10,879
cole's pressed iceland cbdo

241
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:12,240
we were always looking at the website of

242
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:17,278
the fsa

243
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,278
fsai from from ireland and they always

244
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,640
wrote it on their website the cold

245
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,320
pressed products are not novel food

246
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:26,480
for a couple of years if you look at

247
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,360
this webpage now

248
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,200
you can't find this sentence anymore but

249
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,680
i'm happy to hear that

250
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,320
the cold press products are still legal

251
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:37,120
in ireland

252
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,560
and not deemed as a noble food they are

253
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,440
not deemed as another food

254
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:43,119
in austria as well we know for sure but

255
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,440
we know one court decision

256
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,959
in germany from the administrative court

257
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,240
of schwerin

258
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:52,559
from may last year they said no

259
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,759
it hasn't been on the market uh before

260
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:58,719
1997 it's a novel football

261
00:09:55,759 --> 00:10:00,480
and we don't know if this case went to

262
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,079
the court of appeal

263
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,519
so it's not really clear if cold pressed

264
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:09,120
products

265
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,959
are not novel food and in my opinion

266
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,480
yes because it's not an extraction it's

267
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:14,239
not you it's not

268
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,680
in the in the novel food catalog they

269
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,159
are only extracts

270
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,159
mentioned

271
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:24,078
i'm pretty sure you you can find

272
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,958
evidence that uh cold pressed

273
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:29,759
ham juice has been consumed uh before

274
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:32,078
1997 to a significant degree

275
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,600
yeah like any any person when i have a

276
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:36,078
brain would realize to cold press

277
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,200
something doesn't take a huge technology

278
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:43,679
uh to be able to facilitate that action

279
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,680
the last thing i would like to do is a

280
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,839
dangerous

281
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,200
have been consumed for ages for for

282
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,320
decades

283
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,920
for centuries but no yeah well we had

284
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,640
professor o'neivy

285
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:58,319
from uh one of the famous universities

286
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,399
in the states on last week and he's a

287
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,120
professor in biology and molecular

288
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,039
science and

289
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,720
he was one of the founders of the cb1

290
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,679
and cb2 receptors

291
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,879
and basically annihilated any reasonable

292
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:10,639
person's argument

293
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:12,320
as to the non-existence of an

294
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:13,679
endocannabinoid system and the benefits

295
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,920
of cannabinoids

296
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:17,120
to this system so i think what's

297
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:18,479
happening is

298
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,159
the people who are passionate about

299
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,680
legalizing cannabis on the other side

300
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:23,120
there's people just as passionate about

301
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:24,639
keeping it illegal and i think that's

302
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,919
the war that's been fought in europe at

303
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:28,559
the moment

304
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:30,000
moving on to the last topic and again as

305
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:31,359
we were saying before we came on air i

306
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,200
think germany is going to be the model

307
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,240
for a lot of the european states

308
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,680
the way this structure is put into place

309
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,120
who are the top three companies in

310
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:44,000
germany do you think of at the moment

311
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,560
uh so difficult question because we have

312
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,240
uh

313
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:48,239
different tiers we have the medical

314
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,480
cannabis space

315
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,480
we have the hemp industry we have the

316
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,879
cbd industry

317
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,000
in the cbd industry you would definitely

318
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:59,919
have to mention

319
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,320
the sanity group with their brand ray

320
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:04,559
they had a couple of investment rounds

321
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,200
and they are very present in the german

322
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:08,399
market

323
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:11,360
with good with a lot of with a

324
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,919
wide variety of products when you look

325
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,399
at the

326
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:15,360
medical cannabis market you definitely

327
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,559
would have to mention

328
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:22,240
the three companies which acquired the

329
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:26,559
license for for domestic cultivation

330
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:29,519
which is aurova afria and the dimikan

331
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:30,958
and if you look at the the the hemp

332
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,240
sector

333
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:36,799
there are not really big players

334
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,759
but some very important companies like

335
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:43,679
hampro international from dusseldorf

336
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:46,879
which which this company is howling and

337
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:47,679
they do everything from cultivation to

338
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:50,320
extraction

339
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:50,879
