10
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:33,840
lawyer

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,859
um but uh you know thanks for reaching

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,420
out

13
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:38,039
um and you know we're linking up right

14
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,140
now because of this momentous thing that

15
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:42,299
you know kind of momentous potentially

16
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,039
temporarily momentous thing that

17
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:46,558
happened in the um in the New York

18
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:49,859
industry right now and so the very very

19
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:51,119
quick snapshot right is that new you

20
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:53,878
know New York legalized adult use

21
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:57,058
marijuana over two years ago okay and

22
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:58,619
then New York wanted to ramp up you know

23
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:00,780
and it decriminalized there's always a

24
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:03,238
gap between when there's no longer

25
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,519
criminal and when an actual adult use

26
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:08,158
Mark launches and the people that

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,460
benefit the most during that period are

28
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,618
unlicensed illicit operators and New

29
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:16,019
York is very similar to California and

30
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:18,659
what happened was that you know uh

31
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:21,859
estimates in New York City alone 1400

32
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:24,659
unlicensed doors popped open selling

33
00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:27,239
legitimate product from mature markets

34
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:29,040
like California where very difficult

35
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:30,599
frankly and the only people making money

36
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,180
to some extent are people selling stuff

37
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:35,459
out the back door high-end account for

38
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,900
products and I just heard uh from a

39
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:39,539
friend last night that some of these

40
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:43,380
stores are selling psilocybin chocolate

41
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:45,299
bars in child appealing packaging right

42
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:47,578
and so that's one big element that

43
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,860
happened in New York and then you know

44
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:52,798
in order to you know get sales started

45
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:55,078
soon and also to help you know uh

46
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,420
Upstate you know a lot of hemp Farmers

47
00:01:55,078 --> 00:01:59,879
there who've been hurt by the CBD Market

48
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,680
they created this you know conditional

49
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:04,140
you know there's all these conditional

50
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,299
programs that I've opened up to kind of

51
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,879
accelerate the process of starting sales

52
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:10,920
and so I kind of call them like the hemp

53
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,780
crossover licenses so there are

54
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:15,958
conditional cultivators

55
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:18,719
um and you know processors and they were

56
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:21,060
able to start making you know uh there

57
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,859
was a bill past afterwards creating

58
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,020
conditional processors and cultivators

59
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,239
you know just in time I think for you

60
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,520
know a planting season and so all of a

61
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:31,800
sudden there are what you know the seeds

62
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,780
are going in for ultimately will be you

63
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,239
know what were and you know was an

64
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,640
estimated 700 million dollar Harvest

65
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,739
with nowhere to sell and so the

66
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:43,738
conditional retail program was created

67
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:46,080
and all of these programs okay please

68
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:48,420
keep in mind are unique to New York

69
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,300
there's nothing been done like this

70
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:53,939
before in the industry and any law has

71
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,519
unintended consequences in an incredibly

72
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:58,019
complex industry like cannabis where all

73
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:00,120
these pieces tie together those

74
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:02,879
unintended consequences you know

75
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,379
increase exponentially and so this you

76
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:07,560
know conditional adult use retail

77
00:03:04,378 --> 00:03:10,139
dispensary program was created by The

78
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,479
Regulators by the office of cannabis

79
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:14,818
management right and you have to meet

80
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,919
these very specific criteria to qualify

81
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:18,658
being someone with a specific type of

82
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:20,699
marijuana conviction showing that you

83
00:03:18,658 --> 00:03:22,500
were harmed you know by the War on Drugs

84
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:24,060
but to ensure that you know what you're

85
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,340
doing when you're operating a business

86
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:29,039
to also have had some history of

87
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:31,019
ownership in a profitable business and

88
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:33,060
so they get this program up and running

89
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:35,459
uh conditional retail I say we're going

90
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:38,340
to hand out 150 licenses one month to

91
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:41,400
apply 900 people apply and then after it

92
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:43,500
closes the regulators and I cover I have

93
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,480
a podcast we're about to relaunch where

94
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,479
we cover everything in the industry and

95
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:51,479
I've never seen anybody do what New York

96
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:54,179
Regulators did here in terms of after

97
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:56,699
people had applied right everything said

98
00:03:54,180 --> 00:04:00,420
and done they keep on making changes

99
00:03:56,699 --> 00:04:02,158
right for one thing they double to 300

100
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:04,079
licenses they're going to hand out oh

101
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:06,120
there's also this whole other idea of

102
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,459
we're going to have this fund 200

103
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,620
million dollars 50 from the state 50

104
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:13,860
from a raise of investment where we're

105
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:16,319
going to you know allocate 1.5 million

106
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:18,180
dollars or two million dollars to each

107
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:20,819
of these card conditional don't use

108
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:23,040
retail dispensary licensees that we hand

109
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:24,478
out to for the property and the buildup

110
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,340
we're going to help you find the sites

111
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:29,339
and lo and behold is something that

112
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:31,619
ambitious and a place as densely packed

113
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:34,258
as New York that wasn't working and no

114
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,720
money was being raised and so after the

115
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:38,759
application window closed you know some

116
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,680
of the they decided that they're going

117
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:43,080
to change the program you could use your

118
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,340
own property then they realize that more

119
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:46,319
people have their own property in

120
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:47,459
certain means than they thought even

121
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:51,060
though it might not have been the right

122
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:53,399
you know uh their like idea and you know

123
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:56,339
with 700 million dollars I call it Farm

124
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:57,839
to get it right people literally bet the

125
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:59,519
farm

126
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:01,859
um you know to put seeds in the ground

127
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:04,740
and transition over from the struggling

128
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:07,680
hemp and CBD Market to take a chance on

129
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:09,600
the first row and the New York cannabis

130
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,560
market and there's going to be no place

131
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:16,800
to sell uh and so they you know they

132
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,540
after the facts of ocm again right 150

133
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,919
licenses we're handing out you could use

134
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,780
your own properties we're going to

135
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:24,959
double it to 300. we got to sell all

136
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:26,399
that wheat uh and then recently they

137
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:30,180
even you know increased it I think

138
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:32,939
there's a total of 463 card licenses now

139
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:35,038
and you know the and they're also after

140
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:37,038
the fact they change and say oh we want

141
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:39,120
you to be able to sell like immediately

142
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:41,038
delivery out of the retail stores

143
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,660
whereas that have been intended as a

144
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:45,180
separate license

145
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,740
um and and then uh also

146
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,379
um I think it's supper license on

147
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,759
delivery um but I'm sorry New Jersey and

148
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:52,560
New York bounce around my head sometimes

149
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:54,960
and I'm not on Short Grass from the

150
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,759
Fantastic networking event uh and then

151
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:59,519
um but on-site consumption definitely

152
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:01,620
intended to be a separate

153
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:03,060
um no sorry delivery was not a separate

154
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,439
license sorry

155
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,300
um but outside consumption was always

156
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:09,240
intended to be a separate license and lo

157
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,918
and behold uh you know they that will

158
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,240
allow these cards to do on-site

159
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:14,099
consumption

160
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,840
um what they shifted by the way in terms

161
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,460
of like the intended race or full use

162
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:20,099
for card what I was referencing in terms

163
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:21,899
of delivery was the concept of you could

164
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,000
start sales ASAP out of a temporary

165
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:26,279
delivery location because they're just

166
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,019
trying to get you know to address

167
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:29,879
pharmageddon and get weed out the door

168
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:32,339
now the way that I've actually described

169
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:34,399
all this is in a way that's kind of

170
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:37,019
sympathetic to the regulators

171
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:40,258
and what I'll say is I always do the

172
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:42,120
disclaimer I don't I I thank them for

173
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:44,160
their service I think they have great

174
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,840
intentions of coming in and helping

175
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,580
people get harmed by the war drugs

176
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,560
especially in States like New Jersey and

177
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:51,659
New York and they certainly can't please

178
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,879
everyone and they're dealt you know

179
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,680
certain cards by the law that they're

180
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:57,418
handed and in this instance you know the

181
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,720
conditional processor and cultivator

182
00:06:57,418 --> 00:07:03,478
loss so I've kind of portrayed all of

183
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,039
this a certain way and then what

184
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:07,740
inevitably happens in every single state

185
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:09,659
are lawsuits right and those throw a

186
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:12,060
wrench and everything and their losses

187
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:15,000
You can predict because you know in

188
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:17,280
every single state right they the drug

189
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,220
is federally illegal right can you blame

190
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:22,439
local politicians and Regulators for

191
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:24,120
trying to you know when the entire

192
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:25,079
industry is going to be inside their

193
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,538
state

194
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:30,839
savoring people from the state versus

195
00:07:27,538 --> 00:07:33,120
what I call the Cana Carpetbaggers all

196
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:34,978
pop pawns are always intended right so

197
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,560
they come up with things to favor people

198
00:07:34,978 --> 00:07:39,899
in their state and then there's this you

199
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,899
know dormant Commerce Clause issue which

200
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:45,299
is like so incredibly frustrating that

201
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:47,879
the drug is federally illegal but

202
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:50,460
according to this concept of the dormant

203
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:51,899
Commerce Clause if Regulators come up

204
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:53,879
with something that favors their own

205
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:56,579
residence to the detriments of people

206
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:58,139
outside since Commerce is supposed to be

207
00:07:56,579 --> 00:07:59,038
just you know like industry

208
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:00,780
accomplishment was just supposed to be

209
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:03,060
governed by

210
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:05,219
um you know Congress they will knock out

211
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,959
those wrecks and there is a you know

212
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:09,240
dorm of Commerce Clause has an almost

213
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:11,459
100 percent you know track record in

214
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,918
multiple courts around the country so a

215
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:15,719
lawsuit comes in like that holds up the

216
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:18,659
awarding of licenses in multiple regions

217
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:21,360
but then they're what's you know what's

218
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,759
different and is specific to New York

219
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,939
and these moves that The Regulators did

220
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:29,038
in creating the entire conditional adult

221
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:32,399
use retail dispensary

222
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:34,500
that was not in the initial

223
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,620
um in the initial murder the law that

224
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:40,740
legalized adult use two lawsuits come in

225
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:43,139
right the first one is a lawsuit you

226
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,820
know nicely packaged and intelligent

227
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:47,159
packaged by some of the biggest

228
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,778
companies in the industry

229
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:52,259
um you know called multi-state operators

230
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:54,958
who own the medical licenses you know

231
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:56,879
the handful of medical licenses in New

232
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:59,099
York state right and these are vertical

233
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:00,899
and they're the only ones who could be

234
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,720
vertical and they're treated separately

235
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:05,700
in many different ways but there's a lot

236
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:08,160
of stuff in the initial proposed laws

237
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:10,140
that were not friendly towards any type

238
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:12,299
of big business and specifically these

239
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:13,679
folks and one thing was saying you're

240
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:17,039
not going to be allowed to sell and

241
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:19,799
cross over to adult use for years and so

242
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:22,139
with the card program every single

243
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:25,379
lawyer we all saw a vulnerability from

244
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:27,778
the beginning right it said in the law

245
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:30,000
itself the legalization law that the

246
00:09:27,778 --> 00:09:31,679
application period for all retail

247
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,159
dispensaries had to be opened at the

248
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:38,338
same time right the card program created

249
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:40,919
by You Know ocm The Regulators to

250
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:43,560
address Armageddon and everything

251
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:45,899
didn't do that at first glance

252
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:47,338
theoretically anyone could apply but

253
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:48,899
they wouldn't have a shot because unless

254
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:53,160
they have the scoring the very very

255
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:55,259
specific scoring criteria uh and so

256
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:57,480
um you know what ended up

257
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:59,778
by the way I like I'm talking the entire

258
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,778
time

259
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,278
you semperaneously right this is how my

260
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,778
brain is piecing all this together

261
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:08,458
because I've been you know thinking this

262
00:10:06,778 --> 00:10:09,899
out into different angles and I want to

263
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,979
get to the nitty-gritty of some of my

264
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:13,440
thoughts in terms of what's going on

265
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,720
right so you know this lawsuit comes in

266
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,100
and you know and the interesting thing

267
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,360
is the lawsuits in New York have

268
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,360
accomplished what they want to do to

269
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:24,060
some extent right the lawsuit by you

270
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,700
know these big companies you know one of

271
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:28,859
the things that happened was you know

272
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:31,920
the next version of the proposed

273
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:34,320
regulations was released you know by The

274
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:36,419
Regulators and lo and behold it had

275
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,160
changes in terms of accelerating the

276
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:40,379
timeline for them to be able to cross

277
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:42,120
over adult use and a couple other things

278
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:44,220
that were friendly to them and the

279
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,600
person who sued based on the Dorman

280
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,879
Commerce Clause because he was an

281
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,579
out-of-state person trying to get one of

282
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:53,100
these card licenses there's a settlement

283
00:10:50,578 --> 00:10:54,838
agreement with The Regulators in which

284
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,000
The Regulators essentially promised to

285
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:59,940
hand them a license in the adult use

286
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,339
rounds if he qualifies but they settle

287
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:04,620
just so they could remove the injunction

288
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:06,540
holding up the handing out or these

289
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:09,179
licenses and opening up of the

290
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:11,759
dispensaries in well at that point you

291
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:13,979
know one region left because they hand

292
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:16,620
out the car licenses according to

293
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:19,079
Regions tied to you know population to

294
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:21,240
ensure that there's sufficient Supply so

295
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:23,939
the last lawsuit that came out and the

296
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,500
one that's in everyone's mind right now

297
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,440
is

298
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:30,419
um a couple veterans right and so in the

299
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:33,000
initial you know Murder legalization

300
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:35,039
bill you know there are specific you

301
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,539
know classes of you know people that

302
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,338
these bills are trying to help right so

303
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:40,740
we've talked about you know people hurt

304
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:42,180
by the war on drugs or whatever and

305
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,579
um also just say like women-owned

306
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:47,578
businesses and you know service disabled

307
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:50,278
veterans so a group of veterans came

308
00:11:47,578 --> 00:11:51,599
along who you know plunked down you know

309
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:53,278
like I said it's been two years since

310
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,959
the bill was passed they plunk down

311
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:56,338
money for Real Estate right thinking

312
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,439
that things we're going to get up soon

313
00:11:56,339 --> 00:12:00,899
they've taken steps they've made

314
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,279
investment to be there on the front

315
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:04,740
lines and have one of the first

316
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:08,759
dispensaries open and then card program

317
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:11,519
opened up and so they're suing uh on

318
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:13,259
along similar lines as you know the

319
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,078
Coalition of the big companies pointing

320
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:18,600
out that issue of you know the the date

321
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:20,939
right not all retail dispensary

322
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,259
applications open up the same date

323
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,300
um and they pointed out some of these

324
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:26,958
issues in terms of how you know The

325
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:30,419
Regulators keep on you know essentially

326
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:33,838
expanding the card program by worrying

327
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:36,000
more licenses by letting them you know

328
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,980
um do all these different things to the

329
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,078
detriment of all the people that are

330
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:43,620
going to participate in the full adult

331
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:46,019
use round specifically the people that

332
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:48,120
that round you know they want to hand 50

333
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:49,440
of the licenses to these you know

334
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,839
certain classes including service

335
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,300
disabled veterans and you know there's a

336
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,160
limited amount of dispensaries that a

337
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:59,458
state can support and that was going to

338
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:02,639
be 463 cards handed out and operating

339
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:06,838
you know presumably possibly before they

340
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:09,180
get their chance and so they came in and

341
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:10,560
you know they said they asked for a

342
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:13,259
preliminary Junction and temporary

343
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:16,799
restraining order and what that is is a

344
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:19,259
party saying we are going to be so we're

345
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:22,379
being so irreparably harmed right now

346
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:25,620
that this is untenable right and we need

347
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:28,259
you judge to stop the other party you

348
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:30,179
know in this instance ocm we need you to

349
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:32,519
freeze the card program in its tracks

350
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:34,979
it's not just adding out but sending out

351
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:37,019
more licenses it's not approving anybody

352
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,720
who has a license but wants to become

353
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:42,179
operational because all these folks are

354
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,980
scrambling in one of the densest places

355
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:46,799
that there are with location

356
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:49,139
restrictions you know tied to houses of

357
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:51,059
worship in schools you know and certain

358
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:52,919
localities that have opt-in or not to

359
00:13:51,059 --> 00:13:55,138
find property right and some of them are

360
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:58,259
on the hook to pay this property and so

361
00:13:55,139 --> 00:14:00,659
right now you know they you know the the

362
00:13:58,259 --> 00:14:03,000
veterans the plaintiffs asked for

363
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:05,458
everything to be Frozen and what the

364
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,740
judge did here in this case was and this

365
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:10,439
is the same judge who you know appears

366
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:12,120
as handling both the Coalition case you

367
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,800
know and the veteran case and they do

368
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,980
that at times right because it's similar

369
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:20,399
arguments similar issues is efficient

370
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:22,800
and so what he did was he granted that

371
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,139
temporary restraining order he throws

372
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:29,039
the entire card program in its tracks

373
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:30,419
but it was a placeholder okay it was

374
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:31,980
just

375
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:33,838
um you know certainly interesting that

376
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:36,240
he did it but it you know this might

377
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,459
just end up being a placeholder until

378
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,379
you know and I think that the the

379
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:44,099
current deadline for the state to

380
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:46,500
respond is today and the hearing is

381
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:49,860
scheduled and this tro goes and told the

382
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:52,740
hearing uh on Friday so that's not

383
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:54,899
pushed right we may have an answer right

384
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,579
you know on Friday

385
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:59,039
um you know this is a function of what

386
00:14:56,578 --> 00:14:59,879
will end up happening

387
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:02,719
um

388
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:02,720
uh

389
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:09,899
yeah so um so on Friday right there are

390
00:15:08,698 --> 00:15:11,879
two things

391
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:14,339
um you know uh there are two things that

392
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:17,338
could happen right one thing is you know

393
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:20,160
he can deny the request for a temporary

394
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:23,820
restraining order uh in which case hard

395
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:28,139
you know unfreezes and keeps on going

396
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:30,899
um and if he grants the tro it would

397
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:35,278
extend through the point at which he

398
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:38,278
makes a decision in the Coalition case

399
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:40,019
um you know in the Coalition case

400
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:42,539
um dueling summary judgment motions in

401
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:43,620
the Coalition case both sides are saying

402
00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:47,159
that they essentially have a winning

403
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:49,620
hand uh and so the judge right so the

404
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:53,039
veteran plaintiff said all right we want

405
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:54,959
to freeze hard until you judge this is

406
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:57,539
what they actually asked for so you

407
00:15:54,958 --> 00:16:00,179
judge make a call on the legality of the

408
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:01,919
entire card system in that other case

409
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:05,578
with the Coalition where they made

410
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:07,799
similar arguments and you know the the

411
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:10,019
fear here right when we all saw this

412
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:11,879
vulnerability from a ways out and so

413
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:13,799
obvious is that you know talking to

414
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:16,559
other lawyers we all geek out about this

415
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:17,939
you know that there is you know an issue

416
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,919
here

417
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:22,880
um that you know it might not look good

418
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:25,559
it's possible that the card program was

419
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:27,778
improper from the beginning

420
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:30,059
um but you know what I want to put up on

421
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:31,799
LinkedIn today and discuss is you know

422
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:33,778
look judges know what's going on

423
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:36,078
disrupting the card program at this

424
00:16:33,778 --> 00:16:38,639
point would be an incredible

425
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:41,578
stabilization in a market that's already

426
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,680
already really really struggling and so

427
00:16:41,578 --> 00:16:46,198
I'm not you know an administrative

428
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:47,278
lawyer I always say that people need to

429
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:48,958
think of lawyers I could think of

430
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:50,578
doctors who wouldn't ask a dermatologist

431
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,659
to look at something up your you know

432
00:16:50,578 --> 00:16:53,519
what

433
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:55,198
um just like right but you know having

434
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,179
read some articles around

435
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:59,219
um including a point made by an attorney

436
00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:01,439
named David Holland or saying like you

437
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,240
know the only you know line of reasoning

438
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,759
that could help the state is saying

439
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:08,578
everything they did The Regulators was

440
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:10,619
due to an emergency and so I framed this

441
00:17:08,578 --> 00:17:12,779
entire narrative to highlight two

442
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:15,178
emergencies that were not of The

443
00:17:12,779 --> 00:17:18,418
Regulators on creating the first is

444
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:21,000
unlicensed stores selling

445
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:24,299
um you know products that are unsafe the

446
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,099
second is the legislature legalized

447
00:17:24,298 --> 00:17:28,980
created the conditional cultivation and

448
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:31,019
processing and there were 700 million a

449
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:33,179
weed coming out of the ground that

450
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:36,179
needed some place to be sold

451
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:38,700
right and so everything they've done in

452
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:41,940
with the card program has understandably

453
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:44,519
really been for the purpose of safety of

454
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:46,019
the populace and selling the Surplus

455
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:48,058
weed so that these people aren't

456
00:17:46,019 --> 00:17:49,740
economically devastated

457
00:17:48,058 --> 00:17:52,079
um Upstate that they're intending to

458
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:54,058
help and the only thing I'll say is like

459
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:56,460
I want to dig deep into the chronic you

460
00:17:54,058 --> 00:17:57,660
know chronology here because you're

461
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,880
making this argument that you're

462
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,919
irreparably harmed and part of the thing

463
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,179
that occurs to me is why couldn't the

464
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,059
plaintiffs have brought this earlier

465
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:08,280
what just happened that changed this and

466
00:18:06,058 --> 00:18:09,720
made this completely untenable and

467
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:11,819
Justified asking for a preliminary

468
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,279
injunction and the only thing that was

469
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:18,058
relatively recent was the increase from

470
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:19,740
300 to 463 licenses being handed out and

471
00:18:18,058 --> 00:18:22,019
so I'm wondering if the judge can dig

472
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:23,880
them on that and then ultimately maybe

473
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:25,740
right even though it doesn't look great

474
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,860
because they have strong arguments maybe

475
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:32,298
these emergency bases are enough that

476
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:32,298
the program continues

477
00:18:33,298 --> 00:18:37,500
incredible insights and it's it's very

478
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:39,058
well summarize thank you very much for

479
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,919
that I'm sure everybody's going to get a

480
00:18:39,058 --> 00:18:43,200
wealth of information like I just did

481
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:44,700
out of it we've run over our time now

482
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,558
but hopefully we can get to touch base

483
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,538
in maybe a week or two and see well

484
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:51,178
currently lies then do a priority to

485
00:18:48,538 --> 00:18:52,980
this yeah I'm happy to do that all right

486
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:54,900
so uh thank you so much for having me

487
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,960
and letting me speak the entire time

488
00:18:54,900 --> 00:19:00,059
next time I'm going to interview you

489
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,150
not at all my player until next episode

490
00:19:00,058 --> 00:19:04,629
everybody

491
