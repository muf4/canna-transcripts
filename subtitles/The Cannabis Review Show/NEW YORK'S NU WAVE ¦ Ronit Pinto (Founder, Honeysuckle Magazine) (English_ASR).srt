very much appreciate it do you maybe

10
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:27,960
want to give everybody a quick overview

11
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:29,439
in a minute of what your position in the

12
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:34,320
industry is and how you came to get

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:36,399
there sure so I um I was born in Detro I

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,119
grew up in Texas I was born in Detroit

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,679
and then I lived in Tel Avie for a few

16
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:43,320
years and kind of bounc back between

17
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:46,719
Detroit and some other cities U before

18
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:49,039
laning in New York um in Tel Aviv is

19
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,600
where I started um writing so I have a

20
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,439
background in media and film in Detroit

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,280
I was working in Union film sets for

22
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:58,399
like big budget movies like Jim jarmo um

23
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,120
Only Lovers Left Alive and scream for

24
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,000
and Transformers

25
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:05,438
and um when I came to New York I decided

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,640
to stop crewing because you spend like

27
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:09,559
you know 18 hours a day on some Union

28
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,239
film set and I thought well I may as

29
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,040
well just put this to my own sort of

30
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:14,359
like

31
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,840
aspirations um and wanted to combine

32
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:17,840
media and film and so that's what we're

33
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,280
doing now with

34
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:24,759
honeysuckle um it kind of just

35
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:27,400
like um serendipitously coincided with

36
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:30,920
New York cannabis in a way CU um we

37
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,920
landed here in 2017 when when uh well I

38
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,399
started the magazine in 2014 but we

39
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:39,478
started our cannabis New York coverage

40
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:41,879
in 2017 um and uh that was like a few

41
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:43,879
years obviously before legalization so

42
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:46,519
we kind of got in at the groundup and

43
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:48,679
really like connected and got to know

44
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:50,718
the community and the local activists

45
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,880
and that has kind of informed our um

46
00:01:50,718 --> 00:01:54,919
narrative until now so we've kind of got

47
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:57,399
to like come up with everyone it's been

48
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:00,320
great incredible yeah if there's a v

49
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:02,039
diagram of art music and culture pipus

50
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,959
kind is one of the few things that sits

51
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:07,079
right in the center that so it's a it

52
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:09,560
seemed to be a timely uh launch for you

53
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,719
guys yeah I mean it was you know we'd

54
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,120
always been kind of into like

55
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:16,159
underground subjects or trying to make

56
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,319
like taboo issues more mainstream um and

57
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:19,680
then we found that cannabis provided

58
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:21,000
kind of like a micro it was like

59
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,280
everything you can look through the lens

60
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,080
of cannabis you know it's political it's

61
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:30,640
um cultural it's um it's medicinal it's

62
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,560
a lot of things you can explore so

63
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:35,199
through you've had some big uh covers

64
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,680
recently in some of the magazines with

65
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:39,518
Little Wayne and with Erica Badu when it

66
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,560
comes to these big shoots are you in the

67
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,439
an a winter mold where you manage every

68
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,479
single piece of the shoot or do you give

69
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:49,158
free uh freelance to your stylist and

70
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:52,079
photographer um it's definitely a combin

71
00:02:49,158 --> 00:02:54,878
like um combo I uh you know I work with

72
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,640
my partner Sam long who does a lot of

73
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:59,199
the photography so we did not personally

74
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:02,318
shoot Little Wayne but he did shoot

75
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:03,119
Erica and Alan coming and um you know

76
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:05,919
Whiz

77
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,080
Khalifa I am more of a big picture

78
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:10,759
person so I'm definitely like producing

79
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,599
it it's usually my idea you know I'm in

80
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:18,158
contact with the Reps who who connect us

81
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:19,158
with the cover artists um I honestly am

82
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:22,519
a little

83
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:25,399
intimidated uh during the shoots with

84
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:28,560
celebrities I don't I'm a little shy so

85
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,000
I more like to kind of sit back and then

86
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,560
I trust the people that were working

87
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,519
with but of course I'm like extremely

88
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,318
involved you know um but just not like

89
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,120
super Hands-On I guess like during the

90
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:39,598
shoot I don't know it depends you're

91
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,878
probably a good person to ask you guys

92
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:43,479
seem to be uh you've won a lot of awards

93
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:46,679
and there's a lot of recognition from

94
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:48,560
the political side of of New York when

95
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,000
it comes to the Cannabis industry in

96
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,000
general is it mayor Adams or is there a

97
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,639
specific politician who you think

98
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,639
deserves a bit of Praise when it comes

99
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:59,958
to the

100
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:02,839
industry um that's a good question you

101
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:06,799
know I think a lot of them are new

102
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,878
obviously cuz like cannabis is new um I

103
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,360
think you know we've been working with

104
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:15,239
desita Dawson since pre- legalization or

105
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,759
prmr since like 2017 um she's you know

106
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:18,720
we've done a lot of campaigns with her I

107
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:21,759
think the governor hok actually has been

108
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:25,320
pretty supportive also for um you know

109
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:28,960
cannabis um progress and we've worked

110
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:31,800
with taine Wright from the ocm um I

111
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:33,638
think that there's a lot of people who

112
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,319
are pushing the narrative you know have

113
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:38,240
brought Equity to the Forefront um

114
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:40,319
there's obvious like continual

115
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,879
challenges as in any industry especially

116
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,240
in a capitalist Society you know where

117
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:45,959
you're going to have like the

118
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,680
competition or interests of like bigger

119
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:50,439
corporations and I think that's like a

120
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,519
conflict that we see here in New York um

121
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:55,680
and I I think people are doing their

122
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:58,799
best to sort of like mitigate that or

123
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,280
provide um a kind of balance between the

124
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,680
different sort of parts of the

125
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:06,279
industry the first main topic I wanted

126
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,560
to talk about was New York's new wave

127
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:09,839
and like most people would know about

128
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,800
the new wave of Art in the 70s new W of

129
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:14,519
Music in the 80s are we about to see

130
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,120
from New York City a new wave of

131
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:17,560
cannabis in America and some of the

132
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,079
biggest companies that are going to

133
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,800
exist in this industry are about to be

134
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:25,359
bured in this

135
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:27,360
city yeah I mean I think that um New

136
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,038
York will definitely Define a new kind

137
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,759
of cannabis culture for sure like you

138
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,959
know we've seen obviously in California

139
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,240
it's been around and it's so accepted

140
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:39,359
and just like an ingrain part of the

141
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,360
West Coast culture uh it's less feels

142
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,199
less stigmatized there less a little

143
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,879
less I shouldn't say less political but

144
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:50,560
less charged than here in New York um in

145
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:52,360
terms of Brands I don't know the trend

146
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,680
that I see is that there's like many

147
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,120
Brands and it's more kind of customized

148
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:00,639
so they're sort of like um different

149
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:03,360
hierarchies kind of more like fashion so

150
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,639
um you know like like kind of like uh

151
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,800
like we've noticed these um like kind of

152
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:09,199
like sneaker sort of sneaker Brands

153
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,199
where you have this sort of like Elite

154
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,720
really high-grade cannabis that people

155
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,879
love that's um sold and manufactured in

156
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,160
smaller batches but it's more expensive

157
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:21,159
it's at a higher price that's definitely

158
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,840
trending I'm not sure how scalable that

159
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,120
model will be but in terms of companies

160
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:28,359
like I don't know if it's going to be

161
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,399
smaller Pockets or like uh big ones that

162
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,560
emerge or combination

163
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:35,638
um we'll see like you know some of the

164
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,879
msos in other states haven't done well

165
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:39,319
so a lot of it depends on how the

166
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:41,399
companies and brands are like touching

167
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:43,720
and reaching their consumers I know a

168
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:45,079
lot of the Legacy um you know people who

169
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,280
have been doing it already have their

170
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:50,000
customer base so I don't know if that's

171
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:51,839
going to like scale or stay the same um

172
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,680
it'll be interesting to see yeah I

173
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:56,519
haven't heard of one brand in particular

174
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,038
that's like blowing up you know but I I

175
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:00,279
do know like several ones that look to

176
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:02,279
be like

177
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:03,959
successful I noticed as well that

178
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:05,959
cookies opened their first New York

179
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:10,120
store there from one of the Articles you

180
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:11,839
guys did do you see the eventuality that

181
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,360
the Big Brand like cookies that comes

182
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:16,038
into the city is going to be able to

183
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,598
have a dominant hold or is New York

184
00:07:16,038 --> 00:07:18,759
going to always be one of these Outlets

185
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:21,439
there's too many creative and

186
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:23,840
entrepreneurs in too many categories for

187
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:26,038
this to be dominated by an outside brand

188
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:27,638
that as you said like almost with

189
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:29,519
fashion that there's always a hip New

190
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:32,879
York New York designer that everybody

191
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:34,878
body wants what they've got yeah I mean

192
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,319
I think we all love cookies and um

193
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:38,800
appreciate and acknowledge obviously the

194
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:41,598
Legacy that burner has created um in the

195
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,240
brand that's a really tough question

196
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:46,319
like I don't know you know what I mean I

197
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,960
think that um I think that cookies

198
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,560
obviously has a following and and we

199
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:51,399
loved our event and everything that

200
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,959
we've done with them um but New York

201
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:55,799
will be tough because I do think people

202
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:58,279
are sort of like patriotic and you know

203
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,360
want like the specific New York stamp

204
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:02,679
but I mean I'm sure I'm sure they'll do

205
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,158
well um I guess time will tell I mean

206
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,840
look we're going to have a lot of like

207
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:09,959
outside state state um companies coming

208
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:12,000
in so um yeah from somebody who's lived

209
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:13,918
in New York for a number of years and

210
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,478
knows the city well enough it always

211
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:18,279
seems to be in New York that everybody

212
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:21,158
wants to know what's the next best thing

213
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:23,318
and do you see a scenario do you see H

214
00:08:21,158 --> 00:08:26,598
is Edibles are allowed within the rules

215
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:30,479
correct yeah has there been any Artisan

216
00:08:26,598 --> 00:08:32,319
stores and let's say dining experiences

217
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:34,000
that are starting to happen now you see

218
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,519
a lot of it over in LA with some kind of

219
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
famous 420 chefs and and whatnot are you

220
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:40,679
starting to see that in New York at the

221
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,879
moment yes yeah there are a lot of

222
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:45,759
infused meal events like the Mooney

223
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:48,399
house host some and you know there's um

224
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:50,600
chef Mike Hawaii Mike um Chef

225
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,639
Leighton uh you know as to the

226
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,320
legalities of the operation I'm not

227
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:56,639
exactly sure at this point like I know

228
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,278
some of them have brands that are um

229
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:03,159
legit and that in that like in that

230
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:05,879
like in terms of legality um but yeah

231
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:07,679
there's a lot of dining experiences a

232
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:10,759
lot like you could probably find several

233
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:12,958
a week if you look for it

234
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:16,639
okay I would imagine that a good

235
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:19,439
combination as well is going to be the

236
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,838
music side of the industry plus I would

237
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,800
imagine there's going to be catering to

238
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:25,600
tourists there's going to be a number of

239
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:27,278
experiences about that but I see the the

240
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,759
music scene in New York and the Canabis

241
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:30,720
scene in New York coming together to

242
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:32,399
create some unique and spectacular

243
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,320
spaces for consumption and not just

244
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,120
oneoff

245
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:41,720
events um music events you mean like

246
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,799
more immersive yeah um yeah I mean like

247
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,920
which ones are some of the ones that

248
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:47,359
you've

249
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:49,039
noticed just in terms of um will that

250
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,079
start happening in the future is more to

251
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:52,399
the point do you see that I'm sure

252
00:09:51,078 --> 00:09:55,120
there's a lot

253
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,399
of music artists that have capital on

254
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,480
hand that are going to be able to open a

255
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,600
nightclub but without s on alcohol will

256
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,519
have cannabis consumption lounges in

257
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,920
there and blend that with the music's

258
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,759
lifestyle yeah for sure I mean I think

259
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:11,000
that we see it now you know maybe more

260
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:14,120
underground like we did a great event at

261
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,278
um the house of X that was like um a

262
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,320
Black History Month burles show based on

263
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:21,120
Josephine Baker uh we worked with this

264
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,640

265
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,399
choreographer and performer and like

266
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:26,278
there was consumption in a live jazz

267
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,759
band and we had it sort of themed about

268
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:32,000
about the end of prohibition um you know

269
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:34,439

274
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:49,078
these like cannabis kind of award shows

275
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:52,959

276
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:55,278
together to highlight Brands as well um

277
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:58,919
and obviously there's like you know like

278
00:10:55,278 --> 00:11:00,519
AST Club who has like intimate uh nights

279

artists and DJs um and there's like a

281
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,720
lot of kind of underground places like

282
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:09,399
that when it comes to the card licenses

283
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,800
and the suspension that happened

284
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:12,519
recently we've had a couple of experts

285
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:14,399
from New York on at different stages

286
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:16,560
explaining the different timelines of

287
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,240
what's Happening currently where does it

288
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:20,078
stand at the moment are the card license

289
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,159
completely suspended or are they still

290
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:24,958
able to fulfill the applications that

291
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:28,039
were already put in they're trying to

292
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:31,159
codify it that will protect the card

293
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:34,039
licenses they hav done that yet um from

294
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:37,480
what I you know some they have like tear

295
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:39,319
so like some people who had real estate

296
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,800
and have invested you know a certain

297
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:44,480
amount are able to get their licenses

298
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:46,799
and have opened um others I think

299
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,200
they've opened the C program

300
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:53,759
SE um and they have to

301
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:56,040
reapply uh so I'm not sure if card is

302
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:57,838
going to exist um I know that they want

303
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:59,559
it to continue or if they're going to

304
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,279
have to reapply and how they're kind of

305
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:04,919
like divvying up um the people who have

306
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:07,519
already been allotted

307
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:09,159
licenses if there was business people

308
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,639
from Europe that were looking to come

309
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:12,319
over to New York and learn about the

310
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,919
industry what's the one event that

311
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,278
happens in New York every year like

312
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:18,599
we've got mjps in vas that happens

313
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:20,278
you've got the h a couple of the other

314
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,480
ones Med can and that what's the big one

315
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:24,000
on the calendar every year that somebody

316
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,680
if they want to learn about the New York

317
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,440
industry should be

318
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:29,919
attending um well I think coming here on

319
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,320
420

320
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:35,278
is a great time um because you can

321
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:38,440
there's so many parties and events and

322
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:40,278
you can see more of the industry like

323
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,199
how it works and how how consumers

324
00:12:40,278 --> 00:12:45,720
operate and what the culture is um in

325
00:12:43,198 --> 00:12:48,679
terms of events you know they've had uh

329
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:58,639
everyone's at right now I know some

330
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:00,519
companies have stopped coming here some

331
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,680
companies are still coming here but I

332
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:06,360
think that like 420 is a probably really

333
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:08,239
good place to survey the scene make

334
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,759
connections if there's something you're

335
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,799
looking forward to over the next 12

336
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:14,120
months in the New York industry to come

337
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:15,719
to fruition what is the the thing that

338
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,440
you're looking forward to

339
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:21,320
seeing um that's a great question I

340
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:24,639
think the you know more really kind of

341
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:27,040
like cool dispensaries like Union Square

342
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,120
travel agency just did a redesign that's

343
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:31,360
just stunning you know Gotham's doing

344
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,959
doing some cool branding so I think I'm

345
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,800
excited about the marketing and branding

346
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:37,799
surrounding that cuz I love like sexy

347
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:39,719
campaigns and just like overall visuals

348
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:41,679
um and I'm definitely excited to see

349
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:44,600
more consumption lounges you know I

350
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:46,159
think that there's a huge need people

351
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,639
don't want to drink alcohol like they

352
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:51,319
used to um you know they want different

353
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,159
options maybe even other kinds of plant

354
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,720
medicine integrated in there with

355
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:58,480
cannabis um for like mocktails or

356
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:00,360
infusions so I think like uh exploding

357
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,959
the sort of consumption Lounge nightlife

358
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,720
scene as an alternative to the

359
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:06,319
traditional bar is going to be really

360
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,278
cool um and then I also remembered just

361
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,720
to your point about music in cannabis

362
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:14,159
like rolling loud is a good example of a

363
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:16,320
big Festival that um highlights cannabis

364
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:17,879
and kind of has made it part of their

365
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,560
primary vertical or like one of their

366
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:23,360
main lanes and it's a blast and a lot of

367
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:26,078
fun so I think that's a good way to go

368
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,320
too amazing well Rish it's been amazing
