00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,439
and your journey in the industry so far

17
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,359
yeah sure no problem my name is pia

18
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,718
martin i'm the ceo and co-founder of the

19
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,359
konova meiji

20
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,039
and we want to provide patients in

21
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:48,000
germany and europe with

22
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,920
medical cannabis so our vision is that

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,640
every patient deserves the best

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:57,280
therapy and cannabis as a medicine

25
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,480
or cannabis in general i think is a

26
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,879
highly stigmatized topic here in germany

27
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,640
and during my studies abroad in the

28
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:08,000
netherlands for example

29
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,920
um i was surprised by how

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,079
different the approach from society was

31
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,879
there regarding cannabis

32
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:16,239
and it was much more accepted there than

33
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,640
it is here

34
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:19,920
so when medical cannabis got legalized

35
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,439
um here in germany

36
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,359
in 2017 i knew i wanted to

37
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:27,039
work in this industry in this field you

38
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:30,239
know and

39
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,799
after conducting intensive research

40
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:34,560
about medical benefits talking to

41
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,520
doctors and patients

42
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,359
i was really touched by their stories

43
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:41,920
and i always wanted to do

44
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,438
something meaningful um the current

45
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,840
state of knowledge is that

46
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:46,959
cannabis can really heal but it can

47
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,478
improve patients

48
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:51,280
quality of life so our federal institute

49
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:54,640
for drugs

50
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,920
and medical products um also called

51
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,478
beefarm

52
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,519
they're running a non-interventional

53
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:03,200
survey

54
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:04,640
for cannabis and they track indications

55
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,680
and improvements

56
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,598
and the typical patient for example is a

57
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,640
chronic pain patient

58
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:16,318
mostly over 50 years old and has been

59
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:19,439
in chronic pain for more than 10 years

60
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:22,560
mostly and with

61
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:25,598
medical cannabis as a as a medicine

62
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,400
those patients can be helped um

63
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:29,119
quality of life can be improved it can't

64
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,640
heal

65
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,640
but it can improve patients quality of

66
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:38,399
life which is really important

67
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:41,039
and um yes so what i've learned

68
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,519
um about cannabis as a medicine it's

69
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:46,639
it's the potential it has for patients

70
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:49,759
um hasn't been fully used yet or fully

71
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:54,318
um yeah fully developed yet so

72
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:57,280
we need to improve access to

73
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:58,799
medical cannabis for patients and we

74
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,840
want to provide medical

75
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,680
cannabis that is sunlight grown and free

76
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,719
of chemical pesticides

77
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,519
so i founded the company with my

78
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:11,039
co-founder

79
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:14,719
marius cosa in 2019

80
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:17,039
to do exactly that so

81
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:18,000
why sunlight grown and free of chemical

82
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,318
pesticides i

83
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,039
think a sustainable approach is very

84
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:25,280
important

85
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:27,519
so before i worked at kenobo i

86
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,640
worked in the field of renewable energy

87
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,840
so

88
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:33,598
therefore i see a lot of a lot of

89
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,920
similarity between the industries

90
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:37,119
and sustainability is very important to

91
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:40,158
me

92
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,080
so therefore we found canovum

93
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:44,239
with a different approach than our

94
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,400
competitors so we want to provide

95
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,400
medical cannabis that is sunlight grown

96
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,120
and free of chemical pesticides

97
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,719
because after all cannabis is a plant it

98
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,200
needs light and water

99
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:59,919
and i think that's the best approach

100
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:02,000
in that industry okay well i'm going to

101
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:03,280
skip to the third topic and we can come

102
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,239
back to the second because we kind of

103
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,719
led into it

104
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,280
and that's europe's supply chain uh

105
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,158
you're just

106
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,680
talking about sunlight ground flower and

107
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:14,479
now pesticides

108
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,599
we had heidi whitman on a couple of days

109
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:17,839
ago on the show

110
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:20,079
and again a similar model do you have

111
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,679
your flower grown in a specific part of

112
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,319
the world that allows for the sunlight

113
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,000
to be grown

114
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:28,240
or what territory is your supply coming

115
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,079
into europe from

116
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,120
um well um i can say uh exactly from

117
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:36,240
where but it's

118
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:40,240
the european union um and

119
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:43,439
we sourced probably over 50 or talked to

120
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,040
over 50 um cultivators worldwide

121
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:46,800
two source of products we're not

122
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,479
vertically integrated but we work with

123
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,439
the best in the industry that's our

124
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:53,519
approach

125
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:57,040
and yes and we found a partner

126
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:59,120
that is growing um

127
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,639
medical cannabis uh under all the

128
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,360
regulations

129
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,960
up to our quality standards so without

130
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,240
chemical pesticides

131
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:09,680
and in sunlight um so it's from the

132
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,918
european union yes

133
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,038
so do you see then one of the next kind

134
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:14,639
of lead-ons that

135
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:16,159
there is a certain amount of companies

136
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,918
that are going to focus on the price per

137
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,320
gram and it's going to be grown in one

138
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:20,560
of the

139
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:21,839
latin american countries or in africa do

140
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,759
you see the

141
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:25,519
the farming ability in europe which is

142
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,120
far more advanced than most territories

143
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:28,879
in the world do you see that being

144
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,120
a leg up for europe for him being able

145
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,399
to supply the whole continent of europe

146
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,160
with europe-grown

147
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:35,279
cannabis or do you always see that

148
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,400
there's going to be a balance of the

149
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,559
supply chain

150
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:40,879
coming into europe from far-off

151
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,199
countries and grown locally

152
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:44,719
well i think um there are two aspects to

153
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,080
it um

154
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,240
first of all um importing

155
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:52,478
from within the european union to

156
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,400
germany for example is much easier

157
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:55,839
than doing it from from third-party

158
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:59,120
countries um

159
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,918
so the regulatory aspect is one um but i

160
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,519
agree with you

161
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:04,478
um in europe we see a lot of cultivation

162
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,879
right now

163
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:09,439
a lot of cultivators entering the market

164
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:13,279
um with high quality product

165
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:13,918
um so i see that the european union

166
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:17,038
probably

167
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:21,198
could um satisfy

168
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:25,199
the demand here with uh within

169
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:28,879
the european union but obviously

170
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:31,520
other countries with preferable

171
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:32,959
cultivation conditions like africa south

172
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:36,000
america

173
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:38,560
will also have good products probably

174
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,038
with a lower price that will enter the

175
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,720
market

176
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:44,079
but the regulation um regarding the

177
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,479
certification

178
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:47,359
it's it's much more demanding um you

179
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:50,478
need to be

180
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,960
eugmp certified uh in order to

181
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:53,918
export to the european union or to

182
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:57,038
germany

183
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:57,758
um so not everyone is meeting the demand

184
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:00,399
yet

185
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,038
um covet might also be a reason during

186
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:04,799
covert

187
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:07,439
less inspections have been conducted

188
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,160
all over the world so this might delay

189
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:11,120
it a bit

190
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,840
but obviously um other cultivators from

191
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,879
other countries

192
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:16,239
will enter the market as well yeah

193
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:18,478
i see as well that i was reading

194
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,439
recently that some of the first grown

195
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:23,199
uh cannabis grown in germany has hit the

196
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:24,879
german market for your pharmacy some

197
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,960
grown by aurora and one of the other

198
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:28,478
concepts that's a pretty good milestone

199
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:30,638
to be able to say that we've got our own

200
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:31,598
flower on our own shelves for our own

201
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,079
consumers

202
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:35,279
and i i think the europe could end up

203
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,560
going that direction that

204
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:38,559
certain countries are going to have

205
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,959
certain genetics and strains

206
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,959
that are uh relative to maybe let's say

207
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:44,638
the diseases or the patients that

208
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:46,478
they're trying aiming to treat in each

209
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,160
individual country whereas i think

210
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:48,878
america is going to focus more on just

211
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,720
it'll be

212
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,720
weed to get high and weed as a

213
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,319
commercial adult use product

214
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,879
whereas i think europe you could have a

215
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,879
far more nuanced industry with

216
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,400
individual genetics and strains

217
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,479
kind of brings me on to the next topic i

218
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,239
wanted to talk to you about is germany

219
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:06,240
good for cannabis startups

220
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,759
do you see this being one of the homes

221
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,800
we've talked to the malta enterprise

222
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,479
board already

223
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,680
we've talked to we know ireland is one

224
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:13,038
of the main hubs for a lot of the big

225
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,639
huge global companies

226
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:16,159
do you think germany is going to be a

227
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,598
hub for some of the cannabis startups in

228
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,240
europe

229
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:22,800
um well as you mentioned um we have the

230
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,478
first german cannabis on the market now

231
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,560
so i think this is a pretty big

232
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:29,199
milestone

233
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,038
for the whole industry you know the

234
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,879
european industry in germany being the

235
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:36,240
biggest market in it

236
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:37,278
and therefore i think yes it's a good

237
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,000
place

238
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:40,479
for cannabis startups but i think there

239
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,799
are two

240
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,320
aspects to consider here once you have

241
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,639
the um

242
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,519
medical side you know the patients the

243
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:49,759
physicians

244
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,639
and we have many more patients in

245
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:55,120
germany than physicians who prescribe

246
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:55,759
cannabis as a medicine and unfortunately

247
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,720
cannabis

248
00:08:55,759 --> 00:09:00,480
and the endo cannabinoid system are

249
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,519
rarely part of pharmaceutical medical

250
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,399
education

251
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,080
that's something we need to work on and

252
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,559
we support physicians and

253
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,920
pharmacists through medical education we

254
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:13,518
offer workshops

255
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:17,039
and an online platform that offers

256
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:19,440
education on that end and the other part

257
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:21,199
is the regulatory side getting all the

258
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,720
pharmaceutical licenses you need a

259
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,720
narcotics license you need a

260
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,680
distribution license

261
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,879
we also have the manufacturing license

262
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:32,559
in order

263
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:36,000
to build important steps here in germany

264
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:39,119
and yeah bring the best products to our

265
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,600
patients um the market is therefore

266
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,159
really complex with high entry barriers

267
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,360
um

268
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:47,600
which is obviously um good for

269
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,959
um the companies that are already in the

270
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,080
market um

271
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:55,518
but i see germany

272
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,519
as a really potential market

273
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,360
here in germany because if you look at

274
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,200
the german market

275
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,278
um it's the biggest one in europe as i

276
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,839
said and if you look at the numbers a

277
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:08,399
bit

278
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:09,920
in 2020 um i think more than 128 000

279
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,278
patients were treated

280
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:16,958
um in 2017 um when it was

281
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:19,759
legalized there were only 27 000 so

282
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:21,518
that's a lot more and according to

283
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:23,200
prohibition partners

284
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,039
more than one million german patients

285
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,640
will have access to medical cannabis

286
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:29,838
by 2024 which is it's a huge step in

287
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:32,799
development

288
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:36,160
and medical cannabis market alone i

289
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,719
think is expected to be worth around 7.7

290
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:41,199
billion

291
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:44,879
by 2028. so um i think

292
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:48,000
we will see great development

293
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:50,559
and the german and european market has

294
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,759
great potential in my opinion yeah i

295
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:53,359
agree with you i think germany is going

296
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:55,200
to be the model for europe that what

297
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,480
happens there is going to be distributed

298
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,120
across the continent

299
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,159
just for as i said size of market the

300
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,759
skilled uh

301
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,120
labor workforce there that you know

302
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,278
products coming in are going to be to

303
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,720
the highest of global standards so

304
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:08,720
yeah it's exciting times to be in

305
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,000
germany and you guys recently listened

306
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,480
to the burlington hamburg

307
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,278
stock exchanges so again congratulations

308
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,600
on that

309
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:17,200
what are the plans for the next 12 to 24

310
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,519
months that you'd like to take off your

311
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,759
uh

312
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,600
if you had a dream cannabis list of give

313
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:23,919
me two items to tick off in the next 12

314
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,959
months what are they going to be

315
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:28,000
oh well i mean um one big milestone was

316
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:30,479
listing

317
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,919
as you mentioned right now um we got

318
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,600
first listed in dusseldorf

319
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:36,000
that was a huge milestone we've been

320
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,040
working on for a while now

321
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,078
um but obviously we have a lot more

322
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:43,599
future plans

323
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:44,958
and we want to bring our own sustainable

324
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,680
brand into the market

325
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:49,439
this will be the next uh big step uh a

326
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:52,159
huge milestone for us

327
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,120
and obviously we see we see ourselves

328
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:56,240
not just as a

329
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,360
german berlin company but as a european

330
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,079
company

331
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,120
therefore we are looking into different

332
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:04,559
markets as well

333
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:07,759
and really looking closely

334
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:11,119
on the developments there and probably

335
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:12,799
will be soon in other markets as well

336
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,320
