00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,320
that 30 years really

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,660
um but I've been active for like

24
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:01,140
probably about 25 years and I did a lot

25
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:03,238
with a local uh normal chapter Mass can

26
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,579
normal at that time uh the Boston

27
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:07,560
Freedom rally booked their event for a

28
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:09,719
number of years 10 years I was on the

29
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,939
board uh two-term president it's a

30
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:14,400
non-profit for cannabis reform in

31
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:16,438
Massachusetts and uh we're the largest

32
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,760
one on you know pretty much on the east

33
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:19,500
coast of the event

34
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,840
and so I did that for a number of years

35
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,060
and then I got into podcasting and uh

36
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,100
the young jerks has been going for nine

37
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,618
years now we used to do a studio show

38
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:31,859
but now we're doing a live stream yard

39
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:34,259
show uh take phone calls and we we

40
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:36,118
really have been covering you know the

41
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,938
show for the young jerks is really about

42
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:40,438
uh representing communities and people

43
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:43,258
that don't get

44
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:45,959
uh platform or being ignored a lot of

45
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:49,319
times by the larger meteor and uh on

46
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:52,019
this cannabis workers has just risen to

47
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:53,819
the top for us lately uh just due to the

48
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:56,099
fact that there's so much issues in

49
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:58,798
cannabis so that's really what we've

50
00:01:56,099 --> 00:02:02,158
been covering over the last year and

51
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,979
really what's been getting us like out

52
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,520
there and known and you know in a lot of

53
00:02:04,978 --> 00:02:10,500
media a lot the last year we've you know

54
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,000
I've it's funny because we used to do a

55
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,060
lot of media for

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,620
you know D Crim medical legal the

57
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,900
initiatives and then when everything

58
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,640
passed it was like the corporations were

59
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,520
getting all the media not us the

60
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:25,559
activists uh but the last year it's just

61
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,360
totally changed uh based on the worker

62
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,039
issue especially

63
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,020
very good yeah you guys have definitely

64
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,759
made a name for yourself for sure the

65
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,580
first topic I want to talk about was an

66
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:37,318
overview of Massachusetts and can you

67
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,060
maybe give everybody a quick little

68
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:41,818
review of what's the size of the market

69
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,280
what's the medical cannabis market look

70
00:02:41,818 --> 00:02:45,539
like in that state and any pertinent

71
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,620
information you think everybody would

72
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:49,859
like to know

73
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:52,640
uh I mean we've had billions of sales on

74
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:56,819
the adult use you know Massachusetts

75
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:59,098
2008 we did decriminalized cannabis like

76
00:02:56,818 --> 00:03:00,659
that was overnight just amazing to see

77
00:02:59,098 --> 00:03:02,340
it happen that was when I was involved

78
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:04,439
in Mass can

79
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,140
um and nobody here thought that could

80
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:09,539
happen like we we knew the poll numbers

81
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:12,299
had changed like

82
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:14,579
10 years before we wouldn't have won

83
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,260
that initiative but the people's mind

84
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,719
had changed about it we knew the poll

85
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:22,439
numbers we won that campaign two to one

86
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:25,259
you know 60 over 65 35 that was the

87
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:27,598
first one and then 2012 we did a medical

88
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:30,959
cannabis initiative and we won that one

89
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:34,139
as well uh so that changed the law to

90
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,900
allow people to have medical cards to

91
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:38,179
grow their own cannabis and also to buy

92
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,519
from stores

93
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:43,920
unfortunately it didn't really give us a

94
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,200
lot of options uh in terms of caregivers

95
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:48,598
and it was really large big Cannabis

96
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:51,119
stores that opened with a people that

97
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:55,158
had a lot of money millions of dollars

98
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,900
and that's when we did legalization

99
00:03:55,158 --> 00:04:01,079
2016. and every single one of these

100
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,819
initiatives was funded by Big Money uh

101
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,459
marijuana policy project a National

102
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:08,939
Organization so the locals we were

103
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:11,340
limited on you know what we what what

104
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:13,919
actually you know we wanted to to be

105
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,539
included in those initiatives and one of

106
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:18,418
the things that we did make sure that we

107
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:20,399
added was the option for people to do

108
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:22,620
the home cultivation and and that's

109
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,478
become a big fight so the best thing

110
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:28,259
about Massachusetts is that we can grow

111
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:30,839
a you know six plants per person 12 in a

112
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:33,180
household so if you you know have a home

113
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:34,560
a private residence you can grow inside

114
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,600
of it

115
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,418
um if you're a legal adult and so that's

116
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,300
great but again it's been mostly big

117
00:04:39,418 --> 00:04:45,719
cannabis uh that's been strides with

118
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:47,639
Equity to allow uh smaller players into

119
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,500
the market it's starting to work I

120
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:51,900
believe but there's still a lot of

121
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,879
issues and there's a lot of bad

122
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:56,758
investment in the Cannabis space so it's

123
00:04:53,879 --> 00:05:00,300
really hard for smaller players to open

124
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:02,780
now and actually survive because they're

125
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,460
competing against big companies

126
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:08,039
that have over

127
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:10,258
you know they've over invested and so

128
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,939
like we look at truly who's leaving the

129
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:14,699
state right now they're closing down

130
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:17,639
we've been you know on them they're the

131
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:19,620
largest uh cannabis company in Florida

132
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,418
the medical cannabis they own that

133
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,879
market and they came to Massachusetts

134
00:05:21,418 --> 00:05:25,620
and they didn't do well and uh they

135
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:28,199
actually one of their employees died on

136
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,579
the job we covered that extensively and

137
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:31,079
truly if one of the largest companies

138
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:33,659
has decided to move out of Massachusetts

139
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:36,180
which is a you know Massachusetts isn't

140
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:38,039
a big is a big geography wise but it's

141
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,379
not too small I mean we got western Mass

142
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:42,120
too eastern part of the state has really

143
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:44,159
built up a lot of suburbs and they get

144
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,538
the you know city of Boston even in

145
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,820
Central Mass you got the city of

146
00:05:45,538 --> 00:05:50,759
Worcester there's cities in Boston you

147
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:54,019
know all over Massachusetts so we have

148
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:56,160
uh you know an urban dense population

149
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:59,038
especially in the Eastern side of the

150
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,720
state and you know got about what I

151
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:03,418
think eight million people here you know

152
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,940
so there's a good population but a large

153
00:06:03,418 --> 00:06:07,079
company like truly pulled out and now

154
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:09,240
they're dumping all their product

155
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:13,800
they're dumping all their product at

156
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:15,840
like a like a you know once one maybe 25

157
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,720
of what you know they would normally

158
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:20,219
price so you know other companies are

159
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,660
having a hard time competing with that

160
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,699
with companies going out of business

161
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,020
doing and they're not the only ones a

162
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:27,060
lot of other companies too large

163
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:29,038
companies so you have kind of an over

164
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,259
saturation at this point prices are

165
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:32,759
dropping which is good but a lot of the

166
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:34,919
product still sucks

167
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:37,379
um myself I'm a medical patient

168
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:39,418
I have a medical cannabis card in the

169
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:41,699
state of Maine they allow you to

170
00:06:39,418 --> 00:06:45,060
actually uh go up there

171
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:46,800
any any you know State resident from any

172
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,978
statement you know in the country can

173
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,780
drive to Maine or fly into Maine and get

174
00:06:49,978 --> 00:06:53,279
served in their medical cannabis program

175
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:55,559
and why would I do that when

176
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:57,659
Massachusetts is legal because their

177
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,459
program is so much better and the reason

178
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:02,039
that program is better is because they

179
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:05,399
allowed thousands of smaller caregivers

180
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:07,560
to open up there with little red tape no

181
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:08,939
millions of dollars and so what you have

182
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,740
is you have more like a farmer's market

183
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:14,339
you have better product better service

184
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:16,319
better quality I I talked to the guy you

185
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:19,079
know who runs the business that I go to

186
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,699
up there all the time like I'm in direct

187
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:22,379
contact with him all the time you're not

188
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:24,180
going to find that in a big dispensary

189
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:26,759
you know big dispensary chain in

190
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,800
Massachusetts so there's a big

191
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:29,819
difference I think in uh what we're

192
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,939
talking about when we talk about

193
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:34,500
legalization Massachusetts did not do it

194
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:36,899
right I feel like except for the

195
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,120
homegirl they're trying to correct it

196
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:40,918
they're trying to fix it now and I think

197
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,978
there's a great opportunity to actually

198
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:46,439
fix it but I think the bureaucracy and

199
00:07:43,978 --> 00:07:48,478
the invested interests make it very

200
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:50,639
difficult to do so here

201
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:52,560
very interesting and we see over here in

202
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,759
Europe This Home grow might be getting

203
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,519
allowed in a number of different

204
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,740
countries to let's say placate the

205
00:07:56,519 --> 00:08:01,198
activist side of the thing do you think

206
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:03,120
it's viable for patients to be able to

207
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,360
grow their own home do you see it yeah

208
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,098
successful yeah yes but it's limited you

209
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,620
know especially like where I live in

210
00:08:08,098 --> 00:08:12,538
Massachusetts they made the law so that

211
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,879
you know you can only do it at residence

212
00:08:12,538 --> 00:08:16,860
you can't at your your residence so you

213
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,259
like you can't rent out a space at a

214
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,060
U-Haul or maybe a medical you know

215
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:23,819
facility that wants to rent you space to

216
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,680
grow you can't do that so you know most

217
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:27,598
people in Massachusetts are either

218
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,259
renters they live in dorms they live in

219
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:32,580
government housing so most landlords are

220
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:33,599
not going to allow you to grow in your

221
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:37,200
home

222
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,759
so you have to own your home and even if

223
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,919
you own a condo a lot of times there's

224
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:43,559
Condo Association rules against you too

225
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:44,939
so there's a lot of instances when you

226
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:47,039
know if you're living especially in

227
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:49,260
government housing you know your elderly

228
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,299
housing those folks aren't generally

229
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:53,939
allowed to grow in their home so it's

230
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:55,679
limited I'm gonna say that it does help

231
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:58,080
a lot of people I think it's definitely

232
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:00,479
something that everyone should you know

233
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,519
have in any law that they pass that you

234
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,500
need a home grow but I want to go beyond

235
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:05,879
that because that the mistake that we

236
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,759
made at Massachusetts we thought

237
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:10,980
homegirl was enough not enough what you

238
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:14,458
really need is to allow everyone to open

239
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:16,680
if you're not licensing somebody within

240
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:18,719
six months or less that's what the state

241
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:20,519
of Maine does people want to get

242
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,820
licensed from the medical Market they

243
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:25,440
can get licensed usually in 30 days

244
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:27,959
Massachusetts it takes three to five

245
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,420
years and during that three to five year

246
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:32,879
period you're paying for Consultants you

247
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:35,759
have to actually rent or own the

248
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:37,320
property that you're hoping in three to

249
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:40,080
five years that the state and the city

250
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,200
will allow you to actually open in so

251
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,940
the rents in Massachusetts are

252
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,560
astronomical so I know folks who have

253
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,660
been spending ten thousand dollars

254
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:51,899
twenty thousand dollars five thousand

255
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:53,159
you name them amount a month for five

256
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:55,679
years

257
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:57,179
they're bankrupt and they're still not

258
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,859
allowed to open and they're going to

259
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:01,500
close before they even get to open this

260
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:03,180
happens all the time in Massachusetts so

261
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,399
what you end up with is these big

262
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:07,620
predatory corporations

263
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:09,839
that have all the money and they you

264
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,100
know have all the real estate but they

265
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,899
don't care about their workers they

266
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:16,080
don't care about the product the quality

267
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:18,299
sucks and in cannabis especially this is

268
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:21,360
a plant that needs love it needs the

269
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:23,338
smaller batches is better so that's why

270
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,959
I drive to Maine the prices are almost

271
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:26,399
comparable now in that made in

272
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:29,819
Massachusetts but why do I go to Maine

273
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:33,360
product is so much better and you've got

274
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:35,339
to allow smaller folks to open and I say

275
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,200
call it caregivers that's what Maine did

276
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:39,660
they license thousands of caregivers

277
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,300
first they have three thousand it's a

278
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:44,519
small state up in Maine 3 000 legal

279
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:46,559
caregivers in the state of Maine

280
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:48,299
and Massachusetts we might have a couple

281
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:50,879
hundred corporations here large

282
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:53,759
corporations that's the difference when

283
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:56,220
you have and then Maine you know they

284
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:58,620
did the 3 000 caregivers first they

285
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:00,000
license them first and then five to ten

286
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,459
years later they let the larger

287
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,799
corporations in in Massachusetts we did

288
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:07,619
the opposite we said larger corporations

289
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:10,559
first and I think that's a mistake and I

290
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:12,600
think that every state every nation has

291
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:15,179
to consider that when you're shutting

292
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,680
out your local people this is one of my

293
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:18,059
friends lives in the city of Malden

294
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:20,278
Massachusetts he's been trying to open

295
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:22,919
in his City

296
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:25,019
for years now and now he's had to sue

297
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:27,599
the city of Malden and what did the city

298
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:30,959
of Malden do they decided to license out

299
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,879
of state out of town larger bigger

300
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,619
players with more money and that's what

301
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:36,600
we see over and over again and those

302
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,399
folks don't care about the quality of

303
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,079
the product they don't care about the

304
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,980
safety of their employees

305
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:45,838
so that's my advice is homegirl and

306
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,339
license everybody license everybody as

307
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,620
quickly as possible

308
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,519
okay very interesting next topic I want

309
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,220
to begin to was the Massachusetts

310
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:55,078
cannabis Control Commission how does

311
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,180
this stock open we already talked to the

312
00:11:55,078 --> 00:11:59,819
director of Oklahoma's version of this

313
00:11:57,179 --> 00:12:01,379
the director from Colorado's version We

314
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,480
Know New York seemed to be the golden

315
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:05,159
child with their acquired licenses and

316
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,839
all this kind of stuff how are the guys

317
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:09,240
at the Cannabis Control Commission in

318
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:11,899
Massachusetts stocking up on a on a

319
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,899
nationwide level

320
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,019
I don't think they're stacking up like I

321
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:18,539
I don't think they could compete with

322
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:21,000
Maine's medical cannabis program

323
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:23,219
I mean that that says it all I mean

324
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,200
whoever designed that medical cannabis

325
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,360
program in Maine they deserve the award

326
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,278
on the East Coast and uh Massachusetts

327
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,320
it seems like they get a lot of Praise

328
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:33,059
it's like you know because they have

329
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,980
created billions of dollars of Revenue

330
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:37,559
but I feel like that's a drop in the

331
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:40,079
buck bucket we we could have had so much

332
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:43,199
more Revenue if they had just licensed

333
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:45,500
everybody you know so I feel like May uh

334
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,240
Maine is leading their medical program

335
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:50,578
and Massachusetts is trying to catch up

336
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,919
you know that's that's how I feel I feel

337
00:12:50,578 --> 00:12:54,359
like and I feel like unfortunately a lot

338
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:57,299
of states have looked at Massachusetts

339
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:00,778
being one of the earliest and not looked

340
00:12:57,299 --> 00:13:02,278
at me so there are a lot of states have

341
00:13:00,778 --> 00:13:04,740
modeled themselves after the

342
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:07,439
Massachusetts model which it's not

343
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:10,200
working you know even the equity stuff

344
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,300
it doesn't work real Equity is licensing

345
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,940
everybody you know if you give everyone

346
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:17,278
an opportunity and it doesn't cost

347
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:19,980
millions of dollars that's Equity you

348
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:22,019
know it and how about you know no

349
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:24,720
taxation or people who are arrested too

350
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:26,278
like these are the equity proposals that

351
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,259
I don't see that are very frustrating

352
00:13:26,278 --> 00:13:30,480
you know I think that we should be

353
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:33,059
rewarding the folks like even myself I'm

354
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,800
a white guy you know I was arrested why

355
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:36,719
should I have to pay tax on adult use

356
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:39,479
like you know you want to give Equity

357
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:43,740
think of new ideas that touch more

358
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:45,659
people than just a few Rich folks who uh

359
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:48,000
have the right demographics

360
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:49,439
okay so over in Ireland we have a

361
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,578
Citizens assembly happening at the

362
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,079
moment that hopefully is going to come

363
00:13:50,578 --> 00:13:54,899
back with some positive recommendations

364
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:56,819
for decriminalizing or even legalizing

365
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:58,500
cannabis so the top kind of three

366
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,778
takeaways that we should be looking at

367
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,159
are small grow works better than large

368
00:14:00,778 --> 00:14:04,559
grow

369
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:06,419
um open to everybody and a limited time

370
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:08,399
frame to apply for a licenses or

371
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:10,319
anything else that I'm missing no I

372
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,539
think that's it you know and I think uh

373
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,959
you know taxation too should be

374
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:14,958
reasonable

375
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:21,480
yeah you know and I think that

376
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:23,939
cutting in locals is a good idea but

377
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,860
don't you know be very one of the issues

378
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:28,620
we had in Massachusetts is that the law

379
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:31,339
was so ambiguous and it was changed by

380
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:33,899
the state leaders after we passed it

381
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:36,300
that there's a lot of questions about

382
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:38,159
how much tax this the local towns could

383
00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:40,979
actually take and there's been a lot of

384
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:44,159
lawsuits and fights about that too so I

385
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:46,860
would be very specific about taxation

386
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:48,899
you know and limit it don't don't you

387
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,940
know give them something though you know

388
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:53,100
I think a local city or town should get

389
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,360
something for opening and Maine I love

390
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,920
what Maine does that you know for

391
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,360
medical cannabis I go back to their

392
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:59,819
medical cannabis program in Maine

393
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,500
there's no state tax on the medical

394
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,420
which you know I don't think there

395
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,100
should ever be tax on medical cannabis

396
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:07,078
but if you're going to do it do it like

397
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:10,379
Maine does because there's a small

398
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:12,359
little local tax little city tax it's

399
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:15,179
like less than five percent

400
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:18,000
on the medical sale so it kind of

401
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:20,939
incentivizes the cities and towns to uh

402
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,679
allow it and take the revenue

403
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:24,300
Mike it's been great talking to you if
