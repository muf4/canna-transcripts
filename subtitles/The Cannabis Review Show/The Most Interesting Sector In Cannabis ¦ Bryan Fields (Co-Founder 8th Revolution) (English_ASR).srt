1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:04,439
foreign

2
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,399
I'm doing well excited to be here and

3
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,640
excited to dive into the conversation

4
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,659
with you

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,940
hopefully we can get some information

6
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,799
across

7
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:36,539
so can we start real quick quickly how

8
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:39,299
you ended up co-founding eight

9
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:40,979
Revolution and your your endpoint to the

10
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:43,799
Cannabis industry please

11
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:45,479
sure so uh in my previous life I was

12
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:47,399
sales and marketing for an analytical

13
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:48,839
instrumentation company where my

14
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,460
responsibilities were to grow and

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,440
develop marketing channels as well as

16
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,480
business development relation channels

17
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:56,759
into new markets we were experiencing

18
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,799
oil and gas pharmaceutical food and Bev

19
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:00,719
and one of the new tasks was entered a

20
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,959
new market where I was asked to explore

21
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,960
the Cannabis market so in 2018 I set off

22
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,060
to MJ bizcon where my eyes were wide

23
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:11,699
open and I was ecstatic with the speed

24
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,859
and the opportunity of the industry and

25
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,840
uh fell in love with what was happening

26
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:17,579
and decided to link up with one of the

27
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,960
people I met at that joke Kellen Finney

28
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:22,200
who was actually speaking at the

29
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:24,059
conference and from there we decided

30
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,740
that we wanted to see the industry a

31
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,659
certain way which is an analytical focus

32
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:29,280
and we wanted to bring real-time quality

33
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:33,479
control sensors to the Cannabis industry

34
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:36,359
and decided to form eighth Revolution

35
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:38,519
okay incredible so a web information

36
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:40,560
coming from and from sector that applies

37
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:42,359
a lot of cannabis industry but can you

38
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,640
maybe tell everybody a little bit to Die

39
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:46,799
My podcast you guys have you've gone

40
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,900
great guesses I find that these are

41
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,939
great data Gathering tools do you

42
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,340
viewers yourself

43
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:54,959
yeah I appreciate that so the dime is

44
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,180
our is our weekly podcast where we

45
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:59,039
explore all things cannabis and I think

46
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,200
the dime has been the greatest unlocker

47
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,939
from a networking standpoint the ability

48
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,500
to connect with individuals and and

49
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:05,938
spend time with them and then ask them

50
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,739
the why behind they make certain

51
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:10,139
decisions I think a lot of times

52
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:12,359
especially in nowadays we rush to make

53
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:14,159
judgments when we see headlines but we

54
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,900
don't really understand the macro on the

55
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:17,818
why that these Executives make certain

56
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,680
decisions and that's really the primary

57
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:21,839
focus on the dime is to really

58
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,939
understand the true why these Executives

59
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,520
or these leading researchers are making

60
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:29,120
specific strategic decisions on how they

61
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:32,219
go about their day-to-day I do

62
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,219
okay very interesting so I want to start

63
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:37,080
off basically as new what are two things

64
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:39,180
about four different quick topics so

65
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,239
it's got things that you specialize in

66
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,280
so first is like license acquisition for

67
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,659
anybody looking to open up their own

68
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,759
business what's what's more important

69
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:50,098
for license like acquisition consulting

70
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:52,859
company like yourself or legal expertise

71
00:02:50,098 --> 00:02:55,679
which Step comes first for the entire

72
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,900
with the church around the license

73
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,760
I think they work hand in hand I think

74
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,140
relationships are really Paramount in

75
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:02,759
this space and making sure that you get

76
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,979
off on the right foot is really critical

77
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:06,899
so we work very closely with a lot of

78
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:09,238
law firms where we specialize in this

79
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,800
area to ensure that we work hand in hand

80
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,239
with the clients to make sure that

81
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,700
everyone's operating at the same speed

82
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,700
so unfortunately the the de facto answer

83
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:19,979
is both

84
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:23,098
thank you very much next one is facility

85
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:26,098
design is there a specific architecture

86
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:28,139
companies uh that work now specifically

87
00:03:26,098 --> 00:03:31,018
solely cannabis or do or do you really

88
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:34,378
find companies that good fine dining in

89
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:36,239
Real uh buildings and complexes are the

90
00:03:34,378 --> 00:03:37,919
wearables that are for the Cannabis of

91
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,539
the same at the moment

92
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,339
uh I couldn't really hear the end of

93
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:42,479
that but I can make some assumptions on

94
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,519
the true direction of the facility

95
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:46,859
design and what we found is that certain

96
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,259
layouts and procedures help with the

97
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:51,420
optimization of the flow of the process

98
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:53,519
and just putting those necessary steps

99
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:55,798
in line allows for the operator to not

100
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,840
have to go backwards and to take let's

101
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:59,700
say reverse steps that are more costly

102
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,500
and expensive which could set back a

103
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:03,000
facility you know a large amount of

104
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,519
money if they're looking to take certain

105
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,299
steps let's say like cgmp or to do other

106
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,580
uh profit maximization in the future

107
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:13,200
very very good thank you very much so so

108
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,900
put your if you can't hear me just just

109
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:18,478
let go so this question is on equipped

110
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,858
selection now is this something if you

111
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,620
were single company only has another

112
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:25,019
Mantra would you specifically hire some

113
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,720
expertise is in the field working with a

114
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:30,060
kind of benefit or is it just any uh

115
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,280
let's say engineer or a highly

116
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,199
intelligent individual could move over

117
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:35,879
or understand pretty quickly what the

118
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,978
equipment is

119
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:39,240
I I I'm sorry I couldn't make that one

120
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:41,879
out

121
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,840
so let me just start this again so

122
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:44,839
equipment selection

123
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:54,000
is in in expertise required in choosing

124
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:57,439
using a quint or is it some entrepreneur

125
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,439
could learn to read

126
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,540
um that's a great question I think an

127
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,860
entrepreneur can can figure it out

128
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,080
through their own I think one of the

129
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,000
things that special needs for us is that

130
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:07,319
my partner kill Infinity's got extensive

131
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,418
background in the various different

132
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:11,639
attraction space so he's understanding

133
00:05:09,418 --> 00:05:13,500
the variables on what is the end product

134
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:15,840
and then likes to work badly through

135
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,939
exactly what the the client is looking

136
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,079
to create so I think it is possible that

137
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:20,779
an entrepreneur can get their hands

138
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:24,180
dirty and do it themselves but again

139
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:26,459
selecting equipment is necessary earlier

140
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,918
on and and making a step like cgmp might

141
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:30,299
be overlooked or if if let's say the end

142
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:31,859
goal is differently from what we're

143
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,780
expecting to produce you want to make

144
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,439
sure that the the beginning steps align

145
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:38,879
with that end goal

146
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:42,478
brilliant and and the last one in this

147
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:44,519
topic optimization process it's one of

148
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:46,918
those big hurdles a lottery called

149
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:49,799
company come across like again is this

150
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:51,959
something that in-house Houston can be a

151
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,660
tank or is it always was going outside

152
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:57,000
and equities is the better and Superior

153
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,320
option in that process

154
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,300
I mean that's a great question and

155
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,800
really depends on the operator I think

156
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,960
the most important thing that we found

157
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,939
is that data is King and understanding

158
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:07,978
which variables are controlling that

159
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:09,899
optimization parameters and allowing

160
00:06:07,978 --> 00:06:11,819
insights into real time in order to

161
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:13,079
maximize your profit is really the

162
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:15,000
driven goal so if you're not really

163
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:16,379
understanding which variables are

164
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,819
influencing your output it's really

165
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:20,100
going to be hard in order to lock down

166
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:21,478
that optimization what we've seen is a

167
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,220
big margin compression everyone's

168
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:24,839
talking about a race to the bottom and

169
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,220
instead of figuring out hey let's raise

170
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:28,079
our prices and push it back in the

171
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,880
consumer another way to approach that is

172
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:31,258
to look inwards and to figure out what

173
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:33,000
are cogs and where can we make

174
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:34,979
influences to really drive down our

175
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,959
internal calls so that we can maximize

176
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:39,500
our profit and therefore optimization of

177
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:39,500
that process

178
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:52,379
section I wanted to move on today is the

179
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:55,919
most interesting sect of cannabis now as

180
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:59,279
we know uh technically advancing rapidly

181
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:01,318
every year where do you see is going to

182
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:03,779
be the most directing interesting sector

183
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:05,879
of cannabis since now today and and in

184
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:08,159
five years time

185
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:09,478
wow at five years time is really hard to

186
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,100
tell especially with the industry and

187
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:12,599
the way it's operating now I think it's

188
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,280
going to be technology again I think

189
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,960
people are going to dig an inwards Focus

190
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:18,119
they're going to adopt outside industry

191
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:20,219
technology process analytical technology

192
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,199
is one that obviously with my background

193
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:24,180
I'm pretty confident it's going to move

194
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:25,860
to the space it's in pharmaceutical it's

195
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,019
in oil and gas it's in food and beverage

196
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,939
it's exactly the type of equipment that

197
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:32,159
will help consistency and product line

198
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:34,139
across state by state so that when you

199
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,660
do grab a product in New York it's very

200
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:39,439
similar or not close or exactly the same

201
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,439
as the one in California

202
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:46,199
very good do you succeed biotech

203
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:48,060
technology overtaking a large show of

204
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,740
the Cabbage industry district one of

205
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:51,959
these bio company biotechnology

206
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,579
companies have gotten their cell lines

207
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:56,758
and they're in their large quantities

208
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:59,399
that they can manufacture to specific uh

209
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:02,240
price point and an exact yield like like

210
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:06,239
the pens adults

211
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,879
creams tinctures oils potentially come

212
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,220
from the biotechnology sort of bigger

213
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,620
harvests more free frequent harvest the

214
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:15,840
price points Point going to be lower do

215
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,459
you see that and then at that scenario

216
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:19,739
any updates or do you think you think

217
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:21,959
new methods of extraction are going to

218
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:24,319
be able to keep with the biotechnology

219
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,318
sector

220
00:08:24,418 --> 00:08:28,620
it's uh it remains to be seen I I

221
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:30,538
wouldn't feel confident speaking on that

222
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,219
that is outside of my expertise that

223
00:08:30,538 --> 00:08:33,958
would really lead into my partner Kellen

224
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:35,339
Finney or who could expand on those but

225
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:37,199
I don't know it sounds like it's

226
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:38,520
possible but again in this space though

227
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,140
speed and everything is moving it's

228
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:41,699
really challenging to recognize you know

229
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:44,699
what is possible what is really going to

230
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:47,339
happen in the short and near term

231
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:50,940
yeah very much agreed what is the most

232
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:55,680
exciting thing over like 12 once you

233
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:57,779
look for seeing in in your territory

234
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:59,819
I'm excited to see how New York rolls

235
00:08:57,778 --> 00:09:01,679
out their cannabis Market uh it's a big

236
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,600
ask what they're doing and it's a big

237
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:06,179
Challenge and a lot of the msos have

238
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,220
shown some frustration and we we're

239
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:09,838
interested to seeing if it's possible to

240
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,580
what they are able to achieve I know

241
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,600
some people have casted their doubts and

242
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,040
I think one of the things that

243
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,680
fascinates me most is that we're going

244
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:18,360
to get a live case study on exactly what

245
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:20,099
is possible and what is not when opening

246
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,959
up a massive market and limiting certain

247
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,879
the entrants coming in and how they plan

248
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:26,299
on rolling out that market in the next

249
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:27,860
eight to 12 months

250
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:30,179
[Music]

251
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:32,700
mergers and Acquisitions being a big

252
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:34,859
part over the decal of 18 months or it

253
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,660
would only be when Fair legalization

254
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,879
happens they will start to see am an

255
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:41,039
activity

256
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,419
I I think over the next eight to 12

257
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,980
months you might see some merges and

258
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:46,259
Acquisitions but more of the distressed

259
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:49,379
assets I expect to see some of the the

260
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:51,360
smaller operators maybe maybe pass

261
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:53,458
through and get acquired for sure to

262
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,440
cheat multiples I expect that to be the

263
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:56,639
case but again with the capital markets

264
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,140
operating the way they are I think

265
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,179
people will be a little more hesitant to

266
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:01,620
deploy and my understanding is that a

267
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:03,419
lot of these larger companies will look

268
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:05,100
inwards from an optimization standpoint

269
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:07,559
in order to hone in on their internal

270
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,540
efforts so that when the markets do move

271
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:11,159
in the other direction they're ready to

272
00:10:09,539 --> 00:10:13,019
scale faster again but they've really

273
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:14,819
honed in on the internal infrastructure

274
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:17,580
but it wouldn't surprise me if we saw

275
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:19,560
outside in Industry Titans continue to

276
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,120
try to migrate in obviously the word on

277
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:23,039
the street right now is Big tobacco and

278
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,720
everyone's kind of yes or no depending

279
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:27,179
on how your strategy is and if it's good

280
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,519
or if it's bad it remains to be seen on

281
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:31,319
how that works but some may think it's

282
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,179
pretty disruptive Others May think it's

283
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,800
a it's a pretty opening invitation from

284
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:37,620
the joint

285
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:41,039
pretty interesting and do you think the

286
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:42,899
current selection of MMO in America are

287
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:45,838
to be the dominant versus in a few years

288
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:49,200
time or has the most successful cannabis

289
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:51,540
company in Erica still yeah

290
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,259
oh that one's a good one

291
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:54,659
um

292
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:57,120
give me a second to think about that

293
00:10:54,659 --> 00:10:59,519
ah it depends right it depends if the US

294
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,919
gets locked into the U.S market because

295
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,539
from our understanding right now if we

296
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:05,699
haven't federally legalized it we will

297
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:07,740
not be involved in global conversations

298
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,899
at a World level so if we are not

299
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,759
partaking in those conversations the U.S

300
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:13,440
companies might be locked in and might

301
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:15,059
have to take creative approaches to

302
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,680
outside Partnerships we've seen Cheryl

303
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:18,539
Leaf do it we've seen a couple others

304
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:19,979
expand overseas but right now they're

305
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:22,019
pretty much like independent entities

306
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,459
which don't allow companies to operate

307
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:26,278
with the economies of scale that really

308
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:27,719
what the everyday investors used to

309
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:28,919
seeing from a numbers standpoint as

310
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,959
you've seen with these larger companies

311
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:34,019
outside of cannabis

312
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:36,000
yeah we we've seen some of the the mssos

313
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:38,278
take an interest in your Europe ready

314
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,700
truly leaves the acquisition of 420

315
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:44,458
Pharma being one of the latest do you

316
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:47,278
think that that uh an American aiding

317
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:49,739
companies are looking at Europe with

318
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:51,659
blinker and thinking that took it is

319
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,940
there for the taking or do you believe

320
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:57,120
there's going to be European cannabis

321
00:11:53,940 --> 00:12:00,360
companies not only to thrive but moved

322
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,039
to America to take it to that market too

323
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,720
so for the companies that we've spoken

324
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:05,039
with directly on those questions they

325
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,139
think there's a ton of meat in the bone

326
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:09,000
still here in America with with major

327
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:11,399
markets still not opening up and limit

328
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,679
it's the capital capital they're looking

329
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:15,839
internally right now on on States like

330
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:18,000
Florida and Texas Alabama North Carolina

331
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,680
potentially Pennsylvania and Maryland in

332
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,299
the next two years so I think they're

333
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:22,799
looking internally right now with an eye

334
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:24,359
on the future but they're pretty

335
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:26,159
confident that there is a lot of meat on

336
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,860
the bone internally and then I think

337
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:30,419
they look for a global landscape but I I

338
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:32,459
think right now the focus is going to be

339
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:34,379
currently on internally expanding uh

340
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:36,299
locally and domestically with the focus

341
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:37,740
on let's say internationally over the

342
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:40,500
next two to five years

343
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:44,039
course interesting if you had a hundred

344
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:46,379
dollars to put on IMs I was stuck would

345
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:49,078
you be thrown in your money

346
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:50,700
oh I'm gonna make a couple people pretty

347
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:55,219
angry at that one

348
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:55,220
um there's no really good choices

349
00:12:57,299 --> 00:13:00,599
um which is my favorite uh I really like

350
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:04,559
true leave

351
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:07,079
um GTI I'm a big fan of Ben Ben as well

352
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:08,638
um it's hard to tell it's still so early

353
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:10,259
in the market but there's there's

354
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,180
certain things that certain operators do

355
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:14,159
that I like more than others and there's

356
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:15,439
more strategic efforts that I like that

357
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:17,759
others do as well so for example

358
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,920
tarasen's got a very uh limited

359
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:21,600
footprint but it's very very strategic

360
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:23,338
in the markets they're attacking so

361
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,980
maybe over the next two to five years

362
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:27,360
there they start to rise in in growth

363
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,980
and start competing with the bigger one

364
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,278
truly if it's right now dominating

365
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:34,200
Florida but Florida is is a smaller

366
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:36,059
Market of its own in comparison to like

367
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,160
a global landslave so when Florida turns

368
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:40,018
true leaves numbers can be massive but

369
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:41,819
as if they open up that market then

370
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:43,679
truly's numbers might disappear so it's

371
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:45,778
hard to feel to really feel super

372
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,578
confident on anyone I think the craziest

373
00:13:45,778 --> 00:13:49,078
part about the Cannabis industry as a

374
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:50,578
whole is that the way the Cannabis

375
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,958
industry operates now everyone has their

376
00:13:50,578 --> 00:13:53,638
cards and think about from a card game

377
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:55,259
standpoint eventually Federal

378
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:56,700
legalization interstate commerce will

379
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:58,139
come about and everyone will have to

380
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:00,240
re-deal their cards in and then

381
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:01,680
redistribute their assets because these

382
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,360
vertical integration assets that are

383
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:05,759
happening now don't allow for economies

384
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,440
of scale and don't allow for a sharing

385
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:08,759
of knowledgeable confidence right we're

386
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,100
not really driving home price because

387
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:12,720
we're not able to have one massive Hub

388
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,339
of cultivation somewhere and then

389
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,620
dispersing the product elsewhere you've

390
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:18,779
got different states uh growing products

391
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,159
across the region which just makes more

392
00:14:18,778 --> 00:14:21,838
challenges for people right you don't

393
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,639
have one master girl overseeing the

394
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,320
entire operation you've got multiple

395
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:27,539
Master Growers which leads to more

396
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,339
challenges and more expenses and and

397
00:14:27,539 --> 00:14:30,899
more likely more hurdles and less

398
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:33,420
profits

399
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:36,120
yeah and it seems to be what 100 with

400
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:38,219
Canada we're around to this smaller

401
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,839
cultivars and the small backup operator

402
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:42,600
that wasn't taking a huge huge to the

403
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,339
shoe at the moment in the larger Korean

404
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,920
episodes are the ones struggling who

405
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:48,899
have fantasized about the size why is it

406
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:51,419
heals and the difficulties they've been

407
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:53,940
sold off or reflection we're doing the

408
00:14:51,419 --> 00:14:56,578
at the starting four electric ago on

409
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:58,139
cannabis tourism who do you think is the

410
00:14:56,578 --> 00:15:01,138
best cannabis kind of a tourism company

411
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:02,820
in the in most of America

412
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:04,320
that's a great question but I haven't

413
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:06,240
participated on any of those cannabis

414
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,760
tourism so I can't speak confidently on

415
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,278
them but I would Envision that the one

416
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:12,838
that involves education and experience

417
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:15,059
will be the one that can win and I'm

418
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:17,040
looking forward to experiencing the the

419
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:18,359
multiple different uh ones we've

420
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:19,860
interviewed and the different people we

421
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,860
spoke about that are excited to bring

422
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:25,079
cannabis tourism to A Whole New Life

423
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,579
yeah yeah so one thing I see in New York

424
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:28,559
in such a big Market because uh people

425
00:15:26,578 --> 00:15:31,919
take people are restorating how much

426
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:33,239
Europe are going to go to to see none of

427
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:34,919
this is legal and the amount of Revenue

428
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,720
that that's going to generate we've

429
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:38,879
