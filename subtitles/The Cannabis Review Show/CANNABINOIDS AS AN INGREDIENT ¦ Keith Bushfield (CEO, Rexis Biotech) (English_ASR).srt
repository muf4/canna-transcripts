[Music]

2
00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:11,759
welcome everybody to the next episode of

3
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:13,759
the Cannabis review I'm delighted to

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,118
join in this episode by Keat bushfield

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:19,320
who's the CEO Rex's biotech how you

6
00:00:16,118 --> 00:00:20,640
keeping today Kei good and yourself I'm

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,480
very well thank you very much thank you

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,080
for taking your time to do this can you

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,000
maybe give everybody a little overview

10
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:27,719
of your career today and how you found

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,039
yourself a rexus

12
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:31,358
biotech yeah it's you know serial

13
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:33,120
entrepreneur came out of school and

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,760
realized uh you know I didn't want to go

15
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:36,159
down a law school path I didn't want to

16
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:38,519
go down some of the things that I

17
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:40,959
thought were predetermined for me so I

18
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,600
really got in the entrepreneurial space

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,679
did a lot of different things and then I

20
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,039
started a biotech firm in

21
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:49,079
2009 and that managed to morph into

22
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:50,439
another thing and another thing

23
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,600
approached by a few different companies

24
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:55,079
to say what could we use our technology

25
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,518
or could we use our technology in

26
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:01,120
cannabis so we started to do some

27
00:00:57,518 --> 00:01:03,280
experimentation um and here we are so in

28
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:07,359
2002 or sorry

29
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,799
2022 uh rexis was founded um and it took

30
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:12,200
multiple Technologies from different uh

31
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:14,479
entities from different people put them

32
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,359
together to produce what we do today so

33
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:19,519
we are a biotech firm um that really

34
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:21,400
specializes in taking hydrophobic

35
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:24,039
molecules molecules that don't

36
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,680
assimilate in water and having them

37
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,960
assimilate in water so a thing like

38
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:31,680
cannabis is a perfect example uh we can

39
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:34,239
take that hydrob molecule stick it into

40
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,439
our process comes out the other end in a

41
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:39,599
fine white powder and that powder is now

42
00:01:36,438 --> 00:01:41,758
fully stable in water so we remove taste

43
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,719
smell a lot of the profiles that are

44
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,920
off-putting with cannabis but at the

45
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:47,319
same time keeping a lot of the

46
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:50,280
mechanisms for efficacy and so

47
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:51,718
forth so we kind of knew from the start

48
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,399
of the beverage side of the industry

49
00:01:51,718 --> 00:01:55,478
that the cannaboid molecules were either

50
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:57,599
sticking to aluminium or were settling

51
00:01:55,478 --> 00:01:59,280
in a specific part of the can so you

52
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:00,559
guys are part of this new wave of

53
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,478
Technology that's allowing the

54
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,118
cannaboids to distribute throughout the

55
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:09,239
product and give an exact kind of dosage

56
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:13,120
correct correct the biggest problem with

57
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:15,319
the I'll call it cannabis beverages 1.0

58
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,000
or 2.0 or three we're probably on to you

59
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:19,399
know round 20 by now but the original

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,318
companies the early companies either

61
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,879
just put oil into the beverage which is

62
00:02:21,318 --> 00:02:24,759
just like salad dressing Salad

63
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:27,199
addressing oil in water it floats to the

64
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:29,359
top doesn't assimilate tastes terrible

65
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:30,919
all the things that are bad with that

66
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,959
then they got more sophisticated and

67
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:35,399
they use sonification High Shear a whole

68
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:37,640
bunch of different things that have been

69
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,039
in the pharmaceutical industry for years

70
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:42,719
problem is it used a surfactant so a

71
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:44,719
surfactant is basically just a chemical

72
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,479
some are more organic base than others

73
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,719
but it's still just a chemical you use

74
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,679
that surfactant to bond the molecule to

75
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,919
water so it's just an artificial way to

76
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,040
hold it together the problem with

77
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:56,919
surfactants they come apart so they

78
00:02:55,039 --> 00:03:00,000
don't hold very well it doesn't take

79
00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:01,839
long for them to separate so the other e

80
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,680
the other issue with those is the flavor

81
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,920
is very off-putting that chemical that

82
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,719
goes in there uh it's hard to deal with

83
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:11,079
so in the old days you would get colas

84
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:14,120
or root beer or other coffee things to

85
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:17,719
try and hide the Cannabis flavor so with

86
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:20,239
our technology we use our trade name is

87
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:23,199
fused polymorph nanofiber so we make a

88
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,519
co- Crystal of the Cannabis molecule so

89
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:28,158
we make multiple molecules fused

90
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,158
together in a permanent fuse so they

91
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:32,079
don't come apart so you can take our

92
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:33,199
ingredient put it into water put it into

93
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,680
a beverage or whatever you're going to

94
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:39,158
use put it into food uh and it will not

95
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,400
separate over time so we've got uh

96
00:03:39,158 --> 00:03:43,840
pharmaceutical studies twoyear stability

97
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,400
in water without separation so pretty

98
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,120
well unheard of in the industry and

99
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:51,480
that's I think why our um path to growth

100
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,319
has been so fast because we have this

101
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:55,518
that's different than everybody else and

102
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:58,479
I think that's where the market needs to

103
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,239
go you know just like in every industry

104
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:02,158
we limp along until we make some

105
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,840
breakthroughs in different Industries or

106
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:05,400
different Technologies and so forth and

107
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,920
I think that's where we're at so we're

108
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,640
starting to see other companies dabble

109
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:13,119
and trying to make it better but uh you

110
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:15,919
know I the beverage space is where the

111
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,000
growth is happening uh the Cannabis has

112
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:19,478
been around in a bunch of different

113
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,600
Industries before this but it was

114
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:23,639
limited I think from technology but now

115
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,520
we've introduced this technology it's

116
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:28,400
growing at light

117
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:30,560
speed it seems to be the first wave of

118
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:33,719
the Canabis industry was

119
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,519
cultivated flour extraction equipment

120
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,880
and it's it doesn't seem that the first

121
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:38,599
mover Advantage is going to end up

122
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:40,519
working in this industry it seems to be

123
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,360
that the reluctance for a lot of big

124
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:45,038
Brands to get into this was a the

125
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,280
ingredient of a cannaboid where biotech

126
00:04:45,038 --> 00:04:47,918
companies are now are able to use

127
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:50,038
fermentation engineering to make this

128
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:51,758
molecule stfe Sable replicable over

129
00:04:50,038 --> 00:04:54,000
again and you guys are delivering the

130
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,240
mechanism for the distribution of the

131
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,720
product so would it be writing saying

132
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,840
that the future of the industry after

133
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,520
this wave is the brands the the people

134
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:04,198
who can come up at the brands tell the

135
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:06,439
stories and connect with their customer

136
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:08,280
bases uh I think you couldn't put it any

137
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:10,399
better I couldn't put in any better than

138
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:13,399
what you just said I've been preaching

139
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:16,239
this since

140
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:18,000
201617 there was this mad rush for

141
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,160
everybody to be cultivator oh we got a

142
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,839
license I spent a million dollars for

143
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,160
this one 10 million for that I got a

144
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:28,000
license I said from day one it's a

145
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,720
commodity as soon as we get economies a

146
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,560
scale whoever sells the best for the

147
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,639
cheapest amount of money will continue

148
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,639
to sell it and there will be zero profit

149
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,918
margin left I use this example take

150
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:42,038
Budweiser I have no idea who makes the

151
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:44,120
Hops or the grain or the sugar or the

152
00:05:42,038 --> 00:05:46,560
canning facil I don't know any of that

153
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,240
but I know Budweiser and I don't care

154
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,240
who made all the other stuff but the

155
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,639
brand is what is worth the money so you

156
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:57,079
have situations like Canada where Canada

157
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:59,840
eliminated branding and that was a big

158
00:05:57,079 --> 00:06:01,439
mistake for their industry because if

159
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:02,679
you can't if all the packages have to

160
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:05,279
look the same there's no branding

161
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:08,319
differentiation so branding of a product

162
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:10,279
in that scenario maybe is equal but in

163
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,919
the rest of the world or primarily in

164
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:16,318
the United States right now branding is

165
00:06:12,918 --> 00:06:17,839
starting to become the most key place so

166
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,560
we're starting to see branding that

167
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:22,359
doesn't look like the old cannabis

168
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,199
branding where you know somebody was

169
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,919
high and built that now it is fullon

170
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,879
like you know we we make products that

171
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:33,560
look like you know full retail off the

172
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:36,038
shelf Coca-Cola made this so it's

173
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,120
getting away from the oldfashioned way

174
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:40,240
building a brand that has a long life

175
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:43,720
building a brand that is resonates with

176
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:47,000
people and key which I think is the

177
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,479
brand is not a fringe anymore I had a

178
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,399
discussion with someone recently about

179
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:53,159
gummies and they said oh gummies are

180
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:55,478
outpaced beverages always will and I

181
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,560
said well I don't think so because

182
00:06:55,478 --> 00:06:58,918
gummies yes have been around for a long

183
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,800
time but gummies are associated with

184
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:03,038
children's vitamins or vitamins now

185
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,598
they're associated with cannabis and not

186
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:06,120
a lot of other things but when someone

187
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:07,800
says oh I had a gummy the first thing

188
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,680
comes to mind is oh I snuck a gummy and

189
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,598
I had cannabis with it the person that

190
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,720
doesn't know about cannabis and all that

191
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:17,560
has that reputation of or that image of

192
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:21,000
what cannabis and gummies are going to

193
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:23,879
be however if I give someone one of

194
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,959
these we've been drinking rtds ready to

195
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:29,080
drink beverages our entire lives I can

196
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:30,120
drink this this is now a transition

197
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:32,038
between between someone that's never

198
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,478
tried cannabis and someone that has

199
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:36,079
someone that can try 5 milligram dose

200
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:38,560
it's like drinking a beer it has a

201
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:41,399
slight intoxicating it's it's not crazy

202
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,000
you're not you know eating too because

203
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:45,198
the first one didn't work and looking at

204
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,720
purple dinosaurs 45 minutes later and

205
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:51,038
wondering what happened so we don't want

206
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,599
that the other thing is the old adage of

207
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:55,318
I want to get someone as high as I

208
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:56,918
possibly can we don't go by that we

209
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:58,520
don't build drinks that are more than

210
00:07:56,918 --> 00:08:00,399
five or 10 milligrams it's kind of our

211
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:03,399
own company model

212
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:05,439
and the big guys that we work with the

213
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:07,279
biggest alcohol brands in the world they

214
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:09,360
have said to us why would I possibly

215
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:11,638
want someone to have a 100 milligram

216
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,919
drink I want them to have five so I can

217
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:16,519
sell them five in an evening instead of

218
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:19,279
selling them one it makes no sense so

219
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:21,478
we're starting to see the old cannabis

220
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:23,279
religion of you know that that get

221
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:25,120
everybody's high as possible starting to

222
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,318
dissipate especially when it's come to

223
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,360
mainstream and that mainstream brings

224
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:31,360
the brands and I can tell you I can't

225
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,200
tell you who but I can tell you the

226
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,479
biggest brands we work with and they are

227
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:39,719
coming like a freight train and people

228
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,399
don't realize it yet but it all those

229
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,800
purists that were like oh keep the

230
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:46,600
Pepsis and cokes and an heisers out of

231
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:47,958
the business forget it that's coming and

232
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,320
that's coming

233
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:52,879
strong yeah and I seem to think most

234
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,560
people are overlooking that consumer 55

235
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:57,919
60 plus that actually are looking for

236
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:58,919
alternatives to the C current uh methods

237
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:00,559
that they're taking for various

238
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:02,000
different en ailments that the people

239
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:03,759
who can tell the brands to those stories

240
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,078
and as you said the micro does nobody

241
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:08,319
wants at that age to be uh feeling

242
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:10,639
uncomfortable after consuming a product

243
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,440
in any way shape or form absolutely

244
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:16,078
without question it's uh it's

245
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,760
a you know if there's two things that

246
00:09:16,078 --> 00:09:19,919
have changed and with our technology

247
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:22,720
that have really changed the market

248
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:24,360
speed to use the old days like I kind of

249
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,519
alluded there with the purple dinosaur

250
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,680
and you were so high you didn't know

251
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,560
what was going on a gummy hits 45

252
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:32,838
minutes later you know and some of these

253
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:34,719
companies are doing Nano fibers which we

254
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:38,399
have Nano in our name but that's just as

255
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,360
part of the process Nano 99.9% of the

256
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,799
time is just a bunch of BS you know it

257
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,959
doesn't mean anything they can't hold

258
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:47,439
that that Nano particle that size anyway

259
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:49,319
so some have come up with a better

260
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,000
faster way to make it work but not

261
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,600
really you know we did University of

262
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,958
Mississippi studies we did a bunch of

263
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,519
Trials to see how fast we could do this

264
00:09:54,958 --> 00:10:00,039
we got it in the bloodstream in less

265
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:02,200
than five minutes so you feel it

266
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:04,599
very quickly and that's the big thing

267
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,160
how can we control offset and offset so

268
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,879
if I can have a drink make it work

269
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:11,719
really fast I have a lower dose that's

270
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:16,039
going to change the industry in terms of

271
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:18,320
what people believe is a realistic dose

272
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:20,199
people aren't scared to try it they can

273
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,240
have that dose that be accurate every

274
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:25,440
single time and that is a big reason why

275
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,000
also the industry hasn't exploded yet

276
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,760
and I think that's where it's starting

277
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,200
to go because now the technology will

278
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:33,439
dick that the big Brands like that don't

279
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,720
have to worry that they can build a

280
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,320
brand they can build a product or so I

281
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,519
should say they can build a brand around

282
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,879
the technology that will be long term I

283
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:44,879
want to talk a little bit about your

284
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:46,600
fuse polymorph fiber technology can you

285
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:48,919
maybe explain a little bit what was the

286
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,959
time frame for or&amp; D it looks like it

287
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:54,319
was reading three years and uh was that

288
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:56,000
three successful years or three roller

289
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,160
coaster of emotion

290
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,480
years uh yeah I think they're always

291
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:02,399
roller coasters um you know we had some

292
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,800
aha moments along the way and I'd even

293
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,679
argue that it's been longer than three

294
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:07,319
years if you took all the little pieces

295
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:11,599
together

296
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:14,440
um the gist of that technology is we

297
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,120
went at it completely different than

298
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,200
everybody else went at it and I think

299
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:21,480
that's just probably from some sure luck

300
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,360
and ignorance as to what everybody else

301
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,399
was doing because I think if we as a

302
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,919
team knew what everybody else was doing

303
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:29,519
we would try to mimic that but because

304
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:31,958
we went into a blind

305
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,799
we went in for from a pharmaceutical

306
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:36,319
side a biotech side that said look I

307
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:38,199
don't think that other way works there's

308
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,120
got to be a better way to do it so yes

309
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:43,120
you had some trials tribulations we did

310
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:45,360
have some very immediate success not to

311
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,600
the degree that we have now so you know

312
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,159
it's like going to the casino and you

313
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,639
won right away you're going to stick

314
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:51,719
around a little bit longer and see how

315
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:54,759
it goes and so you know three four five

316
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:58,360
six years later you know here we are so

317
00:11:54,759 --> 00:12:00,759
um the nanofiber is without question a

318
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,639
game changer um I think people that know

319
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:04,679
us have used it have said how much

320
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,519
different it is the biggest issues with

321
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:09,919
an Emulsion as we talked about which is

322
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:12,278
what everybody but us uses in a beverage

323
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:14,360
it's basically just a liquid you took

324
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:16,879
cannabis and you put it in a

325
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:19,199
sonification device you made the

326
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:21,360
particles shatter a little bit you put a

327
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:22,838
surfactant with it put it with water and

328
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,159
you drop some of those drops in your

329
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,680
beverage mix it up and there you have it

330
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:30,000
within minutes it's stuck to the wall

331
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:31,759
within minutes it started degrade all of

332
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,559
the things that go with it and for the

333
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:36,078
entire time it tastes terrible it's hard

334
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:38,439
to hide that surfactant Flavor now I I

335
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:39,958
will go with some of our groups that are

336
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,839
out there we call them competitors we

337
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:43,879
don't really do what they do but you

338
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:47,680
know they've got better but they're not

339
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:50,159
there yet so ours is so much different

340
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:52,039
we take multiple molecules we fuse them

341
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:54,559
together they're permanently fused and

342
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:56,919
now they're stable you can take our

343
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:59,078
ingredient our powder stick it in a

344
00:12:56,919 --> 00:13:02,198
sealed bag so the oxygen doesn't get to

345
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:04,359
it two years later it has almost 100%

346
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:06,799
the potency it had before it started if

347
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:09,278
you take a distillate and do that you're

348
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:12,559
going to lose 30 40% in a matter of 30

349
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:14,439
to 45 days so we suspend that animation

350
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:16,759
you might call it so it can sit on that

351
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:19,120
shelf and wait and then used when it's

352
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:21,000
needed and when we put it into water we

353
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,759
get the same we had a six-month

354
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,919
stability test on THC in a can and we

355
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:29,679
lost about 4% in potency over six months

356
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:32,399
in a can I I want say the name I know

357
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:35,159
two larger players that they have to

358
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,399
overdose their cans before they get

359
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:39,958
tested and then they have to wait three

360
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:41,519
days then get it tested then on that

361
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:43,078
third or fourth day make sure they test

362
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,679
it so that it all comes up with the

363
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:48,679
right levels the problem is this one

364
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:50,239
company had something go wrong with

365
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:52,559
metric system they had to enter it into

366
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,560
the Cannabis system they had to retest

367
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:59,359
it and only seven days later it didn't

368
00:13:55,559 --> 00:14:01,319
pass because it degrades that fast F so

369
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,600
the consumer gets a beverage that says

370
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,519
it has 5

371
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:07,720
milligrams if they didn't buy that

372
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:10,120
beverage for 30 days the thing has like

373
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,920
maybe two milligrams in it so that's not

374
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,839
fair to the consumer either yeah it

375
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:17,120
passed testing when it left the lab but

376
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:19,279
that's the big thing too we don't have

377
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,198
those issues and I think that's what's

378
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:22,480
changing the industry too you know the

379
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:24,519
technology is starting to build the

380
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,120
brands that will get involved and that's

381
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:29,879
what makes that polymorph nanofiber so

382
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,120
different it's very exciting and I have

383
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:34,159
no doubt it's h going to be one for all
