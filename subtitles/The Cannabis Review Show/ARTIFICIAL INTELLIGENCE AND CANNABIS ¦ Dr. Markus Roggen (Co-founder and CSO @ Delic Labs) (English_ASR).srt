[Music]

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,199
welcome everybody to the next episode of

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,439
the cannabis review i'm delighted to be

4
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:15,599
joined in this episode by dr marcus

5
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:18,559
rogen who's the president and ceo of

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:22,320
delic labs how you keep it today marcus

7
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:24,479
um thank you very much uh cso uh ceo i

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,480
gave up that job too to a

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,719
more business-minded person so i can

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,880
focus on the science

11
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:32,000
yeah okay very good do you want to want

12
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:33,600
to give everybody a quick little

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,719
overview of how you ended up in the

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,800
cannabis industry and at dillik labs

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,120
okay uh this is a quick 15-minute talk

16
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:43,599
so that won't be the full story but in

17
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:46,238
short uh phd in chemistry and then

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,200
serendipitously while i was doing my phd

19
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:51,599
my postdoc in california i got into the

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,079
cannabis industry um it was

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,079
recreationally legal in

22
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,520
uh colorado at the time and medically

23
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:02,878
illegal in canada in california and so

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,320
my camera can can my chemistry skills

25
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:06,319
brought me into the field

26
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,680
well what is it exactly that you guys

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,640
specialize at at your laboratory

28
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,600
so

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,519
we are in vancouver canada so that we

30
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,599
can get research licenses from the

31
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,280
canadian government on cannabis and

32
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:24,478
psychedelic compounds and we partner

33
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,640
with the university of british columbia

34
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:30,000
to do fundamental research in both the

35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:34,079
field of analytics and and

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,319
process chemistry uh of can cannabis

37
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:38,239
to help producers

38
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:39,118
and end consumers

39
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:41,599
uh

40
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,438
make better products

41
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:44,879
okay and do you see

42
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:46,879
i've been reading up and researching a

43
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:50,640
lot about creating your own cell line to

44
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:52,719
use precision fermentation to create uh

45
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,118
both psychedelic compounds and

46
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:57,200
cannabinoid compounds do you see that as

47
00:01:55,118 --> 00:02:00,319
being the future of that let's say the

48
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,560
ingredient side of this of this industry

49
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:05,199
so i'm a chemist and therefore i will

50
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,799
always talk down on on a plant scientist

51
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,598
and say no no no uh it's it's the post

52
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,239
post-processing but

53
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:14,639
hear me out so yes

54
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,439
grow environment grow conditions

55
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:20,318
fertilizers can influence

56
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:24,239
the chemical profiles the plants express

57
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:26,159
that is that is correct so

58
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,520
everyone talks about the strains or the

59
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,959
cultivars of of of cannabis

60
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,120
but the grow environment is actually

61
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,680
more influential than the dna

62
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,080
so because what what people care about

63
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,480
is the chemical profile so the chemovar

64
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,480
of of the plant

65
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:44,799
and

66
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:47,598
i prefer to uh influence that in

67
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,519
post-production so when we

68
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:51,919
harvest the plant how do we dry the

69
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,000
plant how do we cure it then how do we

70
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:55,759
extract it and then package it into the

71
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,360
various products

72
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,560
and

73
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,599
there

74
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,039
currently is

75
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:06,719
done so much in extraction that there's

76
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:09,598
very little left over from the original

77
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:11,680
chemovar fingerprint of the plant

78
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:13,839
and and a lot of my research or our

79
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,480
research is on to optimizing these

80
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,719
extraction processes to better

81
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:20,560
express the chemical profile of those

82
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:23,280
plants in the extraction process and

83
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,959
therefore in the final product

84
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,959
okay so the extraction process is

85
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,360
basically manipulating the end product

86
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,280
to be as purified and exact as you want

87
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,599
and whatever about the initial flower

88
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,239
was that you get to change and alter it

89
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:38,959
so much that it's it is as clean as

90
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,360
the biotechnology method is it yes yes

91
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,439
that's correct so uh if you think about

92
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,920
it in its basic form the cannabis plant

93
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,759
produces thc or a thc asset and people

94
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:49,518
care about thc because that makes them

95
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,199
high so how do you get it out of the

96
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,039
plant and how do you put it in a vape

97
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:54,399
cartridge or final product if you only

98
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,158
think about a single compound then it's

99
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,120
relatively easy

100
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,878
it's extraction and the purification but

101
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,680
when you think that

102
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:06,959
cannabis is designed as a recreational

103
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,959
product because of all the flavors and

104
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,519
and the higher feelings one gets from

105
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,920
them um pure thc doesn't do it there's

106
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,000
the interplay of various compounds so

107
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:18,000
now we have to track multiple compounds

108
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,238
and they all behave slightly different

109
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,879
in extraction and purification and it

110
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,799
gets a very complicated multi-factorial

111
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:26,159
optimization problem

112
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,520
and

113
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,120
there

114
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:32,079
can be experience uh there can be

115
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,478
uh

116
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:37,198
chemometrics to do this work but it's

117
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:39,599
all like a single dial at a time new

118
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,240
experiment pro process

119
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,360
so we then quickly shifted in our

120
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,840
company to use machine learning

121
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,360
because these these algorithms can track

122
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:51,918
way more uh

123
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,919
variables at a time and optimize for all

124
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:57,120
of them

125
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:59,279
instantaneously and so we we work with

126
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,360
cannabis producers to take in all their

127
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:03,119
data run it through our machine learning

128
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,879
process and then with bayesian

129
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,918
optimization so if you want to look that

130
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:09,918
up on wikipedia uh we then narrow down

131
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:11,758
on on the best method and we can then

132
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:16,879
optimize for

133
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:18,720
yield cost purity or or flavor profile

134
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:20,240
yeah i actually wanted to move on to ai

135
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,479
and cannabis next is it's a great

136
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,560
transition there two things i had a

137
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:26,560
question for an ai in cannabis is

138
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,120
computer vision ever going to be

139
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,360
something that would be utilized to to

140
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,840
let's say monitor the health of a plant

141
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,319
better that the human eye could do and

142
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,918
is machine learning capable of

143
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:39,759
recommending what i suppose is deep

144
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:41,918
learning if you're recommending

145
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,360
blends and formulations of different

146
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:45,839
cannabinoids and terpenoids and

147
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,840
flavonoids that that may become future

148
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,839
ingredients or products

149
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:51,679
actually all of that is already

150
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:54,959
happening

151
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,519
so we have our niche of ai and machine

152
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:59,680
learning in extraction and and cannabis

153
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:02,799
analytics finding new compounds so we

154
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,240
we're using like language ai to

155
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,600
interpret

156
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,199
mass

157
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,520
fragmentation patterns to find new

158
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,360
cannabinoids and then track them so it's

159
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:13,680
really fun and cool for for like the

160
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,840
geeky chemist but but for your question

161
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,079
on computer vision so i've actually

162
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:20,560
worked with two startup companies that

163
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:22,318
used computer vision

164
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,560
to track the health of cannabis plants

165
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,639
so they had cameras in the in the

166
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,639
ceilings of grow rooms and would then

167
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,879
monitor the plants

168
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:34,478
and could spot

169
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:37,199
pests or diseases earlier so that a a

170
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:40,079
cultivator could then selectively treat

171
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,400
that one plant or remove that

172
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:43,839
diseased leaf before it spread through

173
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:47,198
the whole room

174
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:49,598
and and secondly there's a company

175
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,800
so so the first company was uh

176
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:54,959
deep green ai um i'm not sure if they're

177
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,960
still around but they they probably

178
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:58,399
folded their technology in some other

179
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:59,439
application

180
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:01,279
and then

181
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:03,759
but computer vision can also be used in

182
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,758
other aspects for example trimming

183
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,919
so the cannabis plant

184
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,639
is harvested and the flower buds are

185
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:13,038
then manicured with scissors to make

186
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,639
this to have this nice shape and

187
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:16,719
appearance

188
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,160
for the end consumer and that's quite

189
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,199
labor intensive

190
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:24,560
so um a friend uh john goa

191
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,000
uh had this company

192
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,439
um

193
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,079
oh sorry no

194
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:32,879
i'm missing the company i will figure it

195
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:35,198
out in a moment so uh he

196
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,719
built his company built robots

197
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,199
uh that

198
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,000
manicured cannabis flower buds into

199
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,080
these nice end products and to do that

200
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,720
they needed to look at the flower from

201
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:48,478
all angles understand what is flower

202
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,319
what is leaf what needs to be trimmed

203
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:53,038
where does it need to be cut

204
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,759
and so they were training

205
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:57,598
the ai the computer vision of

206
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,919
interpreting

207
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:02,159
what what this pla what this robot is

208
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:04,878
looking at

209
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:08,080
uh and so this his company he then sold

210
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:10,080
it on to like a a larger conglomerate in

211
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:11,120
the cannabis space so this is still

212
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:14,079
around

213
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:17,038
okay very good amazing quick question is

214
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:19,598
cryogenically frozen cannabis the best

215
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:21,918
way to treat cannabis once it's fresh

216
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:24,240
and grown

217
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:26,878
depending on what you want to do with it

218
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,960
okay so for me let's say we want to make

219
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,560
flour as the end product we want to make

220
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:32,559
vape cartridges the end product and we

221
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,719
want to use it as an edible is it

222
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:37,278
suitable for all three of those or is it

223
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,680
perfect for just one of those no so so

224
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:41,120
cryogenically frozen it basically just

225
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,559
means like freezing it very really

226
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,480
quickly yeah

227
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:47,278
so if you have to see in the bad

228
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,320
batman movie with mr freeze that's

229
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:52,480
carogenically frozen

230
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,879
but it it basically just arrests the

231
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,759
plant right it's still wet it's still

232
00:08:54,879 --> 00:09:00,320
fresh it's just frozen in time

233
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:03,600
so if you now want to

234
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,120
use ice water hash or key things so to

235
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,480
separate the trichome heads that are

236
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,720
rich or that produce all the

237
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,120
cannabinoids from the rest of the

238
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,040
biomass then that is quite good because

239
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:17,120
it's fresh it's brittle and you can

240
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:18,799
easily remove them by agitation

241
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,919
but you can't smoke it because it's

242
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:22,399
still wet

243
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:24,159
it's just frozen but it's still wet so

244
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,559
you can't smoke it

245
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:29,199
you can do

246
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:31,278
cryogenic drying

247
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,800
so freeze drying

248
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:34,399
so you you freeze the material

249
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:37,759
cryogenically freezing material and then

250
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,440
you go through freeze dry cycles

251
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:40,559
and those are

252
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,680
potentially

253
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:45,439
really

254
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:47,759
beneficial to to remove the water and

255
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,640
keep more terpenes on the on the flower

256
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:51,600
but so they would potentially give you a

257
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:53,120
more

258
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,519
flavorful

259
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,278
smokable product

260
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,200
um

261
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:00,958
and and there are some companies in the

262
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,959
space that are that are working on these

263
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:05,599
aspects

264
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:08,639
linda for example um a gas supplier they

265
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,920
they have some technologies in the space

266
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,399
and

267
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:14,399
uh then lastly is it useful for

268
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,720
extraction no not at all because

269
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:20,078
extraction uh doesn't really want to

270
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,000
deal with water so you have the cannabis

271
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:24,639
plant frozen but it's still full of

272
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,320
water so for co2 extraction that's done

273
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:28,720
above room temperature

274
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,959
um it would have to thaw anyway and all

275
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,440
the water just really

276
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:35,599
uh throws the extraction out of whack

277
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,360
what is the cannabis campaign database

278
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,879
why did you guys set it up and what is

279
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,159
it so why is it so important for the

280
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,799
industry

281
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:46,319
sure happy too uh when i got into the

282
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:48,719
cannabis industry in like 2014

283
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,879
uh there were like four cannabinoids

284
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,480
known that people tested for you could

285
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:55,278
get basically standards for those and

286
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,079
that was it uh and in the academic

287
00:10:55,278 --> 00:11:01,519
literature you already knew about like

288
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:03,519
50 80 compounds and then over time it

289
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,440
extended to like 150 different

290
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,000
cannabinoids that are known

291
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,680
uh but nowadays you can only buy 16

292
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,240
reference standards and testing labs

293
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:14,479
only test for like 10 cannabinoids so

294
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,879
you see there's a big difference between

295
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,360
like what information you can get on a

296
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:21,519
piece of paper from from the producer or

297
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,278
from the testing lab and what actually

298
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:26,560
is in the plant and then there's

299
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:29,600
research by professor dr mary

300
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:31,599
out of israel uh that really shows that

301
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,079
it's beyond these ten cannabinoids that

302
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,320
actually have biological effects uh so

303
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:38,479
he did some anti-cancer screens where he

304
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,959
found some really minor cannabinoids

305
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,039
that don't even have names yet that that

306
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:44,639
kill the tumor but thc isn't really

307
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:47,599
doing the work

308
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:49,199
and so i was always intrigued

309
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,639
um

310
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,639
what actually is in the cannabis plant

311
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,120
because if i want to do good extraction

312
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,519
or get the right product for the right

313
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,278
medical need i need to understand what

314
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,519
is in there i can't just

315
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:03,278
make a product where

316
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,639
eighty percent of the ingredient is

317
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:06,879
unknown to me

318
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,799
right i need to know what's in there so

319
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:11,039
therefore we just started scouring the

320
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:13,838
academic literature

321
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:16,879
and doing our own experiments to then

322
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:19,040
figure out what different compounds are

323
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:20,879
in the cannabis plant hence cannabis

324
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:23,039
compound database

325
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:24,559
so we just like hand curated that at the

326
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:26,240
beginning

327
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:28,879
and now that we have

328
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:32,240
better analytical tools in our lab

329
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:34,159
with our language ai to to figure out

330
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,799
new cannabinoids

331
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:39,519
we then start adding them as well to our

332
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:41,679
database and we hope that

333
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,720
this database can then use by other

334
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:44,559
people

335
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,680
to look at their

336
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:50,319
com their material or their spectra

337
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:52,559
their analytical runs and compare it and

338
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,720
then maybe we can help them through that

339
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:56,638
database figure out what they have in

340
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,720
