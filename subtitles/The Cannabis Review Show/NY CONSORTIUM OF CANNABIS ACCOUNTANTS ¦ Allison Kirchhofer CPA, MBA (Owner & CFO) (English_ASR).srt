00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:59,839
that you're working in yeah absolutely

27
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,759
so i

28
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,320
started accounting by design last year

29
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:05,920
to work with uh cannabis entrepreneurs

30
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,319
in my backyard in new york and new

31
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,879
jersey i'm a born and bred new yorker

32
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:11,599
and right now i live not far from jersey

33
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:13,280
so

34
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:14,798
focusing on helping those entrepreneurs

35
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,879
come on board in the cannabis industry

36
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,880
here

37
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,879
okay amazing so basically i want to try

38
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:22,640
and touch on as many topics that i can

39
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:24,798
for new york to help educate the viewers

40
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,799
over in the states and in ireland about

41
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,920
uh what i think could possibly be the

42
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,920
best state so far to legalize in america

43
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,240
with i just think with the the level of

44
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,920
entrepreneurship the diversity that

45
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:37,920
happens in new york i think you're gonna

46
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,000
have entrepreneurs coming from so many

47
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,640
different sectors it's it's not going to

48
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,359
be just one or two levels of entry like

49
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,439
it is in a lot of other states

50
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,280
i would agree yeah

51
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:51,359
so perfect can you maybe give everybody

52
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,680
a brief overview what is the new york

53
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:56,399
consortium of cannabis accountants why

54
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,920
did you guys set it up and what is the

55
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,200
medium to long-term aim with this

56
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,840
organization

57
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,240
yeah absolutely so we are a group of

58
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,880
accountants working with cannabis

59
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:10,719
businesses in new york and for the most

60
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:13,759
part we are all new yorkers um and we

61
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:16,239
founded the organization because we

62
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:18,639
identified a real need for financial

63
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,878
education in the industry amongst

64
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:23,439
entrepreneurs that want to enter the

65
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:24,799
cannabis space or have already been um

66
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:27,120
operating the cannabis space

67
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,719
pre-licensed for possibly decades and

68
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,439
and you know supporting livelihoods that

69
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:33,919
way so to help transition them from

70
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:36,719
legacy to legal you know our vision

71
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:39,359
really is to see the legal market in new

72
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:41,280
york thrive and we're focusing on new

73
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,080
york not only because we are new yorkers

74
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,280
ourselves um but because like you said

75
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,519
this new york is is a unique market it's

76
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,080
it's going to be a large one and it's

77
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,319
going to have a lot of intricacy

78
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,160
and detail specific to new york so we

79
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:59,518
really wanted to hone in on what new

80
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:02,400
york campus entrepreneurs needed and our

81
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,959
our long-term goal is really to be the

82
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,360
source of

83
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,199
financial literacy and education for

84
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,200
these groups that are looking to get

85
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:13,679
into some of them are like i said new

86
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:15,199
business owners and um just

87
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,280
an understanding of what it means to

88
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:20,158
operate in a regulated taxed legal

89
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,919
market um and you know helping with

90
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,280
business plans and budgeting down the

91
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:25,598
road and everything you need to do to

92
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,598
get your house in order sort of a step

93
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:29,598
one before you begin to build out your

94
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:31,598
team and do your due diligence getting

95
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:33,518
into the market

96
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:36,318
okay incredible and from my reading you

97
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,840
guys are a team of financial wizards and

98
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:39,359
this is again one of the things i think

99
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,039
about new york where you're going to be

100
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,879
able to if you've got a

101
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:46,079
even a level entry into this industry be

102
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:47,759
able to utilize the skill set of a team

103
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,760
of industry experts like yourself and i

104
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,439
don't think that happens in very many

105
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:53,518
cities so it's not just going to be the

106
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:55,199
big hedge phones and the vcs that manage

107
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,599
to dominate the entry point into this

108
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,518
industry

109
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:01,518
yeah i mean i hope so i hope that's what

110
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,719
what actually plays out as the market

111
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,719
rolls out here in new york

112
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,840
okay great and can you maybe um tell

113
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,640
everybody you understood what is

114
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,878
forensic accounting and why will that

115
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,639
matter in the cannabis industry

116
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:19,279
so it's

117
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,120
forensic accounting is basically um

118
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:23,279
using a set

119
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,079
series of procedures to build books and

120
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:27,758
records going back in time where there

121
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:29,758
were none to begin with and there are a

122
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,360
lot of situations where this may happen

123
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,199
it can happen

124
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,040
with legal businesses that just have

125
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,639
poor accounting systems they don't have

126
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,479
those records they need to file tax

127
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,280
returns um

128
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,560
and

129
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,959
they may be doing that for a lot of

130
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,800
reasons one of the big ones is to submit

131
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:48,638
uh you know as part of the application

132
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,879
to the state for your licensure um and

133
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,639
myself and some of the other co-founders

134
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:55,439
of the consortium have been doing this

135
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,360
sort of um back work with legacy

136
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:00,240
operators as well who are looking to

137
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,319
contribute legacy funds to their new

138
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,280
legal venture while they they need to

139
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:07,680
report and pay tax on that so um going

140
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:09,758
back and building books and records um

141
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,720
and and documenting all of the

142
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:15,120
methodology around that is is what we're

143
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,600
doing to help them um

144
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,360
really uh being in a good position to

145
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,240
submit an application to the state and

146
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,759
to have all their ducks in a row

147
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,360
yeah so it seems like a great service

148
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,879
you guys are providing for people so

149
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,520
we've got the end of sales look like

150
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:31,680
they're beginning in 2022.

151
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:33,359
so in terms of the licensing that

152
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,360
they've been handing out so far you're

153
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,479
seeing retail licenses been giving out

154
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,960
so far

155
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:41,439
and again is is it a is it a broad

156
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:43,439
spectrum or is it i read that it was the

157
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:45,279
the equity groups are getting the first

158
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,519
retail license of new york is that being

159
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:50,000
upheld

160
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:52,000
um yes so it's still rolling out right

161
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,478
now but essentially they decided to kick

162
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,399
off with a sort of ingenious approach um

163
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,399
with the seedling program and we're

164
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:00,560
under this like conditional regime right

165
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,560
now where they've awarded conditional

166
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,879
cultivator licenses so seeds are in the

167
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,959
ground right now and then they are

168
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:10,079
rolling out conditional adult use retail

169
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:13,120
dispensary licenses so this is a very

170
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:15,758
narrow focus to kick-start the industry

171
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,399
on the cultivator processor side um

172
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,280
those licenses are awarded to those that

173
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:20,560
have

174
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:22,879
experience

175
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,800
in growing and processing industrial

176
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,560
hemp so they they will get the sort of

177
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,240
the first stab at

178
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,560
um the thc grows in new york and then on

179
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,960
the retail side they have a very narrow

180
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,478
focus here of

181
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:37,758
individuals that have been just as

182
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:40,639
involved so they have a new york

183
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,800
conviction and they have

184
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,079
experience running a profitable business

185
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,439
so it's it's a very narrow focus and i

186
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:48,959
there will be

187
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:51,120
broader spectrum regulations and

188
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:53,279
applications released um

189
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,280
sometime in the next couple months i'm

190
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:57,679
i'm not very good at sort of guessing

191
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:59,439
when the state's going to act but um

192
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,160
that's that's how they're kicking things

193
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:04,399
off here so they want the existing hemp

194
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,680
farmers and processors to be the first

195
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:08,799
to grow

196
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,038
and they want um those like i said those

197
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,759
that fit this very specific profile to

198
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:15,519
be the first to open the dispensaries um

199
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,479
and they are kind of like

200
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:20,159
sp dispensaries um so they'll have uh

201
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:21,199
lease through the state loans through

202
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,599
the state

203
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,639
selected locations um

204
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:29,199
and and uh it's sort of uh

205
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,240
an interesting and very unique way to

206
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,400
kick off the market here in new york

207
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,160
okay so you basically have a lot of

208
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,560
experience in new jersey as well as new

209
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,880
york with the two states being beside

210
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,360
each other is the shipping of product

211
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:45,038
now going to be okay to do because two

212
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,639
states are right beside each other or

213
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:48,800
are they still separate entities when it

214
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,840
comes to the products and the

215
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,280
cultivation and whatnot yeah as long as

216
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:56,399
as um

217
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:59,359
cannabis is illegal at the federal level

218
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:02,159
um you cannot ship across state lines so

219
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,280
yes two separate microcosm economies of

220
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,680
cannabis

221
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:06,959
right next to each other um

222
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,120
whether there can be some sort of

223
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:11,359
agreement among like the tri-state you

224
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,840
know connecticut maybe pennsylvania i'm

225
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,360
not sure if and how that can play out um

226
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,359
but right now

227
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,960
there is no shipping of product between

228
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,639
state lines

229
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:23,519
do you think new jersey have gotten a

230
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,840
head start or does first a market not

231
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:28,240
necessarily mean a head start in this

232
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:30,159
industry with the amount of pitfalls

233
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,680
that uh somebody starting is gonna come

234
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,240
across

235
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,479
um so new jersey it does have adult use

236
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,399
sales as of today whereas new york does

237
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,158
not so technically speaking they got the

238
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,519
head start and they had a very different

239
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:45,919
approach they gave the existing um what

240
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,560
were referred to as a

241
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:50,240
alternative treatment centers um which

242
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:51,919
you know the medical facilities that

243
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,399
have been existing for a few years in

244
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:56,879
new jersey they were a handful of them

245
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,639
were given approval to sell adult use so

246
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:01,039
it is the msos that got the head start

247
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:03,360
in new jersey um which is not what we're

248
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:05,039
seeing in new york so it is a very it's

249
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,200
an interesting approach however today

250
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:09,120
you can purchase adult use cannabis in

251
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,360
new jersey we're not quite there

252
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,360
probably won't be the goal is by the end

253
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,240
of this year to have those conditional

254
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,000
dispensaries up and operating um in new

255
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,560
york

256
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,519
okay and the next topic i wanted to talk

257
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:26,159
about was new york cannabis taxation now

258
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,080
we know the rules aren't exactly out yet

259
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:30,719
uh when it comes to the exact taxation

260
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:34,160
but we've seen already even decided upon

261
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,759
california's tax laws are even uh

262
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:37,278
known over here for how strict and

263
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:39,759
severe they are we saw the role back

264
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:42,480
there recently if you were designing the

265
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:44,319
taxation for the new york industry of

266
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,320
the three areas that you've got you've

267
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,320
obviously got sales and retail

268
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,519
cultivation in the manufacturing slash

269
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,200
processing is there a sweet uh taxation

270
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,360
number that you think the the government

271
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,000
should be looking at or should somebody

272
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,959
priced a little bit higher than others

273
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,480
um

274
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,639
i can't say that

275
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,120
i don't know if i can tell the state

276
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:07,360
exactly what tax rates if that's sort of

277
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,120
what you're asking um but it is an

278
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,839
interesting approach here in new york so

279
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,879
the distributors are going to have uh a

280
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,640
potency-based tax imposed on them and so

281
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:18,799
that's going to impact

282
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:20,639
their negotiations down the supply chain

283
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:21,838
and ultimately pricing and really

284
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,159
squeeze their

285
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:27,680
their margins in addition to the impact

286
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:29,360
of 280e which is the internal revenue

287
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:31,439
code section that says that cannabis

288
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,278
traffickers cannot take any um

289
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,560
deductions or credit so the distributors

290
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:36,078
are going to be hit hard and that is

291
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:39,838
going to have an impact on pricing down

292
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:42,639
the supply chain and it is um a flat tax

293
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,560
based on potency as opposed to sales so

294
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:46,958
similar to the cultivation tax i believe

295
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:48,319
in california so um it's interesting to

296
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:49,919
see how it's going to play out it's a

297
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,800
slightly different tax regime in new

298
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:54,719
jersey which is weight based um doing

299
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:58,078
the potency tax in new york i know the

300
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,079
intention was or or to

301
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:02,078
what was front of mind in choosing a

302
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:05,679
potency tax typically would be more of a

303
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:07,759
public health so uh initiative so to um

304
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:08,559
not encourage high thc that they're

305
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:10,559
going to

306
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,958
tax the thc from an accounting

307
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:14,799
perspective there's going to be a lot of

308
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:17,039
record keeping to be maintained which is

309
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:19,759
what i've been um you know focusing my

310
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:21,679
attention on in terms of keeping track

311
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:24,240
of because it's based the tax is based

312
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:25,599
on milligrams um

313
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,360
but without getting too much into the

314
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,120
weeds there uh the distributors are

315
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,360
going to have that tax imposed on them

316
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,200
there's also an excise tax at the retail

317
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,680
level and consumers will be paying sales

318
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,839
tax on on cannabis in new york

319
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:39,679
and in new york is the licensing that

320
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,360
people go through it's true a separate

321
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:43,120
whole department it's not true let's say

322
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,879
the licensing and excise people who

323
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,600
would give out alcohol licenses and

324
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:48,958
gambling license is it separate

325
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,519
yes it's the office of cannabis

326
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:54,000
management which was created what yep so

327
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,278
it was medical marijuana program was

328
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,360
managed under the department of health

329
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:58,639
and then when they passed adult use they

330
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,480
created the office of cannabis

331
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:03,440
management and trans transition the

332
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,920
entire um cannabis program medical adult

333
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,920
use and cannabinoid hemp to the office

334
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:09,679
of cannabis management
