overview of how you came to found the

15
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:40,558
hemp hound and your position in the

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:44,320
industry yeah of course um I started off

17
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:47,198
uh with a CBD uh company in 2016 Called

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,558
Love Bud now uh that didn't quite go to

19
00:00:47,198 --> 00:00:51,439
plan uh but I did discover then that I

20
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:54,039
was quite Adept at finding out

21
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:55,878
information uh understanding uh what I

22
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:58,640
needed to know and understanding who I

23
00:00:55,878 --> 00:01:01,439
needed to ask if I didn't understand um

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,359
that actually sounds a bit weird but uh

25
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,599
that led to a job at the Cannabis trades

26
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,159
Association where I was member point of

27
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:10,118
contact for two and a half years where I

28
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,439
helped uh hundreds of companies on

29
00:01:10,118 --> 00:01:16,000
various matters now that position came

30
00:01:12,438 --> 00:01:19,158
to a close at the end of 2020 uh they uh

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,680
CTA evolved as an entity but what they

32
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:23,920
said that they didn't want uh I decided

33
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,640
to take and repackage and create

34
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,118
effectively the hemp pound agency which

35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,239
is basically a um a signpost in an

36
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:34,640
advisory service for first and foremost

37
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:36,399
as well as uh uh now delving into the

38
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,959
world of investigative journalism and

39
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:40,399
Industry

40
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:41,839
commentary yeah it's it's very

41
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:43,320
interesting with the UK it seems to be

42
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,000
one of the territories that actually has

43
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:47,078
the most disinformation if you're

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,280
looking from the outside looking in so

45
00:01:47,078 --> 00:01:51,399
it's great to be able to have somebody

46
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,200
of your expertise and uh Clarity to be

47
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:55,200
able to bring to these topics first

48
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,759
topic I wanted to start off with his CBD

49
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,478
in the UK again lots of reports positive

50
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,359
and negative that come out of the UK can

51
00:01:59,478 --> 00:02:04,239
you give us us an exact overview of what

52
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:06,920
does the CBD industry look like in the

53
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:09,159
UK is it going well are the big major

54
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,878
retailers still purchasing after the

55
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:13,919
ruling that we saw recently based on the

56
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:16,799
the quantity of THC how does it h

57
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:19,839
currently stand as you see it well novel

58
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,000
Foods has been a long strangled Affair

59
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,680
in my point of view uh it's been filled

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
with vague vagueness and uh uh

61
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:32,040
regulatory updates have been um sporadic

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,159
and slow uh for example with the uh ADI

63
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:36,239
announcement recently the 10 milligram

64
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:39,719
advised daily intake that was followed

65
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:42,080
by the uh acmd recognition from the home

66
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:44,560
office in regards to control canabo

67
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,400
levels now one of the very interesting

68
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,479
things in there is that no serving size

69
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,000
is defined it's accepted that there

70
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:55,079
needs to be a serving size for all of

71
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,039
these products but in effect that leaves

72
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,760
us in an interesting scenario where

73
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:03,439
we've got an advised daily intake but no

74
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:06,840
serving suggestions versus um control

75
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:08,400
canabo content allowed per serving with

76
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,640
the home office saying yeah we need to

77
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,280
sort out a serving but the FSA have

78
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:15,919
never thought about doing that and if we

79
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,000
go back in time to the present day it

80
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:20,039
has just been that case of kicking the

81
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,799
can down the road in an attempt to

82
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:26,560
basically strangle the hemp and CBD

83
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:29,200
industry to uh I feel submission uh in

84
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,680
all honesty I don't think there's people

85
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:35,079
out there that want this industry here

86
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,400
and uh my fight in essence is to show

87
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,640
that everyone has a right to be here

88
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,760
whether it that be the small to

89
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:44,238
mediumsized producers or your big boys

90
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:47,560
but at the end of the day because of

91
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,280
that slow strangled effect it's pretty

92
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,560
much the same across the board we are

93
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,280
seeing companies close but we are seeing

94
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,239
companies who seem to be doing really

95
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,560
well in the current climate so it's a

96
00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:03,039
little bit paradoxical I in that effect

97
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:06,840
but um yeah it it it is kind of holding

98
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:09,039
a steady path slightly going down but

99
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,840
we're hoping that basically the

100
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:14,239
regulatory authorities will be a little

101
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:16,720
bit more firm and sensible in in uh

102
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:20,358
their Direction coming on from here so

103
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,320
hopefully we could be at at the trough

104
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:24,439
part you know and there is that

105
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,839
recognition that there should be a CBD

106
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:29,759
industry here and hopefully the industry

107
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:32,038
uh the industry Regulators will provide

108
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,400
a sensible route forward that benefits

109
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:37,319
all companies so yeah it is low but

110
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:38,839
hopefully it's it's going to start

111
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:42,079
playing and out

112
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:44,079
now are we in a scenario and it seems to

113
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:46,038
be in a couple of countries where the

114
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:48,800
CBD industry and cannabis industry was

115
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:50,519
so new that the parameters and the rules

116
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,160
weren't ever set so it was kind of

117
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:54,478
free-for-all and anybody could get in

118
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,080
and anybody could get an ingredient from

119
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:58,758
anywhere in the world and put it onto

120
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:00,159
the shelves are we just basically seeing

121
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:03,080
now the

122
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,000
the grown up part of this sector where

123
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:07,079
it has to be regulated there has to be

124
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,038
certain licenses for ingredient

125
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:11,319
suppliers whether it's CBD or whatever

126
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:14,279
cannaboid it is that everybody now has

127
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:16,199
to obey these exact parameters otherwise

128
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:18,559
we're not going to be able to uh

129
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:20,680
comfortably allow the population to take

130
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,199
this is that kind of where we are do you

131
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,639
think in the UK that we're now getting

132
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:27,319
to the stage okay the Bad actors or the

133
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,639
nefarious actors or the easy supply side

134
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:32,240
of the industry is getting crushed and

135
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:34,519
the established and the more regulated

136
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,840
large scale commercial operators are the

137
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:37,639
ones that are going to end up being able

138
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:40,038
to thrive in this

139
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:41,560
space I I think there's there's like I

140
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:43,439
said a mixture of uh small and

141
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,839
mediumsized companies and big companies

142
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:46,959
that are doing well in the current

143
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:49,000
climate but when it comes to uh

144
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:50,279
regulation now there's there's always

145
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,279
going to be companies that are going to

146
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:55,359
try and circumvent um regulation in any

147
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:58,159
way uh for example there's wind coming

148
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:03,038
out from the FSA that they're looking to

149
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:05,360
Target um C press uh hemp producers now

150
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:08,519
part of that involves the fact that

151
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:11,680
people may or may not be using uh CBD

152
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:14,560
isolate based products misdescribed as C

153
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,639
press now in that sense you would think

154
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,478
yes something definitely does need to be

155
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,519
tackled there because product

156
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:22,879
misrepresentation to the

157
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:25,959
consumer you know that's obviously a big

158
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:28,519
thing in this industry um but to what

159
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:30,000
point is the regulation being a little

160
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:34,359
bit over

161
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,319
applied um if I go back to uh 2017 for

162
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,919
example when I first heard about novel

163
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:42,160
Foods I was kind of confused because in

164
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:45,639
my eyes if you had all the sensible lab

165
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:48,439
reports the canabo profile the mot toxin

166
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:51,120
the uh fungicidal herbicidal all of them

167
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:53,918
you had your um full lab reports for the

168
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:57,399
finished product traceability across the

169
00:06:53,918 --> 00:07:00,519
board what's wrong with your products um

170
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:02,758
but then your flip side is

171
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:06,038
it's is more required when it comes to

172
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:09,280
the ultra refined um isolate based

173
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:11,240
products yes I believe that is the case

174
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:14,119
uh but certainly with more whole plant

175
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,759
products I feel that there was sensible

176
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:20,319
legislation or direction that was

177
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:22,240
available at that time um but when it

178
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,400
comes to uh the isolate products and

179
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,800
that kind of um understanding being

180
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:31,120
applied across the board then of course

181
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:35,840
where is that kind of sensible ground

182
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:38,639
you know we are we really um looking at

183
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:41,239
com uh you know comparing CBD isolates

184
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,280
to full spectrum products it just seems

185
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:46,560
a little bit skewed and there needs to

186
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:49,679
be that level ground where each product

187
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,158
Dynamic is accurately represented

188
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,120
without having a cloud over it that that

189
00:07:52,158 --> 00:07:57,478
comes from a different Dynamic if you

190
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,038
know what I mean kind of overshadowing

191
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:02,758
um the CBD content you know the 10 mil

192
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:06,478
ADI that came from lab reports for

193
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:09,038
synthetic CBD and CBD isolate so should

194
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:12,318
a broad or a full spectrum product be

195
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:14,120
stuck at 10 milligram per day you you

196
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:17,199
know that it just seems a little bit

197
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:19,439
wrong so yeah there there was sensible

198
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,560
kind of guidance I think it's got kind

199
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:26,240
of over

200
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:28,319
complicated uh now but equally from an

201
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,158
FSA standpoint you can kind of

202
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,599
understand why they've that across the

203
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:34,120
board because it makes their life easy

204
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:37,560
but it makes the industry's life a

205
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:39,918
little bit awkward so yeah um it it is

206
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:42,639
it an easy world is is there the right

207
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:45,439
level of Regulation um or or

208
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:47,278
requirements was that there before I

209
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,000
think that's a little bit of a hard

210
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:52,958
question to answer because in some

211
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,399
aspects yes in other aspects

212
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:57,599
no yeah it's a very interesting sector

213
00:08:55,399 --> 00:09:00,240
and as I said still lots more evolving

214
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,278
to happen there moving on now to a topic

215
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,560
that I know you've done a lot of

216
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:07,519
research and investigating about is the

217
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:09,559
GW Pharma and the Jazz Pharmaceuticals

218
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,839
relationship for everybody who doesn't

219
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:13,838
know Jazz Pharmaceuticals bought GW for

220
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:17,600
six and a half billion I think it was a

221
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:19,160
number of years ago 7.2 what have you

222
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,440
found out in your course of

223
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:24,559
Investigations about the proprietary

224
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,480
ownership of certain drugs and was the

225
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:28,119
transaction actually fully completed

226
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,240
based on what you can

227
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:33,039
see it's a bit of a hard question I know

228
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:36,519
there's an investigation at the moment

229
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:38,439
in the US in regards to um

230
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:40,839
misrepresentation uh on GW

231
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:43,760
Pharmaceutical side when they were sold

232
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:46,680
to uh Jazz um so there is a little bit

233
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:48,519
of a uncertainty I I don't understand

234
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:51,159
why that's not potentially being picked

235
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:55,200
up here uh if it's something that the US

236
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:59,639
authorities deem is important uh but

237
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:01,200
when it comes to Jazz and GW um I I

238
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:04,159
believe that there's an agreement in

239
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:07,440
place uh that agreement became apparent

240
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:10,159
in 1998 when the home office accepted a

241
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,440
22p point plan from Dr Jeffrey guia

242
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:16,958
co-founder of GW and that plan was to

243
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:21,800
regulate and control Canabis in the UK

244
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:24,000
now is GW a separate entity still I

245
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:26,439
believe it is uh you can trace them

246
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,440
through uh company's house if you go to

247
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:33,880
Jazz Pharmaceuticals uh canabo age it is

248
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:36,399
labeled for GW um you know there is an

249
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:39,159
indication that jazz in itself aren't

250
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,320
happy with the way that their canabo uh

251
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:43,679
interests have progressed and that they

252
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,959
are looking potentially to sell it but

253
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:48,319
if they sell it what would that be would

254
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:51,039
that be GW that they're selling or would

255
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,720
it be their canabo arm so there is a

256
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:56,519
little bit of uncertainty when someone

257
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:59,200
says oh oh yeah Jazz brought GW yes but

258
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:00,759
uh in what context did they buy to to

259
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,440
assimilate them into their business

260
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:06,078
model and work on or are they keeping as

261
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,279
a separate entity and why are they

262
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:09,559
keeping them as a separate entity I

263
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:11,919
believe that that's because there's a

264
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:13,958
public private partnership at play but

265
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:18,240
certainly uh since

266
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:21,078
2021 uh when Jazz did buy GW uh from

267
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,839
that point working up to the 30th of

268
00:11:21,078 --> 00:11:27,278
November last year every patent

269
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:30,880
extension or or new patent assigned to

270
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:35,399
epids is awarded to G far GW pharmer

271
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:37,958
limited or GW research limited and GW

272
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:39,600
research limited on the 30th of November

273
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:44,278
changed their name to Jazz

274
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:47,200
Pharmaceuticals research UK limited but

275
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:50,200
at the same time they're owned by Jazz

276
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:54,040
uh sorry GW Pharmaceuticals and have

277
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:56,879
been since the six uh the 6th of the 4th

278
00:11:54,039 --> 00:12:00,000
2016 this is all on on company's house

279
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:02,759
by the way um so there is UNC certainty

280
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,639
um are are they carrying on um you know

281
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:09,360
if the the patents are in their name um

282
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:12,000
you know is it Jazz that submitted them

283
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:15,079
or is it GW that submitted them and of

284
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,919
course is GW still its separate entity I

285
00:12:15,078 --> 00:12:19,879
I think it's plain to see at the end of

286
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:21,879
the day um and it's quite understandable

287
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:25,519
because in a public private uh

288
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:28,958
partnership format um you've used public

289
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:32,198
funds and resources to create an entity

290
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:35,000
most likely with a monopoly right so at

291
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:39,000
some point in that contract there has to

292
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:42,000
be a return for the public so public

293
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
private Partnerships can be sold to

294
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,240
companies like jazz was sold to GW uh

295
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,958
sorry GW was sold to Jazz so that needs

296
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,639
to be kept separate to the point that it

297
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:57,879
can be shown that they have achieved a

298
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:00,959
certain area where the public can start

299
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:04,240
seeing a return but that's unfortunate

300
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:06,039
because that agreement comes with a 22

301
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,320
point to regulate and control cannabis

302
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:11,399
in the UK so petitions that get set up

303
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,920
that are you know buffed back because

304
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:15,320
the government have no interest in

305
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:18,360
talking about cannabis that's because

306
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:22,240
that 22o plan what we're seeing in the

307
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:25,560
CBD industry 16 lab reports uh from

308
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:28,198
epids uh unnamed but accounted for

309
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:31,278
observers in the center of toxicity uh

310
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:34,879
meetings the defined application

311
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:38,159
requirements for CBD novel Foods um you

312
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:40,399
know they have their place and their

313
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:43,399
place is to become a world leader in

314
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:45,320
medicinal CBD and canono based products

315
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:48,278
so having a conversation about cannabis

316
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:51,720
does not suit that agreement having a uh

317
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:54,240
a large and thriven CBD industry um that

318
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,399
does not suit that agreement but at some

319
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,039
point that agreement will get to a point

320
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,120
where the public sees a return and

321
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:02,439
that'll be an interest interes in

322
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,278
day yeah it definitely seems to be the

323
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:07,639
drug Discovery and development of

324
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:09,320
formulations is the the holy grail for a

325
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:11,079
lot of these big companies and anything

326
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:14,320
that they can do to ensure that they can

327
00:14:11,078 --> 00:14:16,359
protect those long-term gains I think is

328
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,278
H is what's in place at the moment we're

329
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:21,480
nearly at our time here

330
00:14:18,278 --> 00:14:23,240
now sorry there is one issue there

331
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,480
though when you when you to look at it

332
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:29,198
in a pharmaceutical sense in a single

333
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,639
molecule kind of uh product okay

334
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:33,078
but we're talking about cannabis and

335
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:36,159
cannabinoids we have an endocannabinoid

336
00:14:33,078 --> 00:14:38,120
system so in essence there's a fair

337
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:41,600
argument to say that cannabis is a food

338
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:45,000
before a medicine now I believe that GW

339
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:47,040
Pharmaceuticals and Jazz know that it's

340
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,198
a food before a medicine but what

341
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:52,039
they're trying to do is clamp down on

342
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:55,879
that so that their profits are maximized

343
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:55,879
when your need becomes

344
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,198
medicinal yeah it's it's so fast to

345
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:02,758
watch this industry evolve and happen as

346
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:04,799
as we're kind of in the tick of it and

347
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:06,720
to see all these small little Splinter

348
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:09,198
things that are happening outside the

349
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,480
main kind of consumer platform just

350
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:14,198
before we go for anybody who hasn't ever

351
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:16,680
been to the hound. co.uk yet or doesn't

352
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:18,599
follow Kevin on LinkedIn I highly highly

353
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:20,278
recommend it one of the best sources of

354
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,240
investigative journalism in the UK

355
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:24,639
industry for you who are some of the

356
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,159
other good voices in the UK that people

357
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,560
should be following or listening to okay

358
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:31,519
the kind of Consultants uh definitely

359
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:34,039
without a doubt Steven Oliver and Matt

360
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,639
Lawson excellent excellent in what they

361
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:38,919
do as well as their interpretation on

362
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,440
how the industry is evolving I would

363
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:44,120
also say Kyle esplin uh from the

364
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:47,319
Scottish hemp Association he is a wealth

365
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:49,759
of knowledge and enthusiasm for the

366
00:15:47,318 --> 00:15:52,479
plant as a whole without a doubt he's

367
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:57,480
definitely someone to uh keep an eye on

368
00:15:52,480 --> 00:16:01,519
um as for other people I mean forgive me

369
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:03,278
it doesn't matter who I I think awesome

370
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,600
really people should be keeping an eye

371
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:07,120
on what's happening with the trade

372
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:10,040
associations because they should be the

373
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,679
ideal source of information right I I'm

374
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:14,318
of course doing my investigative

375
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:17,000
journalism um I'm not really too certain

376
00:16:14,318 --> 00:16:18,519
on what they're doing uh but ultimately

377
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,318
they should be the ones that are

378
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:24,440
relaying current information uh out to

379
00:16:21,318 --> 00:16:26,679
the industry and um I I forgive me for

380
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:29,639
saying it if if if they're not doing it

381
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:32,159
then maybe there should be someone El

382
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:34,240
about yeah I think that's the case

383
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:37,519
across a lot of countries M

384
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:39,000
unfortunately still with a lot of uh

385
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,240
barely good enough type of people as

386
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,919
opposed to people who are excelling

387
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,120
within this industry and can understand

388
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:45,639
the various perspective and nuances that

389
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,198
are going to need to be applied across

390
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:49,480
the various sectors of the Cannabis

391
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:51,639
industry as a

392
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,800
whole

393
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:58,240
sorry it seems like that's going to be

394
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:59,039
the case for sure yeah yeah um but you

395
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,680
you know

396
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:03,159
there yeah there are those people out

397
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:06,558
there certainly the cans Consultants um

398
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:10,359
Carl eslin um I would say to to an

399
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:13,119
extent there is some amazing um uh uh

400
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:16,399
academics out there there's uh Dr Ruth

401
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:19,318
fiser as well as Dr Jeff cutter they are

402
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,319
in the US and the and in Australia

403
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:24,119
respectively uh but they offer different

404
00:17:21,318 --> 00:17:27,119
Windows into how the world is evolving

405
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:30,319
um admittedly those windows do tend to

406
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:32,719
uh kind of show uh um a a repetitive

407
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:34,960
angle as it were you know anywhere that

408
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:38,120
talks regulation tends to talk about it

409
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:40,200
with GW lab reports so uh you will see a

410
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:42,000
little a lot of that and uh obviously

411
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,120
alternative takes on the way that the

412
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,160
world is

413
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:47,599
evolving yeah um I'd definitely love to

414
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,000
chat to you again in the next couple of

415
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:50,759
months and hopefully we both have

416
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,440
updates on what's happening in Ireland

417
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:54,599
and what's happening in the UK and we

418
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,798
