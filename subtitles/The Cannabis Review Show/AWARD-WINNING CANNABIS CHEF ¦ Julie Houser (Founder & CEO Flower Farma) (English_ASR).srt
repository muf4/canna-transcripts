13
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:35,280
want to give everybody a quick little 60

14
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:37,140
second overview of how you start at

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,939
flower farmer and how you self found

16
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,340
yourself in this industry

17
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:44,459
oh sure of course

18
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:47,219
um so I'm a plant-based chef and a

19
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,859
celebrity chef and I've had several

20
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:53,520
years in the field in the in the middle

21
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:58,558
of my journey I I had breast cancer

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:00,960
and I'm 11 years now cancer free but in

23
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:05,700
that process I was stage three I've had

24
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:08,579
18 surgeries since since that diagnosis

25
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,020
um I'm doing amazing now and so many

26
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:13,798
things were a part of that Journey that

27
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:15,780
cannabis was huge and as a chef I've

28
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,500
always worked out my problems in the

29
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,560
kitchen

30
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,719
and what I wanted to do was really show

31
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,659
people how to use cannabis as an

32
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:28,259
ingredient and build that into your diet

33
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:29,100
for wellness all the other benefits

34
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:32,099
um

35
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:36,059
and that's how flower Pharma started

36
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:38,039
okay amazing so you as you said teaching

37
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,500
everybody to you how to use cannabis in

38
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,479
Cuisine we obviously everybody kind of

39
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,819
knows the kind of butter that a lot of

40
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:47,158
people use and the kind of simpler entry

41
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:50,039
mode for a lot of people but can you

42
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,960
maybe explain how you think did I I

43
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,360
imagine that the future of the industry

44
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:57,239
is going to be Blends and formulations

45
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:58,920
that are created either for a clip-on

46
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:01,500
for a chef to be able to have in their

47
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,960
kitchen and use at any given time or as

48
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,060
part of a recipe sold in a mass

49
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:09,659
manufacturing for Consumer package Goods

50
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,759
yeah I think this is absolutely true I

51
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:13,620
think when uh when we think back to

52
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,598
cannabis cooking a lot of us still think

53
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,480
of the brownies we made when we were in

54
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:20,159
college or and everything's really green

55
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:23,818
like the cannabutter that you're talking

56
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:26,219
about and I think if we we want people

57
00:02:23,818 --> 00:02:27,719
to start thinking of cannabis as an

58
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:31,020
ingredient then we need to change it up

59
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:35,340
and make it more accessible for them and

60
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:38,580
the line of oils I created does that and

61
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:41,120
it gives people the opportunity to use

62
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:45,180
their own recipes get really creative

63
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:48,560
but use these sort of finishing oils or

64
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:51,239
sauces in a way to complete the meal

65
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,840
intentionally but without adding the

66
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:56,939
super green flavor if you follow me yeah

67
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,680
I do indeed and I think there seems to

68
00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:00,840
be a massive space in the market that

69
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,459
I'll go over in Europe we've got a

70
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,439
mishmash of rules when it comes to the

71
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:06,239
novel food application at the FDA even

72
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:08,400
in America are only now coming to kind

73
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,900
of draw rules and conditions where I

74
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,340
think you're going to see a hell of a

75
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,680
lot of products are going to contain

76
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,780
whether it's CBD THC or other

77
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,400
cannabinoids that are found at a

78
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,680
combination and a blend of those with

79
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,560
terpenes flavonoids and other normal

80
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,439
natural organic ingredients

81
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,860
um yes yeah yeah I think it is actually

82
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:30,539
a huge opportunity right for for people

83
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,659
I think we have a huge opportunity in

84
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:36,900
this industry to to look at this plant

85
00:03:33,658 --> 00:03:40,378
in a different way right uh we want

86
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:42,539
um people I think it's not very natural

87
00:03:40,378 --> 00:03:44,359
to get together on a Friday night and

88
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:47,939
everybody eat a gummy at the same time

89
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:51,900
it's whereas if we can get together and

90
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:55,079
commune over a meal and cannabis is part

91
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,719
of that meal then uh I think we've

92
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:02,340
created a new experience and a new way

93
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:04,199
for people to get together right

94
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,120
I think more than ever the reason why I

95
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:08,280
started flower Pharma was because I I

96
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:12,060
feel like there's really a need for

97
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:14,818
people to get together and commune over

98
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,680
food I feel like since the pandemic

99
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:19,439
we've really lost that connection with

100
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:22,199
each other and

101
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:24,540
um I think cannabis sort of offers this

102
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:26,759
little in whatever waveform you shape or

103
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:30,120
form you want to have it if it's CDD CBG

104
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:33,240
THC all of the cannabinoids they can add

105
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,639
sort of this element of relaxation and a

106
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,280
point where we can just leave our

107
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:40,079
politics our religion at the door uh

108
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:41,399
come together over food and just enjoy

109
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:43,560
one another

110
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:45,719
yeah I definitely think when you look at

111
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,699
the broader Market as much as people

112
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,840
love their smoke and their flower and

113
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:51,300
all that kind of stuff I think the

114
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:53,638
easiest entry point for the Mars market

115
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,280
and a large consumer base is going to be

116
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:58,259
food and I I can picture in my mind

117
00:04:56,279 --> 00:05:00,179
groups of people leader girls in the

118
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:02,879
summer meeting for salads and there's a

119
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,740
sauce range on the table that it's a

120
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,478
much more enjoyable experience as a

121
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,978
group than as you said somebody else

122
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:10,819
saying okay let's all leave the cookie

123
00:05:07,978 --> 00:05:12,899
there right one two three go

124
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:14,339
because that's obviously going to hit

125
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:16,138
different with everybody else as well

126
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:17,758
but at least this way you get to choose

127
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:19,439
how much dressing you're putting on your

128
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,740
own individual salad based on your own

129
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:24,719
needs and wants 100 yeah dosing is

130
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,579
actually a whole other you know topic

131
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,520
that I'm sure we could spend a half hour

132
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:30,839
on a hour online but um I think it's

133
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:32,939
important because everybody does

134
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:34,799
metabolize it differently right and um

135
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:36,300
that's sort of part of the way we

136
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,939
designed this process that that

137
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,620
intentionality needs to go into it yeah

138
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:42,240
that's the more you learn in this

139
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,379
industry whether it's food and consumer

140
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,240
package Goods or whether it's

141
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:47,759
pharmaceutical grade products it seems

142
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,319
to be such a nuanced either consumption

143
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,240
method whatever it is whether you're a

144
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:52,740
patient or a consumer that everything's

145
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,918
so nuanced dead to each individual

146
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,579
person there doesn't seem to be a

147
00:05:54,918 --> 00:05:58,379
one-size-fits-all product of the

148
00:05:56,579 --> 00:06:01,198
Cannabis industry really at all and I

149
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:03,060
think the sources and the the area that

150
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,340
you're in at the moment is kind of that

151
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:08,038
the crux's point in the industry where

152
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:10,500
everybody could meet in the center I

153
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:14,159
agree with you I agree with you 100 and

154
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,899
and part of that right is is sort of I

155
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,060
think if we want to invite this new

156
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:20,758
demographic right that I think we all

157
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,259
want to include then we need we do need

158
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:24,180
to make it really

159
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:27,180
um easy

160
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,180
approachable

161
00:06:27,418 --> 00:06:33,120
um a way to teach people to find their

162
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:35,100
dose find where they're happy right and

163
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:39,060
um and explore the plant in a different

164
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:41,939
way I remember I was I was at an event

165
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:44,100
um a few months ago and we're trying to

166
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:45,180
really introduce cannabis into these

167
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:49,080
events at least here in the United

168
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:50,939
States where we can because it feels

169
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:53,099
silly to do all this business over the

170
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:54,899
bar right when

171
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,539
um over cocktails when we're the

172
00:06:54,899 --> 00:07:00,299
Cannabis industry and so we had

173
00:06:57,538 --> 00:07:02,219
beverages there cannabis Beverages and

174
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,079
uh was having a conversation with

175
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,520
someone and I said I'm just not drinking

176
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:08,399
I don't feel good I'm going to have this

177
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:10,620
and he said well I don't know

178
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:13,318
how many of those do I have

179
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:16,259
you know I know how many of these to

180
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:19,680
have and you had a glass of tequila and

181
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:22,139
and it's true right I mean we have to

182
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,579
create a space in a way where we can

183
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:25,740
find out

184
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:28,079
you know our place with that and offer

185
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,699
that to our new the new demographic that

186
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:30,899
we want to include

187
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,220
I couldn't agree with you more actually

188
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:34,198
I'm going to jump onto the next topic

189
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,580
which is cannabis consumption lounges I

190
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:37,680
know it's something that you basically

191
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:39,598
already have experience in so it just

192
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,439
transitions perfectly into it do you see

193
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:45,538
what's let's say the time period in New

194
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:47,579
York let's say let's just pick New York

195
00:07:45,538 --> 00:07:49,918
for an example where you'll be able to

196
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:52,859
go out for a brunch or you'll be able to

197
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:54,779
go out for made up drinks and it's

198
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,759
basically going to be infused food and

199
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:59,719
Infused cocktails that don't have any

200
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:02,520
alcohol or and it's all cannabis based

201
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,780
70 years away realistically do you think

202
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:05,579
we are from having one of those places

203
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:08,579
well

204
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:12,000
um in the U.S of course it's it varies

205
00:08:08,579 --> 00:08:13,698
from state to state and um it's kind of

206
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,720
an interesting

207
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:17,939
challenging demographic you know

208
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,460
situation

209
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:22,139
um and I think that for example Las

210
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:24,839
Vegas is probably a little bit ahead of

211
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:26,220
New York and that's you know sense I'm

212
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:29,339
definitely

213
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:30,419
um not the expert on lounges but I do

214
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:32,399
know

215
00:08:30,418 --> 00:08:34,679
um sort of the the trajectory of what's

216
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,019
happening and I'd say that Las Vegas Las

217
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:38,579
Vegas already has a couple

218
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:40,319
um the rest of them have just gotten

219
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:43,020
licenses and it's probably you know

220
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,300
we'll be rolling out in the next year

221
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:47,759
um they do have some um tough

222
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:49,500
restrictions that they're they're up

223
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:51,600
against and

224
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:54,720
um again New York is just the first

225
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,420
dispensary just opened the doors in um

226
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:00,360
December in New York right so we'll be a

227
00:08:57,419 --> 00:09:04,439
little further there with the lounges

228
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:06,659
um but I know the intent pin is sorry

229
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,519
just to clarify I think I might have got

230
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:10,439
my pipe mixed up yeah I understand that

231
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:12,000
Arizona that there's other states that

232
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,120
have already got consumption lounges

233
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,860
going for a major City there's got to be

234
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,740
neighborhoods that actually end up

235
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,839
converting into let's say full cannabis

236
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,720
spaces so you could have a whole block

237
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,399
in Manhattan is kind of just the idea I

238
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,339
don't know other states to give us an

239
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,080
example but in in Vegas I would imagine

240
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:33,660
that it's going to be very touristy

241
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,940
Central it's not going to be a regular

242
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:38,039
somebody who lives there's experience

243
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:40,440
that they go for every weekend let's say

244
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:44,458
a ladies who brunch that venue turns

245
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:46,440
into a cannabis type brunch menu and

246
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:47,219
do you see that happening within a

247
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,260
couple of years because we understand

248
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:51,600
there might be one or two pockets but

249
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:53,159
how long is it until we see there's

250
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,600
actually a whole area where people are

251
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:56,699
going to and that's where they're

252
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,399
consuming cannabis via food and Via

253
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:02,220
drinks on a regular basis yeah I mean I

254
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:04,200
I think that that really will will be

255
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,720
able to watch that develop in the next

256
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,519
three to five years you know some places

257
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,980
I think will be in the next year that

258
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:13,440
they'll have their places and I think

259
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:16,139
what's important is

260
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,220
um that we watch these and

261
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:19,620
um

262
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:22,019
here's the thing I think that that when

263
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:24,778
you develop a lounge we need to consider

264
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:26,820
it can't just be a place to go smoke

265
00:10:24,778 --> 00:10:28,620
right I mean you need to you will always

266
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:30,420
have your people that like their flower

267
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:33,899
and like to vape and want to go smoke

268
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:36,240
but I think that to capture this new

269
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:39,778
audience that there needs to be other

270
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,759
experiences available right and how we

271
00:10:39,778 --> 00:10:44,278
get them to stay longer is through their

272
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:46,559
food and through their beverage and

273
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:49,919
maybe there's music and maybe there's

274
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:52,500
other experiences that will encourage

275
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:57,240
people not only to stay but to come back

276
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:59,159
again right yeah and um so I I do I I

277
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,278
think that we'll start on Rolling in the

278
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:02,879
next few years I think it's essential to

279
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:05,879
um

280
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:08,578
be very mindful of the way we roll it

281
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:11,240
out I'm I you know I've heard stories

282
00:11:08,578 --> 00:11:14,519
down in Hollywood where there are

283
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:16,200
first-time users come to the lounges and

284
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:19,620
it's just they get too much and then

285
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:22,140
they just pass out and I think that um

286
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:25,320
being you know the lounges being very

287
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:29,159
mindful of having CBD on board different

288
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:31,560
ways to bring people back to Center

289
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:33,838
um is really important

290
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:35,639
um I that is something that I do in my

291
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,899
infused dinners I don't know if we're

292
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:38,399
going to talk about that more later I

293
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:40,559
can talk about it with you if you'd like

294
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:44,039
but I think it's really important the

295
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:46,979
way we unroll the dosing right per each

296
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:49,679
course for each experience right

297
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:51,539
and so is that like getting under dosing

298
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:53,039
there that's obviously a huge Factor

299
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:55,319
when it comes to the consumption of

300
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:57,360
cannabis in food is there a specific

301
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,278
like a chef's little trick where

302
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,700
everybody has their own little expertise

303
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:06,059
when it comes to dosage or is there a

304
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:08,720
program per body waste type metric that

305
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,719
people could use

306
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:17,458
sample

307
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:21,060
um in in the events that that I produce

308
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:24,539
is I'm I start out you know maybe the

309
00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:27,299
the mocktail actually has CBG which will

310
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:29,278
stimulate the appetite you know the next

311
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:31,799
course we might introduce a little bit

312
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:33,659
of THC but

313
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:35,699
um you know follow it up with a CBD

314
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:38,159
round at the end we absolutely finished

315
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:40,140
the dessert course with CBD to sort of

316
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:42,659
stabilize everyone so I I kind of do

317
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:46,078
like to take them through this plant has

318
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:50,458
so many amazing you know attributes and

319
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:52,078
cannabinoids let's explore them all and

320
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:53,879
um you know use them the way they're

321
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:55,979
intended and I think I think if we have

322
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:57,778
those things on board then we'll get

323
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,459
people coming back right because it's

324
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:01,139
it's very fascinating

325
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:02,518
couldn't agree with you more than step

326
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:03,899
those which gets done right I think

327
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:05,459
that'd be quickly repeat customers

328
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:06,958
Before I Let You Go we've got a couple

329
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:09,899
of minutes left I want to move on to

330
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:12,599
your range of oils called Ola which

331
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:14,578
obviously translate in Irish to oil tell

332
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,278
us about the reasoning behind the naming

333
00:13:14,578 --> 00:13:18,958
and is there a relatives back in Ireland

334
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:23,700
do you know it

335
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:26,338
well so uh I um I'm 50 Irish

336
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:29,399
um my my father my maiden name is

337
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:31,500
mulcaggy so I know there's there's some

338
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:33,419
of us running around there

339
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:35,339
um I haven't been back I would love to

340
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:36,958
go uh my great-grandparents are right

341
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:38,519
from Ireland

342
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:41,458
um and

343
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:43,200
I was playing when I was creating this I

344
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:45,659
had I don't know you know product

345
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,800
creation is a whole Wild game in itself

346
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:48,838
but

347
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:51,599
um I I played around with a lot of words

348
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:54,360
and I just wanted

349
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,399
um hola not only is oil her in Gaelic

350
00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:00,240
but it also means hi in Spanish and it

351
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:02,578
all means all these lovely things and

352
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,379
um and I think it's it's beautiful it's

353
00:14:02,578 --> 00:14:07,679
right from the plant I wanted to stay

354
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:09,720
very close to the plants so I think um

355
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:12,059
that has a lovely way of doing it I have

356
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,459
a couple other lines up my sleeves for

357
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:16,500
this year that um we might play with

358
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:17,578
some other Gaelic names I'll just tease

359
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,159
you with that I'm not going to tell you

360
00:14:17,578 --> 00:14:22,699
very much more but um so more to come

361
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:25,019
but that's sort of where Ola came from

362
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:27,600
incredible well I hope to get to try

363
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:29,339
