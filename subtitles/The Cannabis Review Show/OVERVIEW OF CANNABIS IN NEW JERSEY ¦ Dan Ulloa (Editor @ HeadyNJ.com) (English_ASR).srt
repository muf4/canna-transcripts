13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,719
you got into the cannabis industry and

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,960
how you're the editor of uh eddie nj

15
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,600
yeah so i i got into this you know a few

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,000
reasons you know it was something big uh

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,000
that like our governor phil murphy said

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,238
when he was running through office uh he

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,079
supported uh you know seemed like a

20
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:50,558
great industry to get into on the ground

21
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,920
floor and something that was um very

22
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:54,000
political and i've been involved in

23
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,760
politics for a long time and you know

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,759
i've been a journalist covering politics

25
00:00:55,759 --> 00:01:00,799
so covering cannabis politics in the

26
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:02,799
industry seemed like a great fit

27
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:05,039
it's okay

28
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,560
yeah yeah it's been some journey for you

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,080
so far

30
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,920
yeah

31
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:11,679
excellent so you already have experience

32
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,560
in the kind of overview of a political

33
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,840
system and how a process of regulation

34
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,519
would have already happened and you're

35
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,000
applying those skills to cannabis

36
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:23,039
industry in new jersey how long ago is

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,799
hedy nj set up uh

38
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,520
can you tell the audience

39
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:30,960
yes my business partner uh likes to be

40
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:32,879
called dknuck he set it up in 2017 when

41
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,879
it looked like governor murphy

42
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:37,679
uh was going to win the election and

43
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:39,759
that like he promised that the um the

44
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,520
cannabis would be done quickly

45
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,680
unfortunately it was not done quickly

46
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:45,118
the process was a little longer uh than

47
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,118
we liked but you know we're still moving

48
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,959
forward and it's going out really well

49
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:50,719
you know we had our uh adult use

50
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:52,719
regulations were announced and you know

51
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,798
that we're having the process for

52
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:56,718
companies to start applying for licenses

53
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,240
for that soon

54
00:01:56,718 --> 00:01:59,599
okay amazing so that's kind of leads me

55
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:01,280
up to the first topic i want to talk

56
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:03,599
about it's just an overview of the new

57
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,359
jersey situation so everybody kind of

58
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:06,879
has a clearest perspective over here in

59
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,758
europe i'm sure everybody in america

60
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:11,759
knows but can you maybe give

61
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:14,318
how far away are you guys from selling

62
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:16,159
products in the stores are there a full

63
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:17,759
range of products already available i

64
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:21,280
saw something about there being a ban on

65
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:23,679
baked goods and candy edibles is that

66
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,159
being enforced or part of the regulation

67
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,520
yes yes that's that's one of the most

68
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:29,120
difficult things about like our

69
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,840
regulations is that while they were

70
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,000
really good towards like being conducive

71
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,598
to uh small businesses opening and

72
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,400
people who had been really harmed by the

73
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:40,719
war on drugs you know uh securing a

74
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,959
cannabis license one thing is they're

75
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:44,239
not going to allow baked goods they're

76
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,598
not going to allow a lot of the

77
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:50,640
chocolates a lot of the gummies that

78
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:52,878
people really like in the underground

79
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,079
market quite unfortunately but you know

80
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:56,000
their internal

81
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,400
regulations they might be changed within

82
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,639
a year so we'll see about that but we do

83
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,039
have our medical cannabis dispensaries

84
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:06,399
uh that sell like they do have flour at

85
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:09,359
least so i mean a few concentrates and

86
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,680
lozenges uh so though that uh we're

87
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,519
looking at sometime next year in the

88
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,760
first half of the year either winter or

89
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:19,200
spring we're looking for the official

90
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:21,919
start of the adobe sales to begin

91
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,598
okay amazing and is it is it a

92
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:25,039
free-for-all for brands who are selling

93
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:27,359
flower now in new jersey is it the

94
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:31,359
people who get in get the best locations

95
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,879
the best retail stores set up or uh what

96
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,799
how exactly would the flower be

97
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:37,039
dispensed has it gone through a medical

98
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,640
facility or is it going through a

99
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:40,239
dispensary

100
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,639
yes we have like our medical

101
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,878
dispensaries uh most many of them are

102
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:47,839
going to be allowed to uh sell don't use

103
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:50,158
cannabis so they'll be the ones uh

104
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,080
dispensing the cannabis and then you

105
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:53,598
know we're going to have a license

106
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,760
application

107
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:58,959
process for more dispensaries

108
00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:00,719
exclusively adult use so that's like uh

109
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,400
that process those dispensaries might

110
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,719
take a year or two

111
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,519
to open at least while like our medical

112
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:09,759
dispensaries can start sailing next year

113
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,158
okay so it seems to be there slowly

114
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:13,840
slowly methods so uh yeah burn

115
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:15,438
themselves too badly just in case

116
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,439
anything did go wrong whereas nothing's

117
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:19,439
obviously gonna go wrong we know this

118
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:21,040
can you maybe as a political writer and

119
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:23,439
somebody who has an overview from a

120
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,160
political background explain cannabis

121
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:29,279
control board in new jersey and around

122
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,000
america what is the criteria made up of

123
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:33,519
for these boards to be created is it uh

124
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,360
civil servants who've been working in

125
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,758
government a long time mixed with

126
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,319
business folk or what exactly is the

127
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,600
criteria for in new jersey's cannabis

128
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,120
control board

129
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,840
so that's a really good question so we

130
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,840
have ours is the cannabis regulatory

131
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:50,319
commission in new york it's the cannabis

132
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:52,799
control boards but they're very similar

133
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:54,560
uh i would say so in new jersey it's

134
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,360
really people who have been involved in

135
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,439
the policy and the politics of this

136
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,600
and uh they're all they're all political

137
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:02,800
and appointees for example so it's

138
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,919
really

139
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,079
um

140
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:07,439
a partisan process in that respect but

141
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:09,279
then like a lot of the people who have

142
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:11,120
done who

143
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:12,879
who were appointed to our board we have

144
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,478
five people in new jersey you know they

145
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:17,199
have like a lot of great experience in

146
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:19,038
the policy of this but people have like

147
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,520
criticized it saying that you know

148
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:23,599
there's nobody in the industry on the on

149
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:27,279
the board but then there's nobody with

150
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,439
who could be influenced that way too

151
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:31,519
okay so it's a it's a

152
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:33,680
there's a double-edged sword there that

153
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:36,639
having industry people generally does

154
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,879
help make the the legislation and the

155
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,560
overview of the industry that little bit

156
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,399
clearer for the people writing the rules

157
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,000
but at the same time they don't have a

158
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,159
vested interest when there's nobody in

159
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
there who doesn't have a toe in the

160
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,439
industry per se

161
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,360
yeah yes that's really the catch so so

162
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:55,199
far like our crc has done a good job

163
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,360
it's just as you were saying you know

164
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,199
slowly but surely we're getting there so

165
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,319
one just has to understand that place

166
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,319
right now

167
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,639
and do you guys have a limited amount of

168
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,560
licenses or is it a

169
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,840
an open market system that there is

170
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,759
there is no cap on the amount of

171
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:11,119
applications that can come in there's

172
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,639
just a certain

173
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,478
crate or a

174
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,879
level that businesses will have to be

175
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:18,399
set up by i'm sure you just don't get

176
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:20,639
handed a license you have to prove the

177
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:22,638
premises exists capital in the bank

178
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,800
accounts board of directors have to be

179
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,079
vetted and all that pertinent

180
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,680
information

181
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:29,680
yes that's a really good question

182
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,680
because we've been having like a problem

183
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,160
with like our medical

184
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:37,360
uh cannabis cannabis whereby we only

185
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:40,080
have 23 licensed uh dispensary locations

186
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,840
but we only have 12 license holders for

187
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:43,519
medical cannabis and that process has

188
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:45,918
been very elaborate with need for like

189
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:48,079
great amounts of capital so we're really

190
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:51,839
looking for towards like adult use where

191
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:55,120
there's only one official uh cap 37

192
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:56,079
large-scale uh cultivators

193
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,879
uh

194
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:01,038
will be the max um but that even that is

195
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:04,478
like a two-year thing that ends february

196
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:07,038
2023 so otherwise there are no caps and

197
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:09,360
there's no caps on micro uh cultivation

198
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:11,360
either so that's that's one of the

199
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,120
things that's really heartening uh that

200
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,639
makes me like excited about our adult

201
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,319
use market yeah

202
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,240
yeah i think the utilities market is

203
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,598
where everybody has the real excitement

204
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,439
in can you maybe give us um

205
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:24,879
how long does the process for a license

206
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:26,800
take currently at the moment or do you

207
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:29,360
see a lot of the brands waiting for the

208
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,038
recreational licenses to come up or are

209
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,160
they already available for business to

210
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:34,639
apply for

211
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:38,240
no no so the the interim regulations

212
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,960
were released in august uh the um nobody

213
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,240
the

214
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:45,439
request for applications rfa process has

215
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,199
not yet begun uh but it is like a really

216
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:48,560
good question like what the process is

217
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,639
going to look like because like our

218
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,720
medical cannabis license process has

219
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,960
been very difficult that it was very

220
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,199
expensive that so few companies have

221
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:59,680
been licensed so this is really trying

222
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,759
to change the whole process

223
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,280
and create a new process it's a lot

224
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,280
easier but it's one of those things

225
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:06,878
we're still seeing like how it's going

226
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:09,598
to play out

227
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,520
and in terms of taxation has that been

228
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:13,279
set as they're being

229
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,198
kicked back from the industry so far

230
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:17,679
have they said a ridiculous taxation

231
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,478
level to uh products into the industry

232
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,478
or has they been reasonable and sensible

233
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:24,000
yeah you know we're actually reasonable

234
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:26,079
in that fashion i think a lot of people

235
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,478
were looking at california or that they

236
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:30,800
have with some say like no like an

237
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:33,278
oppressive tax that makes it that their

238
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,000
grain market in california is insanely

239
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:38,080
thriving because the tax is so terrible

240
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,440
so we have a competitive tax we're

241
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,000
actually better than new york in that

242
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,599
way so i'm excited for that actually so

243
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,480
we'll see what happens

244
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,399
okay and do you see the kind of brings

245
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,639
me on to the last topic now the players

246
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,039
in new jersey do you see the players in

247
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:54,480
new jersey being the cookies the players

248
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:56,639
that are already kind of already

249
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,560
established in the the certain other

250
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:00,958
states that have legalization or do you

251
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,639
see uh entrepreneurs in new jersey in

252
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,479
new york that could take the eastern

253
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,080
seaboard by storm

254
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,480
yeah i think we really here in new

255
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,480
jersey want like our locals to receive

256
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,039
the licenses we really want to create

257
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:16,000
local uh companies you know there's a

258
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:18,480
lot of them here that have a lot of

259
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,639
entrepreneurials uh entrepreneurs here a

260
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,440
lot of people with a lot of like zesty

261
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:26,080
like create a company get that going and

262
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:29,279
you know we have in our um regulations

263
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,200
that micro licenses are favored those in

264
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:33,439
like neighborhoods that were really

265
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,160
impacted by the war on drugs are going

266
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,519
to uh be favored and getting a license

267
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:40,000
and we're looking to really see like

268
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:42,720
companies like that you know we already

269
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,759
have you know of our 12 license holders

270
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,080
10 of them already multi-state operators

271
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:50,240
mso so like i guess like a few the few

272
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,879
remaining ones might be able to get one

273
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,560
in but the ideal is really you know to

274
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:56,480
favor small businesses you know the

275
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,958
small manufacturers that make like the

276
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,720
giordelli's chocolate for example of

277
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,799
cannabis something like the high end or

278
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,959
the niche product like that where's the

279
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:07,199
pbr the pbr of cannabis too you know

280
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:08,399
something like niche kind of like quirky

281
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,759
that way you know we're looking for

282
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,759
products like that and that's what

283
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:14,078
people are really excited about

284
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:15,278
so it's gonna be really interesting yeah

285
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:17,199
i think there's definitely gonna be a

286
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:18,320
territorial aspect about this where

287
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,959
everybody's going to want to have their

288
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,959
own brand or their own unique product

289
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:25,039
that's reflective of their demographic

290
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:26,958
and their to exact territory that you

291
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:28,879
might love coca-cola but you'd always

292
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:31,199
buy a local farmer's cola if you bought

293
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:32,879
it at the market type thing

294
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,560
yeah yeah so that'll be like really

295
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:36,078
interesting to see

296
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:37,919
and then like there's restrictions

297
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:39,278
around brands because then like if

298
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:41,759
you're going to be selling cannabis you

299
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:44,320
can't really have a mascot so companies

300
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:46,399
can actually like really be creative i

301
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,560
think in the way they brand themselves

302
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,399
and differentiate themselves because

303
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:52,879
arguably like i haven't really seen a

304
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:56,000
lot of differentiation a lot of like

305
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:57,519
interesting brands in our market so far

306
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,200
and i think that's one of the things

307
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,879
about cannabis in general is that like a

308
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,079
lot of these brands are not that

309
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:04,000
memorable

310
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,679
i'd say like cookies is up there but

311
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,320
like who else

312
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:09,679
but this is the thing we think that uh

313
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,959
there's certain territories i think

314
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:12,719
ireland is definitely going to be one of

315
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:15,199
them once legalization fully comes here

316
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,560
and we've got to grow at home laws and

317
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,240
we've got some of the best farmers in

318
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:19,599
the world over here i don't know for a

319
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,720
minute that there'll be a number of

320
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,639
strains

321
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,278
genetics created out of this country and

322
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:26,958
a number of baked goods and uh edible

323
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:29,120
products because if we're renowned for

324
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:31,199
two things it's farmer and good food so

325
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,039
i can see uh europe definitely coming to

326
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,800
the to the global market when it all

327
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:36,399
gets legalized over here

328
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:38,000
oh yeah that would be really interesting

329
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,440
yeah like i always hear about ireland

330
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,958
you know they say like the guinness is

331
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,360
different because the waters would be

332
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:45,838
interesting to see what like what unique

333
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,839

selection from yet what's the number one

355
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,000
thing you're looking forward to

356
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,879
yeah so like the like the opening of our

357
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,958
adult use market should be interesting

358
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:35,439
and uh it'll be interesting to see like

359
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:37,679
what products are available because

360
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,959
that's been initially our medical

361
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:40,559
cannabis

362
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,359
has also

363
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:43,039
been

364
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,639
has not been like really like high

365
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:46,000
quality it's also been like a little

366
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,000
expensive

367
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,679
so we're hoping that like eventually

368
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,440
that goes away and seeing like

369
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:53,919
affordable cannabis

370
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,399
seeing like different uh unix trains and

371
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:57,919
unique uh flower will be like really

372
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,839
interesting and seeing like a lot of

373
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:02,000
these like new companies like getting up

374
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,079
and running getting licenses

375
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,919
will be like really interesting so i'm

376
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:08,159
excited for that you know people say you

377
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,919
know we new jersey could have the second

378
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,240
biggest market in the united states

379
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:13,919
after california because we because

380
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,079
unlike california it's really easy to go

381
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:17,759
from like city to city like on the east

382
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:20,159
coast here for example baltimore

383
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:21,360
maryland washington dc philadelphia

384
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:23,679
pittsburgh they're all pretty close

385
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,360
three-hour drive for the weekend and

386
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:28,000
their states really aren't moving

387
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,240
cannabis so as the first mover you know

388
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
we could really have you know the uh the

389
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,919
advantage there

390
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,759
so there's got to be a tourism corridor

391
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:38,958
for smoking the best place on the east

392
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:41,600
coast within the next few years is there

393
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:43,518
yeah yeah that's what we're having here

394
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,040
