00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:13,798
Cannabis review I'm delighted to joined

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,878
in this episode by guo Rodriguez who's a

5
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:18,519
virtual

6
00:00:14,878 --> 00:00:19,640
CFO uh how are you keeping today yo I am

7
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:22,559
doing

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,199
good how are you Owen I'm fantastic

9
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,479
thank you very much for taking your time

10
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:28,039
to do this uh it's very interesting side

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,039
of the industry that I'm sure a lot of

12
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:31,439
people will gain a lot of value out of

13
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:33,120
you maybe start off though by giving

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,119
everybody a little background overview

15
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:40,199
on your how you came to your position in

16
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:42,959
the industry sure um I'm a I'm a CPA and

17
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,960
you know the the short version is um I

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,759
became I always say this I came a CPA

19
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,239
because I I wanted to to make money and

20
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:52,159
move out of my parents house when I was

21
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:55,358
in college and so um after I graduated I

22
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:57,799
went into a very typical uh accounting

23
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:59,960
position you know accountants do things

24
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:03,280
uh do financial statements and look into

25
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:06,640
into the past and so I did that for a

26
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:10,000
few years but the moment that changed

27
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:13,159
for me was about halfway in through my

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,118
now 15year career I was working for a

29
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:18,080
large construction company and we had to

30
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:20,759
make an acquisition and so I know you

31
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:22,599
hear a lot about now fpna departments

32
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,640
large companies have Financial Planning

33
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:28,158
and Analysis professionals these are the

34
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,040
people that help uh do forecasting raise

35
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,159
Capital look at what products are

36
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:35,759
profitable and and just analysis to make

37
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:38,479
better decisions and so at that point I

38
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,719
really moved more into U an fpna

39
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:43,640
position a forward-looking position

40
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:45,718
because I had to uh create a forecast

41
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,879
for this acquisition and so I changed

42
00:01:45,718 --> 00:01:52,000
from an accounting career into more of a

43
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:55,519
corporate finance uh professional and so

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,759
I did that for for a few years uh it was

45
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:59,560
it was very exciting because I was

46
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,359
getting to do some new things and really

47
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,680
is where the accounting profession is

48
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:06,478
now moving um if you look at accounting

49
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,439
firms the majority of the revenue now is

50
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:11,360
coming from Consulting so companies are

51
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:13,079
not just wanting uh you know financial

52
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,760
reporting and taxes but they're also

53
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,120
looking for advisors they're looking for

54
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:20,000
that Financial relationship to help

55
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,560
their their companies grow and so I was

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,318
fine doing that in the corporate world I

57
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,959
think where everything changed for me

58
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:31,238
and I'll get to how I got into cannabis

59
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:34,519
was uh Co happened and around that

60
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:36,239
time um you know the solution was stand

61
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:37,840
six feet apart and all these different

62
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,759
kinds of things which was good in the

63
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,200
shortterm but I was really thinking

64
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,479
through this is like what's a really

65
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:47,399
long-term solution like we can't do this

66
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:50,238
forever right and what I I was really

67
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:54,239
influenced by U ayurvedic medicine that

68
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:56,000
talks about prevention of disease and I

69
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,080
I I think at that moment I did some

70
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,080
training on that and and it was during

71
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,840
the covid years and and I said yeah

72
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,400
that's it I mean that's my approach to

73
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,000
health is more about prevention and so

74
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,519
um we weren't doing that during the

75
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,080
pandemic and uh my company was having

76
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,719
those those kinds of you know

77
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,040
regulations that I I couldn't agree with

78
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:17,280
and and I couldn't move forward in so so

79
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:19,798
I left and uh decided to become an

80
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,719
independent consultant and it was during

81
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:24,400
that year that I that I found cannabis

82
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:27,400
started researching different Industries

83
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,400
and I said well here's an industry where

84
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,560
uh people are moving forward with their

85
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,959
own approach to health regardless of

86
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,519
Regulation and so for me it was all

87
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,920
about empowerment and people choosing

88
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:41,480
their own path to well-being and I felt

89
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:44,639
that cannabis was doing that and then on

90
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:46,560
top of that um all the expungement um

91
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:49,479
the other piece of the industry that's

92
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,039
going on is the um you know I look at it

93
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:54,119
the the restorative justice piece where

94
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:58,959
uh the laws are changing the punitive

95
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:00,200
outdated laws um around cannabis um

96
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,438
criminal activity

97
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:04,479
are changing and so I said well these

98
00:04:02,438 --> 00:04:06,039
two things I really want to be a part of

99
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:08,759
especially because I was in a

100
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:10,519
restorative justice Ministry at the time

101
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:13,639
and I felt it was a great industry to

102
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:16,399
get into um not knowing how challenging

103
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:18,719
the industry would be at the time but um

104
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:22,359
at that point um over that next year I

105
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,680
joined virtual um Andre virtual CFO by

106
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,879
Anders and uh became one of their

107
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,360
virtual CFOs and now I'm leading up the

108
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:31,839
the Cannabis

109
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,600
vertical it's seems like one of the key

110
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:35,799
components for any good cannabis company

111
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,039
is going to be hiring a good CFO and a

112
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:41,079
lot of good CFOs have a very substantial

113
00:04:38,038 --> 00:04:43,000
pay packet associated with that can you

114
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:44,879
explain to everybody what is a virtual

115
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,720
CEO what are the benefits of using a

116
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:51,279
virtual CEO over hver an in-person

117
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:54,120
person right most most large companies

118
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:55,679
have an in-house hired on Virtual CFOs

119
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,439
yes as you mentioned it it's very

120
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,918
expensive right and that doesn't even

121
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:02,038
cover the support team around the the

122
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:04,240
CFO right you need a senior accountant

123
00:05:02,038 --> 00:05:07,199
maybe a controller all that cost

124
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:10,199
together can be pretty high and so

125
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,080
companies of the you know 2 million to

126
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:14,560
20 million

127
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:16,319
range that's just a really big cost I

128
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,038
mean you really just can't afford it and

129
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:20,639
it'll eat into your margins and and you

130
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:24,240
don't need it right you don't really

131
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,840
need a full-on CFO at that at that size

132
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,720
and so what a virtual CFO is and what we

133
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:31,839
do is we provide the same level of

134
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:35,199
service but at a at a fraction of the

135
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:39,038
cost and at a set weekly rate and what a

136
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:41,600
virtual CFO is comes in and it's a it's

137
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:43,360
a relationship where the clients really

138
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,759
know their business they know what's

139
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,879
going on and hopefully um they've

140
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:50,919
thought through strategy but what we do

141
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:53,639
is we come in on the financial side

142
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:55,719
right and we help the OPM that

143
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:57,840
operational side with the financial side

144
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,479
to help move the business forward and

145
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:02,038
provide the financial support that that

146
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:04,199
business owner needs that that client

147
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:06,159
needs to move forward so that's it

148
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:08,079
really starts so the foundation of that

149
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,639
is what we call Dynamic

150
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:13,560
forecasting um right now we're in

151
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,879
February so here over the last couple of

152
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,800
months we've been setting what we call a

153
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:20,279
financial plan um a lot of people refer

154
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,439
to that as a

155
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:25,519
budget and and that's fine but that's

156
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:28,639
really set in stone at the beginning of

157
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:30,359
the year we take it a step further and

158
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,160
we build a dynamic IC forecast that

159
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,360
we're really updating every month um as

160
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:38,319
we meet with our clients because because

161
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,919
things change right and so um in that

162
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,800
way we help our clients look into the

163
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:47,120
future and so that's really what we're

164
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:49,000
trying to do is help give them uh a view

165
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,680
into the future of their business to

166
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,079
make better

167
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,720
decisions it would seem the main

168
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:57,918
objective of all entrepreneurs and

169
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,759
Founders is to grow a valuable company

170
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:03,279
what are the let's say say three steps

171
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:06,598
that you would say or the three must do

172
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:09,638
for entrepreneurs to ensure that to grow

173
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:11,800
a valuable company is I mean 10 million

174
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:13,439
plus type of range that it's not a small

175
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,000
amount I think we all agree that an

176
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,199
entrepreneur can create a small to

177
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,839
medium size Enterprise just on pure

178
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,199
determination and drive but that step up

179
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:24,119
into an eight figure or nine fig style

180
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:27,478
company what are the three kind of core

181
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:31,478
components of what does that look like

182
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:33,519
yeah absolutely well first I would say

183
00:07:31,478 --> 00:07:36,560
especially in cannabis right you don't

184
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:39,959
want to ruin the value of of your

185
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:42,839
company um I've worked in m&amp;a and due

186
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:44,959
diligence and the first thing that

187
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:46,918
anybody does is they're going to come

188
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:49,158
over as they're going to acquire your

189
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:52,158
company uh or purchase your company is

190
00:07:49,158 --> 00:07:54,158
turn over every stone every tax return

191
00:07:52,158 --> 00:07:56,598
uh financial statements you know dig

192
00:07:54,158 --> 00:08:00,360
through the transactions especially on a

193
00:07:56,598 --> 00:08:02,680
larger uh company purchase and so the

194
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,240
first step is compliance right it's

195
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:08,400
compliance uh with your tax return with

196
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:10,400
your 401k plan all the different areas

197
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:13,158
that a buyer would come in we want to

198
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:16,839
make sure all of that is is clean

199
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:20,279
another area that that we find um a lot

200
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:21,878
of issues in is is expenses especially

201
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:25,038
with small business you have a lot of

202
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:26,479
co-mingling of personal expenses within

203
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:28,199
the business and then that's something

204
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:30,478
that has to be cleaned out and so we

205
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:33,839
really want to separate that out make

206
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:36,799
sure we have a a clean set of financials

207
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:39,680
that a buyer can come in and and quickly

208
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,240
uh you know assess the value of of the

209
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,838
business because it's just like buying a

210
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,399
house you know you want to have it nice

211
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:46,760
and clean and have good curve appeal

212
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,000
make the transaction easy for somebody

213
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:51,120
coming in as well as build a lot of

214
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,679
value in the company for for a strategic

215
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:57,320
buyer that might want to come in and and

216
00:08:53,679 --> 00:09:01,519
fit in your business into theirs um the

217
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:05,200
other piece is cash flow that's a really

218
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:09,159
tough area in can in cannabis because as

219
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:13,079
markets mature competition gets very

220
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:16,319
heavy um prices start to come down but

221
00:09:13,078 --> 00:09:19,078
also in the US we have a very punitive

222
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,040
uh tax situation at the federal level

223
00:09:19,078 --> 00:09:24,838
and so the effective tax rate for most

224
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:26,919
of these cannabis companies is well

225
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:29,240
above the average that a typical company

226
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:31,399
would pay let's say a corporate tax rate

227
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:34,079
to 40% for a normal company would be

228
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:38,240
somewhere around could be 80 to 90% And

229
00:09:34,078 --> 00:09:42,120
so the cash after taxes uh it's a it's a

230
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:45,200
tough situation and so I say that um to

231
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:48,120
make the point that the the key area is

232
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,360
to know how you're going to scale as you

233
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,078
add a second retail location as you

234
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:56,240
acquire property and the key around that

235
00:09:53,078 --> 00:09:58,719
is the visibility is understanding how

236
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,879
you're going to have more efficiency

237
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,800
around your cost as you grow or what

238
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:06,200
cash it was going to take to run the

239
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:08,359
business as you're scaling because it

240
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,879
takes some time you know say you're

241
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:13,480
opening up a third retail location right

242
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:16,360
there's some upfront cost until you get

243
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,480
that retail location running to full

244
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:21,200
efficiency and so th those are the kinds

245
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,240
of things that um sometimes at a very

246
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:27,480
specific level we help point out for our

247
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:29,320
clients or on a on AIT on a larger level

248
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,600
um through a financial statement for for

249
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,000
casting what what that might look like

250
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,278
and so sometimes it's I want to hire one

251
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,200
person what does my productivity need to

252
00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:41,919
be um you know to to pay for the cost of

253
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,200
this person over the next few months how

254
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:45,719
long is it going to take me to get this

255
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,040
payoff and so we help going to look

256
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,720
through all those

257
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:52,240
scenarios and help help our help the

258
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:55,040
clients scale so that they're grow in

259
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,639
Revenue but hopefully they can keep that

260
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:59,078
overhead uh pretty steady into where

261
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:00,360
they're they're not growing their cost

262
00:10:59,078 --> 00:11:01,319
as they're growing their revenue that's

263
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,759
the goal

264
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:07,040
there yeah it would seem that H the

265
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:08,559
facto that entrepreneurs are Risk Takers

266
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:10,319
and a lot of them don't necessarily have

267
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,759
Financial Acumen when they first set up

268
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,440
their company and the bad ones spend

269
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:16,600
money that they shouldn't have spent too

270
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,720
early and the good ones manage to get

271
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,839
financial advice either on The Advisory

272
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:26,240
board or via employment because without

273
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:28,079
that Financial guard rails put up you

274
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,240
can end up making a number of missteps

275
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:32,519
that could take years to recover for

276
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,480
your company but what are the metrics

277
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:36,200
that you guys look for when it comes to

278
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,639
measuring companies within the Cannabis

279
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,639
industry what are the the the key

280
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:44,759
factors that you guys look for sure we

281
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:48,600
we advise on it's a it's it's a kind of

282
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:50,838
our core Consulting approach for for all

283
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:54,959
businesses um but I'll get more specific

284
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:56,519
into into cannabis is that um for a

285
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,679
virtual CFO service sometimes we're

286
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:02,159
meeting with our clients up to six times

287
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:04,519
a mon month um one might be a financial

288
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:06,719
review another might be we'll we'll look

289
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:08,200
over the production metrics and then the

290
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,800
customer metrics and then we'll have a

291
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,278
series of cash flow meetings um so

292
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:14,240
that's what a typical month might look

293
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:16,838
like for for a

294
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,360
client and that's really around the

295
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:22,120
metrics so if you if you divide it up

296
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:25,039
the the very top of a let's say we

297
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:27,799
you're looking at an income statement uh

298
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:30,439
you have your sales minus the cost of of

299
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:32,359
the product say for a cannabis retailer

300
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:36,199
that's what we call the the production

301
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:39,399
or the sales and we really dig

302
00:12:36,198 --> 00:12:41,679
into how those sales are divided up in

303
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:44,919
terms of different form

304
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:48,519
factors and then we want to really take

305
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:51,519
a look at what the average sale average

306
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:54,440
value of each transaction is and so here

307
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:57,839
in the in the US every state is a little

308
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:00,839
bit different the states that have more

309
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:03,040
competition will have lower averages um

310
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:06,399
newer markets might have higher

311
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:09,480
transaction sizes but in any case we

312
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:12,159
want to track where that trans average

313
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:15,399
transaction size is week to week and see

314
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:17,198
if it's changing um because that that's

315
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:18,879
where we can really help the the

316
00:13:17,198 --> 00:13:19,919
retailer in this case if we're talking

317
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:23,720
about

318
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:25,719
retail understand well how can we

319
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,879
increase this number where do we need to

320
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,278
get it in order to achieve the level of

321
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:33,198
net income that that we set out right or

322
00:13:30,278 --> 00:13:34,240
to maximize that source that location's

323
00:13:33,198 --> 00:13:36,359
uh

324
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,079
profitability um and then the number of

325
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,519
transactions right the number of

326
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:43,439
transactions and the foot traffic coming

327
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:45,519
into into the store so we can track the

328
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,720
conversion and then the other piece of

329
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,959
that is that's where we can really pull

330
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:53,440
out well our transaction size number of

331
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:56,039
transactions coming down and we'll look

332
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:59,880
at the customer metrics and so a big one

333
00:13:56,039 --> 00:14:03,480
there is the customer retention um on

334
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:06,480
average cannabis consumers or customers

335
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,240
have very short uh you know lifetime

336
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,959
value because they're they're jumping

337
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,480
around looking for for deals

338
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:16,039
particularly in the flower category and

339
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,800
so we'll track the average lifetime of a

340
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:20,799
customer as well as the retention so we

341
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:24,078
can see okay what what do we need to do

342
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:26,599
to go out and recapture that customer

343
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:29,519
and then lastly is the the

344
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:32,959
financial metrics um

345
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:35,039
so we're looking at gross margin um for

346
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:37,198
a retailer the very highest that you

347
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,439
know you'll see is somewhere around 50%

348
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:44,240
gross margin that's just the sales minus

349
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:47,800
the cost um and overhead as a percentage

350
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:50,320
of Revenue and net income and so typical

351
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:53,278
retailers those that are profitable are

352
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,079
somewhere around 15 to 20% if you look

353
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:57,838
at their very bottom line on their

354
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:59,439
income statement they're doing about 15%

355
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:03,079
of Revenue

356
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:06,240
um but all that to say is that very few

357
00:15:03,078 --> 00:15:09,039
are profitable in this environment and

358
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,399
so uh something that's you know very

359
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:14,198
exciting and and coming up as you as you

360
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:15,639
well know is is the reschedule and so

361
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:17,198
that would eliminate you think that

362
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:19,480
that's going to bring a wave of m&amp;a

363
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:21,159
activity this rescheduling because

364
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,920
that's initially I would I would imagine

365
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:24,319
what's going to happen the industry is

366
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:26,240
the people who don't know how to run a

367
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,600
business and read a balance sheet end up

368
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:32,079
getting uh swarmed by the heavily vested

369
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,120
and highly capitalized companies that

370
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:36,719
can just m&amp;a their way to

371
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:39,480
dominance I'm I'm hoping not you know

372
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,839
are um so many folks get into this

373
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,759
industry not really wanting to sell you

374
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:47,160
know before they build a very valuable

375
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:51,600
company obviously um or for the long

376
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:53,519
term and so I think for what I call the

377
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,319
you know the Main Street cannabis the

378
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,399
the the the folks that are maybe

379
00:15:55,318 --> 00:16:00,240
firsttime business owners um you know

380
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:05,159
the plan is wasn't to to sell the

381
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:07,680
business so so quickly and so um there's

382
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:10,799
there's not as much or any institutional

383
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:13,719
capital in in cannabis right now it's

384
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:15,120
going to take a few more couple of years

385
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:19,360
but I could I would see you're going to

386
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:22,198
see a lot more m&amp;a activity um this year

387
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,278
and and next year um but my hope is that

388
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:26,399
a lot of these companies can get to

389
00:16:24,278 --> 00:16:28,159
profitability with the reschedule and

390
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,720
the extra cash flow that's going to be

391
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:33,838
coming in in um from the lower tax rate

392
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,199
to avoid a lot of that consolidation

393
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,519
that's going to happen in in the

394
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:40,000
industry but some of it is inevitable

395
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:42,318
just because of the cash flow issues

396
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,519
