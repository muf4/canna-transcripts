00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:11,320
welcome everybody to the next episode of

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,080
the Cannabis review I'm delighted to be

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,879
joined to this episode by Tim Daly who's

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,118
the CEO at True Green Green Global over

6
00:00:15,878 --> 00:00:20,559
at America smart packaging technology

7
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:21,960
company how you keeping today Tim all is

8
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:23,839
well thank you very much and happy New

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,000
Year to you thanks for having me on

10
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:26,278
thank you very much I'm delighted to

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,399
have you on you guys are one of the hot

12
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:29,599
new companies in the American industry

13
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:31,079
at the moment can you maybe give

14
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,520
everybody a little overview of your

15
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:35,119
history and business to dat and how you

16
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,559
ended up a True Green Global absolutely

17
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:39,839
and and thank you for that introduction

18
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:42,959
that's fabulous so uh my my career has

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,640
been spent in uh iot so in create

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,039
creating smart objects smart rooms

21
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:51,320
typically to add value so the the

22
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,120
typically use case is supply chain So

23
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,960
digitizing Physical objects digitizing

24
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:59,399
physical rooms to track things as they

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,759
move through so essentially moving

26
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,359
terrestrial data sets into the digital

27
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:06,478
into the into the cloud for Value

28
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:08,560
whether it be knowing where things are

29
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:11,000
so you can do accurate instantaneous

30
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,280
inventory counts cycle counts or

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,560
creating intelligent objects that know

32
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,439
exactly who they are where they are uh

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,280
and can prevent provide some sort of uh

34
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:24,559
value for an end user so uh use cases

35
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:28,239
like authentication tamper detection

36
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,240
open close messages

37
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:35,040
Etc okay interesting and moving on to

38
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:37,239
True Green Global in terms of the supply

39
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,600
chain where it is do you see the True

40
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:42,199
Green Global adds value to the supply

41
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:44,078
chain so what what's interesting in

42
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,240
cannabis it's it's truly a broken

43
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:50,319
industry um it's a asent industry in the

44
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:52,519
United States and unlike traditional

45
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:55,839
Industries manufacturing government

46
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:58,959
retail globally that use best practices

47
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,600
in supply chain cannabis is an area that

48
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:04,078
where the supply chain is effectively

49
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:06,839
broken it's currently an analog process

50
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:09,478
so you have individuals touching every

51
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,959
item scanning them with a barcode reader

52
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,800
putting them down and touching the next

53
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:16,159
one so in an industry that's highly

54
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,640
regulated like cannabis where there's

55
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:22,479
requirement to do individual unit counts

56
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:25,759
cycle counts Etc either on a daily

57
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:27,518
monthly uh or quarterly basis when you

58
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:28,759
have the human element involved there's

59
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:30,400
going to be errors there's going to be

60
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:32,479
it's expensive

61
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,480
uh there's significant amount of Errors

62
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:37,719
so it's a simple matter to take the best

63
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:40,560
practices of supply chain that are used

64
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:43,359
globally and bring them into an industry

65
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,680
I.E cannabis that darely needs them so

66
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,040
it creates incredible efficiencies saves

67
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,400
time saves money reduces all those

68
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:54,519
errors and helps keep businesses

69
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,680
compliant with the regulatory

70
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:58,599
requirements and from my research as

71
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,360
well I seem you guys are adding value at

72
00:02:58,598 --> 00:03:01,639
the payments side of things can you

73
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,879
elaborate a little bit on that for the

74
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:05,878
audience so that and thanks for bringing

75
00:03:03,878 --> 00:03:08,280
that up that's an exciting area we've

76
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:10,959
been we've uh recently acquired a

77
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,759
company that uh had over the last three

78
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:17,000
years built out a hyperledger fabric

79
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:18,719
payment solution and this solution was

80
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
specifically built for the Cannabis

81
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:24,560
industry so as I mentioned a minute ago

82
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,560
the supply chain side has been broken in

83
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,920
cannabis uh the payment side as well is

84
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,199
broken there in the United States so

85
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:35,158
there's truly no effective legal

86
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:37,518
efficient lowcost payment solution

87
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:39,759
available uh of course part of this goes

88
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,280
to the fact that cannabis is currently a

89
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:45,399
scheduled and illegal substance at the

90
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,799
federal level um but there just are no

91
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,920
Payment Solutions there's ATM Solutions

92
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:52,239
they're expensive They Don't Really Work

93
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:55,318
Well and they're skating the skating on

94
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,759
the edge of legality so the other thing

95
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:59,438
that uh to on the other side that we

96
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:01,878
brought of course is the payment side

97
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:04,878
and so we've purchased this company uh

98
00:04:01,878 --> 00:04:08,120
they are the first block stable coin

99
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:10,479
blockchain payment solution that instead

100
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,360
of skirting the SEC in the United States

101
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:14,878
they went directly to the SEC about

102
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:19,400
three years ago worked with the

103
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:23,240
SEC uh to prove that this solution is a

104
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:25,399
is truly a um security and that is

105
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:28,720
should be registered and and and

106
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:30,198
regulated by the SEC so this solution is

107
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,400
the first

108
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:37,038
Global approved SEC stable coin payment

109
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,799
solution and in the most simplistic

110
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:41,680
sense because everything I just said is

111
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,639
is very technical and confusing but

112
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,400
suffice to say we are rolling out in the

113
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:50,160
first quarter of this year within the

114
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:53,599
United States a Starbucks Starbucks app

115
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,800
like payment solution for cannabis so uh

116
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,800
download your Starbucks app you uh

117
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,960
answer some basic questions because this

118
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,960
is an SC register security you've got to

119
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:06,439
answer the know your customer rule

120
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:07,879
anti-money laundering Rule and then once

121
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:09,800
that's done you'll connect your bank

122
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:12,159
account to the app you'll upload let's

123
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,680
say $100 like you would in Starbucks

124
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,120
that $100 is directly deposited into US

125
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:20,000
money market account you'll walk into

126
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,160
your dispensary make your purchase

127
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,360
you'll show your phone the bud tender

128
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,560
will scan the phone it'll remove from

129
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,919
your wallet those dollars for your

130
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,280
purchase and all is good with the world

131
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:36,758
and this is all done using an SEC

132
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:38,959
approved patented stable coin

133
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:40,919
platform yeah I think the key word from

134
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:42,638
that there you said is Solutions the

135
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:44,000
more I researched into the company the

136
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,120
more it is that you guys are actually

137
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,519
providing poor and key key solutions for

138
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,959
businesses across the the Cannabis

139
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,918
industry I wanted to move now on to the

140
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:56,159
smart packaging side of things and the

141
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:58,599
technology behind it most people might

142
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,120
have heard of nearfield communication

143
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:03,039
but the ultra high frequency radio

144
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,918
frequency identification can you maybe

145
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:07,759
elaborate on what is behind the

146
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:10,639
technology so everybody could understand

147
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:14,400
sure yeah so UHF ultra high frequency

148
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:16,680
RFID is the global standard for

149
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:18,120
digitizing individual objects and then

150
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,800
tracking them throughout the supply

151
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:25,319
chain so RFID uh it's well seen and well

152
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,079
used across all the US in retail and I

153
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:29,479
think one of the real good examples of

154
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:32,318
that would be the large retailer wall

155
00:06:29,478 --> 00:06:34,639
Walmart so Walmart requires that every

156
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,879
product that is shipped into Walmart

157
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,120
with the exception of grocery items has

158
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:41,399
to have an RFID tag on that and the

159
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,199
purpose is it allows for simple

160
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:47,120
frictionless intaking of objects so you

161
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:48,639
use an RFID scanner you scan it it sees

162
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,439
every individual object in there

163
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,639
immediately connects that to their point

164
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:55,360
of sale uh and inventory systems those

165
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:57,840
products are then moved into some sort

166
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,199
of inventory room in the back uh the

167
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:02,239
there could be fixed readers that scan

168
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:05,038
the room automatically every second or

169
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,240
so and see all of the objects there and

170
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:09,318
then can reconcile that immediately with

171
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,639
what's supposed to be there so we know

172
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:13,800
what's supposed to be where we know

173
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:16,000
exactly where it is and when then those

174
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,160
objects move from the inventory room

175
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,560
onto the onto the floor of the actual

176
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,960
retailer we can see as they move from

177
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,000
here onto the floor and so we know where

178
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:27,560
things are at all times it provides

179
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,800
incredible business intelligence it it

180
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,598
it reduces things like product stockouts

181
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,639
uh it reduces things like over

182
00:07:32,598 --> 00:07:36,478
inventorying so you don't have to tie up

183
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,840
all your money in inventory you can be

184
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:41,918
incredibly efficient with what you have

185
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:44,119
and knowing where it is at all times so

186
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:47,519
that yeah effectively is a global global

187
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:49,360
standard for digitizing objects you know

188
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:51,120
it is incredible and it seems that you

189
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,479
guys offer complete Security in the

190
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,680
supply chain which is lacking to a

191
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:59,360
degree in a number of states and uh

192
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,840
somewhat in Canada as well yes yeah you

193
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,960
know it's it's interesting so we're

194
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:05,598
we're operational in a number of big

195
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:07,918
states in the United States

196
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:11,079
and you know I've always said that you

197
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:13,878
can have a business that is regulated or

198
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:16,279
is the the the states mandate your

199
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:17,879
business and that's great um however

200
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:20,000
what our approach has always been that

201
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:21,520
we need to to grow organically we need

202
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,279
to be able to go to operators whether

203
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:25,598
it's a producer whether it's a

204
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:28,839
dispensary or a vertically integrated

205
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:31,000
SSO or MSO and we have to truly add

206
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:33,519
value it's to save the money uh keep

207
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,679
them complying Etc and and that's what

208
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,759
we've done our our customers are find

209
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:40,519
finding huge savings incredible

210
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:44,679
efficiencies and what was nice is in

211
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:46,720
Maryland the other day um one of the the

212
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:49,919
officers who performed the regular

213
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,600
audits came in and saw our solution in

214
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:55,319
place and they were extraordinarily

215
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,720
excited so they took samples back and

216
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,560
they want to try to propose that that

217
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,200
type of solution be mandated for for all

218
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:04,199
producers and dispensaries in the state

219
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,240
and it makes sense um it creates

220
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,120
efficiencies it allows for The

221
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,120
Regulators to know where the product is

222
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,360
so Regulators can now walk in they can

223
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,159
have their own handheld RFID scanners

224
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,240
and they can scan a room instantly they

225
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:19,719
can then reconcile that with what's

226
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:22,879
supposed to be there so by digitizing

227
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:25,440
objects with ultra high frequency RFID

228
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:27,439
you offer value to The Regulators you

229
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,519
offer value to the producers you offer

230
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,519
value to the dispensaries and the end of

231
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,799
the day It ultimately becomes valuable

232
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,759
to the customers because one with all

233
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:37,599
these efficiencies you can save save

234
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:40,759
money and therefore sell the product at

235
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,519
lower price and two the the customers

236
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:43,720
know that these are legal tested

237
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:45,839
products that have been through the

238
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,360
legal supply chain and that they've not

239
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,000
come in from the gray markets uh so

240
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:54,000
everybody every stakeholder in the

241
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Cannabis World benefits from digitizing

242
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,240
Individual cannabis

243
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,078
units and it seems as automation

244
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,399
robotics come into the manufacturing and

245
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:05,479
packaging and distribution side of the

246
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:06,958
industry that your technology is tailor

247
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,039
made for these advancements that are

248
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:11,119
coming in the industry oh there's no

249
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:13,159
doubt about it I mean machines these

250
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,879
these things have to speak to each other

251
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:18,159
and I think a good example of that that

252
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:20,919
from personally from my career before I

253
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:23,519
was working in cannabis I put together

254
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:27,120
helped sell in and build and deploy the

255
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:29,078
entire automation system for Tesla uh so

256
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,440
at Tesla there were all these INE

257
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:33,958
efficiencies because they were using

258
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:38,120
barcode scanners uh by adding RFID to

259
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:40,439
all individual um bins racks and

260
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:43,120
ultimately uh individual items like

261
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,600
battery uh pallets they were able to

262
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,120
track where everything was they created

263
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,000
incredible efficiencies and when you

264
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,440
needed the red door to come in for that

265
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,159
model S at a certain time you knew that

266
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,200
the red door left the inventory room you

267
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:56,719
saw the gateways it goes through so you

268
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,320
knew that that product was going to be

269
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,959
there when it needed to be there um so

270
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,600
it's about creating efficiencies and if

271
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:04,319
you're going to automate you have to

272
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,879
have systems that will speak to each

273
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:10,440
other and understand the data and the

274
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:12,679
outputs we've had a lot of talk about

275
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,600
the DEA rescheduling over the last

276
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:16,439
number of days we've seen the stocks

277
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,480
from a lot of the msos take a little

278
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,079
bump which was well needed for anybody

279
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,159
who's got a skin in the game there what

280
00:11:21,078 --> 00:11:26,039
do do you think within the first Q one

281
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:27,679
of this year that we're going to end up

282
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:29,879
having some positive feedback from them

283
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:31,399
everything is pointing towards something

284
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:33,759
positive whether it's to scheduling down

285
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:36,120
to schedule three or whether it's a full

286
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:38,958
Federal legalization plan obviously

287
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:41,560
everybody hoping for the letter yeah I

288
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:44,239
mean I think this this Administration

289
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:46,599
desperately needs a win and there was a

290
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,440
lot of hope that they would be a much

291
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:53,120
more favorable or Pro cannabis

292
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,959
Administration so the the of course the

293
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,120
expectation is that the DEA will provide

294
00:11:54,958 --> 00:12:00,000
a favorable rescheduling ruling and

295
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:03,959
personally speaking speak I don't hold

296
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,759
out any short-term hope for legislators

297
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:09,119
or politicians to get something done um

298
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:11,559
I do hold out hope that there will be a

299
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,360
rescheduling and by rescheduling from a

300
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:16,119
one to a type three substance that's a

301
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,959
game changer for the industry I mean it

302
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:21,759
frees up cash flow allows for those

303
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:24,039
standard 280e exemptions and it will be

304
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:26,198
a true GameChanger and of course to your

305
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:28,559
point you can see that that starting to

306
00:12:26,198 --> 00:12:30,479
be built in in a small way into some of

307
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:31,879
these these publicly traded cannabis

308
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,560
stocks right

309
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:36,360
now yeah and it seems the winners if if

310
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:38,119
we do end up getting federalization the

311
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,720
brands will be the kind of dominant

312
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,000
players in the industry like it is in

313
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,639
beverages and and in any consumer

314
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,399
package Goods side of

315
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:48,198
things yeah I mean I I've heard numbers

316
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,320
from some of the larger publicly traded

317
00:12:48,198 --> 00:12:52,919
msos on what a rescheduling would do to

318
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,800
their balance sheet in terms of cash

319
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:58,278
flow and it's it's a night and day

320
00:12:55,799 --> 00:13:00,759
change and you know the challenge again

321
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:02,559
the challenge for the industry and one

322
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:05,480
of the reasons why they've not adopted

323
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:08,198
best practices is it requires capital

324
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:10,680
and most of these businesses are are un

325
00:13:08,198 --> 00:13:12,559
well underwater um the last year has

326
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:16,039
been a very difficult environment for

327
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:18,479
attracting outside Capital to come in so

328
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:21,480
with the rescheduling that will free up

329
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,079
significant free cash flow day one and

330
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,480
it will allow these businesses to make

331
00:13:23,078 --> 00:13:26,479
investments and things that will create

332
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,759
efficiencies and and ultimately provide

333
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,879
a better experience for all stakeholders

334
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:33,879
yeah Hopey year 2024 now we get

335
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:36,000
Germany's industry starts getting some

336
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:38,838
momentum and we see some change happen

337
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,039
in America and uh we look forward to

338
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:42,199
seeing true Gan Global dominate on a on

339
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:44,838
a global

340
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:48,399
scale well we we truly appreciate that

341
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:50,959
you know our our goal is to bring to to

342
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,000
to fix the broken parts of the Cannabis

343
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:55,559
market like I said earlier it's it's the

344
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,958
supply chain side and it's the payment

345
00:13:55,559 --> 00:14:00,198
side and

346
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:02,479
again UHF IDE is not truly inventing the

347
00:14:00,198 --> 00:14:05,559
wheel we're just bringing to bear in

348
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:08,440
cannabis tried and true best practices

349
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:10,559
from supply chain and we're adopting it

350
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,639
and adapting it to the nuance and

351
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:16,039
requirements of the Cannabis industry so

352
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,959
it's an exciting time uh we we see that

353
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:19,639

355
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:24,320
their efficiencies across their entire

356
