13

overview of how you got from bond to

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,880
boardroom and your journey into the

15
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,719
cannabis industry quickly

16
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,800
yeah man so i didn't really discover

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,039
cannabis until i was in my mid-20s you

18
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:45,038
know i'm a veteran of the united states

19
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:47,039
marine corps and i came to it as a

20
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,359
patient first and then

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,559
after a little while i realized that it

22
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:52,719
could also be

23
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:54,320
a career opportunity because i'm a big

24
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,840
believer in

25
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,679
you never work a day in your life if you

26
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,199
do something you love and i love the

27
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:00,640
plant i love the people i love the

28
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:02,799
industry

29
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,558
and it just became a thing so a

30
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,319
marketing and public relations guy by

31
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:08,158
trade before the cannabis industry you

32
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:09,679
know military owned a couple karate

33
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,159
schools and then i was a director of

34
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,320
business development at harley-davidson

35
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,479
and believe it or not there's a lot more

36
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:17,919
similarities to working at harley and

37
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:19,438
working in cannabis than most people

38
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,600
would believe because it's it's a

39
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:23,279
lifestyle first right it's not just an

40
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:26,158
industry it's not just a product

41
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,680
category it's a lifestyle and that's how

42
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,680
i try to treat it and look at it

43
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:33,679
okay amazing yeah and i think you you've

44
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,040
got it right in the nail in the head i

45
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,720
think cannabis is going to fit right in

46
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,560
but into some of the normal industries

47
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:41,200
it's excuse me either going to be food

48
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,719
and beverage it's going to be lifestyle

49
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,000
as you said so a lot of the current

50
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:45,599
industry is going to be able to adapt

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,239
cannabis into their

52
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:50,399
current strategy and profiles the first

53
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:51,920
thing i wanted to talk to you about is

54
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,680
consulting and advising in an

55
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,280
ever-changing landscape it's pretty

56
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,118
myriad of uh

57
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,799
rules and onsoths all over the world

58
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:00,478
it's not just in the states or europe i

59
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,280
think everybody's dealing with

60
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:04,879
a changing list of rules what does it

61
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,320
feel like up in the states is there any

62
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:08,478
more clarity towards federal

63
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:10,399
legalization and how do you guys go

64
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,720
about advising your clients state by

65
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,479
state and product by product

66
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,080
you know there's 38 different cannabis

67
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:17,039
industries in the united states plus

68
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,160
there's

69
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:20,159
probably

70
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:22,400
double that in different countries who

71
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:24,799
have some level of framework and

72
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,400
we're actually working with clients in a

73
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,879
couple of different countries right now

74
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,480
in addition to the united states and

75
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:31,518
something that i think is is kind of

76
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:33,840
important

77
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,599
to note is that consulting and advising

78
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,759
are actually different and a lot of

79
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:39,679
people kind of put them together and we

80
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:42,000
try to differentiate them right so

81
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,840
consulting is is going in and getting

82
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
inside of the company and working with

83
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,039
the individuals within the company to

84
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,280
develop plans and strategies whereas

85
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:53,120
advising is kind of being an outside

86
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,439
observer right it's

87
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,599
being there as a resource for advice or

88
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,120
to to offer direction but not actually

89
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:00,639
being involved in the day-to-day

90
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,439
operations

91
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,359
and

92
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,239
what i've found is that advisory

93
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,599
services are actually more powerful

94
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,640
and here's why

95
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:12,560
because as a consultant or an advisor at

96
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:15,039
least in my belief is is that my goal

97
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,120
should be to make myself obsolete sooner

98
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:20,239
rather than later i want to teach you

99
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,039
the skills to do what you need to do

100
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,800
so

101
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:25,359
something we do that's kind of unique at

102
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,439
good ideas is we like to empower the

103
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,959
internal team members to do the things

104
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:30,560
we'll be there as a safety net we'll be

105
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,158
there as a helping hand we'll be there

106
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,080
as the person who can help you kind of

107
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:36,399
navigate the things

108
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,239
but we want you to be the one to do it

109
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,760
we look at it more of a i guess you

110
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,080
would call it a mentoring relationship

111
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:44,158
though i'm very

112
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,959
reticent to call it that

113
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:48,079
and

114
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,000
my big focus these days is

115
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,000
if you look at my resume i look like any

116
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,080
other corporate cannabis guy right like

117
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,080
if you look at me as a person i don't i

118
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,640
i look very much more like a legacy

119
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,480
cannabis guy and my goal is to

120
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,919
blend those two worlds together right if

121
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:03,919
we're talking bridging the gap to bong

122
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:05,759
the boardroom i mean it and i mean it in

123
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,598
that order i'd like to help the small

124
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,359
legacy operators the medium-sized

125
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:11,598
companies the people who are

126
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,120
intrinsic to the culture compete with

127
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:14,719
the industry because those aren't the

128
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,840
same thing as much as people would like

129
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:17,839
to believe they are

130
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:23,359
okay very interesting and have you guys

131
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,519
found you have you got clients across

132
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,879
the whole states and are the different

133
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:30,478
rule sets

134
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:31,600
and advice and let's say consulting uh

135
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:33,359
the

136
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,280
points of rule that you'd use different

137
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,680
depending on the east west coast or is

138
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:39,198
there a kind of synergistic strategy

139
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,478
that you use across the whole of the

140
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,520
north america um so i think a lot of it

141
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,478
could be

142
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:48,799
broad strokes right a big chunk of it is

143
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:51,199
the same like if you're getting into

144
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,120
uh cultivation or extraction or things

145
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,560
like that those are gonna work the same

146
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,079
way no matter where you are at

147
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,360
geographically right the plant's going

148
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:59,519
to grow the same no matter where you're

149
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,960
at minus some variation and climate and

150
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,120
temperature and little things but a

151
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:04,879
plant is a plant a machine is a machine

152
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,519
a product is a product

153
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:10,159
when it comes to the marketing public

154
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:12,478
relations uh business development those

155
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,720
things each state has its own approach

156
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,159
because each state has its own license

157
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,039
structure right

158
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,039
so what i would suggest a company do in

159
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:23,279
california is very different than what i

160
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:25,599
would suggest a company do in florida

161
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,119
because particularly because we do

162
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,280
business to business stuff and a lot of

163
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,800
our clients are primarily business to

164
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:31,679
business clients

165
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,560
so

166
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,160
the

167
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,000
what if i interrupted her are those

168
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,039
strategies going to change when federal

169
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,519
legalization happens a 100

170
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:41,519
yeah okay

171
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,240
i'm up i'm in that little group of

172
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,160
people who are kind of like chicken

173
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,319
little right now who are going you guys

174
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,639
do realize that federal legalization

175
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:55,360
changes the game who are the big players

176
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,038
now will not be the big players then

177
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,560
because their business model isn't set

178
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:00,399
up that way right if you look at the

179
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,879
large multi-state operators if you look

180
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:04,879
at the way they operate they operate in

181
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:06,879
primarily east coast states with limited

182
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:08,639
license structure regulatory capture

183
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:09,918
forced vertical integration

184
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,519
and if you look at the west coast states

185
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:13,038
i think they're better prepared for

186
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:14,079
federal legalization because what's

187
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:16,879
going to happen

188
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:18,800
is traditional union economics producer

189
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:22,000
and consumer states the places where

190
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,160
cannabis grows well naturally are going

191
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,560
to do better at producing products than

192
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,479
the places that don't and we see this in

193
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,800
almost every other industry right like

194
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:33,120
you don't mind the steel the same place

195
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,038
you make you smelt it into a product you

196
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,120
don't

197
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:38,879
harvest the stuff and then put it into a

198
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,319
factory right next door no it gets moved

199
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:41,839
as a raw product and then it gets

200
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,520
processed and then it gets distributed

201
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:46,399
back out and i think it's going to

202
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:48,879
completely upend the cannabis industry

203
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:50,959
at large and truth be told the thing i'm

204
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:53,038
most excited about is the public

205
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:55,038
relations advertising marketing side of

206
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:57,038
the house we're very restricted we've

207
00:06:55,038 --> 00:07:00,318
had to come up with some very

208
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:02,560
unique and interesting ways to approach

209
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,639
those things and i'm excited to be able

210
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,280
to do what everybody else does right

211
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,519
like run google ads run tv

212
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:12,719
advertisements run

213
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:15,120
anything like that i i think will be

214
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,479
huge because right now it's a game of

215
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,478
attention and there's very few ways that

216
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:22,399
other industries have to gain attention

217
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:24,000
that we do and we've kind of had to make

218
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:26,399
up our own and i'll be honest with you

219
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,240
i'm really tired of retrofitting things

220
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:30,159
right i'm tired of reinventing the wheel

221
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,240
every time we need to do something and i

222
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,560
think that's exciting i think it's

223
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,079
going to be fun to watch us kind of grow

224
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,319
because we started as this like

225
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:40,399
post-prohibition industry right and then

226
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,960
we've kind of grown into what we think

227
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:44,959
is an adult functioning vibrant industry

228
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:46,638
worth billions of dollars but we're

229
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:48,478
still kind of a toddler right we're

230
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,240
still kind of a little kid

231
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:52,240
and we need to start growing through

232
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,918
these phases and i'm so i'm really

233
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,960
excited for the next couple of phases of

234
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:57,439
like you know

235
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:59,279
older childhood the the teenage years of

236
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,839
the cannabis industry and then

237
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:03,758
eventually get to what we all hope it's

238
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:05,598
going to be where people can go to

239
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,879
college and get a degree in cannabis

240
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:08,800
where it's no different than saying

241
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,199
mommy and daddy i want to be a lawyer or

242
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,038
a doctor or i want to work in space or i

243
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,598
want to work in this thing

244
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:18,478
that's where we're that's way off but

245
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:20,159
we're taking the steps to get there

246
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:22,318
the next topic i wanted to kind of jump

247
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,759
on to

248
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,280
after this i don't know you guys wanted

249
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,639
something around this so you've just

250
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:28,559
mentioned there we're right we're a

251
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,319
young kid we're only growing up in the

252
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,038
industry so we're a little teenager

253
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,399
who's even at the moment so corruption

254
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:36,639
in cannabis

255
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,918
we're seeing a lot of headlines of ceos

256
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:40,240
especially in some of the canadian

257
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:41,838
companies taken obnoxious annual

258
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,680
salaries and looked like they're almost

259
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,200
killed from the company what can you

260
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,958
tell us about corruption cannabis that

261
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,080
you guys are working on your uh project

262
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,359
mongoose

263
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,920
operation

264
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,560
project mongoose in short is the ability

265
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:56,799
to give someone else a platform or to

266
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:59,278
use our platform to kind of talk about

267
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:01,919
it so something i experienced in the

268
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:04,080
early days of my cannabis career is that

269
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:06,240
it can kind of suck to work in cannabis

270
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,879
it can kind of be difficult it's not

271
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,480
all bong rips and high fives it's a lot

272
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:12,080
of work it's a lot of pivots it's a lot

273
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,240
of crazy stuff

274
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,759
and once you've been in cannabis for a

275
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,200
little bit you kind of realize that

276
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:18,720
you're on an island that most of your

277
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,399
friends also work in cannabis they're

278
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,920
your peers they work at this company or

279
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,360
that company or they work in a different

280
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:25,360
state than you do

281
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,519
and something i realized in just my

282
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,278
day-to-day conversation is that we were

283
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,440
all experiencing a lot of the same

284
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:33,039
problems it didn't matter what state or

285
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,040
country we were in it didn't matter what

286
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:37,039
industry segment we were in

287
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:39,360
and something we really wanted to do is

288
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:42,240
provide that platform for people to have

289
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,080
this traditional water cooler talk

290
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,159
in public because we really want to

291
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,720
affect change if we really want to make

292
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:50,719
the industry better we can't hide this

293
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,120
stuff we can't act like it doesn't exist

294
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,240
we can't turn a blind eye we have to

295
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,879
address it head on we have to

296
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,600
talk about it openly and honestly we

297
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:03,200
have to drive for accountability we have

298
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,879
to do all of these things

299
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,879
and truth be told

300
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:08,958
if people really want to understand

301
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:11,600
what's going on in cannabis you have to

302
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:13,359
understand a simple equation that we use

303
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,839
in the public relations world and that

304
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,079
is that image plus identity equals

305
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,839
reputation and that's a little more

306
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:21,838
complicated than it sounds but image is

307
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,680
what other people say about you and

308
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,440
identity is what you say about you and

309
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:26,479
your reputation as the combination of

310
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,399
the two

311
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,039
what we have in cannabis is a whole

312
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,639
bunch of companies with amazing

313
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,958
identities if you look at nothing but

314
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:36,399
their press releases their website their

315
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:38,159
marketing stuff

316
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,839
they look like the greatest company in

317
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:41,360
the history of companies and you can

318
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,560
point at a whole bunch of them so it's

319
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,480
not just one

320
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,239
and if you look at their image they have

321
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,879
awful glass door reviews they have

322
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,959
terrible customer reviews they have a

323
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:53,919
simple google search of a lot of the

324
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:57,679
major msos with a basic term like

325
00:10:53,919 --> 00:11:00,399
scandal lawsuit corruption

326
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:02,639
union if you start pairing those up you

327
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,278
see a very different story than their

328
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:06,799
identity tells and that's a problem

329
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:08,799
that's a problem that needs to be

330
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:11,199
addressed because it's not just the

331
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:14,000
canadian ceos pilfering the companies

332
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,000
it's not just the american mso

333
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,919
executives and their spouses getting

334
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,759
popped for corruption charges or getting

335
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:22,240
sued out the wazoo

336
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:25,200
it's all of that at one time and that's

337
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,440
just not what we need as an industry to

338
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,560
grow up if anything it's hampering our

339
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,640
ability

340
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,319
to grow up in a lot of ways

341
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:34,399
because they're here doing exactly what

342
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,399
you said they're pilfering the companies

343
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,000
or they're living off of it and truth be

344
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,879
told i think it's actually one of the

345
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,078
most

346
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:43,360
um condemning pieces toward our future

347
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:45,120
right so if you look at the large

348
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,200
cannabis companies whether they're us or

349
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,519
canada or even some of the european ones

350
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,200
all of them kind of have this idea or

351
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,959
they at least position themselves as

352
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,800
thinking we're going to get bought out

353
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:56,879
by the big boys the procter and gambles

354
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:58,879
the johnson and johnson's the coca-colas

355
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:00,078
of the world are going to buy us

356
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:02,000
and

357
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:04,319
they aren't i don't think they are

358
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,039
anyways why would they you guys are

359
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,560
scandal-ridden losing money you're not

360
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:11,759
doing any of the things they're looking

361
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:14,000
for and i think those companies

362
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:15,838
like the big guys are looking at that

363
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,240
and they're playing a much longer game

364
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,480
plan than the company like the major

365
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,639
cannabis companies realize and it's

366
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,959
because we're corrupt and we're broken

367
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,759
and they see it they see it in

368
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:29,119
the pay packages and all of the stuff

369
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:31,039
okay

370
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,720
okay amazing well as i said we've only

371
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:34,319
got a short show that we do for each of

372
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,000
these i think we could talk all day and

373
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,560
continue on but we'll definitely have to

374
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,958
catch up at a further date to do part

375
