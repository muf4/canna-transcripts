sure not a problem at all um so for

21
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,399
myself i've been in the industry since

22
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:48,320
uh 2012 actually

23
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,960
got started by founding uh one of

24
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,558
canada's first private equity funds um

25
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,480
got that up and going with some capital

26
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,558
deployed some capital

27
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,479
it was still very early days when just

28
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:00,238
even talking about cannabis when you're

29
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:02,159
on restaurants or anything like that was

30
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:04,319
a taboo so

31
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,560
um yeah it was it was challenging but a

32
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:09,039
lot of fun in the same instance uh went

33
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,960
on to found a company called vitalis

34
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,840
extraction technology

35
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:15,919
and then uh subsequently uh sold that um

36
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,000
a number of years later um and then

37
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,600
found myself over here in europe um

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,640
making a number of investments here and

39
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:25,280
there and one of them uh is falcon

40
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,239
medical and so that organization was

41
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,960
founded in late 2018

42
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:33,679
and i've come over from canada just to

43
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:35,919
add some of that cannabis experience

44
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,360
and just to make sure that everybody on

45
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,960
the team is on the right track which

46
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:40,879
they are

47
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:42,798
amazing okay great so

48
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:45,039
my wealth of experience can you kind of

49
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,159
get everybody the cannabis in denmark at

50
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,439
the moment from what i can see of the

51
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,200
reading i've done so far yet the

52
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,679
four-year plan extended there just

53
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,478
recently in may and so doctors can

54
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,040
prescribe it there's uh patients can

55
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:01,200
have access to it companies can license

56
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,680
and export it and i've recently found

57
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,000
that there was a danish grown product

58
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,880
for sale in germany pharmacies is this

59
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,038
correct

60
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:10,239
that's correct yeah

61
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,318
absolutely true

62
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,400
and not available for danish consumers

63
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:16,399
as of yet is there a rule in regulation

64
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,319
that hinders this or what would be the

65
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,000
case to stop that

66
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:21,119
yes so you know if we when we start to

67
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,639
take a look at the products that are

68
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,520
available in denmark right now there's

69
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,279
four

70
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,080
there's three flowers that have been

71
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,640
introduced by uh bedrocan and then a

72
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,640
capsule that's introduced by aurora

73
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,958
as it stands right now there are no

74
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:38,159
other products that have been introduced

75
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:40,400
into denmark by danish companies um it's

76
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:43,039
not for lack of trying um and it's not

77
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,879
for lack of the regulatory bodies um

78
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:47,359
wanting to allow it or accept it just

79
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:49,199
takes time that's really all it is so

80
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,560
you look at your major cultivators such

81
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:52,799
as

82
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,640
like say aurora for example or you know

83
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,439
canopy's facility which is now owned by

84
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:59,759
little green pharma scroll medical

85
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:02,318
all of these organizations have

86
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:03,840
a flower within the um say product

87
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:05,919
approval pipeline

88
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,840
and just going through the the checks

89
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,199
and balances to make sure that it's

90
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,598
going to be

91
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:13,439
available and acceptable to the danish

92
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:14,799
government and then therefore to the

93
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:17,199
danish patients

94
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,760
i'd say just because they have market

95
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:21,119
authorization in germany um doesn't mean

96
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:22,719
that they're automatically going to get

97
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,480
it here in denmark the regulations or

98
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,479
the bars are probably

99
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:27,840
one of the one of the most or the most

100
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:30,560
stringent that we're going to see in

101
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,719
europe from a quality perspective

102
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,080
okay so again it's the kind of barrier

103
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:36,080
to entry for the products there it's

104
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,799
just so high and the regulations are so

105
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,519
strict and it was just thinking eugmp

106
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,519
was the the strictest of them all

107
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,039
yes it's not just eugmp like there's

108
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,280
eugmp which is going to set your

109
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:49,919
guidelines but then however

110
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,878
and these companies are all

111
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:54,399
cultivating at incredible quality

112
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:56,000
it's really going through the time that

113
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,840
it takes for the stability testing and

114
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,519
then along side of that making sure that

115
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,680
they're doing all of the microbial

116
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,560
potency testing throughout that time in

117
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,799
period

118
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,920
just to make sure that those products

119
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,840
meet the

120
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:09,919
yeah the standards that the the danish

121
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,280
medic medical system is going to be

122
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:15,280
requiring um on top of that

123
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,358
when you're taking a look at flour just

124
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,040
in it's in its rough warm it's a complex

125
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:22,240
product um and and the microbials um

126
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,240
that can be

127
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,560
i guess housed in this on this product

128
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,360
are probably of the greatest concern to

129
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,879
the um to the danish medicines agency so

130
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,800
they really are they're not taking a

131
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:34,079
look at accelerated stability or

132
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,120
anything along those lines they're

133
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:37,439
taking a look at you know what's

134
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,000
happening on a month-to-month basis um

135
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:41,439
in these true long stability studies

136
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,759
just to make sure that this product is

137
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:45,040
going to be safe for the um for the end

138
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,800
patient

139
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,360
yeah and i was reading up about uh

140
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,360
professor anna catharina uh over there

141
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,280
working in the danish institute medical

142
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,280
or technological institute doing some

143
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:57,039
work on tissue cultures and whatnot so

144
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:59,198
it seems to be the denmark as line and

145
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,360
itself hope to have everything all the

146
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,600
eyes dotted and the t's crossed

147
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,240
to have it this made in denmark we've

148
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,000
talked to the the maltese

149
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,439
guys already but you seem to be going

150
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,959
for a mate in denmark is going to be the

151
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,120
seal of approval you reckon from the

152
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:14,478
products coming out there as well

153
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,399
we're going to see a lot of

154
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:19,519
organizations yeah bringing in product

155
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:21,279
into europe from all over the world um i

156
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,799
think one thing that

157
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,638
the rest of the world can expect from

158
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,919
denmark as they have with it with any

159
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,918
other product that comes out of denmark

160
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:29,758
it's going to be um

161
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:32,240
incredibly high quality

162
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,840
and the consistency is going to be there

163
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,038
right which is

164
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,839
absolutely necessary for the

165
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:39,120
pharmaceutical and medicinal worlds um

166
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:40,638
we we have to make sure that we're

167
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,720
creating the same thing over and over

168
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,319
and over and over again

169
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,400
and that's something that's being very

170
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,560
very closely watched here

171
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:50,399
yeah exact dosage when it comes to the

172
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,720
medical industry has to be down to the

173
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:55,839
minute 0.0 milligram

174
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,759
um can we move on to the next part which

175
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,918
is the vulcan medical story you gave us

176
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,840
a quick overview can you explain to us

177
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:04,240
why the danish industry what the

178
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:06,399
opportunity is there and do you see

179
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,478
denmark having a step above

180
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,799
the likes of we

181
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:12,959
personally i see ireland and malta being

182
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,120
processing facilities for a large scale

183
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,399
product being turned into pharmaceutical

184
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,478
products and then being shipped into the

185
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:20,638
european pharmacies do you see denmark

186
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:22,959
having an upper step on the two

187
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,519
territories i just mentioned there

188
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:27,599
so here's where i see the um

189
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:30,000
the exciting components of denmark and

190
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,960
maybe taking a step back like we we

191
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,399
evaluated from an investment perspective

192
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,198
you know where should we set up a

193
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:38,239
facility um at the time denmark was one

194
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,000
of the first countries that were

195
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,038
allowing for

196
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,399
the

197
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:44,639
processing

198
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:46,879
and cultivation of medical cannabis

199
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,160
there were a number of organizations

200
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:51,038
that were getting set up to do

201
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,240
cultivation here and um we also looked

202
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:53,918
at the regulatory framework where there

203
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,519
were no caps on how much you could

204
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:57,279
cultivate there were no caps on how much

205
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:58,560
you could export

206
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,839
and it was a

207
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,560
it was very nice and

208
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:04,478
straightforward um

209
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,079
uh regulatory framework which we

210
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:08,079
appreciated you know coming out of the

211
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:09,839
canadian market um

212
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:11,439
i don't know how many years we spent you

213
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:13,279
know working with organizations and

214
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:14,959
watching organizations saying oh we'll

215
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:16,719
be licensed next month we'll be licensed

216
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:18,318
next month and then two years later

217
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,240
they're still waiting on their licensing

218
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,560
um uh because of the lack of

219
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,478
transparency um in that licensing

220
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,280
process unfortunately and

221
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:29,439
and the changing um of the benchmarks

222
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:32,559
you might say right versus denmark it's

223
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:34,240
been very very clear so in terms of

224
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,079
getting a license it's not easy to get a

225
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,280
license here but it's very clear on

226
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:39,038
what's required to be able to get a

227
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:40,318
license so we saw that as a major

228
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:43,279
benefit

229
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,479
secondarily in terms of why denmark

230
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:46,559
denmark

231
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:47,680
i'd say probably about like 30 or 40 of

232
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,160
their gdp comes out of the

233
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,079
pharmaceutical space um so there's a lot

234
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,840
of professionals here that are used to

235
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:55,279
working in the can

236
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:57,038
not in the cannabis space but in the

237
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:58,878
pharmaceutical space

238
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:00,079
with transferable skills to the cannabis

239
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,080
space

240
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:03,598
and when i've seen some of the other

241
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:05,199
other markets where they don't have that

242
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:06,639
access to that type of professional

243
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,478
labor pool

244
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,439
that can make a big impact in terms of

245
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:13,120
the reliability of the organization and

246
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:15,519
the organization's ability to be able to

247
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,759
produce a final product

248
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:20,399
taking a look at malta um taking a look

249
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,960
at ireland both great spots even from a

250
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,000
tax perspective both great spots to be

251
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:25,359
able to

252
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,879
start up production

253
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,560
you know we've got uh you can see

254
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,560
northern leaf um they're getting going

255
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,038
over there in jersey for example right

256
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,120
um you've got uh you know our friends at

257
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:37,679
uh materia that got a facility set up in

258
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,679
masa um all of those are places that we

259
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,439
took a look at even portugal

260
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,759
it was a regulatory framework that

261
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,519
really made a huge difference for us to

262
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:46,799
say look is this a very straightforward

263
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,399
regulatory framework and is this

264
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:50,079
something that we can act on and you

265
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,879
know we were founded or we founded this

266
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,600
organization in late 2018

267
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:57,039
so and it's taken us this long to be

268
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,920
able to get through you know the

269
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:02,799
fundraising processes the uh the build

270
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:05,679
out um then the licensing and validation

271
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:07,838
right it takes takes a very long time um

272
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:10,319
and denmark at the time was was great

273
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:13,040
for and still has been an exceptional

274
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,839
place to be able to do business

275
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:17,120
yeah a good business partner is a hugely

276
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,279
important thing when you're setting up

277
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,039
in a different territory for sure last

278
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:22,879
topic of conversation and i think you're

279
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:25,759
to have a wealth of knowledge on this

280
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:27,200
topic canadian lps

281
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:30,159
are we going to see one of them going

282
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,240
bust this year is is it is is as big a

283
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:33,439
show as i can see from over here in

284
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,879
ireland or

285
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,200
something that they're going to pull out

286
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:39,278
of the bag that for some reason to make

287
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,959
this billions of dollars of investment

288
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:42,320
worthwhile and i thought hexaware on

289
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:44,799
turn their corner and they seem to be

290
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,120
going the other way completely so i can

291
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:49,759
see three to four of those guys

292
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,278
running low on capital and who on earth

293
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:54,000
is going to keep funding unless it's a

294
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:56,080
current investor so what do you see

295
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,600
as the next 12 to 24 months do you see

296
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,480
some merger and acquisitions there where

297
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,000
there's left with like two players and

298
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,480
and kind of they're they're able to

299
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,639
survive on a much more leaner strategy

300
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,959
or what do you see the next 12 or

301
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:10,639
24 months happening over there

302
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,239
of course it's anybody's guess right in

303
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:14,399
terms of what's going to happen the

304
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,600
canadian lps have done a phenomenal job

305
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:20,639
at um driving capital into the industry

306
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,480
canada having um the the stock exchanges

307
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,399
available between the canadian x stock

308
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,480
exchange which has been um

309
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,720
i guess jokingly noted as the cannabis

310
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,680
stock exchange or the cse um and then on

311
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,759
top of that with the tsx right so um

312
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:35,519
lots of organizations going public lots

313
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:37,679
of access to capital and then that the

314
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,360
traditional height that brought in a ton

315
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,679
of capital into the market

316
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,039
um to bring capital into that market for

317
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:45,039
a company to say hey look we're going to

318
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:47,519
play it safe and we're going to build

319
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:49,599
out 20 000 square feet and kind of grow

320
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,759
with the market that doesn't drive as

321
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,360
much excitement as hey we're going to

322
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:55,200
build a facility that you can see from

323
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,480
space which we heard one of the founders

324
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:02,240
uh at one point say at a conference um

325
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,680
so you know uh there was definitely a

326
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,159
different components and different

327
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:08,559
strategies um to what the end objective

328
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:10,078
was i think what we're shouldn't even

329
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:11,838
say i think what we're seeing right now

330
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:13,519
is a lot more of a pragmatic approach

331
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,120
within the within the canadian cannabis

332
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,278
industry and also that echoing

333
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,799
throughout the global industry whereas

334
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:21,200
organizations are not saying hey we're

335
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:23,519
going to be everything and anything to

336
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,920
anybody and everybody um let's see what

337
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,360
we can do to try to grow this company

338
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:29,199
profitably

339
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,440
we are seeing you know liquidity

340
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,480
challenges with a number of these spaces

341
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,079
but not without uh you know some of

342
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,240
these organizations are still strong

343
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:39,439
assets on their balance sheet and

344
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,799
because they have that strong assets

345
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,800
it's really trying to commercialize

346
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:44,639
those assets and figure out okay what

347
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:46,719
can we do with these to

348
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,958
turn a profit you see canopy trimming

349
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,000
down quite dramatically aurora doing the

350
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,439
same thing

351
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,399
and really just right sizing their

352
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,800
business

353
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,399
because the industry isn't

354
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:58,240
it's growing fast like don't get me

355
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,559
wrong um it's growing quite fast but

356
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,839
it's not growing as fast as

357
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:03,759
they were maybe once previously

358
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,000
expecting it it'll still be a dominant

359
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:08,639
density it's going to be gigantic

360
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,240
but it takes time everything like it

361
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,079
took time in canada and it takes even

362
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,600
more time over here in europe

363
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:14,719
and i think i think what we're actually

364
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,480
going to see is yeah some more

365
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,639
consolidation happening but also more

366
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,039
specialization rather than companies

367
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,959
saying hey look we're going to to own

368
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:24,480
all the products and do all the testing

369
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:27,199
and all the cultivation and all the

370
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,399
extraction and all the everything um and

371
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,839
you're spreading out your dollars so

372
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,440
thin right

373
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,440
and you're spreading out your expertise

374
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,600
uh so thin and if you look at most

375
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,399
industries globally outside cannabis

376
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,000
industry they don't operate like that

377
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,679
even apple apple who said that with

378
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,360
everything end to end

379
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:45,599
they have groups that manufacture

380
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,680
products for them and and groups that

381
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,959
will specialize across that supply chain

382
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:50,399
and i think that we're going to start to

383
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:51,679
see more and more of that today in the

384
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,958
cannabis space we're gonna see that

385
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:54,319
specialization

386
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:56,559
you know we look at it over here in

387
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,399
europe and just doesn't make sense for a

388
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:00,159
group to go and spend you know three to

389
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,240
five million euros on setting up their

390
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:04,240
own extraction facility to put out maybe

391
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,159
four thousand five thousand bottles and

392
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,079
then some of the regular trade

393
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:09,679
regulatory changes might cause them to

394
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:12,879
re-pivot have to pick up some more

395
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:14,958
capital assets and then um deploy again

396
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:17,838
and when it takes you know 24 to 36

397
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:19,278
months to build out and and then even

398
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,480
before you bring a new product to market

399
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:21,759
just just building out and getting

400
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,519
qualified

401
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,799
that's a long time and a lot can change

402
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,600
during that time so i think

403
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:29,199
specialization is definitely the path to

404
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,079
the future

405
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,360
okay and last word before we go we know

406
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:35,120
medical is going to be dominant in

407
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,759
europe for the next few years but do you

408
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,560
see there being a dispensary style model

409
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:42,399
at some stage in europe to copy the kind

410
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:44,479
of american model

411
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,919
you know what um like the canadian

412
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,839
started with a male in a million medical

413
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:52,319
cannabis program right where um you

414
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,320
could pick up uh your orders um online

415
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,079
and um have them delivered to you which

416
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,160
was quite interesting versus europe we

417
00:13:56,078 --> 00:14:00,799
already see a physical presence so i

418
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:02,879
think that step to dispensary model once

419
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:04,719
a recreational program comes into play i

420
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:06,559
don't think that's so far out of hand

421
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,560
um it's it's already in existence

422
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:09,838
there's a distribution platform already

423
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:11,919
in place

424
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,760
and so stepping into maybe something a

425
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:15,519
little bit more recreation

426
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:18,639
once it's approved

427
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:20,399
i think uh yeah i do see that happening

428
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,079
yeah i've started to see now a lot of

429
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,399
with the pass in the european commission

430
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:26,799
and you can sell cbd flair now legally

431
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:30,320
in the european union so i've seen a

432
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:32,799
huge influx of cbd flower being sold at

433
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,720
a good price same as cbd hash and i know

434
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:36,719
of a couple of stores open up in austria

435
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,320
and france where they'll be selling cbd

436
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,240
flour and cbd hash and i think that'll

437
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,040
be a quick turnaround just to be able to

438
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,879
add thc into their inventory model but

439
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:46,639
it's an exciting industry and a lot to

440
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:48,240
look forward to over the next couple of

441
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,000
years thank you very much for coming on

442

443
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,039
minutes so we're just coming up to that

444
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,720

445
