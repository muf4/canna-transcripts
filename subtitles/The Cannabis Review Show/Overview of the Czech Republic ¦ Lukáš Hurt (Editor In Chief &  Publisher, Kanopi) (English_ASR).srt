Czech Republic topic

22
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:00,058
okay so very briefly I'm publishing

23
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,320
canopy magazine which is which is a by

24
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:04,439
monthly magazine in the Czech Republic

25
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,079
It's we print around 10 000 copies every

26
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:08,640
two months and it's being sold all

27
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:11,219
around the Czech Republic and also in

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,680
Slovakia and apart from that we started

29
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:15,780
a couple of years ago also a English

30
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,600
online version called cannabis therapy

31
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,280
magazine and we tried to publish the

32
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:22,259
Articles which are interesting for

33
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,359
international audience in English there

34
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,459
as well and currently we are also

35
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:28,739
working on some kind of

36
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:30,478
automatic translations into into other

37
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:33,000
other languages so that we can you know

38
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:35,459
have more broader audience even from

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,560
some non-english speaking countries such

40
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:39,599
as like Spanish or French or German and

41
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,579
stuff like that

42
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:45,359
and basically the magazine is focused on

43
00:01:41,578 --> 00:01:47,158
medical aspect of of cannabis but also

44
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:48,478
we we take up the topic of the

45
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,978
recreational legalization because it's

46
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:52,560
being discussed here in the Czech

47
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:54,060
Republic more and more and I'm sure that

48
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,500
that's the most the thing which

49
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,500
interests you most

50
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,780
yeah well it's you start hearing the

51
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,879
dimension of the chapter public a lot

52
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,859
over the past let's say six to 12 months

53
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:07,019
it was all Germany up until the last six

54
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:09,118
to 12 months and it seems to be you guys

55
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:12,719
are coming up on the inside line very

56
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:15,120
fast can you answer me this a what is

57
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,979
the cause of the the positive

58
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,599
discussions that are happening in the

59
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:20,340
Czech Republic around legalization of

60
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:21,959
cannabis now what was the first kind of

61
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,239
the influence point where everybody

62
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:25,800
started to change their tone

63
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,539
uh it was basically the last

64
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,980
parliamentary election when we got the

65
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:33,419
new government and this new government

66
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:35,280
is is like European Pro Western and kind

67
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:37,500
of uh like it's like conservative party

68
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,959
which is which is on the top but this

69
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,280
conservative party uh or actually the

70
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,098
Prime Minister who is from the

71
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,560
conservative party his name is petrified

72
00:02:43,098 --> 00:02:50,039
and he has a very good friend

73
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,739
former National coordinator engine and

74
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:55,679
this engine composure is pretty world

75
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:57,959
renowned drug expert on drug addiction

76
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,939
and Drug policies and he was our

77
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:01,319
national recorder for eight years but

78
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:03,120
the previous government they just threw

79
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:05,159
him out because they they weren't

80
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,420
interested in arm reduction policies and

81
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:08,519
stuff like that they just wanted to

82
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:10,738
continue the prohibition but the new

83
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:11,879
prime minister last year when the when

84
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:13,439
the election was over and the new

85
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:16,259
government was formed the new prime

86
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:19,079
minister petrified he just took him back

87
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:22,019
and since he's back he just he's working

88
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:24,659
very hard on this uh we call it like a

89
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:27,480
ham reduction policies which we want to

90
00:03:24,658 --> 00:03:29,759
focus on basic human rights and where

91
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:31,439
where what better place to start is than

92
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,419
the Cannabis because you know with

93
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,579
cannabis in the Czech Republic we have

94
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:38,039
uh digital public has a very good

95
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:40,799
relationship with it like uh for past 20

96
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:42,840
years the general attitude was very

97
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,879
positive most people have nothing

98
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,280
against cannabis it's like we are very

99
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:50,518
open-minded Society very liberal but the

100
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:54,120
laws and the prosecution from police and

101
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,680
from the just justice system was always

102
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,360
there like in other European countries

103
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,939
so we have many people who are in jail

104
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,099
only for growing and using cannabis for

105
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:04,919
their own purposes without even selling

106
00:04:02,098 --> 00:04:07,619
selling it and there are some very like

107
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:09,658
exemplary cases of people who didn't do

108
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,219
anything didn't harm anybody else and

109
00:04:09,658 --> 00:04:13,798
they end up like young people and they

110
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:16,259
end up in jail for five or more years so

111
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:19,620
we want to change that and under this

112
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:21,358
leadership of Enzo Bogel who has the

113
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,939
blessing from the prime minister to do

114
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:26,279
this we are just working on the

115
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:28,680
regulation bill which would

116
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:31,698
uh we choose to stand on three pillars

117
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,959
one pillar is allowing home growing for

118
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:35,699
your own purposes which should be

119
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:37,918
allowed to anybody who's over 18 years

120
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:40,199
old and then the second pillar is

121
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:41,758
existence of cannabis Social Clubs and

122
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:44,879
the third pillar is a regulated market

123
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,979
so obviously uh in terms of

124
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,978
international laws and single

125
00:04:46,978 --> 00:04:51,360
conventions and the EU law the biggest

126
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:53,939
obstacle will be with the regulated

127
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,759
market and this is taking up the most of

128
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:58,259
our time I mean our time the people who

129
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:00,900
work on this because I'm a member of

130
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:02,460
several subgroups who are working on

131
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:04,019
this under umbrella of National Drug

132
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:06,599
coordinator and the government offices

133
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:09,240
so we have like five subgroups and these

134
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,939
subgroups are trying to prepare the uh

135
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,680
the draft of the law and then the expert

136
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:15,959
Group which is on the top of these five

137
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,639
subgroups will be presenting the draft

138
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:19,680
of the law to the politicians to the

139
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:22,918
Parliament and the legislative process

140
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,259
will begin so basically yeah that's what

141
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:27,359
that's what happened and the main the

142
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:31,439
main Drive behind this it's definitely

143
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,720
the personality of engine who put his uh

144
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:36,839
like credibility his

145
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,419
is a knowledge and everything behind it

146
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:41,399
they put it into this effort and he's

147
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:44,399
leading the effort and he gathered many

148
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:46,918
experts from the drug policy field also

149
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:49,379
with we are in toxic to the police and

150
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:51,599
with the with lawyers and also we

151
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:53,839
escalated people from various Ministries

152
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,939
like Ministry of Health foreign Ministry

153
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:59,159
interim Ministry so it's a it's a hard

154
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:01,680
effort and it takes a lot of time and

155
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:05,160
lots of work but hopefully we'll be able

156
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,079
to to prepare something which will be uh

157
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,280
which will be okay for the politicians

158
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:10,560
for the for the politicians in

159
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:13,319
Parliament the MPS and then in the

160
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,019
Senate and if this if this law passes we

161
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:19,079
should be able to legalize somehow in

162
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:20,159
like next year so hopefully 2024 should

163
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:22,439
be the year

164
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,300
very interesting can you tell me the

165
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:25,560
subgroups and the expert groups that you

166
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:29,038
talked about is there a specific

167
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:31,560
division in government or a specific uh

168
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:33,240
person in government who is in charge of

169
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,639
setting up those subgroups and expert

170
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,610
groups or is it a multitude of different

171
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:38,900
departments

172
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:41,160
[Music]

173
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:43,519
basically who was deciding who will be

174
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:47,939
sitting on each subgroups is people from

175
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:49,799
office so it's all all under him and he

176
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:51,000
has some people working for him who are

177
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,759
actually like administering

178
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,860
administrating this agenda because he

179
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,538
has you know many stuff to do so he has

180
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,220
people working for him but generally

181
00:06:57,538 --> 00:07:01,199
it's not like there will be like one

182
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:03,479
Ministry which should be overlooking all

183
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,580
it's like this it's all coming from the

184
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:08,279
offices of the government where energy

185
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:09,839
corporation works so in every subgroups

186
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:11,459
there is someone from Ministry of Health

187
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:14,939
from minister of interior there are some

188
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:17,038
uh National anti-drug Police Force there

189
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:18,478
are people from the custom offices and

190
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:20,159
they are they have their representative

191
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:21,959
in each of the subgroups and the

192
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,780
subgroups are divided semantically so

193
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:28,138
one one of them is international law the

194
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:29,519
other one is uh home law and like lost

195
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:31,439
in the church public and the prohibition

196
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:35,639
and the repression the third one is

197
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:37,259
economy and Texas and so on so in total

198
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:39,240
there are five of them and remember of

199
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:41,220
two of them but I'm trying to follow the

200
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,500
work of the other three as well but so

201
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,060
far I can't say anything openly and in

202
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:48,120
public because it's all like behind

203
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:50,519
closed doors at the moment the first

204
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,399
but the first Public Public Announcement

205
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:56,219
should be by the end of March

206
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:58,019
okay end of March and in terms of

207
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:00,720
working in unison with your neighbors

208
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:02,818
Germany do you believe that the the two

209
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,500
political leaders of each country have

210
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:06,300
had discussions on this and are kind of

211
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:09,000
moving in unison or do you think they're

212
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,500
on two different uh trajectories that uh

213
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,819
it just seems it might look as if

214
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,259
they're working together but it seems as

215
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:14,819
if Czech Republic are going a hell of a

216
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:17,038
lot faster than Germany

217
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:19,379
uh definitely there are talks between

218
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:22,620
not the not the politicians but between

219
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:24,840
the officials so the team of uh is in

220
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,180
close talks with their counterparts in

221
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:29,279
in German and German government so it's

222
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:31,199
the uh the German drug experts who are

223
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:34,679
working on the bill so we are trying to

224
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:37,320
like discuss our next steps and try to

225
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:39,958
be in line because we also have a long

226
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,278
shared border so you know we need to

227
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:43,259
discuss the things you know if one

228
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:45,059
legalizes and the other one doesn't so

229
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:47,458
what would happen because you know you

230
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:49,319
have the three of free of trade free

231
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:51,299
trade in in the European Union so you

232
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,760
know it's like loads of things to be

233
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:55,679
discussed and yeah we are so we are in

234
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,480
Costa not not me but not me personally

235
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:59,399
but people from our team from Indigo

236
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,659
virtual team are in close touch in close

237
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:02,580
touch with them and they are trying to

238
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:05,958
you know make the same steps or similar

239
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:09,899
steps in order to be in line somehow

240
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:11,278
excuse me do you think that the the end

241
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:12,720
result that they're going to get is

242
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:15,480
going to basically be a change of

243
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,820
European law or just uh we're moving on

244
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,139
ahead because it seems that if you guys

245
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,000
about Germany and Czech Republic

246
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:23,100
Legalize It seems to It's Gonna

247
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,720
obviously be a domino effect then that

248
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,100
no country is going to want to have a

249
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,680
border with a country with a legal

250
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,000
industry where their citizens can just

251
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:31,979
walk over and buy what they want and

252
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,740
then walk back into the country

253
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:37,440
uh yeah well the the that's the biggest

254
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,419
issue and we are just talking about this

255
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,279
a lot because you know everybody is

256
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:45,899
usually scared of this single convention

257
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:48,240
and the U.N but but in reality uh like

258
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:51,240
nothing can happen if we don't you know

259
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,860
if we don't listen to this uh it's U.N

260
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,720
single connection anymore but the

261
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,039
problem is European law because if the

262
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,320
European Union or the European

263
00:09:56,039 --> 00:10:00,599
connection commission says you shouldn't

264
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,180
be doing this and we will do it anyway

265
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,399
they could punish us somehow so and

266
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:06,719
nobody wants to be in like you know have

267
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:09,600
problems with the European commission

268
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,399
and the European Union so uh that's the

269
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,339
biggest problem now and like the the

270
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:16,440
biggest uh threat to this effort is

271
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:18,720
probably is is that the European

272
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,459
commission will say no we are against it

273
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,259
and you cannot do that and then

274
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:23,819
obviously Czech Republic is a small

275
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:27,539
player so we would need the help from

276
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:29,459
German government to try to not I

277
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:30,719
wouldn't say Force but try to persuade

278
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:32,579
the European commission and the people

279
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,639
that are responsible go for this

280
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:37,560
decision to allow it at least somehow or

281
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:39,299
you know maybe it will end up that they

282
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:41,518
will say you know you can Legalize It

283
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:43,439
for the home growing because it's like

284
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,240
human rights issue because you shouldn't

285
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,760
be putting people behind bars because of

286
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,860
growing few plants but the regulated

287
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:52,200
market could be a problem so

288
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,120
we will see what happens we are still I

289
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,339
think what the European commission says

290
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,278
so far there was just some indication

291
00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:00,540
but nothing official so I think in the

292
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:02,278
Czech Republic and in Germany the

293
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:05,099
proponents of this legalization efforts

294
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:06,778
are are waiting and accepting expecting

295
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,180
what's what's gonna what's gonna come up

296
00:11:06,778 --> 00:11:11,399
come out from the European commission so

297
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:14,338
we will see and if they say no it's

298
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,740
gonna be a huge problem so let's fingers

299
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:19,079
fingers crossed

300
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:21,000
is there a team or a specific person in

301
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:23,819
the European commission that is going to

302
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,919
be the sole Arbiter of this case or is

303
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,360
it going to be a panel of people

304
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:29,278
I personally don't know because I'm

305
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,839
actually not the member not the member

306
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:32,939
of the subgroup working on this

307
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:34,980
International International relationship

308
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:37,019
and international law so I don't have

309
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,659
the information from this group yet I

310
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:42,240
will have them as I said in the at the

311
00:11:39,659 --> 00:11:43,860
end of March but so far I'm just focused

312
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,240
on my two groups and I'm following the

313
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,339
news from the other groups as well other

314
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,560
groups as well but I don't know how this

315
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:51,480
is like in in the in regarding the

316
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:53,939
European Commission because I'm not

317
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:56,278
doing this uh like in very depth in

318
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:58,680
depth I totally understand well

319
00:11:56,278 --> 00:12:01,019
something I wanted to ask you about what

320
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:04,199
is the kind of Fest in Prague is that

321
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:06,360
the top uh events that you guys have

322
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,300
every year in the in the city yeah yeah

323
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:11,759
yeah it it grew from a small minor uh

324
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:14,519
trade show to one of the biggest and

325
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:16,379
largest cannabis trade shows and expos

326
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:20,060
in the world I think probably it's the

327
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:22,379
second biggest to Las Vegas and maybe

328
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:24,838
it's comparable to Spanish but

329
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:26,278
definitely it's huge popular and there

330
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:28,019
are many people even from other

331
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:30,059
countries coming here for this trade

332
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:32,159
show like from Germany from Poland and

333

Slovakia and other countries which have

334
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:36,659

335
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,600
to Prague in every November and it's

336

this year and uh Dennis obviously Focus

376
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,860
mainly you know as I said in the

377
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,680
beginning originally the magazine was

378
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:03,000
focused on medical aspects but because

379
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:06,419
what's happening in the Czech Republic

380
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,220
as we were talking about uh we focus

381
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:10,139
more and more on the on the politics and

382
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:12,660
on the regulation upcoming regulations

383
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:14,820
so we have a large interview with One

384
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:17,219
famous hip-hop rapper from the Czech

385
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:20,519
Republic who is who set up who

386
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:23,639
established a like a chart he calls it a

387
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:24,720
chart 420 and he tries to speak with the

388
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:26,339
politicians who are actually against

389
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,139
against this legalization which is

390
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:29,940
mainly the Christian conservatives like

391
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:32,759
in every other country and then the

392
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:36,420
extremist from the from the like right

393
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:38,278
side of the spectrum uh so yeah that's

394
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:40,198
that's basically it and in the from the

395
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:42,899
medical aspects we are just talking

396
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:44,759
about uh health health problems uh

397
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:46,620
women's health problems and how cannabis

398
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:48,778
called them help them this is the main

399
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,940
main topic of the of the issue and also

400
00:14:48,778 --> 00:14:53,698
as in every issue we have many patient

401
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:55,019
stories we have uh growing articles

402
00:14:53,698 --> 00:14:56,399
about growing because we want to

403
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:58,860
encourage people to grow their own

404
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,778
medicine at home as well of course in a

405
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:03,180
legal way so we are talking to CBD

406
00:15:00,778 --> 00:15:04,559
strains which with up to one percent THC

407
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:07,198
which is also very interesting

408
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:09,539
development here that since since 2022

409
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,859
we have uh one percent THC legalized in

410
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:13,500
the Czech Republic so we are the only

411
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:15,120
European Union country to allow this and

412
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,198
only second in the whole Europe to

413
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,980
Switzerland

414
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:22,259
and yeah that's this contributed also a

415
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,220
lot to like the Cannabis boom in the

416
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:25,078
Czech Republic

417
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:27,778
because you know the more th you can

418
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:29,458
have in the plant the more the more the

419
00:15:27,778 --> 00:15:32,698
the Richer profile you can have in the

420
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:34,259
in the CBD product as well and yeah so

421
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:36,659
basically that's it it's like we have a

422
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:38,458
more and 100 pages so loads of

423

00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:45,419
