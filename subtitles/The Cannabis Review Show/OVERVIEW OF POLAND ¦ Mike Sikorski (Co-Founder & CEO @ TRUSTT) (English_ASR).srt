in Poland because I'm hearing lots of

10
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:35,940
movement and news and thought it was

11
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,800
contradictory to the laws that are

12
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:39,659

13
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:41,819

blockchain and artificial enabled uh

22
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,780

verification platform for European

24
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:09,000
medical cannabis industry we are in this

25
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:12,900
industry for the last two years we came

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,700
here to disrupt it to make it better we

27
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,219
are experiencing delivering Technologies

28
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,840

29
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:21,179
around the world you know in our

30
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,400
previous kind of experiences and

31
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,920
cannabis is an amazing business to be in

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,560
you know we we came into it analyzing

33
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,140
Trends and analyzing what's happening in

34
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,659
the market but we stayed like a lot of

35
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,099
people because of you know it's pulling

36
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,020
you in you know the people in the

37
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:39,478
industry are amazing and you know the

38
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:41,640
industry is growing in the rapid Pace we

39
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:43,618
think we can we can come with solutions

40
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,659
that bring that market to their full

41
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:47,519
fruition and full potential

42
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,259
okay amazing so I'm going to jump

43
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:53,219
straight into the first topic which is

44
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,959
an overview of Poland so from my reading

45
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:57,719
and understanding is Poland has a very

46
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:59,399
strict personal drug laws like Ireland

47
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,379
that there's not much tolerance for

48
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,379
anything yet I'm hearing at the same

49
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:06,179
time a potential flourishing medical

50
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:08,639
industry because the laws have specific

51
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,500
uh holes in them can you maybe give

52
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,419
everybody a quick little brief rundown

53
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,620
of what is happening in Poland at the

54
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:16,139
moment how strong was the medical

55
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,900
industry and uh what is all the positive

56
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:20,818
news coming out for yeah so Poland is

57
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:25,080
obviously a huge Market it's uh 40

58
00:02:20,818 --> 00:02:27,179
million people Market with a huge uh you

59
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,160
know acceptance of you know medication

60
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,560
and self-medication especially we know

61
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:33,180
that by by normal pharmaceutical

62
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,659
medication but you know from the

63
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,340
Cannabis perspective uh two things uh

64
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:40,199
Fields there are creational cannabis

65
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,900
obviously the adult use cannabis is

66
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:45,839
illegal in in Poland you can get up to

67
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:49,080
three years for any size of possession

68
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,120
uh this is uh being contested now but

69
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,500
you know with the recent government with

70
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,379
the government we have now at the moment

71
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,659
you know and it may be difficult and you

72
00:02:55,378 --> 00:03:01,919
know as we know around the world but the

73
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:04,139
medical medical cannabis is uh is has a

74
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,479
huge potential in Poland right in 2017

75
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:09,839
the medical cannabis was allowed in

76
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:11,878
Poland uh we were 12th country to do

77
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,000
that apparent was 12 countries to do

78
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:18,299
that from May

79
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,280
2022 the president signed off the uh the

80
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,560
bill that allowed National research

81
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,199
institutes to cultivate medical cannabis

82
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,060
for a domestic Market

83
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:30,000
these institutes are supervised by the

84
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:32,158
ministry of rugby culture that creates a

85
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,439
number of other challenges but the

86
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:39,840
market is growing and it's rapidly

87
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:44,400
growing in 2019 it was 42 million euros

88
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:48,598
in 2021 it was 180 million euros and

89
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:51,120
it's expected to double by 2026 to over

90
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:52,699
half a million euros at the moment we're

91
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,158
selling probably around

92
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:58,098
1.7 tons of cannabis in Poland they are

93
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:02,818
two to nine over nine thousand

94
00:03:58,098 --> 00:04:05,518
registered patients and in 2021 over 30

95
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:09,298
000 prescriptions were provided in power

96
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,658
and the Polish pharmaceutical chamber is

97
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:14,938
calculating a potential of number of

98
00:04:11,658 --> 00:04:17,879
Polish patients at around 300 000 so we

99
00:04:14,938 --> 00:04:20,759
can see that this Market is ready to

100
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:21,978
open the we have number of clinics in

101
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:25,259
Poland

102
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:27,300
prescribing medical cannabis and it's

103
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:30,240
actually quite easy to get the medical

104
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:33,060
cannabis in Poland there is no list of

105
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,819
diseases so there is full Freedom by the

106
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:38,180
doctor to prescribe cannabis and it

107
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:41,418
takes as long as 15 minutes probably to

108
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:43,879
to get the tele

109
00:04:41,418 --> 00:04:47,399
telephone

110
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:50,459
prescription tell a visit and get it

111
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:53,758
into the and get the prescription for

112
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:55,918
medical cannabis so as you can see the

113
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,439
the market is is there the the

114
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:00,779
possibility is there we have challenges

115
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:02,519
with uh with product we had challenges

116
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:05,099
last year with products you know so

117
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:07,620
there is more Demand with Supply at the

118
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,780
moment you know than Supply importance

119
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,879
okay very interesting so some of the

120
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:13,619
hurdles that are hindering access for

121
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:16,379
patients and countries like Ireland and

122
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:18,840
Malta which is a consultant needs to

123
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:20,639
sign off as well as the GP all of that

124
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:23,279
is basically null and void when it comes

125
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,900
to Poland once the doctor is educated he

126
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:26,939
thinks it's going to benefit the patient

127
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:29,339
you're allowed to prescribe it and even

128
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:31,620
telemedicine is allowed correct that's

129
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:34,439
exactly it and we need to remember every

130
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,240
doctor can prescribe it but not a lot of

131
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:38,160
doctors are trained and are feeling

132
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,000
comfortable with prescribing cannabis

133
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:44,160
that's why we have this this kind of

134
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,978
this growth of specialized clinics that

135
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,139
kind of groups specialized doctors who

136
00:05:46,978 --> 00:05:52,500
are then prescribing the the medicine

137
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:54,780
the Cannabis medicine to the patients

138
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,459
okay sounds very exciting something that

139
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:59,219
would have to keep our eye on next thing

140
00:05:56,459 --> 00:06:00,719
I wanted to jump on to that if if you

141
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,160
know enter their business and you've

142
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,479
dealt with companies in Europe that

143
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,820
Poland is one of the homes of

144
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:08,399
cultivation manufacturing and software

145
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:09,839
design uh when it comes to the European

146
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:12,839
sector

147
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:16,379
um can you tell me all of these three

148
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:18,418
let's say topics or or disciplines which

149
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:21,120
one do you think cannabis is going to be

150
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:23,159
the most uh has the most potential shall

151
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,439
we say in Poland is there going to be

152
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,960
large-scale medical cultivation sites do

153
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:29,639
you see the manufacturing of Edibles and

154
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:32,459
vape pens and all that stuff happening

155
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:34,439
there or as the you guys are one of the

156
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:36,719
best parts of the parts of the world for

157
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:38,219
designing software do you see something

158
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,139
like you guys are doing or other

159
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:42,000
companies that are coming up as as being

160
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:43,500
the kind of the focal point of the

161
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,839
Polish industry or the leader of the

162
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,759
Polish industry yeah thank you thank you

163
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:50,459
for recognizing that you see like as you

164
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:54,020
say like Poland has a huge history in

165
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:56,939
Horticulture and and and agricultural

166
00:06:54,019 --> 00:06:59,279
articultural practices so we we're

167
00:06:56,939 --> 00:07:00,839
feeling that you know the the kind of

168
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:04,859
possibility of cultivating medical

169
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:06,659
cannabis in Poland can be a huge uh huge

170
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,580
opportunity obviously they are herders

171
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:11,460
as I mentioned you know the research

172
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:13,379
institutes that are supervised by the

173
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:15,899
Ministry of Agriculture that are allowed

174
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:17,519
now to cultivate you know they have

175
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:20,399
challenges obviously you know like they

176
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:22,019
Pro the approach was us to agriculture

177
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:23,519
we need to remember that we have a

178
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:25,318
pharmaceutical product that we're

179
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:27,598
dealing with here so there are

180
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:30,120
challenges of how to set up those uh

181
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:32,759
this this agriculture that comes into

182
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,918
the pharmaceutical product so these are

183
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:36,780
number that's number of challenges that

184
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:39,180
you know the law and the legislation

185
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:40,918
around how the kind of from the

186
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,379
commercial perspective that cultivation

187
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:45,418
for those research institutes will look

188
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:48,060
like it's also a challenge you know

189
00:07:45,418 --> 00:07:50,939
there is no clear guidance of how you

190
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:53,220
know for example JV with commercial uh

191
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:55,199
commercial entities can work in know who

192
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:58,259
will find those cultivations we know

193
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,780
that there is a huge capex you know that

194
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:03,720
is involved you know huge investment in

195
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:05,879
kind of building a supply chain you know

196
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,380
building a building accultivation sites

197
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:09,199
and then production sites so I think

198
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:13,319
that you know before we go into

199
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,939
producing Edibles Vapes Etc we need to

200
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:17,400
kind of look into how we're going

201
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:19,139
cultivate you know good well verified

202
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:21,899
you know credible pharmaceutical

203
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:24,000
products and that's the first hurdle we

204
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:26,758
need to jump on in Poland right and I

205
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,500
think that's when it's when it's done we

206
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:29,699
have a huge history of working with

207
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,700
cannabis you know we need to remember

208
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:35,879
that up to 60s Poland was the biggest

209
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:38,158
hemp producer in Europe and the second

210
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:41,580
in the world sure we had over 30 000

211
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:43,439
hectares of uh of cannabis you know

212
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:46,620
industrial cannabis but there is a there

213
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:49,680
is a history of working with that plant

214
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:51,778
in Poland and being accepted uh within

215
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:54,659
the kind of society to the certain

216
00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:56,278
extent right now if it comes to software

217
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:58,019
and this is where we feel very

218
00:08:56,278 --> 00:09:01,200
comfortable all right like we have a

219
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:02,879
huge uh huge great community of I.T

220
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,120
specialists around machine learning

221
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:09,419
around blockchain and that's expertise

222
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:12,778
helps us in trust a lot to develop the

223
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:15,958
product you know that can change and can

224
00:09:12,778 --> 00:09:18,600
can change completely the industry all

225
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:20,579
right what we believe in here is to that

226
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,000
bringing that medical cannabis

227
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:25,440
mainstream lies in the creation of

228
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,259
proof-based ecosystem where quality and

229
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:31,339
compliance verification is streamlined

230
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:34,139
and that's streamlined and that you know

231
00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:36,360
increasing that traceability auditable

232
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:38,458
traceability immutable compliance all

233
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,039
those things that make product better

234
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:42,719
for the patients they can come through

235
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:46,079
the technology so we don't need to

236
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,759
blindly trust uh certification we don't

237
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,920
need to blindly trust you know what we

238
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:51,659
see on documents we can trust the

239
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:55,139
technology and the verification through

240
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:57,240
technology and to know that whole source

241
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:59,699
and everything that happens across the

242
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,440
supply chain with cannabis can be

243
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:04,680
checked and verified all right and

244
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,899
that's where you know that pedigree of

245
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:10,259
you know Goods uh great you know

246
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:11,940
technical expertise from Poland it's

247
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:14,720
playing a great benefit for a company

248
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:17,519
like us like Trust

249
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,620
very interesting indeed and it is it's

250
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,000
the technical expertise I think I think

251
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,980
everybody's looking at the Cannabis

252
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,240
industry with uh with rose tinted

253
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:27,539
glasses whereas the people who are

254
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,399
dominating certain sectors like motor or

255
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:31,500
food and beverage are going to be able

256
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:33,419
to dominate when it comes to cannabis I

257
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,700
think it's about implementing the skill

258
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:37,740
set of each territory that is going to

259
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,240
suit the Cannabis industry so I think

260
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,459
Ireland is going to be one of the homes

261
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,700
of the European industry purely from a

262
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:46,259
finance illegal

263
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:48,300
advice and consultancy and Company

264
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:49,740
setups we we know we're not going to be

265
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:51,120
the biggest cultivator we're no we're

266
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,100
not going to be a manufacturer so I

267
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,620
think it's about finding what it is that

268
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,060
each territory is uh specializing it and

269
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,980
bringing that to the Cannabis industry

270
00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:01,500
and as we spoke you guys have three

271
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:03,300
specific Global sectors that you're

272
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,860
already excelling at as well I don't see

273
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:07,559
why these can't be brought into a global

274
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,940
cannabis industry that that's exactly it

275
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:11,399
you know and we need to remember like

276
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,140
why we are based between Ireland and

277
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,179
Poland you say Island may not be a

278
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:16,980
greatest cultivator but you know that

279
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:19,559
connection to pharmaceutical industry

280
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:21,899
here in Ireland you know uh can help us

281
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:25,078
a lot to kind of understand and bring

282
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:27,179
certain things from uh how the how the

283
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:28,919
medicine is verified how it's produced

284
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:31,439
to the certain standard and how

285
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:34,379
especially you know with cannabis how we

286
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,300
can secure supply for patients which is

287
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:39,299
a huge problem in countries like Poland

288
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:41,219
just you know last year we had a

289
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:43,019
challenge you know in Poland where by

290
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,120
four months there was no product at all

291
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:46,980
in the pharmacies all right so because

292
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,860
of the challenges with the consistency

293
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:52,620
and the quality there was no product for

294
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:56,159
patients in Poland at one point I think

295
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,899
around October 140 kilograms of cannabis

296
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:00,240
were brought into Poland and they were

297
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:01,919
brought up within two days so we can

298
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,139
imagine that you know like that was

299
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,879
brought up in today's what happens with

300
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:08,100
the patients next month okay so like

301
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:10,620
that that's challenges that we can

302
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,300
resolve and I I think that here that

303
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,278
connection between Ireland you know

304
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:16,319
where the kind of we know a lot about

305
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:19,019
pharmaceutical we know about a lot about

306
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,959
supply chain we know a lot about how to

307
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:23,879
bring good product and equality you know

308
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:25,559
and using technologies that are used in

309
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:28,439
pharmaceutical or food like you

310
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:30,899
mentioned and then Poland with this

311
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,420
expertise in technology in agriculture

312
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:35,759
Etc we can combine those elements to

313
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:38,458
bring a better product we also need to

314
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:40,319
remember Ireland is great place you know

315
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:41,879
it's it's greatly positioned

316
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,399
strategically between you know Europe

317
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:46,379
and uh United States you know two

318
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,019
continents so it's amazing kind of

319
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:50,100
Launchpad for us as well yeah no I

320
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:52,679
couldn't agree with you more I think

321
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,778
Ireland might be the slowest to get our

322
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:55,979
uh our our together when it comes

323
00:12:54,778 --> 00:12:57,838
to actually getting the industry going

324
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,759
but what I think is when it comes to

325
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,139
likes of drug development and Discovery

326
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:03,419
we've already got the best

327
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:05,639
pharmaceutical companies already here in

328
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:08,759
the country to be able to Fast Track uh

329
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:10,620
the potential orphan drugs and real life

330
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:13,559
drugs that can be conducted after five

331
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:15,539
or six years of clinical trials that's

332
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:18,119
exactly it you know so

333
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:20,278
um I think that that's one you know and

334
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,440
then uh obviously uh Poland we're

335
00:13:20,278 --> 00:13:24,360
looking at polentasar let's say I'm

336
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,779
polish you know and lots of our team are

337
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:31,320
polish we have here in Ireland uh let's

338
00:13:27,778 --> 00:13:33,299
say sales office most of our production

339
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,300
happens in Poland and you know it's

340
00:13:33,299 --> 00:13:38,159
great to have also the scientific uh

341
00:13:36,299 --> 00:13:40,919
basis in Poland right there is a lot of

342
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:43,379
agricultural scientists working on new

343
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:46,500
genotypes development you know new

344
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:49,500
marking of biological markings of for

345
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,600
example strains Etc so we can deep into

346
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,339
that you know from one side in a

347
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,920
pharmaceutical knowledge on the other

348
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:58,139
side on the agricultural knowledge you

349
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:00,539
know around the plant and plant

350
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:02,399
expertise Etc

351
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:04,319
yeah no I couldn't agree with you more

352
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,639
it's a it's very exciting I think what

353
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,680
Ireland and Poland are going to be able

354
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:09,139
to do in the European industry once time

355
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:11,458
has enough

356
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:12,720
length in front of it is there something

357
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:15,419

368
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:46,320
being implemented in various sites in

369
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:49,620
Poland and Spain and Portugal in we're

370
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,240
starting those in quarter one 2023. we

371

products at the beginning of 2023 is our

374
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,160
if that's being clenched well if that's

375
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:04,018
being implemented we have a lot of

376
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:06,000
excitement around the product while we

377
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:07,860
talk to the clients to licensed

378
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,860
producers who can optimize production

379
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:12,720
who can prove the compliance of their

380
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:14,639
products and then Trace their products

381
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,220
up up to the patient so they know

382
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,720
exactly what the patient is taking if we

383
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:21,540
can do that if we can launch

384
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,879
successfully that will be my cherry on

385
00:15:21,539 --> 00:15:26,879
the cake for the next year and that's

386
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:29,639
our main objective within the next year

387
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:31,259
very good yeah I think clear rules and

388
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:32,698
regulations and traceability and

389
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:33,600
accountability is what you guys are

390
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:35,099
going to be able to bring to the

391
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,560
industry and it's what we're all looking

392
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,060
to have so the governments can see that

393
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:40,739
there's an actual Playbook that

394
