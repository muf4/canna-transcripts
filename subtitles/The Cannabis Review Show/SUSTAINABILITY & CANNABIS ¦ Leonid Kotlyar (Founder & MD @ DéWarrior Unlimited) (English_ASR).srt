Innovation how are you keeping today

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,699
Leonard I'm doing very well Owen thank

9
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,320
you so much for having me delighted to

10
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,640
have you on to cover this topic that I'm

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,380
sure a lot of people want to know about

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,880
but don't get too much information on

13
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,679
can you maybe give everybody just a

14
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,420
quick little brief overview of how you

15
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:41,100
came to set up the warrior and the main

16
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,640
objectives of the company

17
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:47,399
absolutely I I came from a career of

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,399
institutional finance and happened to

19
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:53,280
join the firm that was at the start of

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,219
the who cares wins paper that really

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,320
began the ESG movement so when I started

22
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,780
in Morgan Stanley

23
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,698
um ESG and looking after sensitive

24
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,219
accounts from the point of view of ESG

25
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:07,259
compliance and and and management it was

26
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:11,158
something that I always had

27
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:13,920
um an eye into and in 2013 when Colorado

28
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,320
and Washington state were legalizing in

29
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,799
the U.S and I saw a need for these sorts

30
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:21,419
of skill sets uh and institutional now a

31
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,600
know-how in the nascent cannabis

32
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,519
industry it was a bit of a no-brainer so

33
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:27,899
we really came into the Cannabis

34
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:30,840
industry

35
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,880
um aiming to create institutional

36
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,320
benchmarks and standards both from the

37
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:38,039
point of view of Professional Services

38
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:41,539
and execution but also this ESG side and

39
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:44,400
managing environmental social governance

40
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:46,560
variables throughout expanding this

41
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,540
nascent industry

42
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,920
okay very interesting

43
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,020
um can you maybe give everybody an

44
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,540
explanation of what is regenerative

45
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:56,239
growth

46
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:59,759
absolutely so when you think of

47
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:03,359
regeneration it's creating growth from

48
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:06,060
the point of view of Decay or waste and

49
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:09,060
in a way the Cannabis industry as a

50
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,939
whole is regenerative right after nearly

51
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:14,580
a century of prohibition of decay of

52
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:16,439
waste of incarceration of vulnerable

53
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,780
asset classes we now have the

54
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:21,959
opportunity to create value to create

55
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:24,180
jobs to create opportunity out of the

56
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:25,739
industry that stems from this plant and

57
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,300
that goes from the medical cannabis

58
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:29,520
industry to the wellness and

59
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,680
recreational adult use cannabis industry

60
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,680
and to the industrial applications of

61
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,920
the Cannabis sativa l plant or the hemp

62
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,260
plant so for us we see it as a very

63
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:43,859
holistic concept of regenerating

64
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:46,799
communities regenerating economic uh

65
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,780
impact regenerating Agriculture and

66
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,420
phyto Remediation and carbon

67
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,759
sequestration of ecosystems so we

68
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:57,179
believe there's an enormous potential of

69
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:59,878
this plant as a whole to create new

70
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,459
generative Industries in a place where

71
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:04,679
we've had

72
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:05,939
either obsolescence non-existent or

73
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,580
decay

74
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:09,900
okay very interesting so the first topic

75
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,840
I wanted to talk about was

76
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:15,840
sustainability in cannabis can you maybe

77
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,000
give everybody what are the top two uh

78
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,098
let's say the top two tier things that

79
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,979
any cannabis company let's say with

80
00:03:20,098 --> 00:03:24,179
indoor and outdoor should be an

81
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:25,919
automatic part of their business

82
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,379
principles to be able to ensure that

83
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,780
they're making a sustainable product

84
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:32,818
I think we have to actually take a step

85
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:36,658
back prior to that

86
00:03:32,818 --> 00:03:38,818
um so when you're creating a plan for

87
00:03:36,658 --> 00:03:41,399
your cannabis value chain whether you

88
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:43,798
plan to be vertical or you plan to be

89
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:47,400
integrated into one part of the supply

90
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:49,640
chain location is

91
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,860
um the primary variable

92
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:54,779
we believe that in the next decade most

93
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:57,659
of the world's cannabis will be

94
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:00,180
cultivated in the Sun Belt or the global

95
00:03:57,658 --> 00:04:03,560
South whatever name we want to ascribe

96
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:07,140
to these regions but cost effective

97
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:09,360
regions with abundant natural resources

98
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:11,759
is where we believe cannabis should be

99
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,700
cultivated so from the point of view of

100
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:16,798
even before we understand the impact of

101
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:20,699
one particular style of cultivation

102
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:23,159
versus another we need to give a very

103
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:26,939
strong weighting to put in your business

104
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:29,460
in the right place to start after that I

105
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:32,219
I would say understanding in the impact

106
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:34,918
of energy on your cultivation practice

107
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:38,520
and your overall sustainability profile

108
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:42,139
is key so as you put your cultivation

109
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:45,478
Assets in a place with abundant natural

110
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:48,120
resources utilizing them appropriately

111
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:50,699
with climate controlled Advanced

112
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,280
greenhouses that take into account as

113
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:56,040
much sun Spectrum as possible those

114
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:58,439
sorts of variables are are probably the

115
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,819
top on everyone's list when setting up a

116
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:02,040
business

117
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:04,139
okay and when it comes to the medical

118
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,639
cannabis side of the industry I'm

119
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:07,860
correct in saying that all has to be

120
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,319
grown indoor under strict conditions

121
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:13,560
with HVAC systems and ECS systems is

122
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:15,240
that correct that that is not entirely

123
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,399
correct no

124
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,180
um so you're you are correct that

125
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:23,579
medical cannabis has to be grown under

126
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:26,400
gacp environment so good agriculture and

127
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:30,180
collection practices however there's no

128
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:32,579
uh explicit note of what that means and

129
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:35,038
there are multiple medical herbs that

130
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:38,758
are grown under gacp that are grown

131
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:40,978
completely outside in the elements the

132
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:44,580
majority of medical cannabis is either

133
00:05:40,978 --> 00:05:47,758
grown indoors as as you mentioned in

134
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:50,060
greenhouses either Dutch venlow style

135
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,919
fully climate control Advanced

136
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:56,220
greenhouses or

137
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:58,859
um hybrid uh greenhouses which are more

138
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:01,740
like hoop houses with ventilation and

139
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:04,620
basic uh climate control but without the

140
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:07,680
advance the 24 7 monitoring that we have

141
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:09,959
in benlo style greenhouses and if you

142
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,959
look at the supply on the current market

143
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:15,599
let's say in Germany the majority is

144
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,620
indoors but that's only a function of

145
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,740
the

146
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:21,660
um the market itself so when 26 of the

147
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:23,939
German Market happens to come from the

148
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,740
Netherlands and the Netherlands has one

149
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:28,860
company that has a monopoly on medical

150
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:32,160
cannabis and they grow it indoors well

151
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:34,379
that's 26 of the market tilray and

152
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,840
canopy growth take another big part of

153
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:39,000
that and it comes from Canada right so

154
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:41,638
we we're naturally accustomed to

155
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,418
thinking that cannabis can only be grown

156
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:47,759
indoors but in reality gacp practices

157
00:06:45,418 --> 00:06:49,019
don't have that level of granularity and

158
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,660
control

159
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:53,219
okay so you see a future basically where

160
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,259
cultivation's got to be around the

161
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,639
equator and that European countries will

162
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:58,860
be able to ship this product in

163
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,079
repackage it in certain territories and

164
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:04,560
then then transport it logistically to

165
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:06,839
the dispensaries and pharmacies I I do

166
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,780
believe that that sort of Hub and spoke

167
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:12,418
model is is the future but that's not to

168
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:13,799
say that on Continental Europe we don't

169
00:07:12,418 --> 00:07:16,620
have

170
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:21,000
um low-cost uh energy abundant

171
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:24,139
cultivation centers ourselves so the

172
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,899
um the Balkan areas of Northern

173
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:31,800
Macedonia northern Greece uh Bulgaria

174
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:34,560
when it comes online uh Romania to to

175
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,120
some extent so those areas around the

176
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,060
Black Sea

177
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,699
um are very well conducive to producing

178
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:44,399
high quality cannabis with minimal

179
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:46,919
natural resources and the cost of Labor

180
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:49,399
that's significantly lower than the

181
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:52,139
majority of Western or northern Europe

182
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:54,538
uh do you know of any facilities that

183
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:56,340
are basically be able to have designed a

184
00:07:54,538 --> 00:07:58,560
facility that's completely off the grid

185
00:07:56,339 --> 00:08:01,138
where the water irrigation's recycled

186
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,879
it's got solar panels for electricity or

187
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:06,418
are we still a couple of years away from

188
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:09,839
that dream you know that's uh I I love

189
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:11,758
that question because that is the

190
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:15,418
Warrior's aim that is the proof of

191
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:17,460
concept to create that

192
00:08:15,418 --> 00:08:20,038
um I haven't visited a facility like

193
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:22,799
that yet we have a few clients that have

194
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:25,199
the solar panels installed that do rain

195
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,780
water collection but the rain water

196
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,180
collection is supplementing Wells and

197
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:32,399
things of that nature so it's still in a

198
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:34,680
supplementary basis versus completely

199
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:38,700
off off the grid

200
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:39,598
um and I think even off the grid

201
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,778
um

202
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:46,259
it would be challenging to have the

203
00:08:42,778 --> 00:08:49,080
Confluence of uh fully Off the Grid

204
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:53,580
energy and water sufficient enough for

205
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:55,200
cultivation at scale so I'm I I there's

206
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,940
a couple of regions where I could see

207
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,459
that happening but but it would be a

208
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:02,160
challenge Columbia is a place that that

209
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:03,359
I think could uh could potentially be

210
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:05,278
close to that

211
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,139
yeah we hear a lot of news out of

212
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,820
Colombia with the they're supposedly

213
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:11,220
going to be the supply side of the

214
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,740
European industry is that a realistic

215
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:15,660
expectation or are there new territories

216
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,519
that we haven't basically isolated and

217
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:19,199
highlighted yet that are going to be

218
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,480
able to surpass or is the climate in

219
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,220
Colombia like we've been told at the

220
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,800
perfect climate to be able to grow dry

221
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:28,620
and do all the things with cannabis so

222
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:30,240
first of all I I don't think Colombia is

223
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,899
a perfect climate

224
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:36,360
um I think it has very high humidity and

225
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:38,759
you need a particular set of genetics to

226
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:42,000
be able to do well in a climate like

227
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:45,500
that in terms of the pure kind of

228
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:49,559
cannabis connoisseur it takes a certain

229
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:53,339
terroir which is largely found similar

230
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:55,979
to Wine growing regions so Catalonia and

231
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:59,220
the alpuhar mountains in Spain have very

232
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:01,200
good quality for for growing cannabis

233
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:05,879
obviously Northern California Southern

234
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:07,980
Oregon as as well so Colombia may not be

235
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:10,139
perfect from the point of view of purely

236
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:12,720
cannabis but the amount of sunlight they

237
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:15,240
have the amount of rain they have that

238
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,600
combination that balance allows you to

239
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:21,060
create the Matrix of sustainability and

240
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:24,300
I think that's this key the key takeaway

241
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:27,359
that we wish all of our clients to take

242
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:29,819
away is it's not a checklist we're not

243
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,300
go going through any sort of this is

244
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:35,519
good this is bad shape up level up it's

245
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:37,799
really a matrix and adjusting this

246
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,959
Matrix to your budget to your

247
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:42,659
environment to your specific needs of

248
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:44,639
cultivation that's what we're always

249
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:47,699
after so from that point of view

250
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,740
Colombia does have something special but

251
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:52,259
I don't think it's any more special than

252
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:55,320
a place like Thailand which is rapidly

253
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:58,500
opening up and ramping up I think more

254
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:01,680
and more African countries both Northern

255
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,240
African and sub-Saharan are going online

256
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:06,419
so I don't think there will be a

257
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:08,820
shortage of Supply in the next decade

258
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:11,659
and I wouldn't point to any one country

259
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:15,420
in particular to be the future of

260
00:11:11,659 --> 00:11:17,039
European Supply

261
00:11:15,419 --> 00:11:18,778
Okay so

262
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:21,299
last topic Before I Let You Go is

263
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:23,458
cannabis and energy when it comes to

264
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:26,039
energy use and consumption and cannabis

265
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:27,958
what is going to be the the next big

266
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:30,679
landmark in terms of being able to

267
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:33,778
decrease that output is it AG Tech

268
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:35,399
inventions or is it Innovations with

269
00:11:33,778 --> 00:11:36,539
current methodologies that are already

270
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:39,720
in use

271
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:40,620
I think it's in my opinion it's the

272
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,500
latter

273
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:46,500
um we need to start treating cannabis as

274
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:49,500
any other pharmaceutical or agricultural

275
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:51,778
commodity and not as a stale worth of

276
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:54,179
prohibition and the reason we're so

277
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:56,278
accustomed to growing cannabis indoors

278
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:58,799
is because we had to we had to grow it

279
00:11:56,278 --> 00:12:01,379
in basements and attics and abandon

280
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:03,899
buildings and national forests right

281
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:05,059
under the cover of darkness and Tents

282
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:08,339
and

283
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:10,319
closed-loop irrigation systems but being

284
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:12,540
here in the Netherlands and that's the

285
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,459
main reason why the warrior chose to be

286
00:12:12,539 --> 00:12:17,278
headquartered in the Netherlands to be

287
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:20,338
at the center of agricultural Innovation

288
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:23,100
we understand that growing cannabis as

289
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:26,120
an agricultural commodity in Dutch

290
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:28,500
venlow climate control greenhouses

291
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:31,500
significantly reduces the energy

292
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:34,019
expenditure on cultivation the main

293
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:37,620
driver of energy expenditure is lighting

294
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:40,078
so when you shift away from fully indoor

295
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:42,419
or even worse vertical where you have

296
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:45,059
two tiers or three tiers of lighting in

297
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:47,939
the same space you start to reduce that

298
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:51,239
overall impact quite significantly and

299
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:53,579
even putting a cultivation Center that's

300
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:57,000
Greenhouse based here in the Netherlands

301
00:12:53,578 --> 00:13:00,359
on the 52nd parallel would largely be

302
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,480
equivalent on an Apples to Apples basis

303
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:06,240
of using about one quarter of the total

304
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:08,778
energy to having the same size canopy

305
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,919
but fully indoors

306
00:13:08,778 --> 00:13:12,720
okay incredible

307
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:14,159
um last question before I go what is it

308
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,620
you're looking forward to most over the

309
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:18,719
next 12 to 24 months in let's say the

310
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:21,240
European cannabis industry have we got

311
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,940
to be optimistic or are Germany going to

312
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,500
fall at the hurdle or uh you see the

313
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,420
Spanish Medical Market that comes online

314
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,980
at the end of December being a success

315
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:30,419
what is it that you're most looking

316
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:33,360
forward to

317
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:35,519
I think having been Incorporated

318
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,220
um in Europe now here in the Netherlands

319
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,980
since 2018

320
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:43,379
um we've done most of our work in the

321
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:46,500
medical sector and I think we're excited

322
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:48,600
to see what the adult use uh Tipping

323
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,578
Point is going to be

324
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,620
um and you mentioned Germany and we're

325
00:13:50,578 --> 00:13:55,278
certainly excited about that but if

326
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:58,379
we're looking at 12 to 18th month

327
00:13:55,278 --> 00:14:00,620
Horizons I I have to be a little

328
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:03,299
nationalistic here and mention the

329
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:06,179
gishlochenketon Dutch closed loop

330
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:09,659
experiment and we have a good feeling

331
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:13,019
that 2023 is going to be the year of

332
00:14:09,659 --> 00:14:17,219
opening up of production and we may see

333
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:20,399
the First full vertical uh integration

334
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:23,940
fully taxed fully legal of recreational

335
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:26,458
Cannabis here in the Netherlands and the

336
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:31,139
licenses that are vying for this right

337
