00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,480
following your Twitter landscape for a

8
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:29,339
number of years or a number of time now

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,439
so can you maybe give everybody a quick

10
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:32,820
overview in under 60 seconds of what

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,159
your position is and how you came to be

12
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,079
in the Cannabis industry yeah so I've

13
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:39,179
heard a bit of a strange career where I

14
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,399
spent 20 years on the investment

15
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:42,960
management side I worked at Fisher

16
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,759
Investments and Franklin Templeton in

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,399
San Francisco and then I co-managed a

18
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:49,859
couple of hedge funds in Santa Barbara

19
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,840
in 2016 I put aside the investment stuff

20
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:54,058
and started focusing on cannabis and

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,160
founded a dispensary outside of Santa

22
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:57,538
Barbara I did that for about three years

23
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,159
and then for the last couple of years

24
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,780
I've been focused on focusing on

25
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:02,218
bulleting that cannabis and investing

26
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,040
knowledge

27
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:08,939
okay great it's been a interesting to to

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,520
watch the Twitter uh MSO investment and

29
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:12,779
Community shall we say tether over the

30
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,000
last year and the positions everybody

31
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,978
seems to be taking do you maybe want to

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,379
give every a brief little overview of

33
00:01:16,978 --> 00:01:21,060
the higher calling LLC what is the

34
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:22,379
objective with your uh with your firm

35
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,359
and what you guys do

36
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:27,420
yeah so that's an investment Consulting

37
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:29,219
business that I started in 2020 and the

38
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,079
idea there was just to help investors

39
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:33,658
find the best and most appropriate

40
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:35,938
cannabis Investments for them and so for

41
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,979
some people that may be a portfolio of

42
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:39,658
individual stocks so things like green

43
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:41,759
thumb Industries and Care leaf and

44
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,979
Verano and truly individual names like

45
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,719
that or for other folks it could be a

46
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:46,978
venture capital fund there's a number of

47
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:49,219
good Venture Capital funds out there

48
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:51,478
that invest in earlier stage businesses

49
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:53,158
there's also some great hedge funds out

50
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:55,500
there for people that are qualified and

51
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,380
interested in uh in vehicles like that

52
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,299
and there's also some excellent ETFs as

53
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:02,339
well and so I think there isn't you know

54
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:04,259
like a lot of investing things it's not

55
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,000
about there being one best solution it's

56
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:07,680
about understanding somebody's needs and

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,719
objectives and then fitting the right

58
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,540
solution for them so that's what I try

59
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:14,280
to do with uh with higher calling that

60
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:16,259
got started with some larger family

61
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,818
offices that I worked with on the hedge

62
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:19,620
fund side that were interested in

63
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:21,899
getting cannabis exposure but didn't

64
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,340
want to do all the work themselves as

65
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,200
you probably know it's a bit of a

66
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,180
complex and nuanced space due to the

67
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:28,439
state-by-state regulations and that

68
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,060
doesn't even account for the differences

69
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:32,159
between Canada and Europe and everything

70
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,659
else so you know cannabis is a bit of a

71
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:34,739
difficult space to navigate so some

72
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:36,180
people want to Outsource that

73
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:37,739
responsibility that's how that got

74
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,420
started and they've just been able to

75
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:41,340
get out building it out from there

76
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:43,318
amazing yeah it's great to see the

77
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,700
position you're taking and the audience

78
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:46,619
of influence that you're guttering in

79
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:48,598
the industry the topic of this episode

80
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,800
is basically how to invest in cannabis

81
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:51,840
and I just want to kind of maybe give

82
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,640
everybody a quick little overview of a

83
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,860
couple of different ways and models and

84
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:58,619
methods that regular people can get into

85
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,660
investment in cannabis stocks because it

86
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,039
is definitely a medium to long term play

87
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:03,180
that everybody should look at it if

88
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:05,098
they're if you're interested in this

89
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,680
industry so first and foremost what

90
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:09,000
platform would you use to invest in kind

91
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,920
of the stocks or to purchase kind of the

92
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,780
stocks is there a specific cannabis

93
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:14,939
based one or is just a regular platform

94
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,019
that investors use yeah so it's a little

95
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:19,318
bit tricky

96
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:21,360
um there's a Nuance where the U.S

97
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:23,759
cannabis the plant touching businesses

98
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,280
can't trade on things like the New York

99
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:29,158
Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ and so the

100
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,680
U.S companies go public in Canada that

101
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:34,139
have dual listings on the OTC exchange

102
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,879
so if you want to invest in U.S plant

103
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:37,799
touching operators names like I

104
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:40,139
mentioned earlier Green Thumb Industries

105
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,180
are care Leaf which I think are some of

106
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:43,798
the most compelling opportunities you

107
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,500
need to have a brokerage account that

108
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:50,939
allows you to a allow access to access

109
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:53,280
OTC names or B or and B allows you to

110
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:55,439
access cannabis stocks and so one easy

111
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,360
solution for that is Fidelity and that's

112
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,579
what I use for a lot of things that I do

113
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,860
there are other platforms out there like

114
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:04,260
Robinhood which is a big retail platform

115
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:07,260
in the US and they don't allow purchase

116
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:09,780
of these OTC cannabis stocks so it's

117
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:11,219
really a broker by broker decision I

118
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,259
think partially based of what they see

119
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:15,479
is the demand and partially some still

120
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:18,120
see some regulatory risk you know we

121
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:20,459
hope to get safe banking last fall that

122
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,199
didn't happen and I think until we get

123
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:24,000
safe banking or descheduling or

124
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:25,680
rescheduling some of these brokerage

125
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,759
platforms and custody platforms are

126
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,620
still going to be a little bit nervous

127
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:31,259
about cannabis stocks

128
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,939
on top of that you could buy the OTC

129
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:35,520
names like I mentioned but there's also

130
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:38,219
great options for ETFs what we hear a

131
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:40,079
lot about is like the msos ETF which is

132
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,660
the largest ETF in the industry that

133
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:44,879
provides access to U.S uh it basically

134
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,220
broad access almost indexed like it's

135
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:50,519
not an index but it's index index like

136
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:52,919
exposure to U.S cannabis stocks I also

137
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:55,079
personally invest the ETF the Poseidon

138
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:57,719
Dynamic opportunities ETF which has to

139
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:58,800
Ticker psdn and I like that one because

140
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,720
I think it has a little bit more

141
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,360
experience team on the Cannabis side and

142
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:07,020
a more focused portfolio and the ETFs

143
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,819
use swaps to get access to the OTC names

144
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:10,799
so because they don't actually hold

145
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:12,959
those underlying names they can be

146
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,720
listed on the higher exchanges so things

147
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:18,120
like the ticker msos and the ticker psdn

148
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,860
you are able to buy on more platforms

149
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,220
than you can the actual underlying

150
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:26,038
individual names like a GTI or tier leaf

151
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:27,780
okay amazing great information so let's

152
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:28,978
say somebody realizes that they found

153
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:30,839
the platform that they want to be able

154
00:05:28,978 --> 00:05:33,478
to invest in how do you specifically

155
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:36,119
pick your strategy towards acquiring

156
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:38,219
specific stocks is it cash balance sheet

157
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,600
is it assets that they own is it future

158
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,580
earnings that you think that's going to

159
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,020
come in the door is there is there a

160
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:45,060
couple of different parameters that you

161
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:47,399
would set that all investors should be

162
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,319
using these one or two different or one

163
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:51,599
or two three different parameters to

164
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:53,579
judge what to uh purchase or is it

165
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,860
basically just research research

166
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:57,478
research yeah it's a little bit of all

167
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,038
of the above but I always think of

168
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:01,258
cannabis first and foremost it's a

169
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:03,418
state-led growth story and when I say

170
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:05,520
that I mean we have 21 adult use States

171
00:06:03,418 --> 00:06:07,918
today so that leaves us 29 more to go

172
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:09,779
and each state has its own regulations

173
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:12,478
which can be complicated and pretty

174
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:14,219
specific to that environment so you have

175
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:15,659
States like New Jersey which are

176
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,240
excellent States for The multi-state

177
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:20,820
Operators High margins limited number of

178
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,620
stores limited number of licenses cure

179
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:25,319
Leaf as a store in Belmar New Jersey

180
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:27,959
that's on track to do 72 million dollars

181
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:29,400
in sales this year so there are huge

182
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:31,138
stores in New Jersey New Jersey is a

183
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:33,000
great environment so you want to get as

184
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:35,879
much exposure to those limited license

185
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,879
States especially ones that just moved

186
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:40,740
from medical to adult use you contrast

187
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,719
that with where I live which is in

188
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,519
California and California is a very

189
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,919
challenging state for for cannabis

190
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:48,599
operators we don't have enough stores we

191
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:50,758
have too many cultivation licenses

192
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,620
there's a mismatch between supply and

193
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:54,419
demand we have about a thousand stores

194
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,300
here today we need closer to five but

195
00:06:54,418 --> 00:06:59,038
ten thousand to be healthy and so when

196
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,720
you're looking at investing

197
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:02,159
you could have a great big great

198
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,620
business and a great idea like glass

199
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,240
house Brands however if you put them in

200
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:08,399
the most challenging environment in the

201
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,819
US it still is going to be difficult for

202
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:13,799
that stock on the flip side you want so

203
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:16,860
you have States like California which I

204
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,900
don't make dedicated investments in but

205
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,520
usually with these multi-state operators

206
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:22,799
you know let's keep talking about you

207
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:24,779
know Green Thumb for example if you want

208
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,000
to get exposure to New Jersey which they

209
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:29,038
have you have to take some other states

210
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,598
along the way so those bigger Blue Chip

211
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:32,399
names are offered in five or ten

212
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:34,259
different states and if you want New

213
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:36,120
Jersey maybe you have to take in Arizona

214
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:37,919
with it which is more challenging or

215
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,139
Massachusetts which is more challenging

216
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:42,180
or Michigan which is more challenging or

217
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:43,680
California which is more challenging so

218
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,720
it's about understanding where those

219
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,160
exposures are at a state-by-state basis

220
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,660
and investing on what you think are

221
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,220
going to be the best environments so

222
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:52,740
that's number one is focus on the states

223
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,900
number two is you have to understand the

224
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:57,300
climate that we're in today if we got

225
00:07:54,899 --> 00:07:59,939
safe and lending opened up an investment

226
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,439
opened up then I would say it may make

227
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:03,000
sense to dip into some of the smaller

228
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,399
operators with more debt late and

229
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,439
balance sheets however we didn't get get

230
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:09,299
safe we're probably in a recession in

231
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:10,259
the U.S and interest rates are really

232
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,900
high

233
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:14,580
so under those conditions I always think

234
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:17,579
back to a conversation I had with the

235
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:19,680
CEO of Ascend Wellness Abner Curtin who

236
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:21,478
said it's not about finding the stocks

237
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,060
right now that'll go up 200 percent

238
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:25,560
rather than 150 percent it's about

239
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,720
avoiding the ones that are going to go

240
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,220
to zero and I I think about that almost

241
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,840
every day because in this environment

242
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,519
there's so much opportunity in cannabis

243
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:34,079
because the prices are so depressed and

244
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:35,939
we have this series of catalysts ahead

245
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,919
of us but you need to be in the ones

246
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,779
that can survive today and Thrive

247
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:41,699
tomorrow so on top of that

248
00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:44,580
state-by-state component I would focus

249
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,959
on stocks that have scale I would be

250
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:48,060
focused on stocks that have strong

251
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:50,458
balance sheets without too much debt I

252
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:52,500
would be mindful of near-term maturities

253
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:55,199
because it may be hard to refinance

254
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:57,480
those in an environment like 2023 and I

255
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,580
would look for look for businesses or

256
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,220
multi-state operators that have exposure

257
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:04,440
to expanding markets so Connecticut's

258
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,959
just turning on New York is just turning

259
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,459
on Rhode Island is just turning on we

260
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:10,619
have Maryland and Missouri turning on

261
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:12,479
later this year so in today's

262
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:14,220
environment I think it makes more sense

263
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,600
to be a bit more conservative focus on

264
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,180
the more Blue Chip names with the more

265
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,220
sound balance sheets but do that being

266
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:21,838
mindful of what states you're in and

267
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,000
also trying to get exposure to new

268
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,040
states that are opening because newer

269
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,899
States typically have greater margins

270
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:29,399
and more Revenue per store when they

271
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:31,259
first open

272
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:33,958
okay incredible wealth of information

273
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:35,580
there do you see a market at the moment

274
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:37,139
do you actually first and foremost do

275
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,639
you think that New York is ever going to

276
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:40,500
catch up with California in terms of

277
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:42,299
size of Mark of course California always

278
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,860
going to be the state's leading state in

279
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:46,319
America

280
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:48,120
um I think that demand wise it could be

281
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,980
right there you know New York is a big

282
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,560
state has a lot of uh you know cannabis

283
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:54,539
consultant culture and consumption over

284
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:56,759
the years so I think New York will be a

285
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:58,919
strong State I think from a cultivation

286
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:01,139
perspective California's climate is just

287
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:03,120
so much better that you know people will

288
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:04,139
argue about this California I think will

289
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,419
still be the leader in terms of

290
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:08,939
innovation and quality in cannabis and

291
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:10,139
maybe one day we ex we export stuff to

292
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,820
New York you know if we ever get into

293
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:13,379
interstate commerce I think that's

294
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,060
probably going to be a big thing because

295
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,500
if you go to these illegal bodegas in

296
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:19,259
New York they all feature California

297
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:21,120
products because that that's ultimately

298
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:22,799
what consumers want

299
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,720
um so I think New York is a good

300
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:27,000
opportunity the initial regulations

301
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,040
don't look super favorable tooth

302
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,440
multi-fit operators in that they can't

303
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:33,958
open their first adult use store until

304
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,580
three years after any adult use store is

305
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:37,559
open so they're essentially giving the

306
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,899
social Equity operators a big head start

307
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:41,759
there probably a decent cultivation and

308
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:44,399
wholesale opportunity to feed those

309
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:46,919
social Equity stores but I think that

310
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,839
broadly speaking that's the initial

311
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:51,599
regulations have not been real favorable

312
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:54,480
for the msos and so I think that the

313
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,759
people that have assets there like your

314
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,959
Crest goes like your care Leafs

315
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:59,759
um I think they've been a little bit

316
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:01,739
disappointed in the initial drafts but

317
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,360
maybe those things will change otherwise

318
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,278
it just may take a few years for that to

319
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,259
be a real profitable Market

320
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:08,939
okay very interesting do you see a

321
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:11,039
market for things like distressed assets

322
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,360
because with the uncertainty in America

323
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:14,578
do you think that there's actually a

324
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:17,039
position to to to acquire distress

325
00:11:14,578 --> 00:11:18,599
assets and and uh and for that to be a

326
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:20,819
workable option

327
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,519
I think it is but you have to think

328
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:26,040
about why is it distressed and so if

329
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,679
you're in a state like Michigan with too

330
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:30,360
much cultivation and you have and you

331
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:32,759
are a grower in Michigan and you're

332
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,560
losing money and it's really cheap to

333
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:36,360
buy it well you might just buy it and

334
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:37,379
keep losing money and so I think you

335
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,899
need to be careful about which

336
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:41,639
distressed assets that you're buying I

337
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:43,440
think that cultivation in and of itself

338
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:45,778
is not a very interesting thing to buy

339
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,640
these days I think retail is more

340
00:11:45,778 --> 00:11:49,860
interesting or even better is vertical

341
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:51,980
integration where you pair the retail

342
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:54,600
with the manufacturing and distribution

343
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:55,920
and the cultivation because they have

344
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,959
higher margins and that gives you

345
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:59,219
greater control the supply chain so I

346
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:01,500
think there are select distress

347
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:04,259
opportunities but you also ask have to

348
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,820
ask who has the money these days right

349
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:07,259
um in this environment where you don't

350
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:09,300
want to do an equity raise because their

351
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:11,519
share prices are so low and the cost of

352
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:14,819
capital has got so high like glass house

353
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:17,039
Brands did a race a preferred deal that

354
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:19,680
was 20 to 25 interest rates with a

355
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:21,778
couple of warrants so need to be a

356
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:23,458
borrow money at 20 to acquire distressed

357
00:12:21,778 --> 00:12:25,078
stuff 80 that's a high cost of capital

358
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:27,119
and B I think you want to be real

359
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:29,159
selective that uh in terms of which

360
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,259
Assets in which you would invest

361
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:33,539
yeah very good one of the things I

362
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:35,039
wanted to mention was green Giants and I

363
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:36,599
had come across and I think it's been a

364
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:37,980
great wealth of uh knowledge and

365
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,680
information you want to give maybe a

366
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:42,959
quick little overview of green joints

367
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:45,659
yeah that's a website I started um I

368
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:48,059
guess about a year and a half ago and

369
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:50,100
initially it had a it had a feature

370
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:51,778
where you could uh there was a premium

371
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,700
service we could pay for portfolio

372
00:12:51,778 --> 00:12:56,220
positions and trade updates

373
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,899
ultimately the payment provider canceled

374
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,519
that option because they didn't want

375
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:01,919
people paying for cannabis related

376
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,419
content which makes no sense right I'm

377
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:05,458
not selling cannabis I was selling

378
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:06,599
information about cannabis stocks but

379
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:08,458
that's the world we live in with

380
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,500
cannabis so that that feature went away

381
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:12,599
and now I just treat it as a place to

382
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:15,000
share things that I write and share

383
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,800
interviews that I do so there's about 60

384
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,720
different articles there and lately I've

385
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,039
been doing a bunch of uh interviews with

386
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,540
different investment managers in the

387
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:23,699
space and different operators in the

388
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:25,379
space and so it's free to subscribe

389
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,879
people can check it out and if you want

390
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:28,679
to you'll learn about the inductive

391
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:30,539
cannabis that's really what it's for

392
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:31,859
highly recommend everybody checking it

393
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:33,299
out and going to visit at the website

394
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:35,879
the last thing I wanted to touch on

395
00:13:33,299 --> 00:13:37,620
Before I Let You Go is do you see as a

396
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:39,120
North American investor value in

397
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,500
European cannabis stocks at the moment

398
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,060
are you still a number of years away

399
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,799
from taking a position

400
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:45,179
yeah I think Europe is definitely

401
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:46,439
interesting especially as the

402
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:48,299
diversifier

403
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,040
um I think expectations may be a little

404
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:52,139
bit High because the one thing I've seen

405
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:54,299
over and over in cannabis is things take

406
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:56,579
longer than we expect and so there's a

407
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:58,019
lot of optimism around Germany I

408
00:13:56,578 --> 00:13:59,879
recently sat in on the call with a

409
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:02,100
couple of German experts and they were

410
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:05,879
50 50 at whether we would see sales in

411
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:07,620
24. so if not 24 for sure 25 so if

412
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:08,939
Germany turns on in the next year or two

413
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,860
I think that sounds like a pretty

414
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:13,200
interesting opportunity and just like we

415
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:15,539
see in the U.S when one state turns on

416
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,459
offing the neighboring states do as well

417
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:19,799
so I think we could see that uh in

418
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:21,778
Europe as well if Germany Falls then you

419
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:23,639
know we we might see other you know uh

420
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:25,679
countries across Europe turn on as well

421
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:27,600
so yes I think Germany is definitely an

422
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:30,419
interesting opportunity in and of itself

423
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,700
but also a great way to to complement a

424
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:34,319
us-based portfolio so if you own some of

425
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,420
the big msos or a few of the single

426
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,120
state operators go ahead and add some

427
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:42,659
European exposure to diversify just like

428
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,519
in normal stocks a global portfolio is

429
00:14:42,659 --> 00:14:46,919
often better than just the us only

430
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:49,500
portfolio higher risk adjusted returns

431
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:51,059
more opportunity less volatility I think

432
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,278
those same conditions apply to cannabis

433
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:55,018
stocks and so I've mentioned Cura Leaf

434
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:56,759
earlier and they're one of the few U.S

435
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:58,620
msos that's really dedicating themselves

436
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:00,360
to Europe they do have a German business

437
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,679
that they Acquired and so you could get

438
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,300
that through someone like your Leaf

439
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:05,278
otherwise if you want to hunt around for

440
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:07,078
specific opportunities in Europe I think

441
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:09,000
that's definitely a good idea

442
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:11,578
yeah for sure I think Europe is going to

443
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,679
lead more biotechnology and biosynthesis

444
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:15,000
cannabinoids than actual cultivation

445
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,379
because the industry is just set up

446
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,659
completely over here for that to be able

447
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:19,980
to be facilitated it's been phenomenal

448
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:22,019
talking to you I couldn't recommend

449
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:24,600
everybody checking out green Giants and

450
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:26,698
following uh Jesse on Twitter at Jesse

451
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,959
Redmond and very much appreciate it

452
00:15:26,698 --> 00:15:29,519
Jesse thank you very much and hope that

453
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:30,719
we can touch base towards the middle of

454
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,459
the end of the year and get an update

455
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,019
and see where the stock positions are

456
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:35,638
that sounds great this was fun thank you

457
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:38,480
for having me thank you very much guys

458
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:38,480
until next episode
