00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,780

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,859
you're a very busy lady do you maybe

6
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:27,358
want to give everybody a quick little

7
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,400
overview of how you ended up at flower

8
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,599
higher and your position in the sector

9
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:33,899
at the moment

10
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:36,899
absolutely so I actually this is my kind

11
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:39,660
of my my act two of my career um I spent

12
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:41,759
a lot of time as an education executive

13
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:43,378
in the beauty and wellness industry and

14
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:46,079
you know really felt like that was going

15
00:00:43,378 --> 00:00:47,939
to be my career full stop and then

16
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,399
during the pandemic when everything kind

17
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:52,679
of changed around and I lost that career

18
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,759
I was laid off from um the job that I

19
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:55,859
thought that I was going to have forever

20
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,539
it was a moment for me to really think

21
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:59,698
about what I wanted to do with the

22
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,198
second half of my career and really do

23
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:03,718
something that was doing good for people

24
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:06,780
and also to be part of something that

25
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,820
was growing and dynamic and full of

26
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:12,420
potential and

27
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:13,859
what's in Innovation so automatically I

28
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,478
thought about going into cannabis I have

29
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:18,060
a lot of respect for the plant and

30
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:19,978
actually came to flowerhire as a

31
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,799
candidate to see if they would help me

32
00:01:19,978 --> 00:01:24,959
find the job and you know as I was

33
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,000
speaking to the recruiters you know we

34
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,859
really clicked and they said hey why

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,420
don't you be a recruiter and so you know

36
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:32,579
the rest as they say is history it

37
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,400
wasn't something that I set out looking

38
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:37,319
to do but you know the the Stars aligned

39
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,640
and I met the right people and now you

40
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:40,739
know I've never looked back it was the

41
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,599
best choice I ever made

42
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:46,280
I'm delighted to hear that's the world

43
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:46,280
words it was in mysterious ways

44
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:52,500
and jumping on to the first topic of

45
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,060
conversation is how to recruit talent in

46
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,159
cannabis obviously if people are looking

47
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,140
for jobs There's jobs boards and

48
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,259
companies out there but if you've got a

49
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:03,540
specific Talent uh that works in an

50
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:06,180
overall business first of all how do you

51
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,340
guys find the talent and second of all

52
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,560
how did the companies reach you guys

53
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,140
looking for the talent

54
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,759
great question Owen so I think first if

55
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:15,899
we talk about the candidate side if we

56
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:18,179
talk about people who are looking to

57
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,219
work in the industry there's two camps

58
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,719
right there are people who have worked

59
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:24,180
in the industry before and who are now

60
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:26,459
looking for their second or third

61
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:29,099
um home within the industry because as

62
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:30,479
the market is growing and shifting and

63
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:32,818
all of those things you know we do see a

64
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,560
lot of movement from within uh different

65
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:36,060
cannabis operators

66
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,219
um and then you've also got people who

67
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,159
like myself two years ago are making

68
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:42,300
that initial pivot into cannabis so if

69
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:43,859
we're talking about the second group

70
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,660
right so someone who has never worked in

71
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,400
cannabis before and who now wants to get

72
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:48,959
into the industry

73
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,300
um there's a lot of things that you know

74
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,680
we always say for job seekers in general

75
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,660
right you know activate your network

76
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,060
make sure that your LinkedIn looks good

77
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:59,280
all of those things but specifically if

78
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,378
you're trying to get into the industry

79
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,500
um I suggest that people really take a

80
00:03:01,378 --> 00:03:06,780
look and create a a resume that is

81
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,419
specifically tailored toward cannabis

82
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,939
and I say that because sometimes the

83
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:13,859
transferable skills that are really

84
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:15,598
going to stand out to cannabis companies

85
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,099
are different than what they're used to

86
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:20,098
putting on their resume

87
00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:21,780
so um for example um anything that has

88
00:03:20,098 --> 00:03:24,000
to do with working in regular regulated

89
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,519
environments anything has to do with a

90
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,560
lot of dealing with compliance that is

91
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:30,658
something that is really heavily valued

92
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,360
in cannabis and you should probably

93
00:03:30,658 --> 00:03:35,699
highlight on your resume and if you have

94
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,980
experience in startup organizations or

95
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:40,738
any type of startup industry that is

96
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:42,899
also really highly valued because it

97
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:45,959
shows your ability to be adaptable and

98
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,539
Nimble in a work environment that's

99
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,280
super Dynamic and sometimes can be

100
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:52,859
unpredictable

101
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,039
um so yes I would say you know do create

102
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:58,140
a cannabis facing uh resume one of the

103
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:59,699
tools I like to tell people to use is

104
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:02,219
there is a website called careers

105
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:04,979
incannabis.com and there's actually a

106
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:06,598
free Resume Builder on there that is

107
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:08,639
catered to the Cannabis industry and

108
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:10,798
highlights those specific skills that

109
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,479
the hiring managers are looking for it's

110
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,280
a great starting place for anyone who

111
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:15,598
kind of doesn't know where to start so

112
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,000
that's a that's the first place that

113
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:20,399
they can go to

114
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,918
okay interesting and when it comes to

115
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,939
looking for the talent at the moment is

116
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:26,399
it

117
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:30,060
what is the most sought after Talent is

118
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:33,060
it economical expertise obviously the

119
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:36,000
wave of llms and AI technology that's

120
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,620
out there that is at python coders is it

121
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Executives who've already worked in

122
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,519
business development and are not

123
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,319
matching over or is it legal expertise

124
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:45,120
where do you see the most sought after

125
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:48,120
Talent being in the Cannabis industry at

126
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,040
the moment it is all of the above and

127
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,959
more and you know that's what I think is

128
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,280
so exciting about recruiting within

129
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:55,560
cannabis if you think about these

130
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:58,500
vertically integrated organizations you

131
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,959
are not going to see the breadth and the

132
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,120
diversity of talent that these companies

133
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:05,339
need in any other industry right if you

134
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,680
think about a a vertically integrated

135
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:10,079
multi-state operator they are hiring

136
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,639
anyone from plant Tremors you know

137
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,459
hourly workers who are working in the

138
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:16,680
grow to directors of marketing to heads

139
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:18,539
of Finance to c-suite I mean they they

140
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,540
literally are building everything from

141
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:23,879
scratch so I think any type of talent is

142
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:26,400
always going to be applicable in term

143
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:27,959
terms of coming into the industry at the

144
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,478
moment you know with the state of the

145
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:32,698
market as it is it's a very it's an

146
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,079
employer's market right because there's

147
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:36,060
more

148
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,698
um there's probably right now more

149
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,560
experienced cannabis professionals on

150
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:43,680
the market looking for new jobs than

151
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,660
ever before so if you are you know

152
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,459
looking to build a team Now is really

153
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,720
the time to do it because there's a lot

154
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:51,180
of folks who are looking for work and

155
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,699
you're going to have you know a range of

156
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:56,340
really great people to choose from as

157
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:58,020
opposed to in other times when you know

158
00:05:56,339 --> 00:05:59,519
you go out you're trying to hire people

159
00:05:58,019 --> 00:06:02,099
and everyone's already

160
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:05,399
um in a job you know so right now I

161
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:08,039
would say the the most demand that we're

162
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:09,899
seeing is uh Finance and Accounting I

163
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:13,079
think that those roles are always things

164
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:15,120
that um will always be we have a need

165
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:18,000
for specifically people who have

166
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,579
experience in manufacturing cost

167
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,800
accounting and Retail Finance and

168
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:24,839
planning and Analysis those are always

169
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,759
really hot jobs and then of course

170
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:29,159
anything that's touching the production

171
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:30,660
side so manufacturing operations

172
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,180
managers

173
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,699
um inventory procurement all of those

174
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:38,240
things I think are always going to be

175
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:40,978
very much in in demand

176
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,780
is there a specific state or territory

177
00:06:40,978 --> 00:06:44,639
that's the hot spot for a job at the

178
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:46,138
moment in the industry obviously we

179
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,439
don't have Federal legalization yet but

180
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:51,300
I would imagine New York has a a thirst

181
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,759
for a lot of the top kind of talent in

182
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,199
the industry is the ice

183
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,939
it's funny you say that because like

184
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,620
literally on my other screen I have a

185
00:06:56,939 --> 00:07:00,660
big spreadsheet of like all my New York

186
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,519
talent because yes absolutely there's a

187
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,740
lot of um a lot of movement in New York

188
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:06,899
and we are starting to see

189
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,759
um the demand for hiring Talent there

190
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:11,698
especially on the retail and revenue

191
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:13,860
side because in New York they're they're

192
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:15,840
opening up a lot of new dispensaries so

193
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:18,538
they're looking for people who have

194
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:22,198
really strong retail sales marketing

195
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:25,019
experience to drive Revenue in those uh

196
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:26,939
you know retail dispensary outlets now

197
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:29,579
at the same time you're also seeing a

198
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:31,800
lot of demand in the Emerging Markets of

199
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:33,719
the southeast United States which is

200
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,180
super interesting because even a year a

201
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,860
year and a half ago like those states

202
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,840
were not even on our radar so I'm

203
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:43,560
talking about Arkansas Louisiana

204
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:45,779
Mississippi Missouri has has really done

205
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,000
well and and that market has really

206
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:50,219
blown up in a big way so the southeast

207
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,978
quadrant of the United States being

208
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:55,020
these emerging newly

209
00:07:52,978 --> 00:07:56,818
um you know newly open markets there

210
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:58,918
they have a lot of demand for talent as

211
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:01,379
well

212
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:03,779
and moving on to the next topic now I

213
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:06,959
wanted to talk about was what makes a

214
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:09,478
good candidate obviously from hot people

215
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:11,519
myself or other companies that I own it

216
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:14,459
it try to find the right candidate never

217
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:16,799
mind in cannabis is is difficult to know

218
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:18,719
if we add in the Cannabis factor it's do

219
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,620
you know about the plant are you happy

220
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,800
with that they're more business

221
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:25,439
orientated do you find the odd unicorns

222
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,720
who you can marry both of those skills

223
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:30,439
oh man when we find a unicorn

224
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,440
yeah

225
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:37,860
it's a great question I think of course

226
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:40,080
with every client we work with with

227
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,459
every hiring company they have their you

228
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,200
know their idiosyncrasies and their

229
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:45,259
specific things that they look for but

230
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,480
that being said I think across the board

231
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:50,519
people who do well in cannabis tend to

232
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,379
be a combination of a few things number

233
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:54,778
one we're always looking for people who

234
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:57,539
have a good cannabis story right I think

235
00:08:54,778 --> 00:08:59,879
cannabis right now because it is so

236
00:08:57,539 --> 00:09:01,019
um it's it's it's highly

237
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:03,059
um

238
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:04,560
it's portrayed in the media as a very

239
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:06,599
fast-growing industry and a place where

240
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:08,278
you can make money yes absolutely true

241
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,019
so we want to make sure that the people

242
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:12,000
who want to get into the industry are

243
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:15,600
entering for the right reasons because

244
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,039
if you apply in cannabis thinking you're

245
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,019
going to get rich quick and that's the

246
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:20,278
only motivation you have guess what

247
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:22,139
that's not going to cut it because

248
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:25,019
you're going to come in here and see

249
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:27,000
like how hard the work is and say this

250
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:29,159
is not what I signed up for right so as

251
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,559
cannabis recruiters what we always look

252
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:32,759
for is try to dig down and find out what

253
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:34,500
is the motivation for this person

254
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:36,778
entering the com entering the industry

255
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,700
is it because they themselves are

256
00:09:36,778 --> 00:09:40,439
consumers and they have felt like the

257
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,240
plant has made a positive impact in

258
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,100
their lives and they want to give back

259
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,379
that's something we hear a lot but it's

260
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,519
not you know required not everyone is a

261
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:48,899
consumer

262
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,639
um maybe it's someone who had had

263
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:52,379
someone close to them had who that

264
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:54,539
benefited from the plant from a medical

265
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:55,740
or Wellness standpoint

266
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:58,319
um and then there's also people who are

267
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:00,720
just really love startup you know maybe

268
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,220
they went through the.com thing and they

269
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,139
want that that kind of excitement again

270
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,759
and they know that they can find that in

271
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:06,899
cannabis so you know there's there's a

272
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:10,259
range of things but having a good

273
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:12,720
cannabis story is probably one of the

274
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:14,519
most important beyond that and of course

275
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,480
like I mentioned before people who are

276
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:21,720
Nimble people who are ready to kind of

277
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:23,759
work in this very hectic

278
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,278
um environment there's also some

279
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:29,278
personality things that we find tend to

280
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:31,559
be common denominators right with people

281
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:33,899
who are successful in cannabis so I'm

282
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:35,639
talking about people who are inquisitive

283
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:38,100
you know when you work in this industry

284
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:39,838
you can't just put yourself in a box and

285
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,420
only want to know about your specific

286
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,700
work because everything is connected and

287
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:46,979
so if you are a person who is naturally

288
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,620
curious about learning the other aspects

289
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:52,079
of the industry you will do better in in

290
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:54,299
cannabis another thing is

291
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:56,578
we look for people who are

292
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:58,620
um resilient right because sometimes you

293
00:10:56,578 --> 00:11:00,899
go through changes and you know crazy

294
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,700
challenges that

295
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:04,139
we're at a person who was not cut out

296
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,700
for this work they would throw in the

297
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:07,799
towel they would say oh man this place

298
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,959
is crazy I'm out of here right but a

299
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:11,458
resilient person will say hey this is a

300
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:13,500
challenge how can we work around it and

301
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:16,439
how can we get better so that's a big

302
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:18,600
thing too and then we also like to say

303
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,519
a little bit crazy you know I think

304
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,700
sometimes people who have that little

305
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:24,839
touch of uh wackiness in them tend to do

306
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,600
well in this industry as well because

307
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:30,540
you have to really be prepared to

308
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,220
interact with all walks of life every

309
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:34,620
kind of person you can think of from the

310
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,778
most you know white collar corporate

311
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:39,419
person to you know someone who spent

312
00:11:36,778 --> 00:11:41,519
half of their life in prison you know

313
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:44,099
due to the plants so literally someone

314
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,419
who has that you know that personality

315
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,899
that can really get along with just

316
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:51,419
about everyone is is also very helpful

317
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:52,860
yeah I've noticed in over two years of

318
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:54,659
dude this podcast has started out

319
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:56,399
originally is just Gathering data about

320
00:11:54,659 --> 00:11:58,319
the various sectors in the industry

321
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,639
because if you're investing or being an

322
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,160
entrepreneur you need to know all the

323
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:04,319
facets and over 200 episodes and two

324
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:06,360
years later there's a new sector that's

325
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,180
popping up for a new law that's popping

326
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:13,440
up and I think got a degree in chemistry

327
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:15,179
biology cultivation the the lab testing

328
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,040
there's so many facets of this industry

329
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:19,620
that one actually has to be a breath

330
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:21,419
with you can just necessarily have a

331
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:24,179
narrow focus on trying to find those

332
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:26,958
people is to is the job that people like

333
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:30,859
yourselves are on the home to do

334
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:33,958
it's hard work but we're happy to do it

335
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:36,120
and tell me this what are your forecasts

336
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:37,919
for the next 12 to 24 months in the U.S

337
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,139
do you see safe banking or federal

338
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:41,759
legalization open up because um I would

339
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:43,980
imagine that's going to create a wave of

340
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:47,700
M A activity which in then will drive

341
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:49,379
skill sets from current sectors that

342
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,000
aren't necessarily in cannabis at the

343
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:52,500
moment but one bedroom realization comes

344
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,299
I would imagine the pool of talent

345
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,639
that's going to come into cannabis has

346
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:58,500
gone a pretty significant

347
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,879
well I believe that everyone is kind of

348
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,679
holding their breath and waiting for

349
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:03,899
that you know kind of like golden moment

350
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:06,120
right when when safe banking is passed

351
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:07,740
and and federal legalization but

352
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,000
honestly I don't know if that's

353
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,320
something that's right around the corner

354
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,360
I think there's still a lot of back and

355
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,800
forth on that and we'll get close and

356
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,600
then it won't happen and then it's like

357
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:19,019
two steps forward and three steps back

358
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,940
it's it's frustrating but you know we

359
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:23,220
all knew that that's what we signed up

360
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:26,220
for right so some of the things that we

361
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:27,839
are predicting is number one you are

362
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,579
going to see a migration of talent

363
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,380
across the United States you know you're

364
00:13:29,578 --> 00:13:34,138
thinking about those mature markets like

365
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:36,299
California Colorado you know where they

366
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:39,120
have had a bustling industry for many

367
00:13:36,299 --> 00:13:41,039
years the those emerging markets that I

368
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,560
talked about are going to be importing

369
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:45,179
Talent from those States because they

370
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:46,859
need the people with expertise and in

371
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:48,719
the local markets those people don't

372
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,820
exist so number one you're definitely

373
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,060
going to see a lot of people physically

374
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:55,620
moving cross-country to uh go to these

375
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:57,359
new markets

376
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:00,060
um I think also you mentioned New York

377
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,980
earlier I think New York will be a game

378
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:03,419
changer in terms of what the future of

379
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:06,000
the industry looks like you know New

380
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:08,278
York is the the financial center and the

381
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,778
cultural center of the United States if

382
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:13,019
not you know most of the western world

383
00:14:09,778 --> 00:14:17,759
so I think the way that they handle

384
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:19,740
their market and legalization will be

385
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:21,539
um kind of like an example of what it

386
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,940
could look like for other states because

387
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:25,740
it's so different from California in

388
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,000
terms of the way that they do business

389
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:30,419
and the way that they're creating

390
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,399
businesses they have a a heavier focus

391
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:34,439
on social Equity programs which is also

392
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,958
great to benefit communities that have

393
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:39,540
been disproportionately negative

394
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:40,859
affected by the War on Drugs so that's

395
00:14:39,539 --> 00:14:43,139
one thing definitely to keep an eye on

396
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:45,240
you know keep an eye on New York

397
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:48,360
um and then also I think we're also

398
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:50,820
going to see a maturing of the Cannabis

399
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,620
industry and turbos of from a corporate

400
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,660
standpoint I mean this is not this is a

401
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:56,339
very not sexy thing to talk about but as

402
00:14:54,659 --> 00:14:58,078
a a recruiter it's something that we

403
00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:00,720
think about a lot

404
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:02,759
um as these companies are growing and

405
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:06,839
maturing you're going to see them have

406
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:08,759
more of a robust HR infrastructure which

407
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:10,500
means when you come into the industry

408
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:13,319
you're not going to be working with like

409
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,759
some ragtag group and you know working

410
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,980
with the bare minimum you're going to

411
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:19,259
see more recent resources available to

412
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:21,659
you when it comes to benefits and

413
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:24,600
insurance and Health Plan you know all

414
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:26,578
of these things that you need resources

415
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,379
to offer we're starting to see more of

416
00:15:26,578 --> 00:15:30,120
that in companies offering as well so

417
00:15:28,379 --> 00:15:32,039
that's great news

418
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,419
yeah the maturity of the industry is

419
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:35,278
going to bring in all the regulation

420
00:15:33,419 --> 00:15:37,379
benefits at the Banking and Financial

421
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:40,919
