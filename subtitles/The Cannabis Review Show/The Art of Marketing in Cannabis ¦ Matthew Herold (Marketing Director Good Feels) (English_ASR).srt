let's kick things off but basically you

just exploit explain to everybody

17
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:38,479
where you're at i know you're the

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,079
marketing director of good fields maybe

19
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:41,439
how you got to that position and how you

20
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,878
got into the cannabis industry

21
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:48,320
real quick yeah sure um you know it's

22
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:49,439
it's been uh a short but also long road

23
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,480
at the same time

24
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:53,439
a lot of action so a few years back i

25
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,558
had a major life

26
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:58,079
change i um i actually lost my father in

27
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:01,839
a bicycle accident and i

28
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,320
delved into guardian caretaking for my

29
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,198
mother

30
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,599
so i had a ton of responsibility i left

31
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:10,000
a career in health and wellness

32
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:12,959
and got a really close-up view of some

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,118
of the stigmas against cannabis

34
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,719
within the traditional and conventional

35
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:19,680
medical spheres

36
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:21,840
when my mother was misdiagnosed and i

37
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,680
presented cannabis as a solution they

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,000
were trying to come up with

39
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,360
diagnoses like dementia and then

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,519
parkinson's

41
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:32,319
and really it was adverse reactions to

42
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:34,640
the medications they were putting her on

43
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:36,719
and so i found it a bit disheartening

44
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,079
that i couldn't have a conversation

45
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:43,280
with some of the doctors in charge

46
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:45,919
of her care to have really something

47
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,759
that i saw as a productive exploration

48
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,000
for something that could help her

49
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,680
now in this time a close friend of mine

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,040
started to check in on me just to see if

51
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,159
i was okay

52
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,360
and it was sort of my escape that we

53
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,759
would talk about

54
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,680
the new vertically integrated company

55
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,239
that he had just been promoted

56
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,719
to director of operations so we'd spend

57
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,719
hours getting into the spreadsheets

58
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:10,000
talking about what are the problems or

59
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:11,038
challenges that they're trying to

60
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,878
overcome

61
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,719
and i got more and more interested and

62
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:15,519
he was definitely nudging me along the

63
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:17,598
way

64
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,520
and finally i decided to take it

65
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:20,799
seriously so i studied cannabis very

66
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,239
intensely

67
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:27,200
for about six months and then

68
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,480
just over two years ago i did a week of

69
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:31,119
training where i got to see

70
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,318
every single aspect from the extraction

71
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,200
laboratory

72
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:36,238
to the cloning the mother room the full

73
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:39,679
cultivation

74
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,719
experience to how it's processed trimmed

75
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,159
cured

76
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:46,318
packaged transported and then i started

77
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:48,159
my very first day inside a medical

78
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:51,359
dispensary on 420

79
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:53,919
two years ago that quickly led to

80
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,200
all sorts of opportunities promotion

81
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:56,958
into marketing

82
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,119
and since then i've worked with several

83
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,759
companies after staying there about a

84
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,959
year

85
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:04,158
and here we are today amazing okay

86
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,560
that's a pretty great story

87
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:08,000
um okay let's kick into the first topic

88
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,199
of conversation i think it's something

89
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,318
that you're going to be able to shine a

90
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:12,719
lot of light on

91
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:14,719
cannabis becoming a wellness industry do

92
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:19,039
you agree or disagree

93
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:21,039
absolutely agree absolutely

94
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:23,280
do you see much more acquisitions

95
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:26,479
happening now from the wellness side

96
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,519
of business into the cannabis side

97
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:31,598
it's hard to say how it's going to go

98
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,280
exactly i i can't speak to that

99
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:36,399
specifically but what i can

100
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,479
say is that the wellness industry is

101
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,840
very very large i think a lot of people

102
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:42,639
don't realize

103
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,239
that it is it's bigger than alcohol it's

104
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:47,279
also bigger than

105
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,200
the global pharmaceutical industry we're

106
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,719
looking at a 4.5

107
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:55,039
trillion dollar industry beauty alone

108
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:56,400
which cannabis has barely begun to touch

109
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:59,280
though we know

110
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,879
some of the efficacy of cbd as well as

111
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,959
there's promising results for other

112
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:06,000
cannabinoids like even thc

113
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,360
a in its raw form seems to be beneficial

114
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,878
to the skin

115
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,360
and beauty is a trillion dollar industry

116
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:15,280
alone and that's just part of wellness

117
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,840
so when we look at that we look at the

118
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,639
spa

119
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,759
scene which is considered separate we

120
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,600
look at all these caretaking services

121
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,000
there's a lot of opportunity for

122
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,960
cannabis to be integrated into those

123
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,680
i think we're at the very very beginning

124
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:31,918
yet

125
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,079
my personal perspective comes from the

126
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:36,240
standpoint of looking at the data for

127
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:36,959
why people consume cannabis in the first

128
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,680
place

129
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:41,439
and when you dig into those you see that

130
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,079
even if somebody is not necessarily a

131
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:44,399
medical patient they may be

132
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:46,959
self-medicating

133
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,679
and at the very least their reasons

134
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,000
typically

135
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,319
are all surrounding something that is

136
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,439
relatable to wellness and the pursuit of

137
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:57,599
a higher quality of life

138
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:58,959
okay yeah i think it's it's an exciting

139
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,560
one that most people aren't paying too

140
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:02,478
much attention the the capital that the

141
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,918
wellness industry does have to be able

142
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:05,599
to enter this space

143
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:07,120
is going to be pretty vast and when they

144
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,320
do finally push the button i think

145
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,759
there's going to be a

146
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:12,079
a big chunk of the industry brought up

147
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,600
by the wellness industry next topic of

148
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:15,038
conversation that is something i think

149
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,400
again you're an expert that and most

150
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:18,000
people haven't got a clue about

151
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,839
the art of marketing in the cannabis

152
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,240
industry again a lot of people are

153
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:25,279
barred from using social media sites

154
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,000
we had luke from can an la based

155
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:28,719
uh micro dose drink on they had a great

156
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,279
campaign

157
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,320
where they they more imitated to what

158
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,399
the effects and

159
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:36,079
the lifestyle that reflects can do you

160
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:37,198
see a lot of creative campaigns

161
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:38,639
happening like that

162
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,079
or do you see people sitting on their

163
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,439
hands and not knowing really what to do

164
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:43,680
with themselves

165
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:45,279
i think you get a mix of both right

166
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,079
can's a great example

167
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,638
um it's interesting you say that because

168
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:50,719
can

169
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,519
recently entered massachusetts we're

170
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,560
also a beverage company at good feels

171
00:05:53,519 --> 00:06:00,000
so we're doing a lot in the aspect of

172
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,240
celebrating life and wellness that's the

173
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,639
essence of what we do

174
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,079
and across the board there's certainly a

175
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,879
lot of confusion now

176
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,240
each state has different regulations

177
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:11,360
which is going to make it challenging

178
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,680
for example

179
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,400
a distinct east coast west coast

180
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,280
difference

181
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:18,799
in california on adult consumption

182
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:21,519
products you can offer

183
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,879
promotional discounts on the east coast

184
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:25,839
here in massachusetts

185
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,319
you cannot offer discounts so right away

186
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:29,439
that

187
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,759
that shifts your strategy for marketing

188
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:33,038
tremendously in terms of people sitting

189
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,439
on their hands

190
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:37,680
i think you do have people that are

191
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:40,478
confused at what they can and can't do

192
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,360
social media is a challenge digital

193
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:43,839
advertising

194
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,560
is starting to open up just in the last

195
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:46,239
year or two

196
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,519
so i think we're going to see a lot more

197
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:52,400
creativity coming to the forefront

198
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:55,198
okay and we've recently seen new york

199
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:57,598
have legalized cannabis and we saw duchy

200
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,400
have their big huge billboard on times

201
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:01,038
square

202
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:02,719
and uh weed maps if i'm not if i'm not

203
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:03,279
mistaken had another one there the other

204
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,639
weeks

205
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:06,559
do you see that becoming a lot more

206
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,680
prominent across the state such as super

207
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,360
bowl ads and

208
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,800
what not where the cannabis industry is

209
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,240
up there with the pepsis and the cokes

210
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,360
and the budweiser ads

211
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,560
in in terms of quality is going to be in

212
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,439
terms of quality

213
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,879
um yes i think that's coming cannabis

214
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:24,079
comes from a background

215
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:27,759
very closely integrated with music art

216
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:29,519
and all sorts of um you know back in the

217
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,560
prohibition in the us

218
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,519
there's a very prominent actor that

219
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,478
refused

220
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:37,038
to to stop speaking about cannabis and

221
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:39,359
he got

222
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:41,199
arrested he was a very high profile

223
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,720
person my point being that

224
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,160
in terms of the quality of what we're

225
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,199
going to see i think it's gonna keep

226
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,439
getting better

227
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,038
there are more celebrities signing in

228
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:52,800
into the space

229
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:54,639
everyone from martha stewart to jay-z um

230
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,160
it's going to bring that level of

231
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,120
production up

232
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,560
and i have to say i can't wait to see

233
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,240
the first

234
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,560
real cannabis super bowl advertisement

235
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,478
in terms of a brand representing itself

236
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,800
providing something inspirational the

237
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:12,959
same way that alcohol does

238
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,840
yeah no i couldn't agree with you more

239
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,839
and how

240
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:16,959
to you guys it feels good or good feel

241
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:20,318
excuse me how are you

242
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:22,239
finding the the ability to maneuver

243
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,840
within each state and over you guys you

244
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,360
have separate state laws so

245
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:27,439
have you guys got distribution

246
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,879
nationwide or is it specific states that

247
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:30,478
you guys have focused on i'd be

248
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,919
interested to know your distribution

249
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:35,199
method

250
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:36,879
sure so in terms we're in the middle of

251
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,640
launching in massachusetts and we've

252
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:40,958
already had conversations

253
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:43,519
because the interest is there of whether

254
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:46,719
or not we want to be in other states

255
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,159
our focus is going to be similar to what

256
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,600
some other companies have done to be

257
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:53,039
successful which is

258
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:56,159
we're going to hone in on getting really

259
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:58,480
strong in massachusetts we want to we

260
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:00,000
are a massachusetts born company

261
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,399
and so we're going to focus on

262
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,200
connecting with our local communities

263
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,240
educating them on our product as well as

264
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,200
we want to

265
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,799
give back to the community our company

266
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,360
just converted to 100

267
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:14,639
renewable energy all of our employees

268
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,759
started 20

269
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:20,000
or higher that's entry level for us

270
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:21,519
and we are doing a number of other

271
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
things like converting to

272
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,799
all plant-based materials to set the

273
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,278
tone that

274
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:28,479
when we look at life and wellness it's

275
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:31,200
more than just

276
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,800
you as a person but feeling good about

277
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,519
all the things that you're doing

278
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:37,278
outside of yourself and that translates

279
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,440
back to your own wellness

280
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:40,320
so in terms of our strategy we're trying

281
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,160
to start

282
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,160
local with ourselves and the people

283
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:46,480
around us then over time

284
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:47,360
we're gonna look at what are the best

285
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,639
ways to go

286
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,000
state by state what i can say is it's

287
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:55,199
really important

288
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,958
to spend some time before doing homework

289
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,120
looking at that regulation at those

290
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:00,639
regulations because they are going to be

291
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,120
distinctly different

292
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:05,600
in some very important key points

293
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,759
especially when it comes to marketing

294
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,519
yeah due diligence i think is uh

295
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,278
paramount when it comes to setting up at

296
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,799
the cannabis industry regardless of the

297
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,919
territory at the moment

298
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:15,439
one of the things that actually is

299
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:16,479
pretty impressive is the way you guys do

300
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,680
treat your staff and some of the

301
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,720
policies you have i think

302
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:20,159
one of the great things about the

303
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,278
cannabis industry there's so many

304
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:23,519
creative people

305
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:24,958
and it breeds a certain mindset to get

306
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,399
into this industry in the first place

307
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,039
because you have to chase your own tail

308
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,519
there's no

309
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:30,799
clear pathway to success so it's always

310
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,879
great to see companies

311
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:35,199
investing in their staff and bringing

312
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:37,120
them along on the journey as opposed to

313
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,640
kind of profit profit profit i think the

314
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,720
cannabis industry is going to be a great

315
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,679
way to lead in terms of social equity

316
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,720
and

317
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:46,799
reinvest in profits into the community

318
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,759
the last thing i kind of wanted to bring

319
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:49,599
up at you was

320
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:52,159
it's a bit of a random one now and i

321
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,240
just interested to know what you do

322
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:56,159
if you had ten thousand dollars as a

323
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,000
startup for a marketing budget

324
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:59,600
what are the top three things you'd

325
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,360
recommend any startup you don't need to

326
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,278
go into too much detail just give the

327
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,079
maybe top three bullet points of what

328
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:10,399
you think 10 grand would get you

329
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:11,759
sure um i think for one starting to

330
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,639
you know there are a lot of companies

331
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:17,838
that don't invest in their own brand

332
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:18,720
so i think doing some research spending

333
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,279
some of that money

334
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,000
into the sweat of really getting out

335
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:24,720
there

336
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,278
whether it's through digital medium or

337
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,240
getting

338
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:29,200
in person which has been difficult to

339
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,919
interview people

340
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,519
and start testing ideas so with good

341
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:36,639
feels we went through

342
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,078
an exercise to really learn we we had

343
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,720
all these parts right

344
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:42,319
and jason who's the founder is a

345
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,040
tremendous person

346
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,560
so is his whole family his wife is you

347
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:48,319
know they think very similarly and

348
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,439
that's why i'm on board because i think

349
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,480
the same way

350
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,800
i think brands can can really hone in

351
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,079
on understanding who they are what

352
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:59,359
they're providing

353
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:02,399
who are they providing for and getting

354
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,560
getting that down to an essence so that

355
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,639
it's only a few words long

356
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:09,359
when you do that homework up front it's

357
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:12,000
gonna guide the entire marketing plan

358
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,600
from there i think we're in the age of

359
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,039
content production

360
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:19,440
so you're gonna need to have a story

361
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:21,679
whether that's investing in the time to

362
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,600
film and photograph whatever you're

363
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:26,399
doing before you launch

364
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,399
whether it's working with creatives to

365
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,480
to build out something that's exciting

366
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:33,919
and entertaining and delightful

367
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,759
for people to engage with um

368
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,199
those are the things that i would invest

369
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:40,159
in i would invest in

370
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,000
relationships also in educating people

371
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:44,480
who are within the industry

372
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,039
um forming a relationship with

373
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:50,560
dispensaries with retailers

374
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:54,240
holding in on-site trainings as

375
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:56,000
kovid starts to shift back perhaps to a

376
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,079
more normal way of life

377
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,519
that's going to be extremely important

378
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:01,599
and providing investing

379
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,039
in those materials like what's something

380
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,440
someone can hold

381
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:07,439
and bring home with them that's not only

382
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,399
going to provide them value and tell

383
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,320
your story

384
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:13,278
which is is inspiring it's also to

385
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,160
educate them

386
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:18,078
on how to have the best experience when

387
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:21,439
they consume cannabis

388
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:23,759
safety first and always about how do we

389
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,920
how do we make it so it's most enjoyable

390
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:26,799
and going to raise up someone's quality

391
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:28,159
of life

392
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:30,479
that's something that's always very

393
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:32,799
important to me and i think when we

394
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,200
exude that as a company

395
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:37,120
people really resonate they feel that

396
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,240
they feel that they're cared for

397
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:43,198
and that's going to be a real um

398
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,839
ingredient for a successful company

399
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:45,838
amazing

400
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,040

401
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,639
