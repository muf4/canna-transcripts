was uh I wouldn't say complete but

49
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:18,179
um on its way we realized that we needed

50
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,780
more locations and uh the first one that

51
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:24,780
we tackled was Las Vegas Nevada

52
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:27,900
um and where we uh we uh we purchased in

53
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,520
March 2022 the yeah the art is in the

54
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,280
hotel at the time was the Artisan Hotel

55
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,819
also a boutique independent Hotel just

56
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:38,280
off the strip really great location uh

57
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:42,119
so we purchased this completely renovate

58
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:44,818
renovated the hotel uh rebranded uh and

59
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,879
reopened it as uh the Lexi Hotel Las

60
00:02:44,818 --> 00:02:50,339
Vegas uh last June so we've only been

61
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:51,840
open for a couple of months now uh still

62
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:55,080
a lot of things to

63
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,780
um to fix a little bit of a Kinks to uh

64
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:02,280
to uh to a line to be fully operational

65
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:04,500
but we're getting there and uh we uh

66
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,759
we're uh we're happy to bring that

67
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:11,519
concept to Las Vegas as well

68
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:13,500
we we hope that we can we can provide

69
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,739
luxury

70
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,598
uh stays and amazing experiences and a

71
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:20,819
really good time Vegas is a place to go

72
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:22,679
and not necessarily go meditate but to

73
00:03:20,818 --> 00:03:25,018
have to go and have fun and this is a

74
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,239
place that we are trying to craft those

75
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:28,980
experiences around that

76
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:30,900
incredible yeah it's definitely going to

77
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:31,979
be a huge space in the coming time I

78
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,480
think what's really interesting is

79
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:36,119
you're going to give everybody a quick

80
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:37,679
little history yeah on the Lexi in Las

81
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,120
Vegas it seems to have a great history

82
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,920
and a story

83
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,700
longevity so far

84
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:50,039
well uh it's definitely one of the um uh

85
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:51,780
landmarks in Las Vegas especially if you

86
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:55,259
consider anything that's off the strip

87
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,939
so it's very well known with the uh with

88
00:03:55,259 --> 00:03:59,878
the the locals

89
00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:01,579
um at some point and it's history I had

90
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:06,359
a really Gothic

91
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:10,200
Medieval theme to it uh it was um it was

92
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:12,599
full of art everywhere uh seating see

93
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:15,479
ceiling walls plastered with art and

94
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:18,358
small mirrors everywhere it was kind of

95
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:19,978
um uh it was great for Halloween parties

96
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:22,560
I can tell you that it looked like a

97
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:25,439
like like you were entering it to a

98
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,540
vampire movie sometimes but uh it was a

99
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:31,918
great Gathering Place for the locals it

100
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:35,000
became at some point uh one of the best

101
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:37,560
aftermarket After parties uh spot

102
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,079
especially for the locals so we're

103
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,699
trying to bring that back actually uh so

104
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:43,918
we're making sure because it for the

105
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:46,639
last six seven years that kind of stuff

106
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:49,079
the previous owners had a concept of

107
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:53,879
selling the whole hotel they called them

108
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:56,039
buyouts which kind of put a uh then into

109
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:58,500
the ability to be able to be open

110
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:01,199
constantly for for the local business as

111
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,959
well so it's been um so it's been a

112
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,919
little bit challenging uh but

113
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:10,439
um it was well known for crazy

114
00:05:06,918 --> 00:05:13,500
uh lifestyle parties as well uh for a

115
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:16,560
while it was a lot of uh swinger club

116
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:19,740
let's call it what it is uh that rented

117
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,899
the hotel and we're trying to uh bring

118
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:25,918
that bring back the hotel to where it

119
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:28,739
used to be before that uh so uh we're

120
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:31,560
we're we bring our own concept uh there

121
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:34,439
although we keep it very cheeky and fun

122
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,240
we are one of the only three hotels in

123
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:40,199
Las Vegas now grandfather and in with a

124
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:42,840
topless pool part uh license so uh

125
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:45,538
European bathing sunbathing they call it

126
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:48,779
uh so we have uh we have this open as

127
00:05:45,538 --> 00:05:51,300
well so we're we keep the the fun cheeky

128
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:53,219
sexy part of it but we're trying to

129
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,720
bring a little bit more class than what

130
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,919
the property had for the last eight

131
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,560
years

132
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:00,599
yeah I know a lot of Europe European

133
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,759
people who go to Vegas pretty regularly

134
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,800
and I think at your hotel be a perfect

135
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:06,538
destination for a lot of these you've

136
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,939
got a pretty successful industry over in

137
00:06:06,538 --> 00:06:10,918
Arizona at the moment this strategy for

138
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:12,899
the hotel was obviously got tourism on

139
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:15,060
one side of the teams but the matter of

140
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:17,758
conferences and and events that happen

141
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,680
in Vegas we've all got MJ Biz Khan and a

142
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,439
number of massive massive events from

143
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,199
November time and around are they a key

144
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:27,319
part of the hotels plan 100 they're a

145
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:31,080
key part of the Home Market you can't

146
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:33,539
survive in in Las Vegas if you're not

147
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:35,579
playing uh the convention then group

148
00:06:33,538 --> 00:06:38,818
games so we're not opposed to getting

149
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:41,279
groups we're not opposed to uh catering

150
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:43,160

151

00:07:26,098 --> 00:07:30,779
with that crowd on those time of days

168
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:32,639
when it comes to the consumption on

169
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:34,318
property it's obviously there's no

170
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,360
purchasing going on in the hotel it's

171
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:40,740
just consumption friendly

172
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:42,120
correct so in Phoenix our concept works

173
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:45,360
really well

174
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,939
um we can legally uh as long as we are a

175
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,340
hotel and as long as we have a private

176
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:52,399
membership on site we and and and

177
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:55,500
there's a few

178
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:57,959
legal Maneuvers that need to happen in

179
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,939
order to suspend our liquor license at

180
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:01,859
in some areas of the hotel so for

181
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:04,199
example in Phoenix we have a private

182
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,900
membership Lounge uh the illinoisians

183
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:09,120
Nations Lounge so our members that are

184
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:11,638
paying members are allowed to come and

185
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,840
enjoy the hotel for the day all the

186
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,879
amenities of the hotel and they're

187
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:16,978
allowed to bring their own cannabis and

188
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,439
go into our private members smoking

189
00:08:16,978 --> 00:08:22,139
lounge and enjoy the company of their

190
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:25,379
friends or or make new friends there and

191
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:28,800
enjoy the consumption of cannabis now we

192
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:30,780
also have 105 rooms only 16 of our rooms

193
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,959
in Phoenix are actually campus friendly

194
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:35,278
which means that if you are a guest of

195
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:39,299
the hotel and you bring your own

196
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:41,099
cannabis you're more welcome to smoke in

197
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:44,218
your room we have restrictions about

198
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:47,759
using tobacco so we're really pushing

199
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:50,519
more for anything that's tobacco Less in

200
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:52,458
terms of uh of cannabis because we can

201
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:55,200
control the smell and

202
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:57,239
the smell of cannabis once it's properly

203
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,519
treated it doesn't stick around tobacco

204
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,860
does and it's a big problem for us so we

205
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,080
keep tobacco out but those 16 rooms are

206
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:07,379
cannabis friendly sometimes they're

207
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,420
sponsors by some of our partners so the

208
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:11,939
team inside those rooms is really cool

209
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:14,458
and we have a rooftop bar where we can

210
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,980
suspend the liquor license and have uh

211
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:19,739
the use of cannabis there too for

212
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:21,480
specific events in Vegas this is a

213
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,700
little bit different we're working with

214
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:27,060
the authorities right now to change the

215
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:29,940
laws or or rewrite certain laws to allow

216
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:32,778
us to do a similar concept until that's

217
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:35,640
done uh the only thing that we can

218
00:09:32,778 --> 00:09:40,320
safely do right now is that we converted

219
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:42,600
our our main fourth floor uh ask him

220
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,100
it's friendly we call them our 420 rooms

221
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:50,639
they're on the fourth floor they're for

222
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:53,580
428 to to Z uh but um uh these rooms are

223
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:55,439
equipped with uh Resto air equipment and

224
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:58,860
they're all hard hard surfaced they're

225
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,080
designed to be uh easily maintained even

226
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:03,180
with the use of cannabis

227
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,339
um and uh and you are allowed to consume

228
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:07,139
it onto the fourth floor and those rooms

229
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:09,180
will be also sponsored by some of our

230
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:11,338
partners so right now they're pretty

231
00:10:09,179 --> 00:10:13,799
generic looking uh because they're

232
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:16,440
they're the same that any other rooms in

233
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:18,719
the hotel uh with the accession in a

234
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:21,000
couple Suites but as a sponsors Partners

235
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,700
come in they redesign the room and make

236
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,500
them their own

237
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,120
yeah it seems like a great branding

238
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,559
opportunity as you said if you've got a

239
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,480
lot of the big players at these big

240
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:32,639
events and walking in and there's a vape

241
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,759
or a cartridge on your pillow from one

242
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:37,319
of these top brands is a a very good

243
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:38,819
opportunity for these Brands and is

244
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,459
there a plan to take the Lexi brand

245
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:45,300
National and possibly International then

246
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:47,338
when European yeah 100 but the brand

247
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:49,859
itself is going to be elevations or

248
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:51,660
doesn't Resort the Lexi itself there's

249
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,300
going to be only one Lexi it's going to

250
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:56,159
be Lexi Las Vegas all of my hotels for

251
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:59,039
elevations hotels and Resort will be

252
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:02,100
soft branded so the Clarendon in Phoenix

253
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:05,159
by the by elevations hotels and Resort

254
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:07,860
Lexi Las Vegas by elevations hotels and

255
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:11,360
Resort and so on we really want to grow

256
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:14,399
into uh what I call the the the

257
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:18,778
occupancy Square for our area which is

258
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:22,139
Vegas Phoenix La Palm Springs and San

259
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:25,320
Diego most of these markets

260
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:29,639
feed each other for almost 50 in

261
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:31,860
occupancy so we our next uh annexa uh uh

262
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:34,679
Ventures are going to be San Diego La

263
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:37,259
probably two properties in L.A and Palm

264
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:38,338
Springs is on our our Target list that

265
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:40,379
doesn't mean we're not going to grow

266
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:42,720
bigger than that but that's just the

267
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:45,600
main focus right now we also have Tulsa

268
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,060
Oklahoma that we have uh intentions to

269
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:51,240
uh to break into and then up the coast

270
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:54,179
Colorado Oregon Washington obviously are

271
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,159
going to be an actual fit for us also

272
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:58,199
yeah and I would imagine New York when

273
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:59,759
the market matures that a tourism

274
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,759
Central I would say there's going to be

275
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:03,899
some more details yep yep New York is

276
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:08,039
part of it

277
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:09,480
um uh not Miami just yet but uh they're

278
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:11,819
working on it over there as well to

279
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,700
legalize uh the consumption of cannabis

280
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:16,379
so we'll see how things go there but uh

281
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:19,320
for the for the East Coast New York

282
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:21,838
would probably be the Natural Choice uh

283
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:25,200
the Carolinas uh are a good spot as well

284
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:27,959
really hot right now and um

285
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,420
when and if possible Florida is

286
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:32,399
obviously an easy one for us also well

287
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:35,278
that ballot is going to measure now soon

288
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,320
if I'm not mistaken

289
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:39,179
yeah

290
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:42,120
I was just saying that ballot in Florida

291
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:43,679
is the recreational voters coming up is

292
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:46,019
it not in the in the next couple of

293
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:48,059
months next year I believe it's next

294
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:51,360
year actually the same year in the uh in

295
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:52,919
the uh Federal elections 2024. we can

296
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,899
see what kind of Size Market that is

297
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:56,819

298
00:12:54,899 --> 00:13:00,059
