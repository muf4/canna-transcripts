really appreciate it great to have you

20
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,680
on so i've got to basically start off

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,120
with the first kind of question that i

22
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:52,159
had you basically saw oversaw the

23
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:54,399
the

24
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:56,640
acquisition of high times what makes a

25
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,879
good cannabis acquisition in the media

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,039
space in your opinion

27
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:02,960
in in what makes it a good space in

28
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,799
europe or in just in the media space in

29
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,359
general in media space in general is it

30
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,640
consumer content is it the the

31
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:10,799
problem with this

32
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,079
yeah so to give a little background owen

33
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,600
you know i've been doing trade shows for

34
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,438
about 30 years mostly focused on

35
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:17,919
business to business when i came in the

36
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:20,239
cannabis space i basically took over as

37
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,159
the president of mj bizcon and mj biz

38
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:23,920
daily which was a b2b and became the

39
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,320
largest one under my

40
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,759
uh tenure um after i left there though i

41
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:29,359
had an opportunity to kind of step in

42
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,439
the consumer media space and dope

43
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:34,000
magazine had built a really phenomenal

44
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:35,919
brand um except for the fact that i

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,319
don't know if anybody had figured out

46
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,320
the consumer media model in the us yet

47
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:42,158
there was a lot of assets out there with

48
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,000
a lot of hope and promise of becoming

49
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,680
profitable and sustainable

50
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,840
um unfortunately you know when when i

51
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,240
stepped into the the opportunity dope

52
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,000
magazine um we really needed to raise

53
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:53,599
some more money and there wasn't a lot

54
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,799
of capital out there we had looked at a

55
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:56,158
couple of different acquisition

56
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,840
opportunities

57
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,600
had a deal done with a different company

58
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,439
that kind of changed their mind at last

59
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:02,319
minute and high times was a good fit for

60
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:03,839
us

61
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:05,718
and they were looking to make a number

62
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,319
of acquisitions and really kind of

63
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:10,719
reinvigorate the high times brand that

64
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:12,719
had a lot of legacy support in the

65
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:14,000
industry and really kind of make it um

66
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,080
you know probably one of the most

67
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,239
recognizable cannabis brands

68
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,879
um in the us um you know after that

69
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,560
acquisition i had left uh my tenure at

70
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:26,318
dope slash high times um i just i

71
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,560
i think that the cannabis the the

72
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:31,039
consumer media space in cannabis is

73
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,120
challenging um there's a lack of really

74
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:35,759
i think some meaningful events out there

75
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,759
that can really um you know engage with

76
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:39,840
consumers for allow them to explore the

77
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:42,000
category um you know almost every one of

78
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,598
these media companies has you know a

79
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
number of different channels they have

80
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:48,000
print they have digital they have events

81
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,439
um you know and i'm excited i i just

82
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,239
talked to

83
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:53,759
rama maya the other day and

84
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,159
you know they just held their first

85
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:59,359
green street festival out in los angeles

86
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:00,799
really as as a bridge to from the the

87
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,239
business to business side to the

88
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,159
consumer

89
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,000
green street owns a building in los

90
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:08,239
angeles that

91
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,719
hosts a kind of a shared co-working

92
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,719
space as well as a number of brands that

93
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:14,959
utilize that as kind of a

94
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,560
california outpost

95
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,640
and the festival is really designed to

96
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,318
allow people to engage the category and

97
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:21,919
kind of discover the new form factors

98
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:24,958
that are coming out it's it's such a

99
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:27,518
fast and rapidly changing category owen

100
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,439
um so you know in the media space so

101
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,120
again um you know there's there's been a

102
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:32,318
lot of consumer media assets i just

103
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,799
don't know if anybody's figured out the

104
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:36,479
magic formula to make it sustainable

105
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,680
no i i think you're dead you're right

106
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:39,840
there i think the first wave of

107
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,360
information had to be b2b because

108
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,878
everybody needed to understand the

109
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,799
information of how to create the laws

110
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:46,000
accounts and all the nuances that go

111
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,439
with the business side of thing but i

112
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,680
think you're starting to see

113
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:52,239
consolidation of a number of brands such

114
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,000
as cookies you've got a couple of uh

115
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,759
platforms over here and i think it's

116
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,598
starting to switch now towards hold on a

117
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:59,199
minute we want to start capturing the

118
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:00,560
consumer's attention now because that's

119
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:01,839
who we're actually all trying to sell

120
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,560
the brands to

121
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,640
yeah and and and this is kind of this

122
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,400
kind of segues really close into why we

123
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,639
launched mj unpacked and i want to kind

124
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,239
of circle back on the consumer which is

125
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:13,679
really the most important they're

126
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,400
they're really the hero in the journey

127
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,720
right

128
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,639
um you know we when you say that that

129
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,560
b2b had to be the first and and when i

130
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,879
took over at mj biz con

131
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,040
um at the time they did a 20 tabletop

132
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:26,800
trade show at a race track because there

133
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,800
wasn't really a lot of venues saying hey

134
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,079
come on in and have a cannabis event it

135
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,079
was kind of scary there was a lot of

136
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,918
stigma associated with it

137
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:35,359
um there was a lot of concern around you

138
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:37,198
know what kind of behavior would happen

139
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,960
at these events but they were able to

140
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,478
successfully hold a couple very small

141
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:42,560
conferences and i was able to come in

142
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:44,159
and help them scale but the only way

143
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,040
that you could do an event back then was

144
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,320
really to have a supply side event so as

145
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,000
you know the the people who are

146
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:51,759
acquiring the licenses trying to figure

147
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,519
out what does a retail store look like

148
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,919
what does a cultivation operation look

149
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:57,439
like and so you know it was extraction

150
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:00,000
equipment it was lighting technol you

151
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:02,639
know lighting it was pos technology it

152
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,519
was label makers and and and light bulbs

153
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,960
and

154
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:06,399
and and there was a number of events

155
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,319
that kind of all sudden popped onto the

156
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:10,239
radar and there was this huge surge of

157
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:12,240
supply-side events but at the end of the

158
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,079
day let's let's be real cannabis is a

159
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,720
consumer package goods very much like

160
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:17,918
alcohol um you know going to get a

161
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,199
guinness or you're going to get a

162
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:21,279
cookies right

163
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,199
at your local pub hopefully someday down

164
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,359
the road in ireland

165
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,439
and and they're really you know if you

166
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,759
look at on the business to business side

167
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:32,399
of the media space usually the most

168
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,479
powerful and important trade show in the

169
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:36,159
cpg industries is a brand or retail

170
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:37,439
focus show and there did one didn't

171
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,960
exist because we don't have a national

172
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:41,519
market here in the united states because

173
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:43,198
of the complex legal system that's kind

174
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:44,159
of bifurcated between state and federal

175
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,280
law

176
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,360
um but our goal is really is like

177
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:50,959
let's let's be honest like the brand and

178
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,479
the retailer the last kind of

179
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:54,000
interchange and they kind of have a

180
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:56,000
shared responsibility to win over that

181
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,600
consumer of creating a safe and friendly

182
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,360
and educational retail environment that

183
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,840
a consumer can come in and explore a

184
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,360
category many people maybe never have

185
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:05,599
used cannabis before or they maybe

186
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,120
haven't used it for a couple of decades

187
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,560
um and to reintroduce them to the

188
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,079
category and then the brand has to

189
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,839
create a product that's tested it's

190
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:13,519
trusted it's transparent

191
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:15,038
that delivers on the experience that the

192
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:17,279
consumer is expecting

193
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:18,560
um and you know we obviously saw that

194
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:20,318
you know in the early stages of the

195
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,399
market there was kind of this rush to

196
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,879
bathtub gin so to speak

197
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:27,120
uh you know 100 milligram you know candy

198
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:29,680
bars and people didn't know better and

199
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,600
would over consume that um fortunately

200
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,360
we still have a perfect track record

201
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,080
nobody has died from a cannabis overdose

202
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,240
to date um so you know there but there

203
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:40,079
is danger obviously psychologically to

204
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,680
somebody over consuming cannabis that

205
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:44,000
can be very traumatic for people and we

206
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,879
want to be mindful that we need to kind

207
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,519
of

208
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:50,399
really manage that consumer you know

209
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:52,639
journey through the category um to win

210
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:54,478
them over as a category consumer not

211
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,960
just you know have a one-and-done

212
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:58,959
experience because they got too high

213
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:01,198
yeah no i agree i think the right stuff

214
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,799
like the race to the high thc content is

215
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,079
it the complete wrong direction for what

216
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,478
the consumer is actually going to want

217
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:08,719
to want when they have full choice going

218
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:10,159
state from state and even over in

219
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,599
germany you're going to see it legalized

220
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,039
and i think you're going to see

221
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,159
a lot of north american companies

222
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:16,240
planning that they're going to have

223
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,000
germany all to themselves whereas we

224
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,680
already know of a huge amount of

225
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,959
european companies who are already going

226
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,280
to be putting up

227
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:25,839
a fight for market share i want to move

228
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:28,559
on now to your mj unpacked your consumer

229
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:30,719
package goods trade show you guys did

230
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,399
your inaugural event in 2020 if i'm

231
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,240
right just about october just before

232
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:36,478
cove would kicked in was it was actually

233
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,360
2021 we actually founded the company

234
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:41,598
back at the tail end of 2019 and we

235
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,800
raised some capital to fund it

236
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:46,800
in february of 2020 so um you know when

237
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,960
i kind of look back at our journey um

238
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,879
you know i basically you know we we got

239
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:52,079
the money in just at the buzzer because

240
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,479
i don't think anybody would have given

241
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:56,639
us a dime to fund this enterprise um in

242
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:58,478
march and the economy shut down we did

243
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,720
do a number of virtual events

244
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,878
um and from a trade standpoint

245
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,479
especially for a very tactile industry

246
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,080
like cannabis you want to be able to

247
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:07,519
touch taste feel you need to be able to

248
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:09,120
be in the same room with somebody that

249
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:10,878
you're going to do business with

250
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,959
to kind of read their body language and

251
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,800
build a level of trust and and virtual

252
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,799
events just don't fit that bill very

253
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,560
well for cannabis and a lot of other

254
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,400
industries and the tech space are great

255
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,280
because it's very you know kind of

256
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:25,279
technical and and and transactional but

257
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,198
for cannabis it's very relational and

258
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:29,119
it's important that people get together

259
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,199
and kind of you know celebrate the the

260
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,639
industry but also be in the room with

261
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,240
the right people

262
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:35,598
with mgm pact one of the things that we

263
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,959
did different than any other trade show

264
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,719
in the united states is we actually

265
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,639
qualify every single one of our

266
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,039
attendees to make sure that they're a

267
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:44,958
retail or a brand cpg

268
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:46,639
brand company with the title of manager

269
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,079
hire so we're immediately screening to

270
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:49,600
make sure that everybody in the room is

271
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,519
a decision maker

272
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,120
we also know that you know one of the

273
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,759
big challenges here in the united states

274
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,919
is access to capital and we also allow

275
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:59,120
in accredited investors who are actively

276
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:00,639
investing in cannabis because we're

277
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,560
looking for intent and potential not

278
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:04,000
just somebody that might have a couple

279
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:05,679
hundred shares of cure leaf in their

280
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,080
e-trade portfolio but somebody who could

281
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:09,759
actually write a check

282
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,759
you know until we have access to safe

283
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:14,319
banking and normalize you know the

284
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:15,519
financial markets for cannabis um you

285
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,640
know it's going to continue to be a

286
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,320
choke point for our industry's growth

287
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:22,319
yeah we spoke to the guys green check

288
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,839
verified in new york peter sue and there

289
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,278
seems to be a couple of solutions coming

290
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,279
for the banking sector just around the

291
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:29,278
corner and i think that new york

292
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:30,559
industry is going to propel the us

293
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:33,039
industry on

294
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:34,799
by a huge margin i think even myself i

295
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,559
was over there two weeks ago and the

296
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:39,519
cannabis was prevalent everywhere from

297
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:42,079
the vans on fifth avenue to yeah cb's

298
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,159
doors selling thc products i think the

299
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,759
consumer tourism over there

300
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:47,360
people are underestimating how many

301
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:49,278
europeans i think are going to travel to

302
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,839
europe for to new york for cannabis

303
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:53,360
experience sure and well you can travel

304
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,040
to boston right now for a cannabis

305
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,720
experience it's uh certainly a little

306
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:59,360
bit closer than new york for traveling

307
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,360
across the pond but um you know it's

308
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,440
interesting because

309
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,600
um you know it's

310
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,440
on one side yes in new york it's kind of

311
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,360
this very kind of libertarian kind of

312
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,200
mentality living in a big city like that

313
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,039
that you kind of as long as they're not

314
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,200
infringing on your personal space or

315
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:16,559
rights then you know let them be and and

316
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,320
i've been you know when we did our show

317
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:20,078
in new york just this past may i mean

318
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,000
people are outside smoking you can smoke

319
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:24,078
cannabis legally at any place that

320
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,919
you're allowed to smoke a cigarette so

321
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:27,278
restaurants you know have outdoor patios

322
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,278
you can go up and light up a joint and

323
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:30,958
go have your meal

324
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:33,838
you know and and i do agree with you

325
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:36,000
that new york because of its weight and

326
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,279
its influence in washington might

327
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,759
accelerate

328
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:42,639
um you know the the legal some type of

329
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:44,078
safe banking solution uh but you know

330
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:45,439
the other other side of it when you say

331
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:46,879
it's right around the corner we've been

332
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,440
saying that for almost 10 years now in

333
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:50,320
the cannabis space um unfortunately and

334
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,399
and

335
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,079
um you know i i know that you have a lot

336
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,240
of very intelligent you know listeners

337
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:58,799
to this i mean american politics have

338
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,639
become blood sport um we've allowed

339
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:03,838
corporate interest to influence our

340
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:05,838
politics to a a degree in a level that

341
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,920
is dangerous for democracy um i hope

342
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,399
that someday we repeal the

343
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:13,278
um citizens united we have career

344
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,639
politicians that are you know it's it's

345
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:15,919
i was listening to a program the other

346
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:18,799
day that

347
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:20,240
on average like 95 of our centers and

348
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:23,120
representatives will get reelected

349
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,120
because it's just there's that much

350
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,679
influence for them to be able to beef up

351
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,440
their campaign coffers versus a

352
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:32,000
non-incumbent thing and that's that's

353
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,680
problematic for democracy but um you

354
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,519
know hopefully we um this great

355
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:37,519
experiment will figure it out again

356
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,480
yeah i hope so last thing i wanted to

357
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:43,200
touch on was the mj brand and insights

358
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,959
that you guys do one of the things that

359
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,120
it's probably a pet peeve i know over in

360
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:49,759
europe here the amount of reports that i

361
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,919
see that europe is going to be worth 50

362
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:55,439
billion germany is going to be worth 10

363
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:58,319
billion how do you bring real truth and

364
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,399
insight and analysis to hypothetical

365
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,000
markets that may not have happened yet

366
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,519
do you set parameters for you guys

367
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,120
because over here some of the the

368
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,120
companies that do it don't really seem

369
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,959
to it seems to be all one-sided we're

370
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,120
just going to write all the fluffy stuff

371
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:12,719
for us i think it has to be more nuanced

372
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,519
than that for for real investors to have

373
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,000
a look

374
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:19,278
yeah absolutely and so mj brand insights

375
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,879
we actually just rebranded as mjbi um we

376
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:23,039
do have a strategic partnership with a

377
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:25,600
company called bdsa they are one of the

378
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:27,439
leading analytics firms in the market um

379
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,320
and and and going back to that i mean

380
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:33,040
everybody you know any publisher or you

381
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,959
know data an analyst is going to want to

382
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:36,958
come up with some hyperbolic future

383
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:38,638
number of what the market's going to be

384
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,759
and the bigger that number is the more

385
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,919
likely that they're going to get press

386
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:44,559
coverage on that number right so

387
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:46,958
um it's it it's somewhat of a function

388
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:49,199
of sensationalized news um that that

389
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:52,000
we've fallen in a trap as opposed to you

390
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,240
know critical thinking and you know pure

391
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,839
journalism um you know

392
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,879
what we're trying to do is again is

393
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,480
differentiate ourselves from the kind of

394
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:02,000
oversaturated like hey let's post news

395
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,720
stories that are basically pulled from

396
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,078
news feeds um you know about this this

397
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,920
happening or this company you know

398
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:09,439
launching this product but really kind

399
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:11,599
of you know have more of a

400
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,279
conversational approach um we also have

401
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,800
a strategic partnership with a company

402
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:16,720
called pioneer intelligence it's really

403
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:19,519
cool what they do they measure

404
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,000
um consumer activity based on three

405
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:24,159
pillars social media website traffic and

406
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,600
earn media and so they can kind of see

407
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:27,039
which brands are trending up they're

408
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,519
getting more hits on their on their

409
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:31,759
social media posts on their website and

410
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,360
and tie that in and so if somebody from

411
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:34,879
the company is you know can look at

412
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,560
saying all right we ran this marketing

413
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:38,320
promotion we saw this big uptick so

414
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:39,919
let's run that again right that worked

415
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,800
and if it doesn't happen it didn't work

416
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:45,039
let's do something else um so we don't

417
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:46,719
we don't do that type of market analysis

418
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:48,559
what we do do is we cover you know

419
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,519
brands that are creating innovation we

420
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:51,759
look at

421
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:54,078
you know um social equity owned brands

422
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:56,240
uh women-owned brands we really try to

423
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:58,239
cover the underrepresented voices in

424
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,320
this industry and you know while the

425
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,560
msos in the space get you know suck up a

426
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,560
lot of oxygen and news channels

427
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:05,759
it's really innovation really happens at

428
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:08,479
the kind of

429
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:10,319
small business level and when you know

430
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,159
you have a very serial entrepreneur

431
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,839
trying to differentiate themselves and

432
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:16,559
those are the stories we want to see get

433
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,079
lifted up get get attention um you know

434
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:19,919
going back i know that you know the

435
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:22,399
american market is very nuanced compared

436
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:23,198
to what's going to happen in europe um

437
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,799
but

438
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:26,799
at some point in time there's going to

439
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:27,919
be a moment where we federally legalize

440
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,599
cannabis

441
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:31,120
the alcohol and tobacco companies have

442
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,959
business plans they have operational

443
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,720
capital set aside they have some really

444
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:36,399
smart people and they're going to try to

445
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,000
steamroll this entire industry and i

446
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,240
think it would be a shame

447
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,919
if the cannabis industry lost some of

448
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,079
this innovation that happens at the

449
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:45,360
grassroots level and more importantly is

450
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:46,799
that we lost control of the thought

451
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,399
leadership of cannabis because we

452
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:50,078
deserve a better industry that's more

453
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,039
compassionate this is medicine this

454
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:53,519
isn't

455
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:55,519
an intoxicant and really help help

456
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,399
support the growth of the industry

457
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:01,120
so when europe legalizes is there a

458
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:04,078
brand in north america canada or at the

459
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,639
usa that you think has the best chance

460
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:09,120
of making europe

461
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,519
um i would say

462
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,198
not necessarily i think that the largest

463
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,120
brand in the world

464
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:17,039
might not yet have been invented

465
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,198
um there's certainly some powerhouses

466
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:21,919
here in the u.s like we had talked about

467
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:24,799
before the cookies purely select wanna

468
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:26,078
brands um that have some potential but

469
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,000
um you know i think the european

470
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:29,439
market's going to be very unique and i

471
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,720
think that european brands are going to

472
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,000
have the opportunity to really own that

473
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,440
market

474
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,519
yeah i couldn't agree it's it's very

475
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,920
nuanced over here when you get over here

476
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,000
and the the the ability to be able to

477
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:42,399
penetrate the whole of europe with one

478
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,240
brand and one narrative and one message

479
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,519
is a little bit of a misplaced idea i

480
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,959
think

481
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,959
yep we've got i mean we've got all these

482
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:50,719
bifurcated state markets here i mean in

483
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:52,799
europe you know you know regardless of

484
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,759
the eu you do have very you know unique

485
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:57,599
cultural kind of nuances to this and so

486
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,800
um yeah i'm excited to see what's going

487
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,879
to happen next

488
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:02,479
