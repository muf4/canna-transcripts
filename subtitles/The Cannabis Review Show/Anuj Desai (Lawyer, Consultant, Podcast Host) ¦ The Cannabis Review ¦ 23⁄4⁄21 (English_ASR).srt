27
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,079
a commercial lawyer

28
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:50,079
mainly working in the media space so i

29
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,198
work for a variety of

30
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,439
uh big media companies in the uk um but

31
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:55,359
i

32
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:56,960
i kind of got a bit restless a few years

33
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:58,719
ago wanted to do something more

34
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,439
entrepreneurial so

35
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,520
uh quit my job kissed a few frogs

36
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,359
started my own business with a friend

37
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,000
um and then i kind of stumbled on

38
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:09,599
medical cannabis and at the end of 2017

39
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,280
i'd only known about it recreationally

40
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:13,199
before then um and

41
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,478
went to a few conferences and i was sort

42
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,680
of like wow

43
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:18,719
there's there's so much here um and it

44
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,960
has a real chance to

45
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:21,759
be a very positive impact on the planet

46
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:24,879
so

47
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,000
um i started to kind of you know read

48
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:27,280
more and and meet more

49
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,280
people but i couldn't really figure out

50
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,159
what i wanted to do so i started a

51
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,000
podcast

52
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,439
um because no one was really doing it in

53
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,400
europe at the time there's quite a few

54
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:38,639
american ones

55
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,400
um and yeah 110 episodes now in

56
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,239
um interviewed some great people across

57
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,600
the world and it's kind of ever

58
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:46,158
expanding really there's there's

59
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:47,519
more and more topics to cover so um so

60
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,600
yeah no that's been great

61
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,519
and off the back of that i i started a

62
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:53,679
commercial consultancy so

63
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:55,599
i still do a bit of lawyering but

64
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,240
alongside that i'm kind of helping

65
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:00,239
early stage businesses with anything

66
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:02,718
from sort of board advisor

67
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:05,118
type stuff to helping them with their

68
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:07,519
fundraising to

69
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:08,878
advising on strategic acquisitions

70
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:10,560
amazing yeah well you were one of the

71
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,959
inspirations for this show to start up

72
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,878
so

73
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,560
it's uh great to have you on i'm going

74
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:17,280
to kick things off get everybody up to

75
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,039
speeds when it comes to the regulations

76
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,120
that's been passed so far are we looking

77
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:26,479
at uk one eu nil

78
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,400
um i don't think i agree with that um

79
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,840
i mean it was a positive move that we

80
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,480
legalized uh

81
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,159
medical um a couple of years ago but the

82
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:35,518
reality is that

83
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:38,318
you know it hasn't really changed

84
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,480
anything um not not very many people

85
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:41,679
um have managed to get prescriptions on

86
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:44,318
the nhs

87
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,120
and it's been a real bone of contention

88
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:48,238
um

89
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,800
the framework and the education um

90
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,599
within the medical fraternity is is not

91
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,560
great and

92
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:55,199
so i think there's a crucial step as

93
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,400
well

94
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,280
your gp so your frontline access to to

95
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,239
medical

96
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,519
help is not able to prescribe so there's

97
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,439
another step that needs to go to a

98
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,439
consultant but those gps don't know when

99
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:09,519
to refer or who to refer to

100
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,199
um there's a huge amount of people

101
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,680
within the nhs that just didn't even

102
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:13,199
know that

103
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,959
the cannabis had been legalized

104
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,639
medically so the

105
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,239
you know the the knowledge just isn't

106
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:19,839
there yet so there's huge amounts of

107
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,519
work that needs to be done

108
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:27,280
um and in terms of you know in terms of

109
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,759
the wider reform um

110
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,759
we're we're very far behind so sadiq

111
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,598
khan actually the london mayor

112
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:35,039
last week announced that he would like

113
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:37,679
to open up the discussion around

114
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,039
decriminalization which is a you know

115
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,040
very positive move but

116
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:42,560
um boris johnson the next day squashed

117
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:44,878
it very quickly

118
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,000
saying that cannabis is a harmful

119
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:47,359
substance so

120
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,039
this is the level of ignorance that

121
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,680
you're you're dealing with um

122
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:52,400
and it shows how far we have to go um

123
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,000
and then you know

124
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,000
the tory government have never been

125
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,959
evidence driven when it comes to

126
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,680
um drug reform so i'm not hopeful

127
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,959
personally

128
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,519
but on the flip side they boris is

129
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,400
not averse to you turning at any moment

130
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,039
if it suits him

131
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,680
so if someone waves a bit of cash at him

132
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:11,759
who knows

133
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,519
he might just do that so you just don't

134
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:16,798
really know what i would say on the

135
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,239
eu side is i i think you know

136
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,560
there's a lot of positive moves on on

137
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,159
the eu side you know they're moving

138
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,399
they're allowing hemp varieties up to

139
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,000
point three percent thc which is sort of

140
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:28,000
bringing in line with the states

141
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,160
which i think is very positive and then

142
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,519
there's lots of the the individual

143
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,320
countries are doing lots of stuff so

144
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:35,359
france's new medical pro pilot program

145
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:37,439
got lots of stuff going on in the

146
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,360
netherlands german domestic production

147
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:41,040
switzerland raising its limit on thc to

148
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,360
1 so

149
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,040
i would argue that the eu is probably

150
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,560
being a bit more progressive

151
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,759
okay excellent because it's one of the

152
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,280
things you see a lot of financial

153
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,639
information coming out of london

154
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,799
and i don't know whether that's smoke

155
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,120
and mirrors and maybe convincing me that

156
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,960
it looks like it's moving quickly in the

157
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,360
uk compared to the european union

158
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,959
because

159
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,720
over in ireland here we've still got the

160
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:02,159
police force not enacting the european

161
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,280
council law that was brought

162
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:09,039
in december we've got a lady called

163
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:11,439
um veratumi has to pay 10 000

164
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:13,199
euros every two three months for a

165
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:14,560
bedrock and for her child which is

166
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,639
pretty much cbd

167
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,240
it's not as if it's some magic uh

168
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,519
formula they're getting so

169
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,439
it's good to hear that you think that

170
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,359
the eu are moving forward quickly i'm

171
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:24,079
going to move on to the next topic which

172
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,280
i swear

173
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:27,038
i should just say that i don't think

174
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:28,559
anyone's moving quick enough it's a

175
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:30,478
reality but yeah

176
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,478
yeah no i agree we were talking to petry

177
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:32,959
last week he's up in helsinki and cbd is

178
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:36,319
a

179
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:37,359
pharmaceutical drug in finland so again

180
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:38,159
i think this needs to be a lot of

181
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,680
consolidation

182
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,720
in the european union and hopefully this

183
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,918
is one of the things we're going to try

184
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,440
and do with the show to

185
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:44,799
reach out to as many different countries

186
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:46,160
and many different ceos and businesses

187
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,038
and try and get everybody on the same

188
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,800
page because

189
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:50,478
let's be realistic the north american

190
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,759
companies want a piece of europe

191
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:53,599
it's not going to be the other way

192
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,560
around i see europe creating the kind of

193
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,720
high-end

194
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,560
products that uh like the brandies the

195
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,919
champagnes the guinness i think within

196
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,280
time will come from european

197
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:03,198
manufacturers so

198
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:05,198
let's hope that's the case speaking

199
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,600
about european manufacturers

200
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,720
i'm very positive in terms of as much as

201
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,120
we've got a terrible government over

202
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,639
here

203
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,240
at the moment excuse me for this that

204
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,439
ireland is going to be the base for

205
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,038
european cannabis

206
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,478
the north american companies are already

207
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:17,519
positioned here with the low tax rate

208
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:18,959
that we've got we've got an

209
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:20,639
english-speaking workforce highly

210
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:22,239
skilled young workforce

211
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,759
would you agree with that statement or

212
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,639
do you see somewhere else in europe like

213
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,080
malta maybe

214
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,918
piping us to the to the number one spot

215
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:31,359
yeah i mean look it's difficult to say i

216
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:32,399
certainly think brexit has been a boost

217
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,360
for ireland for

218
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,719
some of the reasons you mentioned the uh

219
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,120
being english speaking

220
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,160
does make it very attractive for um

221
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,639
north americans

222
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,400
um to base their plus you know the tax

223
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,800
incentives that you mentioned

224
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:48,079
i think maybe you know ireland is very

225
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,199
strong in pharma

226
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:53,359
pharmaceuticals so um i was surprised to

227
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,598
learn that over a third of eu net

228
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,280
exports come out of ireland and i think

229
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:59,360
all of the major

230
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,478
pharma companies have a base in ireland

231
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,960
um

232
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:04,560
as a consequence so uh and and you know

233
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:05,198
obviously highlighted by the fact that

234
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,199
jazz

235
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,639
um pharmaceuticals bought recently

236
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,598
bought um gw

237
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,160
pharma so um i think on the medical side

238
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,918
of things

239
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,240
uh there it will certainly be an

240
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:18,399
important hub whether it would be

241
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,000
the the main hq for european cannabis i

242
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:22,959
don't know just because of the size

243
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,800
of ireland maybe maybe not but i think

244
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:26,799
it could be a very important player

245
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,240
um the things that you mentioned we've

246
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,720
had vera on the show as well

247
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,240
as were to sort of uh tell us about

248
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,639
what's happening in ireland and

249
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,598
um i've had leah fletcher as well on the

250
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,720
show and

251
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:40,959
you know ireland similarly to the uk has

252
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,160
quite conservative core uh you know at

253
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:44,878
its heart so

254
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,840
that's quite hard to to change and

255
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,759
modify

256
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,038
particularly such a thorny issue as

257
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,280
cannabis so

258
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:52,478
um you know i think there's a lot of

259
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:54,000
challenges for ireland but they're

260
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:56,478
certainly well placed i think

261
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,918
and and will benefit from brexit i think

262
00:07:56,478 --> 00:07:59,359
yeah i think the one thing that's kind

263
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:01,038
of leaning ireland's way as much as

264
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,479
there's uh politicians in power at the

265
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:04,399
moment that mightn't

266
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:05,439
see it from what we've been told by

267
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:07,279
inside the government is that the

268
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:08,959
politicians have no problem legalizing

269
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:10,478
this it's senior civil servants that are

270
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,439
holding the whole thing up

271
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:15,120
so it's uh we've also got a history of a

272
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:16,800
country of having a loud voice and

273
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,399
i i feel sorry for the politicians at

274
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,038
the moment because if you go on to

275
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:20,878
twitter

276
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:22,318
they're getting hounded on the thousands

277
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,680
of tweets every day from all the

278
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,360
activists which is uh

279
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,439
exactly what needs to be done to help

280
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,598
educate and inform the guys to

281
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:30,879
bring this industry to the to the

282
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:31,680
standard that it should be there's no

283
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,959
reason why

284
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,120
the european country shouldn't be

285
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,079
creating our own brands and creating our

286
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,759
own versions

287
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,599
as opposed to just importing north

288
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:40,000
american products that let's face it

289
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,479
don't

290
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
uh are not as good a quality when it

291
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,080
comes to the european products on the

292
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,320
scale when you're manufacturing so

293
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,000
the next thing i wanted next thing i

294
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,480
wanted to talk to you about was

295
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,600
lots of things going on in in the uk at

296
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,240
the moment so

297
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,120
you've got the novel food and the lse

298
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,879
listings

299
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,639
that are happening do you think uk are

300
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,399
going to be the financial hub

301
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:05,199
for the european cannabis industry just

302
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,600
because the framework is already there

303
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,360
for

304
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,800
the investment and we've seen a lot of

305
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,800
the big investments in the llc's

306
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:13,199
listing so far uh it seemed to be a

307
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:16,639
positive move for london

308
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,480
um potentially i mean

309
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,759
again i think brexit is an issue for

310
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,680
this um

311
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,838
i mean already we're seeing on a general

312
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:26,079
level non-cannabis that um

313
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,600
you know london is is no longer the the

314
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,278
kind of financial hub

315
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,040
i think a lot of stuff is moving over to

316
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:33,360
amsterdam and frankfurt

317
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:34,159
um i think they're obviously being a bit

318
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,000
more progressive

319
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:38,000
by opening up to cannabis companies

320
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,120
listing um

321
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,958
but my concern would be around a

322
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,720
repetition of what happened in canada

323
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:48,079
and um you know a lot of these companies

324
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,399
who've

325
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,000
who floated in london they've got very

326
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,399
little meaningful revenues

327
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,519
and you know they're they're the market

328
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,679
caps are quite big

329
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,639
and they've they've ridden this hype

330
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:00,799
wave and

331
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,399
and maybe this is kind of public markets

332
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:04,078
i mean you're seeing it with crypto and

333
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,759
you're seeing it with

334
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:08,078
the kind of reddit uh type investors who

335
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,679
is

336
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:13,679
driving prices up because of kind of

337
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:15,039
putting together a groundswell of people

338
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,799
i don't think it's necessarily a good

339
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:18,000
thing and the retail investor often is

340
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:20,319
the one that kind of loses

341
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,600
out so i mean when you've got vast

342
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,278
valuations based on

343
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,639
very little revenues there's kind of

344
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:25,919
real detachment there and

345
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:28,000
you know it should really be about

346
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,519
building a business through your own

347
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,879
generating your own revenues and a bit

348
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,679
of private investments kind of get you a

349
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:33,519
bit bigger

350
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:34,719
and then once you're established then

351
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,399
you list but you know you've got

352
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,920
companies that are listing

353
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,440
before they're even doing it doing

354
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:41,120
anything and and that's very much what

355
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,959
happened in canada and then

356
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,839
in 2019 there was you know obviously a

357
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:47,759
bit of a crash there so

358
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,600
my my worry would be that some of things

359
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:51,439
happen in london and then what happens

360
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,360
is the regulators and

361
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,480
and the exchanges then sort of clamp

362
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,079
down and they don't

363
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,000
allow cannabis companies to list so i

364
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:00,639
think there's a risk there if it's not

365
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,240
handled well um i would like to see you

366
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:05,278
know genuine companies

367
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,159
that are listing um on the on the flip

368
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:08,799
side of that

369
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:09,600
i think it does it does get quite a lot

370
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:12,078
of headlines

371
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,360
and what that means is that a lot of

372
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:14,958
people it gets a lot of people's

373
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,759
attention so people start to see it as a

374
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:18,958
more

375
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:19,439
um grown-up industry that draws in more

376
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,199
talent

377
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,640
and hopefully some more institutional

378
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,278
money which

379
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:26,639
brings a bit of stability and so from

380
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:28,000
that perspective i think it could be a

381
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:29,039
good thing you've got other things going

382
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,600
on as well there's some m

383
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:32,480
a action as well so mc being bought by

384
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,639
true relief

385
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,800
which is a very big deal in terms of

386
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:39,039
numbers um

387
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:41,278
uh you know i think it's much more of a

388
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:43,919
signal to the market than anything else

389
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:45,120
and similarly we'll we'll create a bit

390
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:48,479
of a buzz around

391
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,839
um about the industry in general and i

392
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,440
think people will be like oh wow this is

393
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,800
actually something real here

394
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,279
um so i think it's good from that

395
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:56,879
perspective yeah well that's i think the

396
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:58,078
big numbers as much as some of them are

397
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:00,159
inflated and

398
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:01,919
not driven by real core value or

399
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:03,360
turnover anything like that is the thing

400
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,799
that a lot of the politicians and people

401
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,320
who have no clue are looking at

402
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:07,599
and they're just seeing how many jobs

403
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,720
can we make how much money are we going

404
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,639
to make and that seems to be the

405
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,320
deciding factor for a lot of them

406
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,879
tell me this your opinion on the next

407
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:18,240
two to three years europe versus the uk

408
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,240
who do you think comes out on top

409
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:25,120
um i don't really know i mean

410
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:27,439
it it's too difficult to tell when when

411
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,000
you're talking about

412
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,600
cannabis wider cannabis medical cannabis

413
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,360
i think uk is a bit behind

414
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,600
i think you know you've got germany's

415
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:39,440
well i mean fifty thousand

416
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,200
prescriptions maybe 5 000 patients um

417
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,160
and you've got certain other european

418
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,759
countries that are being more

419
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:45,439
progressive i think we're

420
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:47,120
we've got something here but it's just

421
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,480
it's quite hidden and i think we need

422
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,159
some proper reform

423
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,320
and i just don't think the government at

424
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:53,919
the moment is is minded to do that and

425
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,879
and for good reason i think kovit is

426
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:56,399
obviously

427
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:59,120
the massive priority for everyone and

428
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,958
then getting the economy back on board

429
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,200
from the latter part of that cannabis

430
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:06,078
could feature as a way to do that but

431
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,519
um it's by no means certain and you know

432
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:08,879
we've seen very successfully some

433
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,399
lobbying from the people

434
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:12,078
in this in relation to the european

435
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,600
super league in football

436
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:17,359
recently so i don't think that

437
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,440
unfortunately cannabis has the same kind

438
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,480
of galvanizing

439
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,040
across the the spectrum but um but you

440
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,039
could see

441
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:26,559
you know quite concerted effort to push

442
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:29,519
that thing um

443
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:31,679
i think yeah and we haven't talked about

444
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,440
novel foods but they're um

445
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:35,439
how that kind of pans out will be quite

446
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,200
interesting too um

447
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:41,199
can you tell me this is the novel food

448
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,199
in the uk applicable to europe

449
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,519
you're putting me on the spot here um

450
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,198
i've noticed i've been told it's not

451
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,560
you'd have to have a second license and

452
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:52,799
eu license now that brexit's gone true

453
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:53,919
i've been told that too but it's unclear

454
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:55,919
because i've heard

455
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:57,838
of conflicting statements on that and

456
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:59,919
it's not an area i specialize in around

457
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,360
licensing and regulatory so

458
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:02,799
i couldn't tell you that it's going to

459
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,320
be interesting you know there's a lot of

460
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:07,359
people that spent a lot of money on

461
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,040
getting that clearance and um but the

462
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,320
regulators just don't have the resources

463
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:13,120
to police it or

464
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,560
enforce it so we will see what happens i

465
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,879
think what will happen is it'll be

466
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:17,838
self-enforcing because if you've spent

467
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:20,320
100 grand on

468
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,120
on on all the testing you're not going

469
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,480
to want to see

470
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,399
someone down the road who hasn't done

471
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,240
any of that continue to sell so they'll

472
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,799
be dubbing each other in i think

473
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,000
a lot of that yeah now well i think one

474
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:31,359
of the positive things for europe that

475
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,720
we can look forward to because it's a

476
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,879
multi-state

477
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,720
uh that we're upping under germany is

478
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:38,799
kind of our test model at the moment

479
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,320
and germany have made massive the green

480
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:42,319
party have made massive gains over in

481
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,920
germany recently so

482
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,480
we could end up seeing germany with a

483
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:47,198
recreational market before a lot of the

484
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,720
other

485
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:50,799
countries come true and hopefully if

486
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,320
that's the case then the eu countries

487
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:53,439
will just replicate the model that

488
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,720
germany have

489
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,240
integrated in i think so and twins with

490
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,639
what's going on in the states i think

491
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,039
yes

492
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,799
i agree yeah yeah now it is it's it's an

493
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:04,480
exciting time for the industry

494
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:05,759
uh as i said we can try and keep it to a

495
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,039
short enough time for this i want to

496
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:07,360
thank you very much for coming on the

497
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,719
