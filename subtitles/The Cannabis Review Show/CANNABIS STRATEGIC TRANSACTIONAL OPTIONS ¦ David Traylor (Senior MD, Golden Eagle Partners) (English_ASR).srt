golden League apartments in your

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,500
position in the Cannabis industry uh

19
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:45,539
yeah sure on so my uh entree into

20
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,519
cannabis is not as interesting as most

21
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,920
people but as I was mentioned to you

22
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,359
just a few minutes ago on that I have a

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,359
biotech background operational

24
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:56,159
background then got into uh Investment

25
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:57,899
Banking in San Francisco and then moved

26
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,419
back to Colorado to do investment

27
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:03,420
banking doing biotech deals and

28
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,338
and we're here in Colorado in 2012 and

29
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,519
that's when Colorado and Washington

30
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:09,959
legalized adult use

31
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:12,599
and so started looking at the

32
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:14,699
opportunity and you know with my biotech

33
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:18,118
background I started looking at cannabis

34
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,400
and when we say cannabis Owen uh being a

35
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:23,000
biochemist by background cannabis to us

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,978
is the genus right so it means

37
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,540
Industrial Hemp molecular hemp marijuana

38
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:30,299
whatever you want to call it THC plus

39
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,740
it's THC minus what we call it but as

40
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,920
far as getting into cannabis in general

41
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:37,679
if you looked at it you know cannabis uh

42
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,420
is a highly regulated sector and you

43
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,320
also look at it's a biological supply

44
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,060
chain

45
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:43,798
and when you get down to it it's a drug

46
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,659
so all three of those I've found to be

47
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,880
very common to biotech

48
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:50,820
okay thank you very much I'm going to

49
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:53,359
jump straight into M A activity these

50
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:55,798
can be complex Endeavors how do you

51
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:57,719
highlight and isolate deals that are

52
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,579
going to be potentially good for a

53
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,438
golden eagle Partners or golden eagle

54
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:02,879
and the partners that you have at the

55
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:05,339
firm

56
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,959
good question Owen I think the one thing

57
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,000
that uh well there's a lot of things

58
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,560
that make golden eagle Partners unique I

59
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,139
mean the one thing that's pretty

60
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,900
exciting frankly for us is as I

61
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:18,119
mentioned before Oh and we've been

62
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,459
doing we're the first Investment Bank in

63
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,020
the US to do cannabis but we've also

64
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:23,580
been doing it internationally for over

65
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:27,659
seven years and frankly I don't think

66
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:30,060
anybody touches that so that's given us

67
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:31,560
a really broad-based background and then

68
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,939
also I did business development and

69
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,878
biotech companies for four and a half

70
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:38,159
years and did deals non-m a deals with

71
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:39,719
the likes of astrazanic advisor

72
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,479
so there's a couple of things

73
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:44,098
distinctions right there that make uh

74
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:45,299
Golden Eagle Partners different and so

75
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:47,280
when we're working with a company

76
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,800
looking at strategic transactions for

77
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,539
example a company recently came to us it

78
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,879
was an industrial hemp company asking

79
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:55,098
for you know looking for m a to help

80
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:58,679
them with M A

81
00:02:55,098 --> 00:03:00,780
and what we typically do is go out to

82
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,760
the market for a client like that if we

83
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,800
end up engaging with them and looking at

84
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:06,840
Broad a broad spectrum of strategic

85
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,519
options because the worst thing a

86
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,259
company can do Owen is if they're

87
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:12,840
looking for m a to go out to the market

88
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:14,459
and put a for sale sign out there

89
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,319
because then all of a sudden that gets

90
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,459
broad broadcast and they're not going to

91
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:19,859
get the best deal

92
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:21,719
the cool thing also that's about Golden

93
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,480
Eagle Partners is again getting back to

94
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:26,459
that business development experience

95
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:29,399
over 20 deals were co-development cross

96
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:31,920
licensing Etc so most investment bankers

97
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,420
don't have that type of background where

98
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:35,219
it's what we call an incremental

99
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:37,079
transaction non-m a

100
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:38,340
and so when we go to the market we're

101
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,319
looking at co-development we're looking

102
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,878
at a whole spectrum and the more options

103
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:45,298
we can provide our clients the better

104
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:48,000
now as far as the m a does go we did

105
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:49,739
actually uh close we're in Pro we we

106
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,939
close the transaction m a transaction

107
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:56,759
last December December finally closed uh

108
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:58,439
after regulatory approval uh the story

109
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:01,199
behind that is there's two former

110
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:03,120
clients of ours and we put them together

111
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,158
as a two companies here in Colorado

112
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,158
where I'm from where I'm based right now

113
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:11,878
and it turns out the I think it's worked

114
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:13,798
out well so far uh both companies like

115
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:15,719
them like each other

116
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,959
and the nice thing is both companies

117
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:21,358
still like us and so that's very unique

118
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,759
because most M A and frankly most M A

119
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:26,519
and deals done in cannabis in the US and

120
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,340
other places frankly uh Owen have not

121
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:30,599
worked out mainly because the people

122
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:32,519
that are putting these deals together

123
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,439
didn't look and say okay what's gonna

124
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:36,659
what's gonna go wrong what's gonna go

125
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:39,600
bad what's going to go belly up what's

126
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,800
going to be a problem with this deal and

127
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,320
that's what makes this different too

128
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,680
when I was doing business development 67

129
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:49,918
of our deals were successful monetarily

130
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,840
or scientifically or both because we

131
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:53,579
looked at what was going to go wrong so

132
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,519
uh that yeah that's just a long

133
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:57,539
explanation on on how we do M A and why

134
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:00,299
we're different

135
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:02,220
and of the m a deals that happened I've

136
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,100
recently sold a company myself how much

137
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,660
of a from one to 100 how much time has

138
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,639
wasted with people just kicking the

139
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,680
tires of a deal and coming and sniffing

140
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,120
around and is it is it always the small

141
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,379
percentage that actually end up

142
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,439
following through

143
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:18,899
uh that's uh that's a good good question

144
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:20,399
Owen and I think there's usually a

145
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:24,418
pretty high percentage but I think in

146
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:26,219
cannabis it's even higher uh mainly

147
00:05:24,418 --> 00:05:28,159
because I don't think a lot of people in

148
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:31,020
cannabis understand

149
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:34,320
uh you know the difference between uh

150
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:36,478
cross parties but even worse is you know

151
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:37,680
one of the things we always say on is

152
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:40,439
the fact that you hire an investment

153
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,780
banker advisor for two really reasons

154
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:45,060
relationships and expertise

155
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:47,099
and you know we I still draw on

156
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,259
information I learned back in the late

157
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,060
80s doing biotech and we've been doing

158
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:54,120
this as I mentioned seven plus years

159
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,680
we've had cannabis companies with

160
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,038
operations on six of the seven

161
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,079
continents on so when we're doing a deal

162
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:03,599
like that and and finding out we

163
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:05,639
understand and can kind of really you

164
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,340
know help our clients

165
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:10,319
really weed out the weed from the Chafe

166
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:12,599
so to speak and to cross a metaphor

167
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:15,779
right because there is a lot of crap in

168
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,340
cannabis to put it Frank and so that's

169
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:19,859
one of the things we do well too is to

170
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:22,198
try to certainly separate the the real

171
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,580
players from the non you know the

172
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:25,319
non-serious players because you know

173
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:27,180
that as you mentioned it can muddle a

174
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:28,740
transactional process

175
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,660
yeah and as you said especially in

176
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,579
cannabis the level of c-suite Executives

177
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,080
don't seem to be at the same caliber of

178
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:35,879
a number of Industries across the world

179
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:37,918
that it seems to be in the easier

180
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:39,719
barrier to entry to get into this

181
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:42,060
industry and we're kind of now trying to

182
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,280
sift through the the good from the bad

183
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:46,500
well you know but though exactly but you

184
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:49,379
know the one thing is I grew up in uh

185
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:52,379
you know going to college in the in the

186
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:55,019
80s and I invested in Genentech when I

187
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:57,180
was I think uh you know in 84 when I was

188
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:59,399
a sophomore in college

189
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:01,680
and you saw a lot of the same things

190
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:04,500
frankly in biotech in the 80s where you

191
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,900
had a lot of for example phds coming in

192
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,660
and running companies now a PhD anybody

193
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:12,000
knows PhD is not a good training for

194
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:14,880
being a CEO because the CEO you gotta

195
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,100
you have to build a team and a PhD and I

196
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:19,019
don't have a PhD but certainly phds are

197
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,460
not meant to be team players you have

198
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:22,439
your little Silo and that's what you

199
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:24,719
study on and we saw the same thing in

200
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:27,478
biotech right that you had people

201
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,800
jumping into a very new industry uh

202
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:31,139
thinking that things were going to be

203
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,840
easy that you know all these new you

204
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:36,300
know bulleted magical bullets like uh

205
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:39,119
monoclonal antibodies we're gonna all of

206
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,560
a sudden you know cure everything and

207
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,819
that certainly is not what happened and

208
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,199
that's kind of I think the same thing

209
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:45,180
you've seen in cannabis around the world

210
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,939
is people think oh it's going to solve a

211
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:50,519
lot of problems Etc and it may but it's

212
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:52,439
not going to happen overnight

213
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:54,598
moving on to licensing and

214
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:56,819
co-development agreements these can be

215
00:07:54,598 --> 00:07:58,860
valuable strategies for expanding a

216
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:00,780
reach and the capabilities of companies

217
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,699
what are the kind of key elements that

218
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:04,879
you see of being a good licensing

219
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:07,560
co-development agreement

220
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,300
well that's uh that's a good question

221
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,399
though and I think one of them is to

222
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,740
have a high degree of humility you know

223
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:16,439
don't assume that the the deal is always

224
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:18,598
going to work uh again I think that's

225
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:20,939
you know looking at what's going to go

226
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:22,740
south what's not gonna go south the

227
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:25,379
other thing is I think having a real

228
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,819
good goal on on what it's you know what

229
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:28,439
it's about you know if a company has a

230
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:31,500
really good technology a really good IP

231
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:33,778
and they need uh you know a really

232
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,700
well-known company or somebody who has

233
00:08:33,778 --> 00:08:39,360
different expertise than they do

234
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:41,039
uh you know that that can be uh very

235
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,099
helpful I mean the one thing too that

236
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:47,039
why more of an incremental approach like

237
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:49,620
that may be a good idea on is like for

238
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,480
example as you know if an m a deal is

239
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,459
done and it needs to unwind for some

240
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,220
reason it's much more painful than

241
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:58,559
unwinding like a co-development or a you

242
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,480
know a joint venture or even better yet

243
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,099
you know we believe we're the first

244
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,959
group which I'm pretty sure we were to

245
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:06,240
do an option based deal

246
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:07,559
in cannabis so I don't know if I

247
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,240
mentioned but I was Chief business

248
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:11,458
officer at Cerna which is one of the

249
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,259
first three public companies in cannabis

250
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:16,379
in the world they went public in March

251
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:19,319
2014 and I joined them in December

252
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:21,120
2014 and we did an option based deal a

253
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,180
few months later after that with an LED

254
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,339
company and then also we did a option

255
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:29,219
based deal with Panacea Life Sciences in

256
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:30,720
22nd century back in 2019 and

257
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,879
option-based structures are really

258
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,220
interesting because you can work

259
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:37,980
together in a company put a deal

260
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:39,899
together where there is some cross

261
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:43,259
fertilization if you will but if things

262
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:45,778
turn south or they uh things change like

263
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:48,299
they did with Panacea in 22nd century uh

264
00:09:45,778 --> 00:09:50,100
the CEO that promulgated the deal with

265
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:52,259
Panacea ended up leaving a couple months

266
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,940
later the new CEO that came in at 22nd

267
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:56,759
century didn't like the deal

268
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:59,360
so that deal is much easier to unwind

269
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:03,419
than if 22nd century would have bought

270
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:05,639
uh you know Panacea you know 51 or 100

271
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:08,639
percent of it right

272
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:10,019
very very true there's Tech advancements

273
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:11,699
and Market descriptions are pretty

274
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:14,039
common when it comes to the Cannabis

275
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:16,680
industry what are the strategies that

276
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:18,599
you employ to mitigate these and

277
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:20,399
maximize the value for clients that you

278
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,879
have

279
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,679
oh man that's a good question uh you

280
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:29,458
know I think the uh

281
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:30,419
the one thing that uh is good to

282
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:33,359
mitigate

283
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:36,000
technical risk and again I I hearken

284
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,159
back to uh my days and genomics of the

285
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,039
company I was at and they thought they

286
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:43,139
had the best technology

287
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:45,059
and uh you know it turns out they they

288
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:47,519
really didn't or or they could have

289
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:49,379
supplemented their technology with other

290
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,120
complementary Technologies so they would

291
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:52,919
have you know built a maybe a technical

292
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,839
picket fence because one thing about

293
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:56,338
everybody can agree on technology it's

294
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:58,980
hard to predict

295
00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:00,420
and so as a result what we found when

296
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,700
we're working with companies where we're

297
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:05,399
doing a deal in technology or or what

298
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:07,680
have you that's you know prone to

299
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:09,240
disruption like cannabis is prone to

300
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:11,879
disruption all the time too with you

301
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:14,399
know new geographies coming online you

302
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:17,700
have new regulations coming online with

303
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,620
the FDA et cetera uh and so I think one

304
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:22,079
of the main things that we again getting

305
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:25,078
back to this arrogance and humility

306
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:27,000
and and frankly uh only that's one of

307
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:29,159
the things that I mentioned in Bloomberg

308
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,139
in February 2020 right before the

309
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:33,059
pandemic shut things down one of the

310
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:35,039
biggest problems in cannabis has been

311
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:36,838
the fact that there's been too much

312
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,458
arrogance and too low as humility and

313
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:40,800
you can apply that to technology right

314
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:42,439
if you think you have the best

315
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:45,899
technology

316
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:47,940
uh you know ever there's a chance maybe

317
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:49,379
you do but if you don't then you know

318
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,060
what's your fallback position and

319
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:53,159
unfortunately a lot of times you know

320
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:54,719
for example drug delivery technology in

321
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:56,278
cannabis everybody says they have to

322
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,560
have the best drug delivery technology

323
00:11:56,278 --> 00:12:01,500
and it's not true right

324
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:03,419
so yeah you know it's tough It's a tough

325
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,639
thing to do and that's humility is I

326
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:06,479
think the best thing to to apply in that

327
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:07,919
sense

328
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,060
couldn't agree with you more you

329
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:11,099
mentioned you're a biotechnology

330
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:12,659
experience one of the interesting topics

331
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,159
over the last year or two that I've

332
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:16,139
started to notice is the ability to

333
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:18,120
biosynthesize molecules and rare

334
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:19,860
molecules and in turn become an

335
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,440
ingredient supplier or develop your own

336
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:24,060
apis do you think that's the future of

337
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,220
the ingredients side of the industry

338
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:28,259
surely because it's so replicable it's

339
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,820
so safe and it's it's it's more

340
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:32,338
palatable let's say for a European

341
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:34,079
politician to be able to swallow than an

342
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:37,079
extract the plant matter

343
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:38,639
uh great question Owen so we have I

344
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:40,500
think somewhat of a unique perspective

345
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,600
on this and part of it is the fact that

346
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:47,339
we essentially come from the biotech

347
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:49,800
side and so uh you know having will run

348
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:52,980
from the come from the bio processing

349
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:54,958
uh side and also one thing just to put

350
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:57,060
it out there we what we're trying to

351
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:59,699
what we could call this is alternative

352
00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:01,500
production methods so biosynthesis

353
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:04,440
sometimes is not always correct

354
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:06,419
synthesis uh it depends you know a lot

355
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,920
of this is chemical uh chemistry

356
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:11,240
alterations

357
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:14,458
but the one uh perspective we believe

358
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:17,339
is that in this through my experience in

359
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:19,199
bioprocessing that the method or methods

360
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:20,459
that were going to win out are the ones

361
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,160
that produce the highest quality

362
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:24,899
molecule or molecules at the lowest cost

363
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:27,179
and I think everybody would agree with

364
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:29,399
that so our thought is it's probably

365
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:31,439
going to be a combination of

366
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:33,419
of the two and a matter of fact we had a

367
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,040
panel at can Med which is one of the

368
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:37,019
leading science conferences in Florida a

369
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:40,980
few weeks back we had a panel like on

370
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:43,139
this exact topic on about you know is it

371
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,820
cultivation is it uh alternate

372
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:46,379
production methods or synthesis or

373
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,660
biosynthesis whatever you want to call

374
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:50,399
it and one of the things that came out

375
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:53,278
of it is really depends on the molecule

376
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,958
too right yeah and I suppose who could

377
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:56,220
deliver the highest Teeter amount there

378
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:59,219
are the ones that are going to have a

379
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:01,079
lower uh cost overall and over time be

380
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:03,000
able to deliver a pure product for a

381
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:04,319
lower cost than their competitors so it

382
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,600
really seems to be the Teeter amount

383
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,700
Whoever has got the six grams per liter

384
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,440
the seven grams per liter or above that

385
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,680
are going to be the long-term winners

386
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,720
well well and also though coming from

387
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:17,278
bioprocessing not only is it what we

388
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,339
call the title over here and the Teeter

389
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:21,419
there uh but you know the stepwise

390
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:23,160
synthesis

391
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:25,259
so I mean that's again one of the things

392
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:27,838
that makes us unique as an investment

393
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:29,578
banking group oh and is the fact that uh

394
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,320
the two patents that I got when I was

395
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:34,019
doing a common hemoglobin is I came up

396
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:36,959
with a an idea to use carbon monoxide in

397
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:39,120
the process train and by implementing

398
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:41,278
that it turned out that it improved the

399
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,399
overall yield of the whole process from

400
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:45,778
10 to 40 percent so we had a 400 percent

401
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,000
increase

402
00:14:45,778 --> 00:14:50,578
in the overall yield of the process the

403
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,799
amazing thing is using that methodology

404
00:14:50,578 --> 00:14:55,500
we also increased the quality of the

405
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:57,359
molecule the end molecule so you know

406
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,399
that almost never happens in

407
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,139
bioprocessing or anything in cannabis

408
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,820
where you know you're increasing the

409
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:04,980
quality and you're increasing the yield

410
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:07,440
it's always kind of you got to do one or

411
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:09,539
the other right so again that's a skill

412
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,300
set that I I learned a long time ago but

413
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:14,039
it's kind of it's it's already provided

414
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:15,719
a lot of benefits for us working in

415
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:17,698
cannabis globally

416
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,440
well we're up to our 15 minutes I don't

417
00:15:17,698 --> 00:15:21,240
know you're a very busy man so I'm going

418
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,459
to let you go for any companies in the

419
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,259
space if you haven't checked out Gold

420
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:26,819
Eagle Partners yet the website is below

421
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:28,259
I highly recommend checking them out and

422
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,000
touching base if you're ever interested

423
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:31,860
in m a activity or licensing

424
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,120
co-development agreements they seem to

425
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,159
be the leaders when it comes to North

426
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,539
America and David thank you very much

427
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:37,559
for your time today it's been very much

428
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:39,899
appreciated

429
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:42,379
thank you I want to appreciate it have a

430
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:45,860
great day until next until next episode
