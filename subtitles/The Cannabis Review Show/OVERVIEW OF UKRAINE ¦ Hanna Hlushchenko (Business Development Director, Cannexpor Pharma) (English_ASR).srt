00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:33,179
want to give everybody a little overview

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,000
of your position in the industry and

11
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:38,219
what connects Poor's objectives are

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,659
yeah sure sure so my name is Hannah I'm

13
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:41,460
in the medical cannabis industry for

14
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:43,558
five years already so basically five

15
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,359
years ago Ukrainian investor started the

16
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:47,820
company in Portugal with intention of

17
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:49,619
good weight in medical cannabis here and

18
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,619
basically I was the first person who

19
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:54,439
joined the team at first I was

20
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:56,820
responsible for planning of the project

21
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:58,799
and now I'm mainly focused on the

22
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,539
business development which includes

23
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,419
sales which include access to the new

24
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,799
markets existing one and all and also

25
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,019
the commercial activities of the company

26
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,460
yeah and can explore them basically we

27
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:10,560
are one of the license holder for

28
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:13,139
cannabis cultivation in Portugal there

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,760
20 companies I guess for that cultivates

30
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,978
medical cannabis and basically we are

31
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,500
one of those

32
00:01:16,978 --> 00:01:21,060
okay excellent I'm going to start off as

33
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,500
the first topic with cultivation of

34
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,780
Portugal because you guys have a

35
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,719
facility there can you explain to

36
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,460
everybody the informed

37
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:31,200
um certification that cultivation

38
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:33,478
companies need in Portugal and what's

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,219
the overarching parameters that

40
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:37,500
accompany that cultivate support people

41
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:40,920
that's going to need to have in place

42
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,659
yeah sure so basically we are in 2023

43
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,519
and Portugal really kind of is

44
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:45,719
considered to be one of the best one of

45
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:48,719
the best place to cultivate medical

46
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:50,219
cannabis in Europe because the policy is

47
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:52,500
very transferred the increment is very

48
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:54,719
familiar with the with the process so

49
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,000
it's quite easy not not easy but it's

50
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:59,158
very kind of logical how to get the

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,319
license here in Portugal and as I said

52
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:05,820
there are already 20 companies in place

53
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:08,159
new players are coming uh and yeah so

54
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:10,079
the the idea is that the first step is

55
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,539
to get the pre- license which is kind of

56
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,080
you submit the documents to get

57
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:15,900
um

58
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,520
to give informat idea basically what are

59
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,459
you doing what is the what is the plan

60
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,680
of yours and then you start building the

61
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:25,680
facility and once you do this you go

62
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,959
through the gcp and GMP process and if

63
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,040
you do this you can cultivate and you

64
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:33,719
can process the product within Portugal

65
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:35,759
and you guys are an indoor facility

66
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:38,759
against outdoor

67
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:40,500
yeah yeah so the logic of Portugal is

68
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:42,419
that since the climate is very good

69
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,340
there are a lot of companies on the

70
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:46,079
south that is cultivating basically in

71
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,780
the greenhouse we chose a bit different

72
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,700
strategies so we cultivate indoor uh

73
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,318
because we kind of value consistency of

74
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:54,238
the product we value purity of the

75
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:55,799
product our product do not need

76
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,480
radiation because of this we always

77
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,540
focus on kind of making sure that our

78
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:02,399
product is very high quality

79
00:02:59,539 --> 00:03:06,060
uh yeah that what makes us a bit

80
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,159
different from some other companies

81
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,080
and when it comes to the genetics and

82
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,959
picking the strain that you guys are

83
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,080
going to cultivate and grow D is your

84
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,759
head of cultivation uh expertise from

85
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,780
outside of Europe or from inside of

86
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:21,658
Europe

87
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:25,259
well we basically our

88
00:03:21,658 --> 00:03:27,598
main head grower is from uh he was

89
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:29,639
working previously in Colombia so

90
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:32,219
basically we hired him from from there

91
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:36,059
so he had experience outside of Europe

92
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:38,519
but also according to gcp standards

93
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,799
incredible so once the product is

94
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:42,539
cultivated in Portugal we put a lot of

95
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,280
new markets that are popping up in the

96
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:46,199
EU do you maybe want to give us an

97
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,539
overview of what are your top tier three

98
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:51,119
new markets that you see in the EU over

99
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:53,699
the coming years and uh what are some

100
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,200
places that may be going over the radar

101
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:57,719
currently

102
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,459
sure So currently we are selling the

103
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:02,039
product to Germany we have a partnership

104
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:04,439
with sanity group we really like each

105
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:07,019
other I guess uh we I think we found our

106
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:09,299
Synergy uh when it comes to the new

107
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:11,879
markets to be very honest UK's Hot Topic

108
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:13,680
obviously uh and I personally very much

109
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:15,840
believe in the Polish market to be for

110
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,298
me it seems that the Polish market did a

111
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,840
very good stage of development uh

112
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:25,198
basically from 2020 to 2020

113
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:27,299
that from 2021 to 2022 the markets

114
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,040
tripled uh people are already get used

115
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,360
to the fact that it's possible to get in

116
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,879
Pharmacy prescription for medical

117
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,460
cannabis and also Poland has very long

118
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:38,040
history with the CBD market so basically

119
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:40,198
the Poland was the Pioneer in this

120
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,580
industry and because of this people I

121
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:44,400
really kind of get used to the fact that

122
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:47,159
cannabis can be consumed and have a lot

123
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,418
of natural and positive effects on the

124
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,479
body

125
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:53,939
so yeah that's that's Polish is the for

126
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:56,039
me is one of the hottest uh subject

127
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:59,100
right now subjects right now

128
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:01,379
and obviously Poland and such a long

129
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,820
manufacturing history and what are the

130
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:05,879
parallel houses of Europe when it comes

131
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:08,819
to this do you see the manufacturing of

132
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:10,500
Edibles let's say or pre-rolls as Poland

133
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:12,540
being one of these territories when this

134
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,040
does become a viable uh product market

135
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,139
for consumers

136
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,699
foreign

137
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:21,000
well to be very honest I'm very

138
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:25,259
skeptical about the whole uh possibility

139
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,879
of Distributing of Distributing Edibles

140
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:28,020
in Europe because once again in Europe

141
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:30,418
cannabis it's considered to be

142
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:32,579
pharmaceutical industry what what makes

143
00:05:30,418 --> 00:05:34,139
Poland different is that for instance in

144
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:37,198
Poland there is possibility to sell

145
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:40,800
babes there are some pharmacies that

146
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,900
produce Vapes in in Poland and it's

147
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,759
actually quite a unique because I don't

148
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:47,038
see this possibility exist in Germany

149
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:48,840
for instance uh yeah but when it comes

150
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:51,839
to the recreational Market let's say

151
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:55,019
since no one no one none of the

152
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:56,638
countries is yet uh recreation in Europe

153
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:58,620
it's very difficult to predict what

154
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,439
would happen

155
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:04,139
do you see any country regulating

156
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:05,819
cannabis for abuse purposes within the

157
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:07,319
next three to five years or do you think

158
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:08,579
it's going to be a medically dominant

159
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:11,639
sector

160
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:14,939
well everybody had High Hopes when it

161
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,680
comes to Germany uh as we know it didn't

162
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:19,680
happen at least the way everybody

163
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,500
expected it to happen uh so we'll see

164
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,019
but in any way in any case Germany is

165
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:28,319
always a Pioneer in the industry in in

166
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:30,560
Europe so I think most likely the

167
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,759
Germany would be the first one

168
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,918
and what is the level of competition

169
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:36,840
Germany for supplying flour at the

170
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:37,978
moment is it pretty extensive or there

171
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:39,659
are a few companies that are well

172
00:06:37,978 --> 00:06:41,579
established obviously you guys have your

173
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,819
distribution agreement with the sanity

174
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:43,818
group

175
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:52,439
uh I won't lie it is competitive

176
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:53,939
but if you produce good product if you

177
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:57,620
know what you are doing if you

178
00:06:53,939 --> 00:07:01,100
understand the logic that

179
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:03,959
the buyers have when it comes to the

180
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:05,819
purchasing the product then you're good

181
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:07,620
I guess

182
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:09,600
when it comes to

183
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,459
if the cult of Life flower in Portugal

184
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,039
and it's been distributed into Germany

185
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:15,839
Are there specific fulfillment centers

186
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:18,180
that let's say the sanity group as your

187
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:19,918
partner would have where the product is

188
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,860
picked in there and it's stored before

189
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:25,560
distribution Nationwide and what are the

190
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:28,800
the levels of

191
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:32,220
um security and commands that are

192
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:35,060
required for these distribution centers

193
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:37,860
well there are

194
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:40,860
GMP partners because we for instance do

195
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:42,240
not have gmps so for us to sell the

196
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,919
product directly to Germany we need

197
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,800
first the product to be processed within

198
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:48,779
the GMP facility so this is one of the

199
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,699
partner of ours when it comes to the

200
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:52,559
distribution it depends on the what the

201
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:54,960
buyer have what the company in Germany

202
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,620
has so we also have our own distribution

203
00:07:54,959 --> 00:08:00,418
entity uh but basically being able to

204
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,340
import the product into Germany is not

205
00:08:00,418 --> 00:08:05,698
that difficult let's say there are

206
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:08,279
players who can help with that

207
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:10,199
I wanted to move on now to Ukraine's

208
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:12,119
Brooklyn Canada as the lady was born in

209
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:14,759
Ukraine and as a ukrainian-owned company

210
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,139
I've read a lot of headlines and seen a

211
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:18,598
lot of Articles over the last couple of

212
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:20,460
weeks where there was no real depth to

213
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:22,378
what we're talking about to maybe give

214
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:23,939
everybody an overview of what is

215
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:26,759
happening currently in Ukraine when it

216
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:28,319
comes to cannabis and how optimistic are

217
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:30,240
you that this is potentially going to be

218
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,158
a big New Market

219
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,599
I'm actually very optimistic to be very

220
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:36,658
one that's taken into account that I'm

221
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,820
Ukrainian I personally saw three waves

222
00:08:36,658 --> 00:08:41,218
of trying to legalize cannabis in

223
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,680
Ukraine so first one started even with

224
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:45,180
the previous government and there is a

225
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,979
specific group of people who are pushing

226
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:48,599
the law for four years already and I'm

227
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:52,879
really happy that we finally succeeded

228
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:55,139
doing this so the idea is the following

229
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:57,000
basically the country understand High

230
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:58,199
need in cannabis right now because we

231
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,200
have a lot of patients and we have

232
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:04,740
military who are in pain constantly and

233
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,480
cannabis is considered to be a best kind

234
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:09,139
of treatment for this right and because

235
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,519
of this the lensky announced that place

236
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:14,819
legalize medical academies because we

237
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:18,320
need it and the department did it so the

238
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:21,899
law was adopted in the first hearing uh

239
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:24,180
the Next Step would be second hearing

240
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:26,879
and basically it might be a case that

241
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:28,500
the law will change a lot so the idea is

242
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:30,539
that currently the law is not perfect

243
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,220
because it allows cultivation within

244
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:34,860
Ukraine so I anticipate there are a lot

245
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:37,440
of cultivation facility would appear in

246
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:39,899
the the ones the lawyer is adapted

247
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,300
however the law prohibits import of

248
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:44,940
medical cannabis in the form of API and

249
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:47,939
in the form of a herbal medicine drug as

250
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:50,040
it being sold in Europe so only import

251
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:52,980
of Finnish pharmaceutical product is

252
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:55,079
allowed which is a problem because of

253
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,379
this last week the whole week I spent in

254
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:00,240
Ukraine I was invited as an expert to

255
00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:02,879
explain how it works in Europe so my job

256
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,919
was to show example of Germany my I was

257
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:08,338
explaining how it works in Poland a

258
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:10,079
regulatory rise to allow actually input

259
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:12,180
of the product why it's important

260
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,060
because once again the whole idea of the

261
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:17,819
law is to allow cannabis consumption

262
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:21,958
we've seen Ukraine for those who are in

263
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:24,300
need and if we stick only to Ukrainian

264
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:28,559
products the product will appear on the

265
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:31,620
market only until like not until 2028

266
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:34,199
right because of this uh

267
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:38,759
my job was to explain how it works in

268
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:42,060
Europe how to how to draw a lot away it

269
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:43,319
allows quick access to medical cannabis

270
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:45,958
and to be very want to say have High

271
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,360
Hopes uh it's very early to say because

272
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:50,458
the second hearing of the law would

273
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,278
happen somewhere in September

274
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:54,539
before that there would be a lot of

275
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:57,120
discussion in the Parliamentary

276
00:10:54,539 --> 00:10:59,879
committee but to be very honest it seems

277
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,620
that the position was heard it seems

278
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:05,399
that there is an intention of actually

279
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:07,860
bringing cannabis into Ukraine

280
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:09,899
and so previously until date there was

281
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,639
no medical cannabis program in any way

282
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:14,820
shape or form in Ukraine

283
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:17,159
no no not at all Ukraine has one of the

284
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:19,680
strictest law when it comes to cannabis

285
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:21,899
So currently if you want to cultivate

286
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:26,219
him cultivate hemp you have an ability

287
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:28,740
of cultivating hemp only until 0.08 THC

288
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:31,379
in seats meaning that Ukraine even have

289
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:35,399
their own variety when it comes to seeds

290
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:36,720
for hemp or only because those seeds

291
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:39,419
that are allowed in Europe are not

292
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,240
allowed in Ukraine and to be very honest

293
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:44,759
when it comes to the Cannabis it's very

294
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:48,299
strict regulation and because of this

295
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:50,759
this law is a huge advancement really

296
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:53,039
huge advancement the people who was

297
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:55,078
working very hard on legalizing it for

298
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:57,719
four years did an amazing job really

299
00:11:55,078 --> 00:12:01,500
amazing job because they kind of uh

300
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:04,259
showed that it's possible we need to do

301
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:06,958
this once again because people patients

302
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:09,419
military needs it to give anyone else I

303
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:11,578
I personally since the war started I

304
00:12:09,419 --> 00:12:13,740
I've obtained quite a lot of inquiries

305
00:12:11,578 --> 00:12:17,219
from friends of mine who are in military

306
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:19,740
to somehow bring them cannabis uh

307
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:22,200
obviously it's illegal but then

308
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:24,480
there were requests mainly because

309
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,959
people understood that they need it by

310
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,959
themselves

311
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:32,578
and when it comes to German markets do

312
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,100
you see that being the key influencer on

313
00:12:32,578 --> 00:12:37,319
the European wide sector do you think

314
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:39,060
when the German Market is fully fledged

315
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,980
and we've got all this nation and maybe

316
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:43,619
within the next 12 to 18 months we see

317
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:45,060
some sort of Returns on the tax amount

318
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,740
that's been taken in by the government

319
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:50,359
do you think that's going to be a big

320
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,360
influence for the likes of Ukraine

321
00:12:51,778 --> 00:12:55,980
um it will have some impact but you need

322
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,959
to understand that for instance if you

323
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:01,259
compare Ukraine and Germany Ukraine is

324
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:03,958
like eight years behind right so uh

325
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:06,720
let's say I

326
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:08,699
working also towards the direction of

327
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,139
showing how it works in Germany so we

328
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,820
are kind of couple steps ahead so

329
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:13,919
basically we use already practice that

330
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:16,019
exists in Europe and then we apply it in

331
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:18,059
Ukraine but we are still far right so

332
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:20,060
until the moment there would be actually

333
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:23,099
Market there's still a couple of years

334
00:13:20,059 --> 00:13:26,278
uh but yes obviously Germany is a

335
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,000
Pioneer in in medical cannabis in Europe

336
00:13:26,278 --> 00:13:30,179
um

337
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,919
basically the way Germany sings the rest

338
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:33,479
of the country follows like Czech

339
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:35,819
Republic like Poland so for instance

340
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,440
Poland also recognize the German

341
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:40,519
Pharmaceutical

342
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:43,800
so yeah I guess Germany makes

343
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:45,959
a lot of impact on on the European

344
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:48,299
cannabis landscape

345
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:50,219
it looks as if Europe is heading in a

346
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:52,679
direction where we've got a clearly

347
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,959
defined Medical Market and then the

348
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:56,759
actor recreational or adult use Market

349
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:59,219
is going to be under the Cannabis Social

350
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:00,720
Clubs not-for-profit model and it looks

351
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,399
like that could be implemented across

352
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,639
Europe do you see that happening

353
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,639
yourself

354
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:09,120
well yeah and the reason for that is the

355
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:12,179
following right so the big difference

356
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:16,320
with Europe and for instance yes is that

357
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:19,559
Europe chose to regulate cannabis as a

358
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,379
pharmaceutical industry and it makes a

359
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:23,699
huge difference so there is no kind of

360
00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:25,439
in-between process right so either it's

361
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,120
pharmaceutical or it's not right when

362
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,279
for instance in the years they kind of

363
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:33,240
chose the specific cannabis regulation

364
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:36,179
and because of this I guess uh Europe

365
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:38,820
moving with the past of Social Clubs

366
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:41,578
mainly because uh there are no other

367
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:43,440
paths possible because once again you

368
00:14:41,578 --> 00:14:45,659
cannot put recreational into the

369
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,040
pharmaceutical industry right so yeah I

370
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:48,778
guess that would be that that's

371
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,698
something that would happen in the

372
00:14:48,778 --> 00:14:52,860
future I believe that

373
00:14:50,698 --> 00:14:55,439
so we see the example of Malta we see

374
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:57,720
Spain we see Germany following the

375
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,300
similar path so yeah I guess it is a

376
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,459
pattern

377
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:03,899
and for now we're just hitting our time

378
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:05,698
limits for anybody wants more

379
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:07,198
information on Connex poor the website

380
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:09,000
is below it's going to be in all the

381
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,259
descriptions Hannah thank you very much

382
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,759
for taking your time to do this and

383
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:13,439
hopefully within the next 12 months we

384
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:16,198
can have another chat and get an update

385
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,959
on Ukraine's potential has become

386
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:22,319
yeah I really hope I would be kind of

387

of using my LinkedIn for this and yeah I

389
00:15:24,778 --> 00:15:28,500
mean like I really have high hopes and

390
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:31,139
it seems to me that there is a high

391
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,879
chance that that actually happened

392
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:34,860
well we left our fingers crossed over

393
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:36,958
here in Ireland that Europe starts

394
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:39,000
progressing at a quicker Pace than we

395
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:41,338
will see progressed in the last year or

396
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,019
two but for now thank you very much for

397
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:46,139
