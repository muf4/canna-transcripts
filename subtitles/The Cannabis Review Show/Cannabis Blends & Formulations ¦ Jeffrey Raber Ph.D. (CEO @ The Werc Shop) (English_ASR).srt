2
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:12,320
welcome everybody to the next episode of

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,599
the cannabis review i'm delighted to be

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,240
joined on this episode by dr jeffrey c

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,800
raber who's the founder of the workshop

6
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:23,358
he found the workshop in 2010 with a

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,599
focus on botanical analysis new product

8
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,439
development and sustainability and he is

9
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,960
currently serves as the executive

10
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,679
director on the association of

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,039
commercial cannabis labs so jeffrey how

12
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:34,640
are you keeping today

13
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,558
i'm doing very well thanks aaron how are

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,759
you how are you doing very well thank

15
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:39,280
you very much matt i've been looking

16
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,839
forward to talking to you for some time

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,679
now the more i've researched it the more

18
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,840
the bigger the intro was getting the

19
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,600
more there was to learn so i'm kind of

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,360
basically going to jump into the first

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,198
topic as opposed to doing a big intro of

22
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:53,679
how you got into this industry

23
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:55,679
far preferred for me yeah we can just

24
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,679
start at the first topic so how to test

25
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,840
cannabis so for those who don't know

26
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:01,759
jeffrey set up his company in 2010 with

27
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,680
the aim of being a cannabis testing

28
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:05,840
facility in california is that correct

29
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:07,599
here jeffrey yep yeah we were right in

30
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,359
los angeles and and at that time

31
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:11,919
everybody's like wait you can test

32
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:14,478
cannabis um but the first question we

33
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,359
got uh an answer is yes yeah you can

34
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:19,118
test just like every other plant really

35
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:21,280
and so you were kind of one of the first

36
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:23,519
people with a phd in organic chemistry

37
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,320
getting into cannabis in

38
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,959
at that time in terms of the capital for

39
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,639
setting up the lab was it an expensive

40
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:31,919
overlay and was it something that took a

41
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,599
lot of time

42
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,960
with your experience were you easily

43
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,118
able to put together the kind of

44
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:38,959
equipment and the personnel required to

45
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:40,640
do such a thing because i could imagine

46
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:42,239
it runs into seven figures if you're to

47
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,399
do it nowadays

48
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:47,519
yeah it was very interesting timing

49
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,759
right when we did it we raised 150 000

50
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:52,239
in capital half of it went to the down

51
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:55,118
payment of the hplc the first big

52
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:56,959
decision we had to make was what what

53
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:58,718
analytical equipment and tool do you use

54
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,718
do you use a gas chromatograph or a

55
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:02,879
liquid chromatograph to go analyzing

56
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,718
cannabinoids the liquid chromatograph's

57
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,319
a little bit more expensive

58
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:07,919
but it gives you the cannabinoid acids

59
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:09,840
and the neutral cannabinoids so you get

60
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,840
a better picture a more full picture of

61
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,598
exactly what you're holding in your hand

62
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,520
and while it was more expensive than the

63
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:17,919
gas chromatograph more expensive to buy

64
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,280
and run and maintain we chose that one

65
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:22,399
and that took you know most of the

66
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,400
capital but to get started then it was

67
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,480
you know a little over six figures today

68
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,920
it easily approaches seven figures you

69
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,318
know you'll need about one and a half to

70
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:32,559
two million dollars to start a lab today

71
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:34,159
pesticide testing alone that equipment's

72
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,680
about seven hundred and fifty thousand

73
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:37,359
dollars and that's just the equipment

74
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,040
not the people or everything else around

75
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,400
it to run it

76
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:42,799
yeah and that's it the more i got into

77
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,480
the research the you kind of you

78
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,239
sometimes take for granted the ability

79
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:47,679
to be able to let's say test cannabis

80
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,920
but then you start to get into the kind

81
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,319
of molecular science part of it and the

82
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:54,238
different chromatography

83
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:55,439
type types that you'd have and whether

84
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,599
you're analyzing terpenes or

85
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,400
cannabinoids so it does become a very

86
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:01,839
complex issue and we'll move kind of on

87
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,439
to the next topic because that's kind of

88
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,200
where you started the next thing i

89
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:09,199
wanted to talk about was the chemical

90
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:10,799
fingerprints of cannabis so um you guys

91
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:12,878
were the first kind of analyzed the

92
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,719
first few hundred or few thousand

93
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:16,479
strains in california how did that

94
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:18,000
process start for you guys it was

95
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:19,039
natural progression and evolution of the

96
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,840
company

97
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:24,400
yeah it was uh we started in 2010 right

98
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,400
we're testing cannabinoids and you just

99
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,560
start to see all these cannabinoid

100
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,080
chromatograms look very very similar you

101
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,479
can almost stack them all on top of each

102
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,000
other and say they're identical and you

103
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,598
know while you're not seeing possibly

104
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,519
everything there they're very very

105
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:39,518
similar yet you're hearing very

106
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,959
different effects you smell that the

107
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,879
products are different they taste

108
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,719
different and you start to say there's

109
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:46,798
something else here that's driving their

110
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:50,158
differentiations it's not you know if i

111
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,599
see 10 products and they all have 22 thc

112
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:53,199
there's something else that's driving

113
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:54,959
them being different so we literally

114
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:57,679
followed our nose and our chemical nodes

115
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,000
and started testing for terpenes um and

116
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,680
we did so in 2011 we were the first

117
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,878
commercial effort to go ahead and say

118
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,120
you need to test for these other

119
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:06,560
molecules that we'll call terpenes

120
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,080
um and everyone thought we were just

121
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,400
trying to charge more for testing so

122
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,120
there was next to no importance for it

123
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,680
but lo and behold after six months of

124
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,840
giving it away and putting those values

125
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,280
on labels and product labels we heard

126
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,959
dispensaries saying hey there's really

127
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,799
something here too many patients are

128
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,879
coming back to us and saying

129
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,720
i don't like the highest thc value i

130
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:29,120
like the one that has you know beta

131
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,720
carotene or limonene at the top there's

132
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,160
really something going on with these

133
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,080
terpenes

134
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,759
fast forward to today i think more folks

135
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:37,439
are finally embracing the idea that

136
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,680
terpenes are a major driver to the

137
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:41,600
entourage or ensemble effect and are

138
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,040
really important in what types of

139
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,439
overall effects you're getting from the

140
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,040
cannabis you're consuming

141
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,478
okay and that kind of leads me perfectly

142
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,000
on to the topic that i'm going to spend

143
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:52,000
the most time talking about in this

144
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,240
episode which is the blends and the

145
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,079
formulations the more i've started to

146
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,240
research this industry you kind of start

147
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:00,560
to realize the winning time the isolates

148
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,680
and the individual cannabinoids are

149
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,360
going to be

150
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,879
with education and marketing and

151
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,879
advertisers are going to be blown out of

152
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:09,279
the water by the blends and the

153
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:11,519
formulations and it's something to use

154
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:12,319
in very ahead of the curve on the number

155
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,719
of

156
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,959
uh intellectual property how you came

157
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,440
across metered dosing and cannabinoids

158
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:21,359
cannabis processing terpene composition

159
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:23,360
so this is something you see being a

160
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,800
major part of the industry over the next

161
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,960
decade say

162
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,400
oh absolutely yeah and i do think we're

163
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:30,159
kind of on the cusp of really starting

164
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:31,839
to understand it i think you know

165
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,840
unfortunately we've always named the

166
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:36,879
products the same from the cultivar

167
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:38,478
right so if i have um you know

168
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,240
let's say blue dream right i have the

169
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:42,000
blue dream flower well someone says

170
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,840
here's a blue dream live resin here's a

171
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,319
blue dream vape card here's a blue dream

172
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:48,159
topical but all of those compositions

173
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:50,240
are wildly different they may have you

174
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,680
know started from a plant that somebody

175
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,360
called blue dream we're not even sure we

176
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,079
all know what the exact same blue dream

177
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,800
is

178
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:58,639
um it and it became very very clear to

179
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,400
us that there is a lot of chemical

180
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,000
changes and chemical transformations

181
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:04,478
that happen when you extract the

182
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,879
compounds so i might start with the

183
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:08,478
exact same plant but what do i get when

184
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:11,199
i'm holding an extract of that and it

185
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:13,839
can be wildly different if i have a co2

186
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,478
extract ethanol extract get it down to a

187
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:18,638
distillate a live resin extract even a

188
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:20,639
rosin pressed extract all of those

189
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,639
things end up with a very different

190
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,759
chemical composition than what the plant

191
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,600
produced

192
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,800
so i think we've all started to kind of

193
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,120
understand and there's been some

194
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,199
excellent work by ruth galileo in israel

195
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,439
and some others that are starting to say

196
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,360
hey these things called terpenes and

197
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:38,000
other minor cannabinoids are important

198
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,759
in our cannabis compositions and you can

199
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,959
look to something like marinol or even

200
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,639
single isolate cbd like epidialex and

201
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:46,959
folks are saying this is not as

202
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,720
therapeutically useful as when i have a

203
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:50,799
whole plant composition or something

204
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,039
that has more of the plants components

205
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,199
so isolate molecules and high purity

206
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:57,759
molecules are super helpful tools and

207
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,720
very valuable in building composition

208
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,038
but

209
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,599
to be how do i make these compositions

210
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:05,598
more like what the plant presented more

211
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:06,879
of what i was offered to begin with you

212
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:08,879
know most of the

213
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:10,560
experiential effects that we're told

214
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,478
about are through those that are

215
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,918
consuming either vaping or combustion of

216
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:16,399
the plant material

217
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:18,240
or even directly eating it but those are

218
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:19,918
the molecules offered from the plant

219
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,000
right the plant grew those it expressed

220
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:24,079
those and said here they all are when i

221
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,918
extract it i've lost them i've changed

222
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:27,359
some right those cannabis derived

223
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:29,439
terpene sweets

224
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,360
maybe forty to fifty percent of what

225
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:32,800
remains is what was actually originally

226
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,439
there in the plant but you've turned a

227
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,520
lot of other things into different stuff

228
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:40,560
how do you go from here's what the plant

229
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:42,719
provides into a vape cart or some sort

230
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,240
of extract product that says this is

231
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,400
what it would look like if i just

232
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,759
magically was able to just convert thca

233
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:51,598
to thc or cbda to cbd and everything

234
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,439
else is the same minus you know

235
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:55,839
cellulose and amino acids and some other

236
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:57,598
stuff that i may not want uh and i think

237
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:59,519
that's you know what our approach has

238
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:02,478
been how do i take as many individual

239
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:05,038
components and build up a sophisticated

240
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:07,279
and consistent uh able to be

241
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:09,439
consistently produced composition so

242
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:11,598
that any time i'm getting the same

243
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:14,000
product to market and i can infinitely

244
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:15,519
scale it so i think it's really

245
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,199
it's really unfortunate to folks that

246
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:18,799
have medical needs and you say here's

247
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,800
this product today and we'll call it

248
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,079
blue dream and then a month later they

249
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,840
come back and i said that stuff really

250
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:25,519
helped me and i got you know can i get

251
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:27,598
the next blue dream but it's chemical

252
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:29,598
compositions wildly different and it

253
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:30,800
doesn't help them the same i think

254
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:32,080
that's you know there's almost nothing

255
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,360
more cruel than here's some medicine

256
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,080
that works and then i can't give it to

257
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,759
you again so it's really how do i go and

258
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,080
approach making these compositions

259
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:42,799
exactly the same every single time at

260
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,560
any batch in any scale so that once they

261
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,958
are successful in the marketplace

262
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:49,199
whether it is medical or adult use

263
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:51,039
that will be able to be reproduced and

264
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,879
able to be provided time and time again

265
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:54,639
so that the same people can use it for

266
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:56,639
the same reasons

267
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:58,480
yeah i think the reason the epigenetics

268
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:00,159
and the single component

269
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,000
things as we know lawmakers aren't the

270
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,240
most uh intelligent when it comes to

271
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,440
making specific decisions so i think

272
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,080
that was the most

273
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,000
palatable option it ticked all the boxes

274
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,920
in terms of legislation but the

275
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,720
companies that follow behind and i can

276
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:16,559
see this almost like chef recipes to a

277
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,519
degree there's such a multitude of

278
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:21,518
combinations and so much r d that needs

279
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,360
to be done that there is so much space

280
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,759
to run for companies that enter into

281
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,759
this space with the rice personnel

282
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,679
definitely definitely i mean it's funny

283
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:31,519
i i talk to lawmakers you know they ask

284
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:33,519
for for help all the time or you see new

285
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,039
legislation about hemp or new analogs

286
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,799
and you say hey look there could be the

287
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:38,799
potential problems and the first thing

288
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:40,639
that the lawmakers or the legislative

289
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:42,319
staff and aides say is like look i did

290
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:44,080
poorly in chemistry i don't know any

291
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,640
math please don't you know make things

292
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,399
technically difficult for me so your

293
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:50,399
point of it was easy checking all these

294
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,839
boxes i think that's absolutely right

295
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,679
but unfortunate because you're going to

296
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,160
throw away a lot of the good value that

297
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:58,079
cannabis has to offer the beautiful part

298
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:00,079
of its complexity is that it can help so

299
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,519
many folks but the challenging part of

300
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,519
the complexity is how do i find the

301
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,519
right things for the right folks and how

302
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,000
do i consistently produce something that

303
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,480
is highly complex time and time again

304
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,480
and i like your analogy with the chefs

305
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,159
because i think that's right we all have

306
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,759
a palette now that we can start to play

307
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:17,679
with and start to put these compositions

308
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:20,480
together you can even layer on top of it

309
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:23,039
for other flavorings or other types of

310
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,560
product experiences but you really want

311
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:28,639
to do that the same every single time so

312
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,078
how do we do that in a scalable fashion

313
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:32,159
i think folks are still trying to figure

314
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:33,838
that out but that really is going to be

315
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:35,759
how do we introduce cannabis in

316
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,360
consistent manners to the broadest

317
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:40,078
amount of people so they can get their

318
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,600
benefit time and time again and i do

319
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:43,439
feel like we're really on the cusp of

320
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,120
starting to see more folks begin to do

321
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,360
that and that we have technologies and

322
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,519
tools that enable us to do so

323
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,519
yeah i'm sure you're aware that over in

324
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,560
europe here it's going to be

325
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:54,078
pharmaceutical-led for the first initial

326
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:56,479
few years it's a lot different over the

327
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:58,000
north america so do you see a scenario

328
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,839
where companies over here are able to

329
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,519
create individual

330
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,600
synthetic cannabinoids and blend them

331
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,560
together with terpenes we've already

332
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,720
talked to

333
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:09,599
ellen sobel in israel who have already

334
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,079
made full glandular trichomes in a

335
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,480
bioreactor and have made mass scale of

336
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:16,719
it so do you see that as an ability to

337
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,399
happen or do you think it has to happen

338
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,600
with the flower is the original

339
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,120
ingredient

340
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,720
no i think you'll see all of it you'll

341
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,278
definitely see those biotechnology

342
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,800
approaches there are um some interesting

343
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:28,480
avenues of that that can be very

344
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:30,879
scalable right it's not going to freak

345
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,560
out the authorities or the the lawmakers

346
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:34,958
if you're doing it in a bioreactor as

347
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:36,639
opposed to acres and acres upon

348
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:38,239
area that someone might want to you know

349
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,799
come and grab your plants at the wrong

350
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,879
time um whether that is more

351
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:45,039
economically efficient at those scales

352
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:46,399
or not is an interesting question

353
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:48,719
i think that still remains to be seen

354
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,958
until we can ultimately scale it fully

355
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,800
but just like the food and fragrance

356
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:54,719
industry you see all of those tools and

357
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:56,479
technologies apply there are some that

358
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,639
are great for pharmaceutical use there's

359
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,159
some that's good for food use and and

360
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,000
kind of the in-between dietary

361
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:03,278
supplement i think you can see cannabis

362
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,958
across all of it

363
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:06,879
so you can certainly start in the

364
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:09,439
medical side and go down the hardcore

365
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:11,919
pharmaceutical path that may be more

366
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,680
expensive more um cumbersome and

367
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:15,838
restrictive on some compositions and

368
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:17,599
that might not help as many folks but if

369
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,200
that's kind of what gets the door open

370
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,600
and allows people to feel more

371
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,680
comfortable with this type of tool to

372
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,759
the physiological systems then then so

373
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,439
be it we'll have to take that path

374
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:29,278
um but i do see all of those

375
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,920
technologies probably having some sort

376
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:34,480
of role in in some place which ones will

377
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:36,719
ultimately win out um i think there's

378
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,159
consumers for all of them right we have

379
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,959
some of these folks with their their

380
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:43,439
high purity bio isolate biosynthetic

381
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:45,359
isolates um and they're great tools like

382
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,040
they can be useful but some of our state

383
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,839
systems are not really amenable to

384
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:51,519
allowing them in the dispensary path um

385
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,760
there's legislation and regulation that

386
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,440
make those difficult so they're they're

387
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:56,480
playing in some states but not yet in

388
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,160
others but they might play in the

389
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,600
federal system because that one's pretty

390
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:02,240
wide open here and doesn't have all the

391
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,920
rules fully fledged out for it but i i

392
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,839
mean you see it in food and i think

393
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:07,759
that's probably a common place to say

394
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,360
what might cannabis look like it's going

395
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:11,200
to look like food plus dietary

396
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,720
supplement plus pharmaceutical kind of

397
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,240
all mashed together or some sort of

398
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,320
version of those

399
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,919
all along their own individual past

400
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,519
because you you can get them through

401
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:21,919
each one of those

402
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,360
yeah amazing it's been a hugely

403
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:25,120
informative the last thing i wanted to

404
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,560
touch off i was recently reading there

405
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,320
that california revamped their the laws

406
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:32,638
surrounding the cannabis industry am i

407
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,079
correct in reading that was there a holy

408
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,240
there was a little bit of new hemp

409
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:38,879
legislation there has been some new laws

410
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,198
relating to testing inside the licensed

411
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:43,120
dispensary system as well so and there's

412
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:45,599
gonna be continued evolution there's a

413
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,519
lot of complaints about taxes um there's

414
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,639
not enough access via dispensaries in

415
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,480
california

416
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,039
it is a very difficult challenge for

417
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,720
licensed operators to combat the illicit

418
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:57,198
market out here

419
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,839
it's almost a five to one

420
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:03,039
ratio of illegal operators to licensed

421
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:05,120
operators and the you know licensed ones

422
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:06,639
pay tax they have higher operating costs

423
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,039
because of regulatory compliance and

424
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:11,039
testing pieces and while that product is

425
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:13,198
clean and assured at the shelf it's

426
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:15,198
definitely not you know able to compete

427
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:17,759
in a price sense with all the illicit

428
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:19,359
market um and i think it's going to be a

429
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:21,360
while so we can straighten that problem

430
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,839
out unfortunately but it really needs to

431
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,079
come through proliferating access more

432
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,600
access points and lowering the cost via

433
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:30,239
lowering the taxes or giving some sort

434
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,680
of tax reprieve for a short run so that

435
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,519
you can kind of say all of it now

436
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,879
operates inside the licensed legal

437
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,480
entities

438
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:38,958
yeah we'll even over in dublin ireland

439
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,480
we realize and i've heard numerous

440
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:43,039
stories about the taxation in the

441
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,120
california industry so hopefully that

442
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:47,278
gets to change for you guys in the next

443
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,039
year it's pretty rough to see the

444
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:50,639
receipts coming out of the dispensaries

445
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:53,838
you're like wow all of this and that was

446
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:55,198
the tax you're like wow um it's yeah

447
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,880
it's a challenge

448
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:58,319
well we've reached the time limit i can

449
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:59,600
actually talk to you all day jeffrey

doing some more research and checking

456
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,839
all out jeffrey's other work and

457
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,600
hopefully we get to chat again in maybe

458
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,839
a year and see how things are all going

459
