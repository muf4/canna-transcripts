1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,839
foreign

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,880
to the next episode of the Cannabis view

3
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:15,058
I'm delighted to be joined with this

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,580
episode by Gianni Del Rosario macridges

5
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:20,160
how are you keeping today Gianni very

6
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:21,479
good Owen how are you fantastic me thank

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,800
you very much for taking your time to do

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,000
this I know it's late in the evening and

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,380
over there and you've got a lot of

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,480
studying ahead of you

11
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:29,339
yeah that's all right uh it's a

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,140
privilege to to be here so thanks for

13
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:32,759
having me on thank you very much for

14
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,200
coming on do you remember we want to

15
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,719
give everybody an overview in a minute

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,160
or two of what you your area of

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,840
expertise is and how you find yourself

18
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:42,898
in the Cannabis industry

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,140
yeah sure so uh I was actually quite

20
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:48,960
lucky I changed career when I was in my

21
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,878
late 20s so I was used to work in an

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,700
office for a freight and logistics

23
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:57,299
company and I realized that that wasn't

24
00:00:53,700 --> 00:01:00,899
really what I was passionate about so I

25
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:03,299
made a big decision to just move out of

26
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:06,478
that career and I went to South America

27
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:08,039
where I lived with local people uh all

28
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:11,640
across the continent

29
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:14,640
um and uh from there I I volunteered on

30
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,379
farms and I did a lot of couch surfing

31
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,500
so it was pretty rough

32
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:22,199
but during that year I learned how they

33
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,420
use plant medicines over there and I

34
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,978
really saw the benefit and it really

35
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,680
intrigued me so when I came back to

36
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:32,039
Australia I decided to start studying uh

37
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:35,220
botany at Latrobe University and then

38
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,960
from there I got into an honors project

39
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:39,539
which is

40
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:42,118
um sort of in between an undergraduate

41
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:45,540
and a postgraduate and that was based on

42
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:49,140
plant biotechnology and I started to

43
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:52,860
realize the potential of the genetic

44
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:54,899
engineering implants and the problems

45
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:58,078
that it can solve for the world after

46
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:00,960
that I got a job with a cannabis

47
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:01,919
cultivation company here in Melbourne

48
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,739
Australia

49
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,200
and then I met some professors from

50
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:10,799
another University who said that they

51
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,979
had a project for me in a PhD on

52
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,680
medicinal cannabis and so all the stars

53
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:19,139
aligned and that's how I got into uh

54
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,620
studying and researching cannabis

55
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:27,359
genetics at Latrobe University

56
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:30,120
um and I focus on trichome genetics

57
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,099
okay incredible first topic I'm going to

58
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,560
start off with is cultivation in

59
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:37,019
Australia can you maybe give us who who

60
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,819
are the best cultivators in Australia

61
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,840
and who has the best genetics in

62
00:02:38,818 --> 00:02:42,598
Australia

63
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,340
uh yeah that's kind of a dicey Topic at

64
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:48,179
the moment there's a lot of competition

65
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:51,479
and it's very secretive because of the

66
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:53,879
high competition between companies so I

67
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:55,079
no longer work in directly in the

68
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:57,120
industry

69
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,120
um but I do have uh four years

70
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,420
experience working for one of the main

71
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:06,239
major cultivators in Australia

72
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:08,639
um and uh who who are called can group

73
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:12,599
they were the first company in Australia

74
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:14,939
to get a license to manufacture cannabis

75
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:18,479
um but uh there is another company

76
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:21,000
called ACS botanics who are doing really

77
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:23,340
well in Australia right now they are

78
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,500
taking out all the awards

79
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:29,219
um and the main difference between

80
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:31,680
someone like can group and ECS is that

81
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:35,818
can group specialize more in indoor

82
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:40,080
cultivation and ECS uh are all about

83
00:03:35,818 --> 00:03:43,259
outdoor cultivation so the outdoor

84
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,019
cultivation model seems to be prevailing

85
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:48,479
at the moment and

86
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:50,400
um I'm not sure if that's exactly got to

87
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:52,318
do with their genetics there's a lot of

88
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,000
research and development that companies

89
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:56,699
have done to get the best genetics

90
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,979
including importing them from overseas

91
00:03:56,699 --> 00:04:02,399
like Canada

92
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:05,219
um but I think it's it's got a lot to do

93
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:09,480
more around the production it's very

94
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:12,419
expensive to run a indoor facility and

95
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:15,238
the outdoor model has been able I guess

96
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:17,699
to keep costs low

97
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,620
okay you mentioned genetic engineering

98
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:21,959
then in your discussions I'm sure you've

99
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,478
heard of bioharvest Sciences in Israel

100
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,340
who are able to cultivate glandular

101
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:29,159
trichomes on a mass scale and

102
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:31,439
bioreactors do you see this is the kind

103
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,759
of future side of the ingredient side of

104
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:35,759
the industry where we're able to make

105
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:38,220
cannabinoids and molecules 100 pure and

106
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,259
replicate that over and over again or do

107
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,820
you see that uh plant matter is always

108
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:43,259
going to have a say in the ingredient

109
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:46,800
side of things

110
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:50,460
yeah so there are definitely two sides

111
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,400
to the argument but I I sit more on the

112
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:55,859
whole plant uh side of things and I

113
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:59,219
think that a lot of people in the

114
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:02,100
industry like uh Dr Ethan Russo uh

115
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:04,380
believe that the same kind of model

116
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:07,259
um that the plant does it better in fact

117
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:11,159
that was uh one of the the quotes from

118
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:12,900
uh his papers that the the plant

119
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,139
um you know the full spectrum of

120
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:18,599
molecules produced in the cannabis plant

121
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:20,939
seem to have this Entourage effect where

122
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,639
they can have

123
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:26,219
um more therapeutic benefits than single

124
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:28,019
molecule drugs that's not to say that

125
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:30,300
there isn't a purpose for single

126
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:34,439
molecule drugs

127
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:38,280
um but um in terms of cultivating and um

128
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:40,379
yielding these phytocannabinoids uh in

129
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:42,179
my opinion I think it's going to be more

130
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:43,680
effective to do that within the plant

131
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:47,220
rather than

132
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,620
um these lab Lab situations

133
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,360
so for example one of the biotech

134
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,579
companies if they ever been able to

135
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,560
isolate their own cannabinoids and then

136
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:57,599
get mixtures or Blends and formulations

137
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,699
of terpenes and create their own recipe

138
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,580
do you see that as being a more

139
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:04,038
advantageous route than extracting flat

140
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:07,019
matter because surely for the

141
00:06:04,038 --> 00:06:09,180
environmental the actual overall cost

142
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:10,560
and the production quantity that these

143
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,180
guys are going to be able to do that

144
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,860
there's going to have to be an

145
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,900
inflection point where

146
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,520
if the ingredient that people are buying

147
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:19,198
they don't really understand too much

148
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:20,879
about it then the Blends and formulation

149
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,060
seems to be

150
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:27,180
is what everybody's going after

151
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:29,579
yeah absolutely I I do think that the

152
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,978
Blends uh are a great

153
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:33,719
um uh Advantage

154
00:06:31,978 --> 00:06:36,360
um in terms of putting different

155
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,880
compounds together like the cannabinoids

156
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:41,819
and the terpenes and sort of um blending

157
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:44,759
them from different sources I think that

158
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:48,479
that's something that's going to be more

159
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:51,538
futuristic right now there's not enough

160
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:53,879
clinical information to understand what

161
00:06:51,538 --> 00:06:58,199
works best with what in terms of

162
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:59,699
specific illnesses so at how it stands

163
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,100
at the moment

164
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:02,660
um it might not be as

165
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,539
um

166
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:09,720
necessary right now but if you want to

167
00:07:06,538 --> 00:07:11,879
sort of look to where the the puck is

168
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:15,120
heading as they say in ice hockey then

169
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:17,579
uh potentially these new ways of putting

170
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,399
together specific formulations for

171
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:23,159
particular illnesses or

172
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:26,159
um for to generate particular benefits

173
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,319
that could be a really exciting area of

174
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,780
of Industry

175
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,160
yeah because it seems to be that if you

176
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:34,318
actually move just over to the medical

177
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,439
side of things that if we're going to

178
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,819
have a cardiovascular information or a

179
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:40,918
gastrointestinal information that these

180
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:42,598
specific cannabinoids are a key

181
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:44,519
ingredient and that there's no way a

182
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:46,560
cultivation facility is going to be able

183
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:48,959
to produce the quantities that let's say

184
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,280
a Pfizer is going to want if they get a

185
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:55,620
good recipe for a drug in that case

186
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:57,418
yeah absolutely but the the other thing

187
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:01,620
too is you have to think about the

188
00:07:57,418 --> 00:08:04,799
target market too and I don't think most

189
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:08,340
of the Cannabis Community are super

190
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,918
prepared to take on uh formulations like

191
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:12,719
that from Big pharmaceutical uh drug

192
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:15,240
companies

193
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,520
um but having said that we're talking

194
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:20,340
about patients that are not necessarily

195
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:23,818
within the Cannabis Community right the

196
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:26,459
the whole idea is we want to expand the

197
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:29,639
reach of cannabis medicine to all um

198
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:33,418
people regardless of what they do and do

199
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:36,120
not know about about cannabis so

200
00:08:33,418 --> 00:08:38,639
um there is potential there but I also

201
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,580
see a little bit of pushback from from

202
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:43,080
the real Die Hard

203
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:45,540
medicinal cannabis fans

204
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,980
um yeah who might not be willing to take

205
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:49,860
that on just yet

206
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:51,360
yeah it seems to be that these big

207
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,220
biotech companies and Pharma companies

208
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,560
can see that broadening the patient

209
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,120
range is what their aim is I think we're

210
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:58,139
always going to have the die hards who

211
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,879
couldn't really tell the difference

212
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:03,360
between an independence sativa anyway

213
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:04,919
but they just have their own hard stance

214
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,500
and that's the way they're feeling about

215
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:09,479
a specific topic but on a global scale

216
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,278
if you're able to reach another 30 40

217
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,379
percent of patients that had no interest

218
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:15,299
in cannabis whatsoever but are going to

219
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:17,879
be happy to take a pill or a capsule or

220
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:19,199
whatever a topical formulation I think

221
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:20,939
that's where the benefits of this

222
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,680
genetic engineering is going to be a

223
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:25,320
dividends

224
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:27,539
absolutely absolutely and I think that

225
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,760
that patient

226
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:31,199
um footprint is going to grow and we're

227
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:34,080
already starting to see it grow

228
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,240
especially here in Australia it's really

229
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,600
taking off

230
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:42,360
um and we have a lot of clinics and

231
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,620
dispensaries that are starting to pop up

232
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:48,778
all around the country in various States

233
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:52,019
and uh they have been inundated with

234
00:09:48,778 --> 00:09:54,059
calls from patients who uh who have

235
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:56,580
tried a lot of other things for their

236
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:59,039
illnesses and now they are looking into

237
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:03,180
medicinal cannabis

238
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:06,240
um at the same time you have this uh

239
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:09,719
need for homegrown cannabis being pushed

240
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:12,720
for by Advocates as well and also by

241
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:15,420
recently elected political parties here

242
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,839
who are introducing bills into the

243
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:21,479
parliament to allow the home growing of

244
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:25,500
of cannabis for people that don't want

245
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:27,899
to go through the clinical dispensaries

246
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:30,419
um and and prescribers

247
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:33,120
yeah you definitely start to see a split

248
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:34,860
in Europe where farm and boy attack are

249
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,419
going to be developing brand new novel

250
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,339
drugs and being able to take care of

251
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:41,458
let's say cosmetics and Beauty but then

252
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:43,380
you'll be able to placate the activists

253
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:45,719
and the the industry people who've been

254
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:47,399
around for decades with a homegirl rule

255
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,019
with you can have three or four plans

256
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:51,659
and this not-for-profit cannabis Social

257
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:54,000
Club model is going to pop up the next

258
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:56,100
question I wanted to ask you was how

259
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,958
would somebody improve their their home

260
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,519
growing are there any specific things

261
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:01,679
that somebody look I'm trying to grow

262
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,539
two or three plants at home for ex

263
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:04,979
ailments what are the two or three

264
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:07,019
things that I should be looking at to

265
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:09,720
ensure that I'm getting the best kind of

266
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:13,500
annoyed on a trichome balance

267
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:15,899
yeah absolutely so the first thing I

268
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:19,139
think is important is is the genetics

269
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:21,899
right so you want to make sure that you

270
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:25,199
have got seeds or clones from a

271
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:28,679
reputable breeder and that you're

272
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:31,500
growing the variety well we say in

273
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:34,379
science the cultivar that is suited for

274
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:38,339
your needs so you would want to know a

275
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:41,399
bit about the cannabinoid profile also

276
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:44,160
the density of trichomes Leaf uh the

277
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:46,259
flower morphology the

278
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:49,019
um the architecture of the plant so that

279
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:52,319
it fits within your growing space we

280
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:56,039
know growing at home can be quite tight

281
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,959
um so that's the first point of protocol

282
00:11:56,039 --> 00:12:01,019
with with growing at home you want to

283
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:02,399
have a good starting point and then I

284
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:04,259
think it's just a matter of really

285
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:07,980
getting into the nitty-gritty of

286
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:11,399
cultivation and it comes back down to

287
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:14,879
light so lighting plays a big part also

288
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:16,919
nutrients plays a big part as well and

289
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,899
of course you're growing medium so you

290
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:22,259
need to make a decision of whether you

291
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:23,700
want to grow in soil or soil less medium

292
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:26,458
so

293
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:28,620
with that we're really um lucky these

294
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:30,958
days or a lot of information is being

295
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:34,078
published online about the best uh

296
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:35,458
cultivation tips but I think if you if

297
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:38,099
you start with those three or four

298
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:39,179
things and then um you're on a good good

299
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,278
path

300
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:42,899
yeah I think there's a reason if you

301
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:44,278
look at the most profitable and largest

302
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:46,139
cannabis companies around the world

303
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:48,360
Scott's miracle grower I think two

304
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:50,759
billion bigger than most of the big msos

305
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,379
in Canada and America and I think that

306
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:54,360
that's where it's going to Sweet Spot is

307
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:56,100
going to be the the trays the soil the

308
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,139
lighting the nutrients that they're

309
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,820
going to be given is going to be a a big

310
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:01,620
industry when it comes to Europe and no

311
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:04,980
doubt Australia as well

312
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:08,399
absolutely absolutely in fact um yeah

313
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:10,560
I'm I'm looking at ways of of trying to

314
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,120
uh help people out with that here in

315
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:13,979
Australia

316
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:17,100
um and and make the most of their home

317
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:20,459
go in anticipation that these laws are

318
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:22,379
going to to pass in the next six to 12

319
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:25,138
months

320
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:28,078
um and what effect that will have on the

321
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:30,839
local industry we're not quite sure yet

322
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:34,019
of course not everyone is going to want

323
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:35,940
to grow their own cannabis just like you

324
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:38,100
not everyone grows their own vegetables

325
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,839
but I think there is going to be a

326
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:43,200
substantial proportion of the market

327
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:46,260
that is is going to grow their own just

328
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:48,839
because of the cost but also uh because

329
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:49,799
of the enjoyment of of growing your own

330
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:52,380
medicine

331
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:53,578
yeah I think everybody initially when

332
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:54,958
they're allowed to do it are going to

333
00:13:53,578 --> 00:13:56,578
put their finger and try and attempt to

334
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:58,859
do it but they're going to soon realize

335
00:13:56,578 --> 00:14:00,778
how difficult it actually is and we

336
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,879
discussed before they came off the The

337
00:14:00,778 --> 00:14:04,500
Social Club model seems to be what's

338
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:06,720
going to be the most palatable thing for

339
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:09,659
a lot of politicians to give adult

340
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,339
access use to places what is the the

341
00:14:09,659 --> 00:14:12,838
story with that in Australia at the

342
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:14,880
moment

343
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:18,120
yeah so

344
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:20,278
at the moment like I mentioned the laws

345
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:23,399
for homegoing have not yet been been

346
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:25,679
passed but the bill that's being

347
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:28,440
proposed at the moment does have

348
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:31,439
Provisions for cannabis clubs

349
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:33,899
but I'm not sure what it's uh the

350
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,540
purpose mainly is in Europe but in this

351
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:38,820
field what they're proposing it for is

352
00:14:36,539 --> 00:14:41,759
for people who don't have room at home

353
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:44,220
to grow their own or don't have access

354
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:47,639
to to seeds

355
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:50,278
um also for renters who who might not

356
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:52,259
um be looked up upon greatly by their

357
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:56,879
landlord to the growing cannabis at home

358
00:14:52,259 --> 00:15:00,240
so you can uh allow these cannabis clubs

359
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:03,659
to grow your cannabis for you so that's

360
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,579
the proposition at the moment in the in

361
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:07,319
the in the legislation that's being

362
00:15:05,578 --> 00:15:09,539
proposed

363
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,220
well hopefully now mates we in Europe

364
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:13,319
and in Australia we get these Social

365
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:15,540
Clubs up and running over the next 18 to

366
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,220
24 months and the people who want to

367
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:18,838
have access to a plant have access to a

368
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:21,060
plant and the people who want to create

369
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:22,560
new novel products and drugs out of the

370
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:24,899
the molecules that come from the plant

371
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:27,179
are able to do so as well and we can all

372
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:28,740
live Kumbaya happily together as we

373
00:15:27,179 --> 00:15:31,078
March forward

374
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:33,240
that's right we are on the precipice of

375
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:35,578
a really exciting time in the Cannabis

376
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,620
industry and for the Cannabis community

377
00:15:35,578 --> 00:15:40,198
and

378
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:43,139
um hopefully with Europe leading the way

379
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:45,719
Australia will will follow suit and and

380
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:48,060
make it available for for people to home

381
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:51,060
