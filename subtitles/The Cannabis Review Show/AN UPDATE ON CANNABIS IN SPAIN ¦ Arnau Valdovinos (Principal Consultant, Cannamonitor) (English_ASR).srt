me I'm delighted to have you on the show

10
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:31,439
um can you maybe give everybody a little

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,719
overview of you came into the industry

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,280
and your current position at caner

13
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:40,480
monitor sure so I've been involved in

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:44,520
the Canabis space Since U I was quite

15
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:47,599
young maybe too young even um but in a

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,879
in a professional sense um it all came

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,960
about about six years ago I started

18
00:00:49,878 --> 00:00:55,920
working for a British consultancy I saw

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,600
it as an opportunity to merge my skills

20
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,079
in market research and consultancy with

21
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,640
one of my passions with which was the

22
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,319
the Cannabis plan and about three years

23
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:09,200
ago I started uh my own practice which

24
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:12,199
is Canam monitor working mostly with the

25
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,040
European clients on on Market

26
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,520
intelligence and and research on the on

27
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,400
the European

28
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:22,879
markets very good I'm going to start off

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,159
with the can of monitor report that you

30
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:27,399
guys have been working on in Spain can

31
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:30,240
you maybe give everybody an overview of

32
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,920
this report the sectors that it covered

33
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:34,478
is it just Spain specific and why this

34
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,680
would be valuable to a lot of the

35
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:38,959
European

36
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:42,280
operators yes so this is a report that

37
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:44,798
is focused on Spain we do not cover any

38
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,680
other markets even though it of course

39
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,240
they have some relevance also for the

40
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,920
for the Spanish Market because there are

41
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:53,959
some operators that are in both in both

42
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,719
cases and essentially the the goal was

43
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:57,839
to provide a comprehensive view on the

44
00:01:55,718 --> 00:01:59,959
situation in Spain because now the

45
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,399
spanis is coming up everybody's asking

46
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:04,919
questions like uh what happens with the

47
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,439
clubs what happens with the uh what are

48
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,318
these CBD stores that I see on the

49
00:02:06,438 --> 00:02:12,400
street etc etc and nobody knew exactly

50
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,799
how how the market is set up and what

51
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,920
are the uh the different segments and

52
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,360
The Operators and how how it all works

53
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:21,639
so essentially we cover uh pretty

54
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,920
comprehensively all the segments of the

55
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:28,000
industry um by by doing a a market

56
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:30,359
sizing in terms of um how many employees

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,479
there are what are the revenues

58
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,040
generated uh what have been the

59
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:36,719
investments in each segment of the

60
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:38,439
industry and this covers particularly

61
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:41,000
medical cannabis because it's now going

62
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:45,840
to get legalized finally in the country

63
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:49,158
but also CBD and also the hom growing uh

64
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:52,560
industry and also the the elcd market

65
00:02:49,158 --> 00:02:54,959
which uh is very prevalent and growing

66
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,878
in in

67
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,840
Spain okay let's start with the Spain

68
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,639
and the medical cannabis industry over

69
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,400
there Spain has always kind of been one

70
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,919
of the Forefront leaders in Europe

71
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,840
everybody's known about the social clubs

72
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,199
for a long time but it's pretty

73
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,959
surprising that if you actually have

74
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:12,679
been checking on this territory that

75
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,759
there is no medical cannabis program at

76
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,280
all over in Spain and this new minister

77
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:19,239
of Health that's been brought in after

78
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,759
your general elections seems to be very

79
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:24,000
H Pro medical cannabis and bringing this

80
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:26,798
industry to the four can you maybe give

81
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,199
everybody a little breakdown of is flour

82
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:32,400
included is it regular pharmacies is it

83
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:33,798
specializ doctors what are the proposed

84
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,519
uh conditions that they're looking to

85
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:39,040
bring in for this Medical Market in

86
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:41,158
Spain yes so as we are speaking we do

87
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:44,000
not have the final version of the Royal

88
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:47,560
Decree that we legalize medical cannabis

89
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,158
in the country sadly uh however we know

90
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,640
what the ministry has said which is in

91
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,280
application of the conclusions of a

92
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:55,199
parliamentary commission that happened

93
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,640
in

94
00:03:55,199 --> 00:04:00,238
2022 uh so we have some idea of of how

95
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,039
how it may play out

96
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,400
uh for now there are no mentions that

97
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:07,280
the flow are going to be included so it

98
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,560
seems like the regulator will choose uh

99
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,560
pharmaceutical forms in the form of

100
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:15,319
extracts it is not clear yet which which

101
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,879
of them probably oils but maybe a

102
00:04:15,318 --> 00:04:19,759
different one also the list of of the

103
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:22,519
pharmaceutical forms could potentially

104
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,120
be expanded in the future which is also

105
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:27,478
important also how it is worded in the

106
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,160
sense of how easy it is to get new

107
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:33,800
formats in the in the scheme is going to

108
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,880
be massively important other factors are

109
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:40,038
the of course the the number of who can

110
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:43,439
prescribe which it looks like it's going

111
00:04:40,038 --> 00:04:46,279
to be just Specialists and another thing

112
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:48,519
is who can dispense these products which

113
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:50,918
uh it looks like it might be only in the

114
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:54,639
hospitals but then again we do not know

115
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:57,038
how's the how the ging of this decree is

116
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,560
going to be therefore how easy it's it

117
00:04:57,038 --> 00:05:01,120
will be to expand this dispensation also

118
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,560
also to community

119
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,360
pharmacies because obviously if you look

120
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,079
at at the map of Spain it's quite big

121
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,319
for the population it has so many

122
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:12,639
patients are going to be far away from

123
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:15,360
the from the far hospitals where they

124
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:18,038
need to get the their medicines so it

125
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,960
probably makes sense to allow Community

126
00:05:18,038 --> 00:05:22,120
pharmacies to dispense as

127
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:24,038
well they seem to be taking a

128
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,160
conservative approach initially for the

129
00:05:24,038 --> 00:05:29,599
first stage of this medical program but

130
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:32,000
as you said on a territory basis the the

131
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,240
cost and the traveling time frame for

132
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,639
patients who may be sick Hospital

133
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,120
pharmacies is a pretty a uh a reserved

134
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:41,319
strategy that they would take I would

135
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,720
imagine that the Pharmacy Union of Spain

136
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:45,600
are lobbying hard to be able to ensure

137
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,600
that their members are able to dispense

138
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,199
and sell these

139
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,360
products this is one of the advantages

140
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:55,120
of the new regulation which as you say

141
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,800
it's quite conservative I would say that

142
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,560
pretty much every country when they

143
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,520
first regulate medical cannabis they

144
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,680
tend to be pretty conservative as you

145
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:05,918
are very well aware in Ireland but also

146
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:08,680
in other uh markets in in Europe have

147
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:11,799
has had the the same the same situation

148
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,759
however one advantage that all the um

149
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,759
colleges of doctors and pharmacist are

150
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,000
on board with the with the new

151
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:19,199
regulation is that we're necessarily

152
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
100% on board with the regulations as

153
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,919
we're seeing now for instance in in

154
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,680
Germany with the

155
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:29,758
recreational legalization so it's quite

156
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:32,680
conservative but we certainly hope for

157
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,919
it to get expanded over time and sooner

158
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,280
rather than

159
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:38,000
later when it comes to the specialist

160
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:39,879
doctors that are allowed to prescribe is

161
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,399
this somebody who's a certified pain

162
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:45,800
specialist or a certified oncology

163
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:48,038
expert because I would imagine that if

164
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,038
teley medicine has got to be a big part

165
00:06:48,038 --> 00:06:52,800
of the program in Spain due to as you

166
00:06:50,038 --> 00:06:54,918
said the location of patients away from

167
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,960
major cities do you

168
00:06:54,918 --> 00:06:59,680
see the the prescriptions being written

169
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:01,878
by a condensed small amount of

170
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,360
specialist doctors and if so do you

171
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:05,919
think there'll be any International

172
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,680
expertise that are able to take part in

173
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:10,000
the industry or would it be closed to

174
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,759
just Spanish

175
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,439
Specialists yes so sadly we do not know

176
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:17,280
yet the the specific list of specialist

177
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:18,959
that are going to be able to prescribe

178
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:21,239
however by looking at the indications

179
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,758
that the regulator wants to include

180
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:26,879
which are mostly pain and particularly

181
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:29,720
chronic pain which is also an important

182
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:32,000
thing to the fact that all chronic pain

183
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,479
patients are at least in theory going to

184
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,680
be able to be prescribed medical

185
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:38,359
cannabis we would assume that pain

186
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,478
specialists are going to are going to be

187
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:44,240
able to prescribe but uh we do not know

188
00:07:41,478 --> 00:07:47,120
that uh it seems like the regulator is

189
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:51,079
uh very very worried about possible

190
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,680
diversion to the to the illicit Market

191
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:55,198
which is

192
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:58,478
um I mean it's probably more based on

193
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:01,598
their fears rather than than a real an

194
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:03,000
actual reality on the on the ground um

195
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:05,199
but it seems like at the beginning they

196
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,240
want to make sure that this is not

197
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:11,639
possible so things like uh tele medicine

198
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,879
and even something that is very normal

199
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:16,720
in Germany or or the UK like shipping

200
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:19,840
the products uh from the pharmacy to the

201
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,520
to the patient by the by the mail seems

202
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:24,638
like this is not going to be possible um

203
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:26,758
in the early stages of the new program

204
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,240
as it is not allowed for other medicines

205
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:30,800
in Spain

206
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,519
generally it also could be a positive

207
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,519
thing that doesn't allow one large

208
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:36,320
company to control the industry by being

209
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:37,519
able to deliver these medicines it seems

210
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,080
that there's going to have to be

211
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,080
localized clinics for each individual

212
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:49,479
territory yeah

213
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,320
maybe I think on the being that the the

214
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,240
market is going to be a magistral sector

215
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,040
so the pharmacist will need to prepare

216
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,360
each prescription according to the

217
00:08:55,039 --> 00:09:00,159
indications of the doctor as it is in

218
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,600
Germany for instance um

219
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,319
in Germany we see that there are a a

220
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,159
relatively small number of pharmacies

221
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,600
that serve um the population through the

222
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:11,399
post and they can offer better price

223
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,720
prices and maybe better service and a

224
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:16,799
wider assortment assortment of products

225
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,959
than other pharmacies so I think that uh

226
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:21,359
allowing this type of things wouldn't be

227
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:23,439
bad at all for the system I think that

228
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:27,720
giving freedom to prescribe and freedom

229
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:29,880
to um to get the as as many products of

230
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,560
the greatest quality possible is always

231
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:34,559
the goal of a medical cannabis scheme

232
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:36,119
yeah and as you said there's no country

233
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:37,599
in the world yet that's just opened up

234
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,159
the gates for a medical Market it's

235
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,278
always been step by step and incremental

236
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:45,039
gains moving on to the next topic which

237
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:47,559
a lot of people have always been posting

238
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:49,039
about as the Social Clubs in Spain we're

239
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:50,479
a little bit detached over here in

240
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:52,719
Ireland and other parts of Europe we

241
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,480
kind of get headlines and the last big

242
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,079
headline was one of the Mayors in

243
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,920
Barcelona was looking to close down the

244
00:09:57,078 --> 00:10:02,278
Social Clubs is this still the case and

245
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:05,399
if so are the Social Clubs so ingrained

246
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:08,159
in society that uh it is not possible

247
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:08,159
now to remove

248
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,120
them to be honest the landscape of

249
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:17,159
Social Clubs in Spain is highly

250
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:19,240
localized depending on the area in for

251
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:22,519
instance in in Madrid clubs have been

252
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,680
closed uh for for years they have been

253
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:28,480
um they have problems with the police

254
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:31,039
etc etc so one might say that Barcelona

255
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:34,159
was probably the hot bet of these clubs

256
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:37,879
and because apart from other areas but

257
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:39,799
Barcelona in particular um thanks to the

258
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:42,639
to some regulations developed by the

259
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:46,599
municipal Council so what we are seeing

260
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:51,039
now after the uh courts repealed these

261
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,040
Municipal regulations in the past due to

262
00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:01,879
[Music]

263
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,879
some uh of course and the situation is

264
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:08,679
still quite uncertain there might be a

265
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:11,039
part of Simply uh populist tactics

266
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:13,519
because there's an ongoing pro security

267
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:17,000
situation in the city that the council

268
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:19,839
might want to look like they are uh

269
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,600
acting upon even though of course the

270
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,720
clubs um are are quite the harm

271
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:28,480
reduction uh initiative that actually

272
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,440
gets people out from the streets from uh

273
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,480
Street deal and so on so the the

274
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,920
situation could very well deteriorate if

275
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,240
uh the clubs were to be curtailed in in

276
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:40,240
their activities for now there have

277
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:45,039
there has been a ramp up in inspections

278
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:46,639
of these clubs um but it is not certain

279
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:48,919
at all what's what's going to happen in

280
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:52,440
the in the next few months it looks like

281
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:53,879
at least next week with the spanis uh

282
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,839
they are going to they are still going

283
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:58,759
to be open and to be honest as as as far

284
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:01,399
as I remember in the last few years they

285
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:03,958
have always been uh there has always

286
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:05,200
been concerns with the clubs regarding

287
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:08,919
their their

288
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:11,759
likely legal State status in the future

289
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:14,719
and this seems likely to to remain for

290
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:17,120
the time being because they are uh as

291
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,240
you are well aware it's not uh they are

292
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,240
not legal in the sense that they are

293
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:25,919
written into the legislation but rather

294
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:29,440
a loophole uh in the in the gray

295
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:31,479
area on a lighter note now you have

296
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,680
spannabis next week I reckon you'll be a

297
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:36,199
pretty busy man with everybody trying to

298
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:37,799
uh pull at you from all angles um are

299
00:12:36,198 --> 00:12:39,919
you looking forward to spannabis have

300
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:41,439
you got a number of events lined up that

301
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:44,399
you plan on

302
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,680
attending yeah absolutely it's getting

303
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,799
better year after year it's it's no

304
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:52,000
longer only spanis but there's a a

305
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:54,359
plethora of parallel events some that

306
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,958
are more focused on the let's say

307
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:00,039
cannabis cups and contests others that

308
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:01,759
are more professional networking events

309
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:04,799
so yeah I'm I'm going to be attending

310
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:06,958
the Cannabis Hub which is a local entity

311
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:08,559
in Barcelona they are doing an event I'm

312
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:12,359
going to be attending the Cannabis

313
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:15,599
genomics Conference um which is a new

314
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:17,240
event created this year based on uh

315
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,720
genetics which just something very

316
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:22,198
interesting I will be at ICBC which is

317
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:25,600
of course B2B networking event and I

318
00:13:22,198 --> 00:13:27,240
will be of course also at spanis and

319
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,440
looking forward to catching up with

320
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:32,639
everybody it's really nice having

321
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,480
everybody come to your city and uh so I

322
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,680
do not need to move for the networking

323
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,720
everybody comes to me yeah and I think

324
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:42,198
having something like spannabis and the

325
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:44,519
other uh satellite events around you is

326
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:46,439
nothing but good business for Canon
