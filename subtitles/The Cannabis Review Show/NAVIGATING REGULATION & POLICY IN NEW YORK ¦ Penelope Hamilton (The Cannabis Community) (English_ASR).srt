00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:29,438
so i'm going to jump straight into the

40
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,200
things uh first topic i want to talk

41
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:32,798
about was navigating regulation and

42
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,600
policy in new york

43
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,240
um

44
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:38,000
obviously it it's a huge myriad of

45
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,239
different uh sectors and different

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
licenses can you give maybe everybody a

47
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:44,158
quick brief of the mandate for the

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
office of cannabis management

49
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,479
are they the licensed applicant

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,719
receivers are they in charge of taxation

51
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:52,478
what's the exact uh

52
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:55,519
job of that board

53
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:59,679
sure um our legislation was signed uh

54
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:02,319
march 31st of 2021

55
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,960
and it took quite a long time for this

56
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:08,079
office of cannabis management to be

57
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:10,719
formed our legislation the mrta the

58
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,200
marijuana regulation and taxation act

59
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:15,598
was the building blocks the foundation

60
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:17,759
of how we would legalize and what types

61
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:19,359
of licenses etc

62
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:22,239
and then the office of cannabis

63
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,200
management is written into that to

64
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:28,878
establish the rules and the regulations

65
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:31,119
of how it would all play out you know

66
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:32,878
in person when we all get to actually

67
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,319
apply so they are developing the

68
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:37,039
regulations

69
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:39,759
um helping with the the local laws

70
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:42,239
building out those licensed applications

71
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:44,719
every little detail of how legalization

72
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,120
will work in new york state

73
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:49,519
okay amazing so in terms of the license

74
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,759
applications over here it would be if

75
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,159
you've got a bar or a gambling

76
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:56,079
institution it looks as if that's kind

77
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:57,759
of the the structure that people who are

78
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,680
applying for campus license would apply

79
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,120
under is that similar in new york or is

80
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,360
there a whole separate entity where

81
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,319
people apply for every type of cannabis

82
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,720
license from retail to cultivation to

83
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:11,839
purification and

84
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:14,080
lab work we have all separate licenses

85
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,759
so there'll be nine different licenses

86
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,080
open for the public

87
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:21,199
and it is sort of being paralleled you

88
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:24,560
know just like our alcohol and tobacco

89
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:26,318
so but it's not um the same organization

90
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,400
this office of cannabis management is

91
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:30,719
brand new so this is something that has

92
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,840
to be built out and then there's little

93
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,560
you know

94
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,000
group subgroups under that for advisory

95
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,759
and such too

96
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
um so there's

97
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:43,598
all separate licenses that we'll have

98
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,080
going out for each um and very specific

99
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:48,238
that it will not be vertical

100
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,519
which is you know seed to sale in new

101
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:54,080
york state for the large organizations

102
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:57,360
but we will have seed to sale available

103
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:00,080
for a micro license so that the smaller

104
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,360
individuals can get involved and you

105
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,840
know

106
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,040
offer a craft product

107
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,959
yeah well i think that having the

108
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:08,158
barriers to the big msl is just coming

109
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,920
in and trying to double up the big

110
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:12,239
market it's canada i think has proved

111
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:14,318
that that vertical integrated model

112
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,120
doesn't succeed when you have caliber

113
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:19,680
craft craft growers and a number of uh

114
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,759
highly motivated entrepreneurs can't be

115
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,120
stopped creating new products another

116
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,120
thing i wanted to ask you about is

117
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,759
taxation over new york does that fall

118
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,918
under the irs purview or again does the

119
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,439
new office of cannabis management have

120
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:33,918
the power to go

121
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:35,600
and uh retrieve taxes that are owed to

122
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:38,159
the state

123
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,040
so i mean the tax base was written into

124
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,320
the legislation that mrta

125
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,520
and it's being collected at different

126
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,000
um

127
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,599
different areas some is

128
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,519
at um

129
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,160
different steps you know it's not all at

130
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:56,399
the at the retail throughout the process

131
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,120
of it being grown processed so there's

132
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,319
different taxes that's applied

133
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,519
and then it's

134
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:05,279
collected and sent into the state

135
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:07,839
and then the counties will actually you

136
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:10,638
know collect and send into their states

137
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:13,679
as well and to be honest that is as far

138
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,038
as my knowledge on the taxation um you

139
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,879
know piece would be

140
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:18,000
and if they release figures of what the

141
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:20,959
kind of numbers that they're going to

142
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,879
tax at or is this still to be determined

143
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:26,319
before the first retail stores open up

144
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:27,918
in autumn yes we do have it exact but

145
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:30,560
you know we do know we do know what

146
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:31,839
percent will go to uh counties and in

147
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,918
any town

148
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:38,239
um that opted out of specific retail or

149
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,599
consumption site lounges they will not

150
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,478
be getting

151
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,680
their piece of the tax revenue either

152
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:45,758
so

153
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,680
that's an interesting stipulation i

154
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,000
think you might have a couple of votes

155
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,439
down the line to bring that all back in

156
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,439
when they see the revenue that's gone

157
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:55,759
into the legalized territories

158
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:59,038
possibly yes and they do have that

159
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,879
option they can easily opt back in

160
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:03,279
so

161
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:05,680
and so next thing i wanted to talk about

162
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:08,000
was community engagement

163
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,519
how do you see the industry over in new

164
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,759
york at the moment is there a

165
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:14,240
flourishing local scene in the different

166
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,919
five boroughs is there uh

167
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,840
individual companies you kind of see

168
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:20,719
leading the way we saw some of the

169
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:22,638
columbia care purchased there recently

170
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,400
what's your overview of the community in

171
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,720
new york at the moment

172
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:28,879
yeah i mean i think a lot of um

173
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,400
scratching our heads just watching too

174
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:33,279
because like you you just said the

175
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:36,239
columbia being um you know

176
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:38,719
purchased so a lot of changing hands

177
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,199
what's happening with etane so a lot of

178
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,880
questions out there who's going to

179
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,038
dominate and that's a lot of you know a

180
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,800
lot of negative talk too a lot of them

181
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:49,120
don't want those registered

182
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,800
organizations or those multi-state to be

183
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,038
monopolizing but i think we're going to

184
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,038
have some some good competition in new

185
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:57,519
york especially because we have those

186
00:06:55,038 --> 00:07:00,240
smaller licenses and we're seeing a lot

187
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:03,439
of action across the entire state from

188
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,519
east to west with uh the legacy market

189
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:08,160
right now too they're calling it a gray

190
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:09,839
area so a lot of people are setting up

191
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,199
shop and

192
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:13,119
they're really not

193
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,800
quote-unquote legal

194
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,639
so

195
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,160
and are you excited now have they given

196
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,560
an exact date for the first retail

197
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,639
stores to open up in new york because

198
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,240
i'm sure there's a number of european uh

199
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,680
travelers who are frequent visitors to

200
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,240
new york who this is going to be the

201
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,519
icing on the cake to a trip to new york

202
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,960
now for the future

203
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,519
oh i'd love to be able to tell you a

204
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:36,159
date but no we do not have an exact date

205
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:39,439
we are just still trying to form the

206
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:43,120
actual regulations on how to

207
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:45,759
set these license applications up so we

208
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:49,038
have a few things that are going faster

209
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:51,759
social equity was written into our mrta

210
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:54,399
as a the main objective here in new york

211
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:57,199
state so we're trying to take our time

212
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:59,519
and see if we can get those uh social

213
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,598
equity the 50

214
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,680
are supposed to go to a social equity

215
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:05,199
applicant of our licenses throughout the

216
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,759
state so

217
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,598
it's taking a little bit of extra time

218
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,080
trying to get some things

219
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:14,159
you know to go in the right direction

220
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:16,878
yeah well i think that shows that equity

221
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,080
piece is a great uh nuance for investors

222
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,520
you might be getting in the industry

223
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:21,279
there's certain individuals now who will

224
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:22,878
have access to capital that may not have

225
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:24,399
had access to capital purely and the

226
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,639
distinct that they've got access to a

227
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:28,159
license ahead of uh

228
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,160
standardized companies which i think is

229
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,320
a good thing across the board

230
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,440
yeah just trying to lower some barriers

231
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,479
you know so new york's trying to get

232
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:40,320
very creative even as far as helping to

233
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:42,158
fund grants teaching uh you know really

234
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,760
to be there and guide them don't want

235
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:46,000
people to fail

236
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:48,000
yeah a good educational program now i

237
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,519
think is essential for getting everybody

238
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,320
up to speed on all the different do's

239
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,560
and don'ts for the industry

240
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,560
definitely yeah and it's it's

241
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:59,119
still so like i said so many questions

242
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:01,278
you know we know these are written in

243
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,519
all these different little um programs

244
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:04,958
and what we would like to do but it's

245
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,679
just not

246
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,559
formed yet so everything is we we say

247
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:09,519
we're

248
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:12,399
you know

249
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,480
building the plane as we're flying in so

250
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,080
you know and it's so true

251
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,600
and do you see

252
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,639
in your opinion do you see a certain

253
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,440
specific uh market in new york is it

254
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,958
going to be flower is it going to be

255
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,640
vapes is it going to be edibles do you

256
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,639
think it'll be health and wellness where

257
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,080
do you think the biggest sector is going

258
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:32,799
to be in the market or is it going to be

259
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,480
tourism just a casual footfall going by

260
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:36,159
dispensary down in

261
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,000
midtown or open

262
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:43,278
yeah that's a great question um

263
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,480
i think tourism is going to be huge i do

264
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:46,720
and

265
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,560
i would also say flower i think we're

266
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,920
going to see new york

267
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:54,159
um possibly really stand out with their

268
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:55,838
uh kraft flower like they did with their

269
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:57,199
craft breweries

270
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,040
and our wine

271
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,399
country because if you look at the rest

272
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:04,399
of the state we're agricultural based so

273
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,600
i think we're going to have some very

274
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,919
um talented may we say um you know

275
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,200
cultivation in new york state

276
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:12,958
yeah i haven't lived there for a number

277
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,160
of years i definitely know for a fact

278
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:16,159
that there's going to be a number of

279
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:17,919
different genetics i think that come out

280
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:20,799
of new york that are going to become

281
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:22,799
popular global strains and it'll emanate

282
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:24,159
from some little basement in brooklyn or

283
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:26,479
the bronx or something like that it

284
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:29,199
won't emanate from some lab in manhattan

285
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:32,320
oh yeah we're counting on that we're we

286
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,560
definitely have some wonderful legacy uh

287
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,800
strains already so i'm sure the genetics

288
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:38,159
are gonna continue at least that's our

289
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:40,000
hope

290
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:42,159
and have you guys seen the cbd market of

291
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,159
it is there is the ability to buy cbd

292
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:46,719
flower legal over there or is it just

293
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:48,799
going from illegality straight away into

294
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,480
all consumption of everything

295
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:55,039
it is um we really did have to fight on

296
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,120
that regulation because they did not

297
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:59,679
want us to have flour for quite a while

298
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,399
to be sold to people so the compromise

299
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,919
was

300
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:06,879
no pre-rolls for the hemp products for

301
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:08,399
cbd flour but you can sell the actual

302
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,078
flour so

303
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,078
okay very interesting

304
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:14,078
and it's is what are you looking forward

305
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:15,838
to most now over the first nine months

306
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:17,439
is it the opening of the retail stores

307
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,560
or is there something specific that we

308
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,560
need to know about that's going to be

309
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:21,838
happening in new york

310
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:23,278
um

311
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,040
i you know

312
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:28,078
this isn't to do with licensing but i

313
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:30,480
think i'm most excited about seeing our

314
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:32,719
people be able to grow and cultivate

315
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,639
their own cannabis because with our

316
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,680
legislation

317
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:38,000
all

318
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:39,519
adults 21 years and older are going to

319
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,958
be able to grow

320
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,320
their own cannabis plants at home so

321
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:46,159
i got to be honest that's my most

322
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,079
exciting uh you know

323
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:49,600
weight yeah that's incredible you've got

324
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:51,919
to have the potential for millions of

325
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,920
young botanists to be able to to have

326
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,519
their own plant and is that a limit is

327
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:57,199
there a specific amount of plants that

328
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,600
each individual person is allowed to

329
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,680
grow is there any rule set around that

330
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,040
or is it just limited to certain amount

331
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,159
of plants and you can do everything else

332
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:06,958
yourself

333
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:08,719
it is limited and again they're still

334
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:10,319
working on a lot of the regulations so

335
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,959
and that is not going to be allowed

336
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,600
