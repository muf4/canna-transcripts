companies in the global sphere so

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,719
why did you want to give everybody a

16
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:34,558
little overview of how you got to where

17
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,079
you are in the video at the moment

18
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:40,000
yes absolutely back in 2017

19
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,079
my husband and i started researching

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,119
going into natural health holistic means

21
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,160
medicines

22
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:46,718
and fell into the cbd world while

23
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:48,878
visiting

24
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,879
america i am american but i do live here

25
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:52,159
in the uk so we spent seven months doing

26
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:53,919
due diligence

27
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:55,599
in the states looking to see what was

28
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,440
working what wasn't understanding the

29
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,280
market as best as we could

30
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:00,558
with the mindset to bring something back

31
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,879
to the uk

32
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,878
and our desire was to provide a product

33
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:06,640
for people and for pets because that is

34
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,920
part of my background technically was in

35
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,599
veterinary medicine

36
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,560
so we we created a brand called the

37
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:14,798
naked leaf um brought it back to the uk

38
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,879
and successfully started trading for

39
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,280
people over here as well as for pets and

40
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:19,920
people

41
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,478
in america back in america and our

42
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,560
product

43
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:24,239
and our brand and our company was

44
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,680
acquired by a different

45
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,359
group that was looking for a vertical

46
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,159
operation so we

47
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:32,078
um spent our time doing all of that type

48
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,960
of transitional work which led me

49
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:36,798
into a wonderful um experiential

50
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:39,280
education in the marketplace

51
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,960
in the cbd realm and also started

52
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,599
getting my passion for

53
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:45,039
medical marijuana which was the next

54
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:46,879
phase that i wanted to enter

55
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,320
and that's when i met the group at avita

56
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:50,239
global who are

57
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:51,758
producing the highest quality medicinal

58
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:53,280
cannabis and that was something i really

59
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,000
was excited about

60
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,879
and we melded forces and joined together

61
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,879
just this past june

62
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:05,359
oh i think

63
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,038
you are a mute sorry i'm still muted

64
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:11,359
there so

65
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,799
yeah so that's that's great it's uh you

66
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,760
you kind of have the expertise from the

67
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,840
veterinary side

68
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:17,280
coming in to talk about the subject it's

69
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,080
not somebody just come in and said it

70
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,640
set up a

71
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,640
a cbd company can you tell me what

72
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:24,559
attracted to you to aveda global

73
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:26,159
what's their story like can you give

74
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,159
maybe the viewer an overview of who

75
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,000
vito global are and what their purpose

76
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:31,598
is yes absolutely well

77
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,639
part partially because i have been a

78
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:36,159
cannabis medical cannabis patient myself

79
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:37,919
in the past it is really important to

80
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:39,359
understand where your product comes from

81
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:40,878
and i think that is something that the

82
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,920
consumer and the patients don't have a

83
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:43,759
lot of access

84
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:45,439
to knowing because there's so much out

85
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:47,199
there and what i liked about avita

86
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:49,039
global was their transparency and their

87
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:51,280
traceability to product

88
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,799
so um what's really unique about evita

89
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,080
is this is a group that

90
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,640
had an idea to create this high medical

91
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,719
um high quality medical cannabis with

92
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:03,199
three factors in mind the location

93
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:04,239
the people in the process around it and

94
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,039
so what they have done

95
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,840
uniquely is they've set up um in

96
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:10,719
colombia

97
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,640
an area called la jolla la jolla de

98
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:13,280
americo in cesar which is northeast

99
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:15,119
columbia

100
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,479
it's at the foot of the andes mountains

101
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,599
so they're looking at doing a

102
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:20,959
sustainable

103
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:23,280
natural growing method by being um

104
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,080
environmentally sound and carbon neutral

105
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,000
along the way

106
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,840
so this was a three year process and

107
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,680
i've joined in at a very critical time

108
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,319
where everything is now moving

109
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,760
and what was nice about this is that the

110
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:34,318
being that cannabis plants are like a

111
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:36,239
sponge

112
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:38,318
whatever the environment is grows into

113
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,158
them so they grow hydroponically

114
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:42,238
and purpose-built greenhouses so it's

115
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:44,079
akin to laboratory conditions

116
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,319
and i found that to be really unique

117
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,840
being that it's outdoors hydroponically

118
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:51,039
grown but covered

119
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,200
and with the optimum 13 hours of

120
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,560
daylight consistent temperatures of 26

121
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,639
to 34 degrees

122
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,479
they can actually harvest about five to

123
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,479
six crops a year

124
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:02,238
and when there's a limitation for

125
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,719
patient access due to supply

126
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,759
this to me was incredibly interesting

127
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:07,680
because now

128
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,438
we can produce a medicinal cannabis that

129
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,840
can actually reach those who need it

130
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:14,239
because of our ability to harvest

131
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,840
and these conditions so although they

132
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,918
have these six harvests per year they

133
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,079
micro harvest every three days

134
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,918
and watching these controlled batches

135
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,918
making sure that the epigenetics are

136
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,758
being taken into consideration

137
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,758
that all the data that's being collected

138
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,479
is shared with our bio diligence team in

139
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,080
israel

140
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:32,079
everything they're doing has such

141
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:34,079
concise and precise measures

142
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:35,599
that the quality consistency will then

143
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:38,399
follow and it has

144
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,000
it's proven to be and um so i think all

145
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:40,799
of the efforts that they have made so

146
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,839
far has been

147
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,600
have been unbelievably exciting um they

148
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:47,439
are in an eu gmp

149
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,639
track and that should be coming in at

150
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,279
the end of this

151
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,160
quarter and that will give us the

152
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:55,039
ability to

153
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,080
um focus on all of the markets including

154
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,319
not only just colombia but also the um

155
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:02,719
neighboring south american countries

156
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:05,279
like brazil uruguay chile mexico

157
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,759
and of course europe so that is part of

158
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:07,918
um

159
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,319
why why i wasn't fascinated with their

160
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:12,879
process but the other part is the locals

161
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:13,439
um impact that they have so they they

162
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,360
harness

163
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:17,600
almost all of the local skill sets that

164
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,120
they can so they work really carefully

165
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,160
with the ministry of justice for

166
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,879
security

167
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,280
on site but they also work with the um

168
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:24,560
the

169
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:26,159
national training service which is

170
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,478
called cena down at colombia and they

171
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,080
have

172
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:32,879
60 employees and recent grads that work

173
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:35,359
on the agricultural medicinal side link

174
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:37,279
joined joining evita and 60 of them are

175
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,919
now but we hope to actually employ

176
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:41,839
about 600 people when it's all the 40

177
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:43,918
hectares are filled with our

178
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:46,319
facility and i love the fact that they

179
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:48,719
also have three quarters of their

180
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:50,719
employees are female because they're

181
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,479
trying to keep on this ratio to give

182
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,400
opportunities to the local women

183
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:55,918
who are usually disadvantaged in terms

184
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:56,719
of employment opportunities in the

185
00:05:55,918 --> 00:05:58,560
region

186
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,080
and i felt that was something that was

187
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,399
really close to my heart so there's a

188
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:05,680
lot of ethics behind this company

189
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,000
as well as the um the careful genetics

190
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,280
being

191
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,439
followed you know with the group of

192
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:11,599
people that are involved we have the top

193
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:13,199
agronomists some of the best cultivators

194
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,080
a lot of people that used to work in

195
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,079
pharma

196
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:17,758
um so the skill sets are there and then

197
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:19,839
of course we do have a bio diligence

198
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,560
team in israel that monitors all of the

199
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:23,119
genetics

200
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,199
all of the data and keeps us on track to

201
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,280
making sure that we're ever evolving

202
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,520
and that whatever strains we are growing

203
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:31,279
can complement the necessary

204
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:33,198
medical conditions that could benefit

205
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:36,000
from these strains

206
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,520
um and then one other little point if i

207
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,918
don't if you don't mind me saying is

208
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:40,318
that

209
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:41,839
they also have a foundation where coming

210
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,000
from a background where i worked in a

211
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:47,359
lot of non-profit as a volunteer

212
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,399
um avito global set up a foundation to

213
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,240
bring back some um to give back to the

214
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:53,038
the local country with a focus on

215
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,759
education

216
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:56,719
local enterprise environment and arts

217
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,759
and culture

218
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,759
so they've been working well um past

219
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,759
this past year a lot with the pandemic

220
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,479
and assisting those in the area

221
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,879
that were suffering from food shortages

222
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:09,120
and

223
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:10,959
job shortages of course but they also

224
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,280
are looking to promote um

225
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:15,120
transportation options for the local

226
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:16,959
children who tend to walk 5k to work

227
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,319
every day i mean to school every day so

228
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:21,439
i found that to be a really

229
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,199
nice component of what avita does

230
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:24,639
so that's basically the guys have got

231
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,120
the model in place where

232
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,840
the price per gram grown in colombia is

233
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,000
going to be

234
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:31,758
a specific attractive part of the

235
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,279
company you've got the medical research

236
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,560
side of israel which are the world

237
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:36,399
leaders and this is the other

238
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,079
attractive side so the components for

239
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:38,560
that company seem to be put in position

240
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:40,478
and then

241
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,800
the final piece for me is always equity

242
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:43,918
partners who stands to make from the

243
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,360
company if the companies in the

244
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:46,959
territory are they giving back to the

245
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,800
people in that environment so

246
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:50,399
you seem to be doing all three of the

247
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,400
right things for a company to do

248
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:54,000
to to make it on a global scale and i

249
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:54,638
think what you're going to see over time

250
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,720
now is

251
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,160
the acquisitions and mergers of a lot of

252
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,800
companies and you're going to be left

253
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,879
with

254
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,038
let's say the top five to 10 companies

255
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,000
who if they haven't got that price point

256
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:05,038
for gram

257
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,399
they're going to be blown out of the

258
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:07,918
water if they haven't got the medical

259
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:10,719
research and the top kind of

260
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:12,159
tier research that goes along with it

261
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,039
which kind of brings me on to my next

262
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,400
topic which is

263
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:15,680
fostering relationships with

264
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:16,399
universities for research and

265
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,478
development

266
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:20,159
you guys seem to be pretty good at this

267
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:22,318
is there something that you'd

268
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,000
give any information to the audience on

269
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,319
this side of the industry

270
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,680
absolutely well one of our chief medical

271
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,479
officer happens to be dr

272
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,280
francis francisco cabal and he was one

273
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:33,519
of the leading

274
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:35,038
colombian trauma doctors and what he's

275
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,560
doing right now in colombia he has

276
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:39,278
started a three-phase

277
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,399
clinical trial and he's working on four

278
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:43,599
aspects which is

279
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:46,399
trauma post-traumatic stress and anxiety

280
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,480
combined cancer as well as multiple

281
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,720
sclerosis which is very close to a lot

282
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,200
of

283
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,480
our hearts because we've had several

284
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,000
different family members suffering from

285
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,720
it as well as dr cabal so

286
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,799
that trial is underway that is based out

287
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,200
of his eye care clinics which are in

288
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:03,359
colombia so it gives us patient access

289
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,519
doctor access and he can keep his finger

290
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,360
on the pulse of all of the processes

291
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,799
once again this began the beginning of

292
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,240
this year so it's a three-phase

293
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,719
three-year trial

294
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,000
um but we also have fostered very close

295
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,959
relationships with universities and

296
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,200
academies

297
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:19,039
um locally in colombia but also in

298
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,399
israel as i mentioned we have

299
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:24,399
a form of bio-diligence group

300
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,679
over there that is keeping an eye on

301
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,440
everything we're doing and it's been

302
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:29,199
advising from the very beginning

303
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,040
so they also are looking at all the

304
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,120
genetic aspects and

305
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:34,319
pharmaceutical aspects of each strain

306
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,759
that we are working with

307
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,839
making sure that we have the proper

308
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:40,159
delivery systems also creating new

309
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:43,040
delivery systems that are unique to the

310
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:43,919
um marketplace which um will be released

311
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:46,000
once we we

312
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:48,079
finalize everything with them um we have

313
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,080
multiple just um the multi-disciplinary

314
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,519
center at hebrew university in jerusalem

315
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,440
and the techyon are two of those

316
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,320
locations that we're working with

317
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,839
um and also the um you know

318
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,000
understanding the new

319
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,519
cannabis molecules and how the

320
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,639
combination of these molecules and the

321
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,919
entourage effect

322
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,240
can work with different medical

323
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:08,479
conditions so these all keep us up to

324
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,399
date with the latest developments um

325
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,959
we are working hard to make sure that

326
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,958
we've got as much clinical background on

327
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:16,719
our strains to be able to provide to

328
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:18,078
prescribers to give them the confidence

329
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,959
the insurance that everything we're

330
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:21,120
doing

331
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:23,599
is um copacetic with what they are

332
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,320
looking to prescribe for their patients

333
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,200
very amazing the last topic that i want

334
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,320
to touch on

335
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,839
and it's something i know you're going

336
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,760
to be an expert on i know about a good

337
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,200
few people kind of ask me about this

338
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:34,958
we've heard of a lot of companies doing

339
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,440
dvds for different pets

340
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:40,000
can you talk about cbds or horses the

341
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,000
benefits that it does or does not blame

342
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,039
and how it should be administered and

343
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,120
maybe what the

344
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:47,120
recommended dosage for a horse would

345
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,959
yes absolutely i have a lot to say on

346
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:55,120
this subject it's something that's close

347
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:56,399
to my heart i'm an equestrian i have

348
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,399
been my entire life

349
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,159
um and working with horses has been

350
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,839
something that's been not only a passion

351
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:04,159
but creating

352
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,079
a hemp-based product for horses was

353
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:07,039
something that i wanted to set out to do

354
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:09,599
and i did

355
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:10,240
um that was with the naked leaf company

356
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,959
right now

357
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,200
in the uk cbd for pets and animals in

358
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:16,958
general is not permitted however and i'm

359
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,800
disclosing all of this information not

360
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:21,119
being a veterinarian i can give you some

361
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:23,039
information on how i have seen it work

362
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,320
well um in the united states

363
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:29,120
and what i hope to see is the acceptance

364
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,560
leading across europe and the uk um

365
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,320
other countries are starting to look at

366
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:32,879
it as well i think it's becoming a hot

367
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,839
topic

368
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:37,600
and there's a lot of owner of horses

369
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,320
equestrian demand for their equine

370
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,720
partners

371
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,440
to have ability to recover while in

372
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,440
motion

373
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,440
and that is what cbd does for horses

374
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,519
just like us they have our mammals they

375
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,560
have an endocannabinoid system

376
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,320
when you give a horse cbd they are all

377
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:54,159
sensitive creatures as large as they are

378
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,839
i always deem them like butterflies

379
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:57,439
and so when you give anything to a horse

380
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,639
it can affect them quite quickly

381
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,680
and cbd is no different however um

382
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,159
there's different types of

383
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,278
administration i will give some examples

384
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:07,039
just of my own

385
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:09,039
product that we created it was a pellet

386
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:11,759
form so it was an ingestible

387
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:13,919
um each pellet had a one percent content

388
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:16,159
of cbd in it so therefore

389
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:18,000
um a scoops you know that we had which

390
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:20,000
was equivalent to about a tablespoon was

391
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,720
about 75 milligrams and it was a

392
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
for an average size horse 500 kilos 550

393
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,160
kilos it was about a 300

394
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,399
milligram dose that seemed to work best

395
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:29,600
you're also dealing with a very long gut

396
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,879
so when you're dealing with anything

397
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,159
ingestible you've got to remember a

398
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:32,958
horse is built a little differently than

399
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:36,480
a dog

400
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:38,638
so i have had um amazing anecdotal

401
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,360
real world evidence showing that with

402
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,720
this type of dosage of 300 milligrams of

403
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,839
cbd product

404
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,680
for a 500 550 kilo horse

405
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,480
there was a reduction in anxiety a

406
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:52,399
reduction in arthritic

407
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,480
or you know a range of motion that was

408
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,958
increased the arthritis pain

409
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,720
subsided and when pain subsides a horse

410
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,919
will eat better like any of us if you're

411
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,759
in pain you don't want to eat

412
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:03,439
and forest doesn't eat they can also

413
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:05,600
result have gi

414
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,200
issues so it was very important that if

415
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,360
you have an animal you want to

416
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,200
treat them like a horse with something

417
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,159
to reduce their pain it will help them

418
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,480
create the regular um system functions

419
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:17,919
as well as eating and defecating etc

420
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,560
which is really important in the horse

421
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:20,958
world

422
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:22,399
i've also had great success with topical

423
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:24,719
products so if there

424
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,320
is a horse with swelling in the leg

425
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,879
there's no need for that edema to go

426
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,600
down the leg there's a way to actually

427
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:32,799
um reduce that swelling with a cbd

428
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,959
topical solution

429
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,078
and i personally loved our liniment gel

430
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:38,479
that is something that

431
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:39,759
was something we created and it worked a

432
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,879
long time to get that

433
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:45,278
um water-soluble nano-molecular

434
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:46,879
cbd liniment gel and it's helped horses

435
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:49,198
like i said with my own experience as

436
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:51,039
well as our customers in the past

437
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:52,719
and i think if it's in every

438
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:55,439
equestrian's toolbox

439
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,879
you don't have to aim for those um

440
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,639
butte-type drugs

441
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:00,639
you know drugs that can actually on a

442
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,519
long-term basis affect the animal's

443
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,480
well-being

444
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:07,278
the other aspect of cbd for horses it is

445
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,720
not permitted in competition animals so

446
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:10,320
there is a withdrawal period for

447
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,320
everything be sure if you're going to be

448
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,278
using cbd for horses that whatever

449
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,839
product you're buying

450
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:16,320
has that withdrawal period noted on the

451
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,160
product

452
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,920
or contact the company itself so that

453
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:22,000
you are not competing

454
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:23,599
unknowingly having cannabinoids in your

455
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,879
horse's body so that you get

456
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,199
disqualified

457
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:28,240
um so that's just i just asked a

458
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:31,359
question there so

459
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:34,560
cbd is illegal for any racehorse

460
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,639
um in well it would if they're racing

461
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:39,518
yes that is true and i believe the only

462
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,600
horses that are allowed to take cbd and

463
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,879
i could be wrong here are polo horses

464
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,639
but for the most part

465
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:48,879
um racing fei usef show jumping and and

466
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,240
the racing associations do not permit

467
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:52,559
cannabinoids and horses

468
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,320
however if there's a withdrawal period

469
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,958
using them while not racing

470
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,480
and monitoring them is very important so

471
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:00,078
you would want to make sure that you

472
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,159
know exactly what you're doing there's

473
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:03,759
no cross-contamination within your yard

474
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:05,838
and that your horses are getting exactly

475
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:06,319
what they should you need almost a groom

476
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,519
proof

477
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,639
system so that any sensitive tests that

478
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,639
they provide

479
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,320
these horses at times you make sure that

480
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,600
there's nobody touching cbd and then

481
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,879
touching another horse

482
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,800
you just never know and some of these

483
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:20,320
animals have been you know training for

484
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:22,159
so long you wouldn't want someone to be

485
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,480
disqualified accidentally

486
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:25,519
so i do believe though these are the

487
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,360
athletes why

488
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,360
should we prevent athletes from not

489
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,360
getting the chance to recover

490
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,120
naturally while in motion when we

491
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,159
personally as athletes get to recover

492
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,000
while we're in motion

493
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:37,759
they're doing the same and if anything

494
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,600
they're then put in a box and told to

495
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,480
stand still which isn't always very good

496
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,480
so

497
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,720
i believe that it should be necessary

498
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,759
i've spoken in washington dc about this

499
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,680
to the heads of the

500
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,120
olympic committees as well as ucef and

501
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:51,278
fei um

502
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,839
this was back in 2018 and even then they

503
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:55,679
were skeptical but interested and they

504
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,360
agreed with me that it does work

505
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:59,198
it's just a matter of rewriting rules

506
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,399
and sometimes it takes a lot of effort

507
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:03,359
and so therefore

508
