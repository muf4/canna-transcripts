1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:03,599
foreign

2
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:16,560
by Ruth Fisher who's the principal at

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,000
quanta she's an economist with a passion

4
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:19,919
for understanding how components of

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,079
systems work together to create outcomes

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,900
how are you keeping today Ruth Oh I'm

7
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:26,038
great how are you I'm fantastic I've

8
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:27,899
been looking forward to having a chat

9
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,400
with you now since we announced this um

10
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:31,379
can you maybe give everybody a quick

11
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:33,899
little overview of how you came to set

12
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:36,600
up quanta and how you ended up touching

13
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:40,679
on the Cannabis industry

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:44,039
um so I'm an economist and I spent a lot

15
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:45,840
of time in uh I I started out doing a

16
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:48,179
supporting expert testimony as to

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,800
damages from infringement and I was

18
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:51,299
working on a lot of technology and

19
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:54,718
especially biotech and healthcare

20
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:57,179
industry uh projects

21
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,539
um and I left the industry to start

22
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:02,039
quanta because I was very interested in

23
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:05,280
the fact that when I was working with

24
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:07,618
firms the information that I got tended

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,320
to come in very piecemeal from different

26
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:11,938
companies so I would go in and need to

27
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:13,919
do certain analyzes and I would say okay

28
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:16,379
in order to understand the environment

29
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,000
here I need this information and this

30
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:20,099
information and this information and

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,959
what happened invariably is the

32
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:23,699
companies would say okay for this piece

33
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:25,379
of information talk to this guy and for

34
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,118
this information talk to this guy and

35
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:29,280
for that information talk to that guy

36
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:32,579
and I would put everything together and

37
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,879
get a much more comprehensive and to me

38
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:37,920
more uh

39
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:40,920
just a better understanding of what was

40
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,460
going on in the company and I figured

41
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,019
that if I started my own company I could

42
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:48,179
help companies kind of piece together

43
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:50,879
this information give them a more

44
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,618
complete vision of what was going on in

45
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:56,339
their environment and help them more

46
00:01:52,618 --> 00:01:58,438
strategically Advance their uh their

47
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,600
projects or products or whatever it is

48
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:03,258
that they were offering so that's kind

49
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:07,319
of how quanta came to be

50
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:09,598
I came to cannabis in about 2015 because

51
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:12,659
my brother was diagnosed with multiple

52
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:14,179
sclerosis and he was having a very

53
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:17,159
difficult time

54
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:21,180
alleviating his his neuropathic induced

55
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:22,859
his neuropathic pain from Cannabis and

56
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,420
one of his doctors at some point said

57
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,760
you know I think you might be able to

58
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:29,219
benefit from Cannabis but I can't give

59
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:31,799
you any guidance so he's kind of thrown

60
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:33,359
out there he was he was excited to

61
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,900
finally have something new to try

62
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:40,379
because he would he had tried everything

63
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:42,659
so he's started using cannabis and at

64
00:02:40,378 --> 00:02:44,399
some point he realized that he was

65
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:45,900
getting some effects but if he knew what

66
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,640
he was doing he would probably be

67
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,159
getting better effects

68
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:53,339
so given my background in in healthcare

69
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:55,579
and under in market research and

70
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:58,979
understanding how to gather information

71
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:01,019
and put it together in a helpful uh way

72
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:03,359
he turned to me and said you know I'm

73
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:05,640
using cannabis I'm getting some results

74
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,319
I think I could get better results if I

75
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:08,939
knew what I was doing so can you help me

76
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:12,000
figure this out

77
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:15,239
so at that point I came to cannabis and

78
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,039
I literally had zero understanding of

79
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:18,599
the plant the product how it worked

80
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:21,179
anything

81
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:22,738
um it was it was a very uh interesting

82
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,739
experience for me

83
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:28,680
I jumped in I said I'm just gonna try

84
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:31,019
and figure this out uh I just started

85
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,080
reading everything it's it's a very

86
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:36,180
perhaps the most complex industry I've

87
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,760
ever been involved with

88
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:41,760
um it took me a long time to finally

89
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:43,979
kind of understand what was going on and

90
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:46,259
it was very interesting to me because

91
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:48,479
there's so much information out there

92
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:51,419
and I know that I I talk about this

93
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:53,699
regularly and everyone seems to have the

94
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:55,439
same problem is people who are new to

95
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:57,359
cannabis they start trying to find

96
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,878
information and it's really hard to

97
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,680
understand what's going on and and what

98
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:03,899
to believe there's there's good

99
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,840
information there's misinformation

100
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,939
there's disinformation there's kind of

101
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,219
everything out there

102
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:13,799
um and it took me a while and I think

103
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:16,199
perhaps what helped me most to

104
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:17,939
understand the information in cannabis

105
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:19,799
in the industry

106
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:21,660
is that you have a lot of different

107
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:23,159
people who are in the industry and

108
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,840
they're providing information they're

109
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,699
providing products and services and

110
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:29,279
advice and everything from their

111
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:32,040
particular perspective

112
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:33,659
so you have you have the traditional

113
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,580
healthcare industry and the traditional

114
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,860
healthcare industry they're very

115
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:40,198
skeptical and the early literature

116
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,000
everyone was very anti-cannabis and

117
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:43,620
everything is focusing on the dangers of

118
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,079
cannabis

119
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:48,000
um and then only more recently are they

120
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:50,579
focusing on doing research on how

121
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,379
cannabis actually works then you have

122
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:54,478
kind of the traditional Legacy people

123
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:56,939
and they're talking about whole plant

124
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:59,399
cannabis and they're providing a really

125
00:04:56,939 --> 00:05:02,160
a lot of really good information on the

126
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:04,079
plant and whole plant products which are

127
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,820
diametrically opposed to the isolate

128
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:07,680
model that the traditional healthcare

129
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:11,040
industry are presenting

130
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,139
uh you have a lot of casual users who

131
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,300
some of them have good information some

132
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:17,699
don't you have a lot of naysayers out

133
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:20,400
there who are trying to kind of torpedo

134
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:23,038
cannabis in any way they can so for me

135
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:25,620
one of the biggest lessons I've learned

136
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:27,360
in the industry is to try and figure out

137
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,160
what perspective what's the background

138
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,900
of that person who's providing the

139
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,240
information and that will help you kind

140
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:34,918
of figure out what context to put that

141
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,199
information in so that that was

142
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:38,038
definitely very helpful for me

143
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,800
um

144
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:42,719
but so once I started understanding how

145
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,400
cannabis was working and I was I was

146
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,500
giving the information to my brother and

147
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:47,758
he was using it and lo and behold it was

148
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,300
working and that was just really

149
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,139
fantastic and we decided to

150
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,780
um

151
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:57,360
try and and kind of put together a more

152
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:59,939
systematic view of cannabis to help

153
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,979
other people we started developing a

154
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:03,959
technology it didn't end up kind of

155
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:05,939
going very far

156
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:09,959
um but

157
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:13,160
um so after that I was continuing on and

158
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:16,680
became very passionate about education

159
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:19,880
and and education and promoting medical

160
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:23,220
cannabis and promoting access to people

161
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:25,199
who uh who've been kind of not able to

162
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:27,120
be served well by the traditional

163
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,120
Community which there are a lot of those

164
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,639
in cannabis unfortunately

165
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,379
but at the same time as an economist and

166
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,500
as someone very interested in market

167
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:39,659
dynamics and Technologies I've also been

168
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:42,839
looking at the industry and following

169
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:45,360
its path of evolution and in particular

170
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:48,060
it's a highly regulated industry and how

171
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:51,479
are the the regulations shaping the way

172
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:53,339
that the industry is evolving in the way

173
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:55,978
that firms are supplying products which

174
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:57,659
products are they supplying what are the

175
00:06:55,978 --> 00:06:58,680
prices

176
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:01,100
um

177
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,240
um what type of competition is out there

178
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:05,160
and I've also been really really

179
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,740
fascinated by all the different

180
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:10,330
Technologies in cannabis and kind of

181
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,680
which ones are emerging and

182
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:11,699
[Music]

183
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,519
um

184
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:16,800
so that's kind of where I am right now

185
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:18,359
yeah the Cannabis industry seems to be

186
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,699
one of the industries that everybody has

187
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,620
their own personal point of view and I

188
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:24,598
think a highly accomplished people like

189
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,639
yourself especially in The Economist

190
00:07:24,598 --> 00:07:28,500
side of things are parliament of this

191
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,598
industry actually getting some validity

192
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,639
and being able to cut you shall we say

193
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:34,379
the [ __ ] of a lot of the stuff that

194
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,900
you hear in the Cannabis industry around

195
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:38,339
so it's an absolute pleasure to talk to

196
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:40,439
you I'm going to move on to the first

197
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:42,538
topic which is cannabis The Mulch and

198
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:44,579
Technology can you maybe give everybody

199
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:47,159
a little overview of your recent

200
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:49,019
Publications on this technology and what

201
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:52,319
it is that you found

202
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:55,620
sure so um I I was looking reading about

203
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,660
how uh beverages are now perhaps one of

204
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:00,000
the fastest growing categories product

205
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,080
types in cannabis and and I and I

206
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,740
thought that was very interesting

207
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:07,978
because all of a sudden beverages are

208
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:10,740
kind of the it product and I'm like well

209
00:08:07,978 --> 00:08:14,279
beverages have been out there before so

210
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:16,259
why now are they just being uh becoming

211
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:18,179
successful and so I started researching

212
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:19,860
in that and it turns out that what's

213
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,680
really important in beverages are the

214
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:24,479
Emulsion Technologies and again I was

215
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,819
kind of puzzled because I know Emulsion

216
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:29,098
Technologies are nothing new so I kind

217
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:31,620
of did some research there and I

218
00:08:29,098 --> 00:08:33,120
discovered that Emulsion Technologies in

219
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,918
general first started becoming

220
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:39,479
commercially available in the early

221
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:41,038
1900s and they were being used primarily

222
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:43,800
in the food industry but in other

223
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:46,139
Industries as well so that's that's been

224
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:49,740
a hundred years now so you know why are

225
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:52,319
our cannabis beverages only Now new so

226
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:55,560
after the the traditional Emulsion

227
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,980
Technologies in around the 60s

228
00:08:55,559 --> 00:09:00,838
um 50s 60s 70s you had micro Emulsion

229
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,659
Technologies and those were an

230
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:05,399
improvement in enhancement on on the

231
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:08,338
earlier stuff

232
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:11,100
um and those those uh did allow for very

233
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:13,740
small particle sizes and again well now

234
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:16,019
that's the 60s it's still you know 60

235
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:19,799
years so why is it new well then you

236
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:23,278
have the Nano Emulsion Technologies and

237
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:26,759
those improved upon the micro Emulsion

238
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:29,278
Technologies but those were the late 90s

239
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:32,159
so again 20 years they've been around

240
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:34,980
and it I just I kept digging and it was

241
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:37,980
more and more of a mystery and so

242
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:40,139
um it took some I went into the patent

243
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,519
database and I was looking at the timing

244
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:43,139
of the patents to see when the

245
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,100
technology started first becoming

246
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:50,399
available and so you you had the Nano

247
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:52,879
nanotech patents in the late 90s started

248
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,879
coming around

249
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:58,319
um and I was very baffled and um it

250
00:09:56,039 --> 00:10:01,019
wasn't until I was reading some

251
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,540
um some papers by industrial Sono Sono

252
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:07,019
mechanics I believe is the company

253
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:10,919
um and everything became clear then and

254
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:14,459
what happened was is you had early uh

255
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:18,240
Technologies with so so no Emulsion is

256
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:20,759
basically so cannabis is is soluble in

257
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,959
oil not water so if you create a

258
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:24,299
beverage what you're doing is you're

259
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:26,819
taking a cannabis extract which is an

260
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:29,099
oil-based product and mixing in a

261
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:32,339
water-based beverage and so what happens

262
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:35,700
is is the canvas extract the oil stuff

263
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:38,459
was globbing in the beverage and it was

264
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:40,500
kind of sticking to the can and so that

265
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:42,659
was really problematic it wasn't mixing

266
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,759
up and if you take you know it didn't

267
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:46,439
taste very good the canvas extract is

268
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:49,740
very bitter

269
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:52,339
um and there's a big problem with it

270
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:57,240
because it's not homogeneous in the can

271
00:10:52,339 --> 00:11:00,300
if you have say a 10 milligram uh can of

272
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,759
uh a beverage and you drink half the can

273
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:05,578
you're not getting half the dose

274
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:07,679
and in canvas this is a big deal uh

275
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:11,519
where you need to be able to dose kind

276
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:14,519
of in a very predictable way and so

277
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,679
um in a classic Emulsion technology uh

278
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:18,419
the problem is as I said so the oils

279
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:19,559
globbing in the water and generally what

280
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:21,899
you want to do is you want to break up

281
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:24,239
the oil into smaller pieces so it mixes

282
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:27,179
more homogeneously

283
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:30,480
um in in the water and they couldn't get

284
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:32,159
that in cannabis and while what you can

285
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,959
do is you can shake the can very

286
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:36,719
vigorously and then it kind of you know

287
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:38,639
you get a nice Emulsion but then it very

288
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,980
quickly separates again so it wasn't

289
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:43,259
stable and so what a good Emulsion

290
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:46,379
technology will do it will do two things

291
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:48,720
it will break the Cannabis Globs into

292
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:51,360
very very small particles

293
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,000
but then importantly very importantly it

294
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,539
will coat each of the each of the

295
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,639
molecules or the particles rather

296
00:11:56,539 --> 00:12:03,000
in a substance called a surfactant or an

297
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:05,720
emulsifier and so by coating the small

298
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,039
particles then you keep them from

299
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:11,160
re-coalescing or re-separating out again

300
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:13,860
and so this is these two factors being

301
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:16,559
able to create small molecule sizes and

302
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:18,959
also coat them to keep them separate is

303
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:21,419
the challenge of the technology and the

304
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:25,500
micro Emulsion Technologies and the the

305
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:30,599
nanotech Technologies both were enabling

306
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:32,578
this but not very greatly so the earlier

307
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:36,420
Technologies what happens is they would

308
00:12:32,578 --> 00:12:38,578
put the surfactant into the the Cannabis

309
00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:41,039
and the beverage and it would cause the

310
00:12:38,578 --> 00:12:43,319
molecules to break up but you needed a

311
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:46,379
whole lot of surfactant to do this and

312
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:48,660
you needed more surfactant than the

313
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:50,600
cannabis extract concentrate in there

314
00:12:48,659 --> 00:12:54,360
which means

315
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:58,200
the the the uh surfactants don't taste

316
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:01,259
very good and so it just didn't work it

317
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:04,560
wasn't stable you could get stability

318
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:05,159
but it just it didn't taste good

319
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:07,559
um

320
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:09,299
and it was only and this is kind of the

321
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:11,039
big thing and this long-winded way of

322
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:13,199
getting there but the really big thing

323
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:15,719
is only very recently have they been

324
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,240
able to have these technologies that are

325
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,639
forcing rather than just kind of relying

326
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,759
on the chemical breakdown of the

327
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:26,399
particles into small sizes they're using

328
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:29,100
a technology to force

329
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:32,399
um the the breakup

330
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:34,259
of the cannabis oil into very small

331
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,600
particle sizes and by using the

332
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:38,939
technology to force the breakup they can

333
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,659
now use much much less surfactant on

334
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,540
there

335
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:45,059
and so now you have these very very

336
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:48,659
small particle sizes

337
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:50,159
um and much lower amounts of surfactants

338
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:52,980
and

339
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:55,980
um so the two now work together and it's

340
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:59,399
creating homogeneous beverages that are

341
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:01,800
translucent so they don't look Gloppy

342
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:02,940
um it's mixing up nicely and you're

343
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:05,099
getting

344
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:07,920
um very importantly in cannabis you're

345
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,600
getting not only better dosing so you

346
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:11,939
can drink half the can and get half the

347
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,700
content but also you're getting improved

348
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:17,339
bioavailability and traditionally in

349
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:20,399
cannabis if you use if you ingest

350
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:22,620
cannabis orally you get a really really

351
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,299
low bioavailability on the order of say

352
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:26,459
five percent

353
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:29,819
um but with these new technologies

354
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:32,278
you're by increasing by decreasing the

355
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,839
particle size you're getting it's it's

356
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:35,700
passing through your system it's not

357
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,680
getting destroyed in the stomach by the

358
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:41,519
acids and it's getting absorbed by your

359
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:43,979
intestines in a much better better so

360
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,278
um it's these technologies have only

361
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:51,740
been around for the last couple of years

362
00:14:46,278 --> 00:14:55,860
and it's creating a whole new areas for

363
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:58,259
Beverages and other forms of edible uh

364
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:00,300
cannabis products which I think is just

365
00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:01,559
going to cause explosive growth in the

366
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:03,479
future

367
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:05,518
yeah being able to feel the results

368
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,199
quicker and faster I think is the core

369
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,299
objective of a lot of these Brands and

370
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:11,399
it's no different that the most popular

371
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:13,259
brand that we know of is canned drinks

372
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:15,600
and they're using sources technology and

373
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:17,399
I think it seems to be that these brands

374
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,659
that create this Emulsion technology are

375
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:20,458
actually going to be some of the main

376
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:22,439
winners when it comes to the whole

377
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:24,719
entire industry

378
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,459
uh yeah I

379
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,339
they're

380
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:31,559
it appeals to both casual users the

381
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:33,959
whole like cocktail crowd who want to

382
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:37,500
use canvas like they use you know

383
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:40,619
alcoholic beverages but also buy the

384
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:43,139
whole medicinal group who want to you

385
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:45,959
know wrap and rate of onset wants to be

386
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:47,879
able to do very clean dosing

387
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:50,338
um and have very you know palatable

388
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:52,860
products

389
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:54,660
and before we finish up what are the

390
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,459
things you're looking forward to seeing

391
00:15:54,659 --> 00:15:57,958
in the industry happen over the next 12

392
00:15:56,458 --> 00:16:00,778
to 24 months do you think Federal

393
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:02,578
legalization is going to end up rocket

394
00:16:00,778 --> 00:16:05,600
boosting the industry and the technology

395
00:16:02,578 --> 00:16:05,599
into the next level

396
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:10,740
I

397
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:13,379
I was just reading this morning how

398
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:15,060
um they're talking about legalization by

399
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:17,100
the end of the year

400
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:19,319
um I don't know that it's going to

401
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:22,079
happen that quickly I think that there's

402
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:24,300
so much politics and there's so many so

403
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:26,039
many groups out there who have such a

404
00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:27,958
strong interest against canvas

405
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:29,698
legalization

406
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:32,039
um so I don't want to make any

407
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:36,120
predictions but I think it's going to

408
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:37,980
take longer than uh people hope

409
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,078
um I also want to note there's a lot of

410
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:42,539
talk about how the industry is going to

411
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:44,359
consolidate very quickly and this is

412
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:47,519
another area that I've been looking at

413
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:49,740
and I worry about competition I think

414
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,659
that we need we need all the little guys

415
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:53,940
out there we need the craft cannabis and

416
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:56,639
we need all the small businesses to

417
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:58,440
promote variety because Variety in

418
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,620
cannabis is so important for so many

419
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:04,318
reasons and all the regulations I see

420
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:06,058
have been very problematic and that they

421
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:08,519
create they create a very difficult

422
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:11,939
environment for small business is to

423
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:15,179
thrive so I hope the legislation helps

424
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:17,880
protect small businesses and creates a

425
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:19,380
viable environment for them

426
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,079
um

427
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:24,660
I also the other thing I really worry

428
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:27,119
about is that

429
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:29,279
um recreational or adult use cannabis is

430
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,798
going to swamp medical and it's going to

431
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:34,558
squeeze it out and I think that that

432
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:37,019
when Federal legalization comes they

433
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:40,558
really need to have a very clear curve

434
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:42,480
out to promote and maintain

435
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:44,399
um products and services geared

436
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:48,240
specifically towards medical cannabis

437
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,820
patients uh and and so those are I don't

438
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,259
know where regulations are going I don't

439
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:54,418
know when it's going to come I think

440
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:56,220
it's going to come later than people

441
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:58,679
think I think it's going to take longer

442
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:00,419
for the industry to settle than people

443
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:02,940
think

444
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:04,919
um and what I really really hope for is

445
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:07,440
protections for small businesses and

446
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:10,080
medical cannabis

447
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,519
yet it's been highly informative chattan

448
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:12,720
chi I could wish the episodes for 30

449
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:14,400
minutes long because there's so much

450
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,079
more we could touch on but I couldn't

451
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,480
agree with you more I think that the the

452
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:21,178
entrepreneurs with a strong brand and an

453
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,339
exact target consumer as opposed to a

454
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:24,538
scattergun blanket approach are going to

455
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:26,099
be the ones that are hopefully around

456
00:18:24,538 --> 00:18:28,440
for the long term

457
00:18:26,099 --> 00:18:31,678
you know what what I think could really

458
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:34,440
do it for them is by enabling direct to

459
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,179
Consumer uh marketing and I've been

460
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,798
reading also about the wine industry and

461
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:39,059
the wine industry they do direct to

462
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:41,879
Marketing sales and that's very

463
00:18:39,058 --> 00:18:43,918
important you know to to enable small

464
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,840
Wineries and I think that they really

465
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,020
need to do that and they've explicitly

466
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:50,639
prohibited at least here in California

467
00:18:48,019 --> 00:18:52,679
but I think they really need to enable

468
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,059
it and that that would really really

469
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:56,640
help

470
00:18:54,058 --> 00:18:58,319
yeah I couldn't agree with you more

471
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,000
um as I said I'd love to talk even

472
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:01,259
further with you but the episodes are

473
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,819
very short and brief to the point

474
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:03,960
hopefully we can touch base again in a

475
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:05,819
couple of months and we might have some

476
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,440
more information to be able to chat on

477
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:09,659
