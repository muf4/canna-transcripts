yeah thanks for having me yeah it's uh

23
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,960
really really interesting times

24
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:56,079
to do this these ventures and this this

25
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:59,280
business at the moment and uh

26
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,719
yeah my two-sided background it it is in

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,719
the professional sports and after that

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,000
in the business world and and then

29
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:09,519
uh i started my working career

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,920
in uh red bull so that's kind of

31
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:13,359
like the place where i got brainwashed

32
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,920
for the beverage industry

33
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:18,000
basically and then get excited about the

34
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,239
consumer brands and and cool stuff they

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,280
are

36
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:23,599
doing there so a few years

37
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,118
a little bit side steps to sales and

38
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:28,640

39
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:29,840
bigger corporations and 2018 i i started

40

42
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:39,680

43
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:42,319
beverage brand uh which has at first

44
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,960
nothing to do with uh hemp or cpd but it

45
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:45,118
was

46
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:47,280
on the product development pipeline and

47
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:47,920
we were pitching uh that venture to one

48
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,519
investor

49
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,799
and then uh our another founder of

50
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:55,759
youtube uh valid

51
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,759

52
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,399
ventures to the same investor and the

53
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,200
investor

54
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,359
uh built a bridge between us and we

55
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,399
started discussions and planning we

56
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:06,959
shared same vision uh about things and

57
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,520
then

58
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,478
everything clicked and we started the

59
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,760
new company

60
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,760
and then started to create the brand

61
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:16,959
brilliant amazing that's great stuff i

62
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,919
want to get on to the first

63
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,598
topic of conversation and it's the world

64
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,519
of cbd beverages

65
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:24,878
how do you see this at the moment we

66
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,319
obviously know there's a couple of big

67
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,159
big players that are coming to the fore

68
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:30,399
in america like kill cliff

69
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:31,598
and over here you see as we were talking

70
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,200
about there's a couple of brands coming

71
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:34,959
out of ireland and the uk do you see

72
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:36,000
other big players in europe that are

73
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,719
coming to the fore

74
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,639
or do you think you guys have a nice

75
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:41,519
exact target demographic that you're

76
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:45,119
going to

77
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,920
pitch your drink to yeah there is

78
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,759
a lot of players getting huge traction

79
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:50,479
in u.s side but i think their home

80
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:52,719
market is

81
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:53,919
is that big that they they are uh

82
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,318
focusing on on

83
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:57,598
there there's a lot to do in the u.s

84
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:00,639
side and then the

85
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:04,158
market is the most developed in europe

86
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:07,839
in in the uk uh but not too much

87
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:08,479
uh actions uh in in eu countries i would

88
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,878
say

89
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,919
uh and that's obviously because of the

90
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:13,679
regulation

91
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,679
uh we feel that we have a good thing

92
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,200
going on since we

93
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,439
uh are focusing more uh on the category

94
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,719
of

95
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,120
scent rings and the like the functional

96
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,080
and the

97
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,560
experiential brand of of the centerings

98
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,040
so

99
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,039
we are not too tied to the cbd

100
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:33,679
ingredients so we already have our first

101
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,318
product out which is cbd free but we are

102
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,920
still

103
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:39,439
uh 100 cbd brand so so that's the

104
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:42,798
competitive advantage we

105
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:45,598
we have and we have now time to

106
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,480
do our thing and then let's see what the

107
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:48,798
regulation

108
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:49,679
thing will be what's the schedule will

109
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,239
be in

110
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,360
eu but yeah the time is interesting we

111
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,319
really cannot know

112
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,280
what is happening in what time frame it

113
00:03:56,318 --> 00:03:59,438
really is yeah

114
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,840
do you see the drinks market i see a big

115
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:04,560
huge future for the nootropics

116
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,158
style drinks and i think cbd and a lot

117
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,759
of the uric cannabinoids and terpenes

118
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:09,840
even in the future are going to play a

119
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:11,598
big part in the range of products that

120
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,959
will be available to consumers

121
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:14,560
is that something that you guys are

122
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,399
keeping your eye on as well or is it

123
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,879
going to be laser focused on the cbd

124
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,879
industry

125
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:26,000
no we see it as just one

126
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,120
regular functional uh ingredient for

127
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,839
food and beverage

128
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,959
the cbd and then we look look around

129
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:32,560
with all the pro

130
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:34,638
ingredient innovations and the new

131
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,519
things which is which are coming

132
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,759
is it cannabis or or outside cannabis so

133
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:43,279
so we try to be innovative in a way

134
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:46,560
how we check out the product development

135
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:47,599
uh of course uh uh i think now now the

136
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,639
timing is great

137
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,199
for for focusing a little bit to cpd and

138
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,680
the

139
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,319
when the regulations go the regulation

140
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,519
comes

141
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:59,599
a little bit like uh behind so

142
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:00,879
now it now it's time to focus on on the

143
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,280
cbd and and then

144
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,159
later on to something else but it really

145
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:08,000
supports our

146
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:11,680
our brand and our functionality so so

147
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,519
but a lot of good things uh coming uh

148
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,038
innovation site in ingredients and in

149
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:17,519
technology which are

150
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:18,879
supporting these type of beverages

151
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:20,319
amazing it kind of leads me on to the

152
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:21,918
next topic i wanted to talk about and

153
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:23,199
it's sport and cannabis from somebody

154
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:25,839
who's an x-pro

155
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,439
sport athlete i think this is as you

156
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,119
said you guys are focusing on cbd we're

157
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:31,120
only at the tip of the market when it

158
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,038
really comes to this i see this being

159
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,000
cbd being an ingredient for a whole host

160
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:37,120
of products do you agree that within 24

161
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,720
months we're gonna see

162
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,319
some of the biggest sports stars in

163
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,960
europe being sponsored by various

164
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:46,560
different cbd brands

165
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:50,799
uh i believe so if and when the

166
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:53,839
regulation uh is clear and unsteady

167
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:57,360
i believe it's gonna happen it's gonna

168
00:05:53,839 --> 00:06:00,719
like come more normal and and then

169
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,120
i think cbd brands will act uh like

170
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,319
any other consumer brands and and then

171
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,478
linking themselves

172
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,759
to the persons who are representing the

173
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:09,918
same same values and

174
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,280
and then supporting the things so so

175
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:14,318
yeah for sure

176
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:17,359
uh it's interesting yeah

177
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,000
i've been checking out a little bit of

178
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,600
the

179
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,439
side of the like how anti-doping agency

180
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:28,319
will uh check this thing out uh if

181
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:29,519
i have understood correctly uh cpd is is

182
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,800
not prohibited

183
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:34,879
uh by the agency but you have to be

184
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,160
really careful uh which products you are

185
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:39,199
using so there's no

186
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,680
dhe or any any other like prohibited

187
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,400
uh ingredients in the products you are

188
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,478
using but

189
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:45,918
but yeah i think it will be pretty

190
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:49,038
common since uh

191
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:52,478
cbd use is supporting uh

192
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:54,159
sports and athletes happily yeah well

193
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:56,079
i think you see there's a huge amount

194
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,280
you've got that uh

195
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:00,240
where dr md or the cbd company over the

196
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:01,758
states there's a couple of them

197
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,800
sponsoring big huge athletes at this

198
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,560
stage and i think

199
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,160
once we get the regulations in place

200
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,199
here the extraction method should be

201
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,680
allowed

202
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,439
uh to for a sports athlete to consume

203
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,478
this without having any

204
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:15,680
remote uh hesitation

205
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:17,359
tell me this and tell me more i'm going

206
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,800
to go on to the next in this topic that

207
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,120
i wanted to talk to you about

208
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,199
is this industry ideal for the

209
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,800
entrepreneur mentality you're an ex-pro

210
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,759
sports club you understand the training

211
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,639
that's involved

212
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,000
how much kind of you're you're you're

213
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,439
pushing yourself on your own

214
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,720
steam as it were there's nobody coming

215
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:33,918
to you in the cannabis industry with a

216
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,000
manual to say

217
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:38,399
here you go these are the steps you need

218
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,639
to take to be able to do x y and z

219
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:41,598
like a lot of entrepreneurs you bury

220
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,280
down one anal

221
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:44,878
or one tunnel if that doesn't work you

222
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:46,638
come back you go down another tunnel if

223
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,560
it does work you make the tunnel bigger

224
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,840
do you see that the cannabis industry is

225
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,560
actually going to attract some of the

226
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:53,918
brightest

227
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,560
and best over the next decade uh

228
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:58,000
yeah i think so it's ideal at the moment

229
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,560
i think it will be

230
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,519
a more ideal at the moment there is a

231
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,720
significant

232
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:08,878
uh regulation a legal risk still so

233
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:11,919
i think uh a lot of people are avoiding

234
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,759
that risk still but um there's a lot of

235
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:16,079
uncertainty a lot a lot

236
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,439
a lot to do you you need to do a lot of

237
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:20,878
work a lot of research

238
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:24,639
uh you need to uh figure figure it out

239
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,639
like you say uh and then yeah it really

240
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,840
really you need that entrepreneur

241
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,478
mentality and

242
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:30,959
and the mindset to navigate in that type

243
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:32,958
of

244
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:34,000
business environment and i i believe

245
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:37,119
personally that my

246
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,839
my uh sports background will that and

247
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,278
is supporting and will support that yeah

248
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,399
now i'd agree i'm one of these people

249
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:46,000
who thrives on 14 16 hour days and

250
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,159
god help you if you're going up against

251
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,600
me and anything i'd be one of those so i

252
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:51,278
think the cannabis industry again it's

253
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,959
it's suiting a lot of people down to the

254
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:54,000
t because there's so much to learn and

255
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,199
if you're one of these people who's

256
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,639
hungry for knowledge and

257
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,720
making connections like we're doing

258
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:00,240
today then there's so many connections

259
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,759
to make it so much to learn that you've

260
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,360
got a good couple of years of

261
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:05,039
tiring yourself out with all the

262
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,360
information that's out there

263
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:08,879
have you been over to north america at

264
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,200
all and seen some of the setups over

265
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:11,519
there

266
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,879
have you guys just focused on uh

267
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,839
specific as you said you've got

268
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:17,039
expertise in the drink beverage world or

269
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,120
have you been over and seeing some of

270
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:23,519
the competitors over north america

271
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:25,360
uh not not in the past year obviously

272
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,278
because of the all the travel bans one

273
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,839
of the team members were visiting

274
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:30,399
or tried to visit uh the previous expo

275
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,560
west

276
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,440
but it was cancelled uh he was there

277
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:36,879
already

278
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:40,720
uh so so personally i haven't been

279
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:42,399
there now for uh three to four i think

280
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,800
three years

281
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,240
since i i've been in in the states

282
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:49,439
previously so i'm not

283
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:53,120
not yeah too familiar with those things

284
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:55,519
like uh okay yeah

285
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,440
but hopefully hopefully the travel bans

286
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,759
will go away and we are able to travel

287
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,000
more

288
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,600
so after that we need to head head to

289
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,440
u.s immediately

290
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,879
yeah yeah well i think everybody there's

291
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,760
going to be a hell of a year or two of

292
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:07,439
travel when this

293
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:09,120
is all over and done but i've got to

294
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,880
list the length of my arm of things that

295
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,039
i need to smoke and drink and eat over

296
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:14,240
the next 12 to 24 months as soon as i

297
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:16,319
get out of this so

298
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,159
i hope it goes well what's the industry

299
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,640
like for you guys over in

300
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:22,719
helsinki have you found that they're

301
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:25,838
complying with the european

302
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:28,480
regulations that got passed in 2019

303
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,480
or do you still think over in ireland

304
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,879
they're still enacting laws from the 70s

305
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,079
but

306
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:33,679
by the looks of things they haven't

307
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:35,439
caught up with europe what's it like for

308
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:37,439
you guys selling cbd products over there

309
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,920
and can you buy cbd flour

310
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,160
in helsinki is is there any dispensaries

311
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:45,120
that are selling cbd flour yet

312
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:47,039
no uh finland actually consider cpd as a

313
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,519
prescription drug

314
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:50,799
at the moment so it's it's really really

315
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,120
really uh

316
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:54,559
limited how you can buy an unused and

317
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,600
then it's actually

318
00:10:54,559 --> 00:11:01,039
a little bit against the ruling which uh

319
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:04,399
the court of trust is eu i gave

320
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:07,039
end of last year so it's difficult

321
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,000
there's a huge stigma around the whole

322
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:11,199
cannabis

323
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,078
and old-fashioned legislation around it

324
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,040
in finland it actually goes uh also in

325
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:17,278
sweden

326
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:18,159
and uh yeah there was actually one

327
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:21,278
article

328
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:22,159
uh in the past weekend that does um like

329
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:24,399
a general

330
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:25,360
pension fund uh which is investing uh

331
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,480
people's money

332
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:31,680
for the pension uh things and

333
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:35,839
i think it was like 63 percent of

334
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:38,719
of uh uh the people in finland said that

335
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,160
there's no way we wanna our money to be

336
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,680
invested in cannabis

337
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:46,319
but uh only 30 said that

338
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:48,078
uh it's not cool to invest in alcohol so

339
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,639
alcohol is really really fine

340
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:51,599
uh considered as a sustainable

341
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,000
investment uh

342
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,920
uh they invest those companies and then

343
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,200
cannabis is seen like an illegal

344
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:59,278
criminal business

345
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,560
and that that stigma we need to get away

346
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:03,838
and and that's why

347
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:05,439
why we try to be really active uh

348
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,959
discussing in different challenge

349
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,880
channels and and then

350
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:11,199
educating people that this is actually

351
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:13,519
pretty legit thing and it's called

352
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,639
called legal cannabis industry for a

353
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,639
reason there's a legal

354
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,839
in front of it so it's not criminal it's

355
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,759
not illegal

356
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,040
and then it's really big business in the

357
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:24,000
world and we should

358
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:25,120
consider it uh that way also here in

359
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,360
finland but we are

360
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,240
behind what comes to regulation and

361
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,720
development

362
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,240
and then the stigma is real well

363
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,360
hopefully now these conversations i'm

364
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,039
going to have a good few more with

365
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,360
people around europe that will be able

366
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:38,879
to

367
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:41,278
coalesce together and create a a unified

368
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:41,600
group that can basically fund campaigns

369
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:42,879
because

370
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,959
the one thing i've noticed from around

371
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,958
the world is there is money funding

372
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:48,319
anti-cannabis campaigns where the

373
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,278
it comes from and all that kind of stuff

374
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,278
is another issue

375
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:53,039
but there is most certainly money behind

376
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:54,399
it and i think the whole industry need

377
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:55,599
to get together and start

378
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,839
as opposed to just telling everybody

379
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,800
this is a miracle planned doing proper

380
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,240
kind of

381
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:02,078
advertising campaigns and marketing

382
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,600
campaigns and putting somebody who's

383
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:04,559
sick who's getting this medicine as

384
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,879
opposed to

385
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:08,078
the cool people trying to say oh 420 is

386
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:09,519
where it should be legalized it should

387
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:11,919
be we should be putting somebody

388
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,679
having shiver and panic attacks on an ad

389
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:14,719
and then cbd oil is the one thing that

390
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:16,479
stops them because i think

391
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,920
you need to play fire with fire at this

392
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,200
stage but it's great to see you guys

393
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:20,799
doing your great work

394
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,399
and i hope we're going to be able to

395
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,799
chat again over the next couple of

396
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,399
months

397
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:26,399
and keep in contact and build this

398
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,320
relationship as we go forward

399
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,440
yeah definitely that's what we try to do

400
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,600
and and then we like

401
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,639
networking we like to share our things

402
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,839
our contacts

403
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:39,120
if we can help in any way yeah we are

404
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:41,040
uh yeah approachable guys so

405
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,720
everybody just can contact us on

406
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:43,360
linkedin or or something like that and

407
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,959
then let's

408
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:49,360
chat chat and i really hope that uh some

409
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:50,078
big bigger countries and universities uh

410
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,240
take uh

411
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:53,198
the research uh thing seriously

412
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,879
seriously

413
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:56,399
since uh i think there's a lot of

414
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:58,958
research uh going on

415
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,519
around but if it's communicated through

416
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:02,078
the

417
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,799
uh industry channels it's uh not so

418
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:05,359
credible

419
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:06,719
but if the countries and governments and

420
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,639
big universities are

421
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,639
are communicating at the research

422
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,360
results it's it's credible and and i

423
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,159
think

424
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,839
uh yeah yes i couldn't agree with you

425
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:17,120
more

426
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:19,120
research research and development and

427
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,480
good financial reports are what we need

428
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,600
to be able to convince people who don't

429
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,560
have a clue what they're talking about

430
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,680
in this industry look

431
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:25,198
there's so much money we can make this

432
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:26,559
many jobs we can make and this is how

433
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,679
safe it is according to the most

434
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,439
stringent tests
