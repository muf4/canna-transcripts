to give everybody an overview of quick

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,000
30 seconds of where you are in your

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,219
business world I know you covered a

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,079
couple of different topics sure so my

11
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:36,299
name is Alex Popov I'm a U.S Air Force

12
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,219
veteran I'm originally got into cannabis

13
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:40,558
when I found actually just using

14
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,840
cannabis socially with friends I wasn't

15
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:45,179
needing pain medication as much for my

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,480
back I've had several back surgeries and

17
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:50,820
so over time in early 2018 I come to

18
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:53,038
learn about all the research and all the

19
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:56,280
amazing benefits of cannabis and how we

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,219
had been lied to for so long about the

21
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,079
benefits worldwide so I got involved

22
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,120
with advocacy work I did a bit of

23
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,320
digital marketing I got a Bachelor's

24
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,840
degree in digital marketing kind of

25
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:09,179
learned that marketing is great it's an

26
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,560
essential component uh it just didn't

27
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,299
come naturally I didn't have a passion

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,340
for it even with cannabis and the moment

29
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:16,020
that I began my uh business intelligence

30
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,060
master's degree

31
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:20,099
um this January I started connecting the

32
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,140
dots with cannabis and data I started

33
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:23,399
talking to some of the leading cannabis

34
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,719
data companies

35
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,580
um because it their their their

36
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,560
employees were kind enough to reach out

37
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:29,640
to me and say hey here's what we do you

38
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,560
know when you graduate if you're

39
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,060
interested in this type of work so I

40
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,079
kind of got a little peek inside of

41
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,240
what's going on at some of these

42
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,700
companies I've talked to some of the

43
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,500
license holders that are going through

44
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,000
an upgrade process with their data

45
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,459
system and seeing under the hood of it

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,099
so to speak and uh yeah I just really

47
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:48,839
love this stuff so that's about me I'm a

48
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:51,000
veteran that's found cannabis has helped

49
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,100
me personally I've gotten involved in

50
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,899
advocacy and now I'm pivoting from

51
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:57,118
marketing into the data analytics and

52
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,280
business intelligence okay incredible

53
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:01,140
stuff yeah I think the sector you're in

54
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,540
now is going to be a Cornerstone of this

55
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,159
industry over the next decade or so and

56
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,020
people like yourselves are going to be

57
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,179
the next big names did you start hearing

58
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:10,560
in the industry can you give me an

59
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,080
overview is there any big business

60
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,780
that's used in data analytic property

61
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,760
like obviously you're using whether it's

62
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,739
for marketing improving that whether

63
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,719
it's in product Improvement and research

64
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:23,280
which of the big companies like is the

65
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:25,020
cure relief green told many of the guys

66
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,659
that you know that have actual data

67
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:30,239
departments in there in their companies

68
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:32,280
right so I um I don't know as much about

69
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,259
the MSO surprisingly but I will say I

70
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,818
will speculate widely that they do

71
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:37,979
probably have their own data departments

72
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:39,659
I I've seen um people where it says like

73
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:42,119
data analysts and it's at one of the big

74
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:43,680
msos like you described um but I've also

75
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,000
seen it this is what gets me more

76
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,800
excited is I've seen it at like the

77
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,539
mid-tier level as well yeah and I say

78
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,099
mid-tier like you know maybe they're in

79
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:52,019
two states but they're not a cure leaf

80
00:02:50,098 --> 00:02:54,119
and they're in like more than 10 or

81
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:55,500
whatever they've got so

82
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,659
um and these folks will they'll still

83
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,699
have a full data section um they may not

84
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:01,859
use like the big data tools and all the

85
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:04,318
stuff that you hear about in Academia

86
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:07,080
and with Enterprise level like forty

87
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:09,598
five hundreds or or the big msos but

88
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,580
they're you know they'll do they'll go

89
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:13,378
beyond using an Excel spreadsheet by all

90
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,760
means and I've talked to some of these

91
00:03:13,378 --> 00:03:17,518
folks it's incredible the analysis

92
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:19,139
they're doing and it's everything from

93
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,819
um what's our best selling product you

94
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:23,158
know because your point of sale systems

95
00:03:20,818 --> 00:03:24,899
most of them that I know of will give

96
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:26,818
you basic business intelligence

97
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,640
dashboards they'll say you know here's

98
00:03:26,818 --> 00:03:30,958
your busiest time of day here's your

99
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:32,639
best-selling product here's here's the

100
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,500
skus that are upcoming the up and coming

101
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:36,000
they'll have all kinds of features but

102
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,199
the best data is your own data and you

103
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,699
don't really know what where they're

104
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,139
driving this information and it's not

105
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:42,179
granular enough because you can't

106
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:43,139
manipulate it your own way most of the

107
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,060
time

108
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:46,798
um so I am seeing some of these smaller

109
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:49,680
operators actually using tools they're

110
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,840
not just relying on uh you know what

111
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,780
their POS has out of the box

112
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,239
and is there a specific model of

113
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,739
gatherings the the data that they're

114
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,378
using themselves or is it basically

115
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:03,180
first-hand knowledge or social media

116
00:04:01,378 --> 00:04:05,158
what would you think is the most

117
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,620
advantageous route to get a data if

118
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:09,359
you're an entrepreneur

119
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:11,158
I would say a combination right so you

120
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,140
always want to have this what we refer

121
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:15,719
to and I know from academics they'll

122
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:17,819
teach us is a single source of the truth

123
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:19,620
because you don't want you don't want

124
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:21,180
three different top selling products

125
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,579
unless it's different categories you

126
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,840
want you want one source of the truth

127
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:26,159
however

128
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:28,799
um what I would say is you'll see

129
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,960
everything from scraping like websites

130
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,600
and collecting the price points so a

131
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:35,879
local dispensary retailer might say okay

132
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,300
the average price per gram for this

133
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:41,219
strain even is four dollars or fifteen

134
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,840
dollars or something in that range which

135
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,080
can vary widely so that's why they would

136
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:47,879
want to know exactly what

137
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:49,918
um that price point is it could also be

138
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:51,839
something where they need to use

139
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:54,060
um like the the AI and language learning

140
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,399
models we talked about before we started

141
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:59,160
where they're going to do sentiment

142
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:01,258
evaluations where they'll scrape social

143
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,900
media sites and then they'll analyze

144
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:06,300
from everything to emojis to text to

145
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:08,159
determine what sentiment the community

146
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,660
has on their brand and on their products

147
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,979
and I would be surprised if like you

148
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,460
said purely from these other companies

149
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:16,680
aren't doing that

150
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:18,719
100 I think in this modern day and age

151
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,759
now you didn't you don't really need to

152
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,199
spend half a million on wages for data

153
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:24,840
scientists to come in and basically

154
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:26,639
analyze data I think you can have a

155
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:30,478
number of proficient people on these new

156
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:32,220
AI programs and plugins to be able to at

157
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,740
least get your your start in the game

158
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,900
but data I'm sure is going to influence

159
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:39,360
when Federal legalization comes in the

160
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:41,279
states like what every other industries

161
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,060
does a handful of dominant Brands and

162
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:44,399
they

163
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:47,399
Target their products and their nuanced

164
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:49,019
advertising various the sectors so kept

165
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:51,918
building that data from the ground up is

166
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:53,939
probably a parliament now to people

167
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,538
right like there's

168
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:59,219
um

169
00:05:54,538 --> 00:06:01,800
the co-founder of uh uh pardon me I miss

170
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,300
so I missed out my companies there what

171
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,038
I meant to say was that there there are

172
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,720
companies out there where they're

173
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:08,399
they're taking feedback on certain

174
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,100
products and certain strains and using

175
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:13,379
Ai and using data analytic data

176
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,120
analytics and Big Data tools to

177
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:16,500
determine like how is this product

178
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,180
affecting people are there certain

179
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,038
terpenes giving certain effects I mean

180
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,418
and there is just dozens and dozens if

181
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:22,620
not hundreds of different apps and

182
00:06:21,418 --> 00:06:24,839
companies

183
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,519
um approaching this I'm not an expert on

184
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:28,439
any of those that's just one like the

185
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:31,079
thing about data is when we say data we

186
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:33,779
can talk about cannabis research data we

187
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:35,219
can talk about retail data like you

188
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:37,500
mentioned the big business side of

189
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,940
things it just hits every facet that's

190
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,680
what I love is you're never going to get

191
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:42,600
bored or tired of it because you can go

192
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,759
in so many directions

193
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,500
one of the things about the data side of

194
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:48,600
things we kind of see it over in Europe

195
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,720
here that people cherry picking specific

196
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,939
data to kind of suit their own end

197
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,919
valuation or whatever it may be the

198
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:58,199
amount of this country's got to be worth

199
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:59,758
this amount of money boy this year uh

200
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,879
claims that I've seen over the last

201
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,379
number of years and it's one of those

202
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,659
ones do you see that as much in America

203
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:07,879
as well

204
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,800
all right

205
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:12,418
I'm trying to find the words here I

206
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,180
don't know how it is in Europe so I

207
00:07:12,418 --> 00:07:17,279
can't make a comparison but I'll uh I'll

208
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,478
say it's probably worse here even

209
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:20,279
without knowing whatsoever and that's

210
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:22,139
not that's not a data-driven decision

211
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:24,598
that's just my own bias from being an

212
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:26,460
American in America uh we're terrible at

213
00:07:24,598 --> 00:07:28,379
that and I I know that I can I can say

214
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:30,120
this rather than compare

215
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:31,500
um I see it with these large companies

216
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,098
that's why I was

217
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,839
um

218
00:07:32,098 --> 00:07:35,219
apprehensive to be like oh yeah they're

219
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:39,299
doing great working data I'm sure

220
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:40,680
they're kicking but in data but uh but I

221
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,060
want to see the smaller operators and

222
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,560
everyone have a chance to because like

223
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,120
you said they can cherry picked out and

224
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,038
say look we're the safest cleanest

225
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,598
product or this but some of that just

226
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:51,120
comes from being the biggest voice and

227
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:52,579
having the most money in the room

228
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,259
yeah

229
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:56,519
do what you want anyone can but

230
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:58,919
especially when you have the money to

231
00:07:56,519 --> 00:08:00,839
kind of shape perception around it

232
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:02,159
yeah I couldn't agree with you more I

233
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:03,779
think the only way that you can actually

234
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,720
really trust that is if it's been

235
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:09,000
gathered at the source itself and you

236
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,520
can amalgamate data then to make larger

237
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,500
reports but I think looking from afar

238
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,758
and taking a couple of people a couple

239
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,379
of different papers and a couple of

240
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:19,080
different numbers and translating them

241
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:20,699
into your uh let's say document that's

242
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:22,378
going to give data to somebody else it

243
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:26,038
seems to be the model that's been used

244
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:28,439
so far so is there a value and is there

245
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:30,300
a company in the US that has gone state

246
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:33,139
by state and has gathered data whether

247
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:35,700
it's via medium of music events or

248
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:37,860
consumption parties or whatever it may

249
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,719
be is that most to me that seems like

250
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:42,180
the smartest route for a company to do

251
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:44,820
and then translate that data back into a

252
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:46,679
software platform that like a tableau

253
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,240
that somebody can easily Digest

254
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:50,099
yeah exactly

255
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,240
um I again I'd be shocked if they're not

256
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,519
doing that

257
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,139
um that is definitely that's I learned

258
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,820
about this with in marketing where you

259
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:58,199
know you're doing your um your focus

260
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,120
groups and getting feedback from your

261
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,220
target audience and saying hey do the

262
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,019
consent you sometimes

263
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,160
um with with innovation in general you

264
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:07,019
don't really know what the consumer

265
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:08,639
wants and there's always competing views

266
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:10,080
like the view of oh that you need to

267
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:11,639
show the consumer what they want they

268
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,399
don't know maybe that works in some tech

269
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:16,559
applications but cannabis you know um

270
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,379
people know they like cannabis but it is

271
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:21,838
complex so I think it comes down to

272
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:23,639
um looking at things like uh

273
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,080
like why

274
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:27,000
um why are we collecting the data like

275
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,639
Define the problem and then go out and

276
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,200
don't just generate groups but

277
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:33,179
um like you said put it in the table

278
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,680
I'll put it in the power bi power bi is

279
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:36,000
the one that I'm familiar with and

280
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:38,338
there's looker and there's tons of

281
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,980
visualization tools that people can use

282
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:42,779
because data doesn't have I just said

283
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,980
this to my girlfriend before the call I

284
00:09:42,778 --> 00:09:45,659
was like you know I'm gonna try to touch

285
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,659
on the fact that people think data is

286
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:50,939
all uh numbers and it's all quantitative

287
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:52,919
but data can be qualitative when you

288
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,740
take it when you can transform it and

289
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:57,179
put it into a format that the computer

290
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,680
programs can analyze and that's when you

291
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:00,539
drive the most value when you talk to

292
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:02,338
people and say well how is this working

293
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:05,458
for you what do you think instead of

294
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:08,820
just Mass surveys the the spray and pray

295
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:11,338
approach like is not my Approach

296
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:13,320
yeah no it's the undertale to 100 people

297
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:16,140
in 10 different cities and get their

298
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,820
opinion then send out 10 000 surveys

299
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:19,620
that get filled out by a much smaller

300
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,300
group of people the data that's

301
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,620
recovered on the ground I think is where

302
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:25,139
there's huge value in the Cannabis

303
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,539
industry over the next decade

304
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:28,860
no absolutely I keep looking to my left

305
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:30,958
over here apologize I've got my other

306
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:32,879
screen here I have a uh I'm gonna send

307
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:35,099
you this after our call so you can maybe

308
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:37,080
screenshot or or uh just for your own

309
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,600
viewing it's a it's an analytics

310
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:42,720
dashboard actually uh that that the

311
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,540
Oklahoma medical marijuana use uh agency

312
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,040
has commissioned a contractor to put

313
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:49,679
together and it's just beautiful because

314
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:51,599
it shows you the density of licenses Per

315
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:54,659
County it shows you the total commercial

316
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,480
license Trend um over time it shows you

317
00:10:54,659 --> 00:10:59,879
things like total licenses uh by

318
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:03,240
category from cultivation to retail

319
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:04,620
process lab and um this is exactly the

320
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,240
type of stuff that I'm learning to do

321
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,100
and I think is so helpful because from

322
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,919
an investment point of view you can look

323
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:13,079
at this and see is more cannabis being

324
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:15,599
harvested month over month is there more

325
00:11:13,078 --> 00:11:17,278
Harvest total like you can get very

326
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,720
granular and look at the specifics and

327
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:20,338
get a better idea of what's happening

328
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,019
and then you like we talked about then

329
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:23,279
you combine that by talking to people in

330
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:25,139
different counties and different

331
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:27,240
cultivators different license holders

332
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:28,319
and say how do you think the Market's

333
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,000
going that's that's business

334
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,140
intelligence and data analytics working

335
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,320
together

336
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:37,259
um and and still being a human being so

337
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,579
so tell me this um give me a quick

338
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:41,578
overview of what's happening in Oklahoma

339
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:44,519
how is restrictive is to sector there

340
00:11:41,578 --> 00:11:46,199
and how well is it working or not

341
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:47,879
working

342
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,879
all right so that's a great question so

343
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:52,500
it's um it's chaotic in many ways as you

344
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:54,299
can imagine people call it the wild west

345
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,879
but like when we look at the data you

346
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:59,219
can see it's it's not uh it's not all

347
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:01,559
cartels and organized crime um those

348
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:03,899
those elements will exist

349
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:05,759
um most likely everywhere in the world

350
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:08,458
um at all times to some degree hopefully

351
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:10,379
to a lesser degree most of the time when

352
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:12,059
you have a new market people are going

353
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:13,799
to try to take advantage of it and

354
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:16,078
that's what's happened here and that's

355
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:18,778
what happens everywhere now since this

356
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:20,458
is the most conservative read Republican

357
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:22,860
state it's ironic that it has the most

358
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:25,078
Progressive and liberal uh program for

359
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,820
cannabis so what you see is you see the

360
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:28,679
state Regulators there's a disconnect

361
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,720
between the industry and The Regulators

362
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:32,519
like in most places as well and you'll

363
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,079
see that the state wants there to be

364
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:36,839
less licenses like right now I'm looking

365
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:41,039
at the dashboard and there's something

366
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:43,260
like 11 000 or 13 000 licenses there's 8

367
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:45,179
000 cultivators alone and there's no

368
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:46,860
plant limits so they can all 8 000

369
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:48,958
Growers grow as many plants as they want

370
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:53,579
and our population somewhere like 3

371
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:54,838
Point uh four uh million stores I own's

372
00:12:53,578 --> 00:12:56,759
over there at the moment

373
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:59,639
part of me what would be the prize

374
00:12:56,759 --> 00:13:02,220
program or price per ounce

375
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:04,139
oh that's the thing too so price per

376
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:07,259
pound per outdoor people are saying

377
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:09,360
anything from 250 to 400 uh which is

378
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:11,159
extremely low yeah and that's when you

379
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,440
see one thousand three thousand four

380
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:15,419
thousand even in other states but um

381
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,920
it's competitive so that so that's again

382
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:18,899
when we look at the data there's going

383
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:21,539
to be outliers there's still people that

384
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:23,458
can get more much much more for their

385
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:25,199
quality outdoor and for Quality indoor

386
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:27,179
and there's probably people selling for

387
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,459
50 bucks a pound too if it's very low

388
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:32,519
quality going right to extraction there

389
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:35,159
is um a major glut of biomass of

390
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:37,379
cannabis biomass and uh when I again I

391
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:40,500
look at the data here there's less and

392
00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:42,720
less Harvest month over month and that's

393
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,759
not a bad thing I love The Growers I

394
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,980
want them to win and there needs to be

395
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:48,659
some there needs to be a balance and the

396
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:50,700
market it's not a free market because

397
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:52,919
you have Kansas and Texas Louisiana all

398
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:55,079
our bordering states that and Arkansas

399
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:58,139
even that have more restrictive or no

400
00:13:55,078 --> 00:13:59,638
cannabis legal at all so so people will

401
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:01,919
produce product where it's affordable

402
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:03,899
and sell it where it's expensive

403
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:06,299
that kind of sums up the market but it's

404
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:07,799
good for patients the prices are low so

405
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:09,719
price per pound like you said is that so

406
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:11,639
as a patient I can get an eighth from

407
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,379
somewhere from five dollars to fifty

408
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:16,860
dollars it depends on the quality level

409
00:14:13,379 --> 00:14:19,320
I can pay 170 an ounce and get very good

410
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:21,539
quality cannabis uh and that's good for

411
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,860
patients so so I rant a lot but I want

412
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:24,838
to give you the completion oh wait

413
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:27,778
that's brilliant yeah that's a fantastic

414
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:29,040
information and it it's been amazing

415
00:14:27,778 --> 00:14:30,778
talk with you we're just coming up on

416
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:32,458
the 15 minutes here hopefully we get to

417
00:14:30,778 --> 00:14:34,439
do a party with this conversation after

418
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:37,679
you've finished all the exams and

419
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:39,360
whatnot and uh we can deep dive into

420
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:40,919
this industry because as I said I think

421
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,360
this is going to be a Cornerstone at the

422
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:43,979
Cannabis industry and anybody who

423
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,720
doesn't know how to mix business

424
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:48,720
intelligence with data gathering on

425
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,278
their uh at source will be the losers in

426
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,259
this game but thank you very much Alex

427
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:54,480
for now mate

428
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:56,278
no thank you very much um you summed it

429
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,199
up well very more succinct than I could

430
00:14:56,278 --> 00:14:59,958
but um thank you for having me I know

431
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:02,819
I'd love to come back when I'm either

432
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:05,099
employed or graduated or both hopefully

433
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:06,360
yeah sounds like a plan made you have a

434
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,700
great week and I will chat to you soon

435
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:12,109
