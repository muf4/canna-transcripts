which is the representative body of

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:17,640

just a quick word about the Inc V8 it is

18
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,480
the representative Association again of

19
00:00:54,238 --> 00:01:00,419
lawyers who operate in the Cannabis

20
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:03,299
space we've now I think over a thousand

21
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:06,659
lawyers uh spread across North America

22
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:10,079
and Europe and Beyond and so today's

23
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:12,900

24
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:16,618
European legal and Regulatory

25
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,659
environment in 2023 I don't need to

26
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:20,099
introduce myself again I think most of

27
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:23,040
you are familiar with me at this point

28
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:24,959
probably sick of me but uh anyway the

29
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,420
format for today is we have the

30
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:30,239
presentations from our speakers and then

towards the end we have a instance and

32
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:37,379

information for you we only have 15

40
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,180
minutes

41
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:58,379
please stop me if I'm getting too long

42
00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:01,320
here and yeah let's see what we where we

43
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:02,759
know what we can do here okay I'm

44
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:04,500
talking about a little bit about ham

45
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,200
medical and adult use cannabis in

46
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,259
Germany I want to give you a little

47
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:12,420
overview in regulatory overview as you

48
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:13,619
might know my now the Germany has come

49
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:18,738
to legalize

50
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:20,939
in the uh next coming month and the

51
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:24,239
Coalition agreement of the new

52
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:26,340
government in 2021 so they agreed on

53
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,099
Distributing

54
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,959
cannabis

55
00:02:28,098 --> 00:02:33,299
recreational Cannabis to adults in

56
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,300
licensed shops that was the goal of the

57
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:39,180
new government so we had a one year of

58
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:43,019
intense debates on how to do that but

59
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:45,599
the uh four and first and foremost goal

60
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:48,480
is Health protection it's the primary

61
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:49,979
goal so if you think the calories in

62
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:51,959
legalization in Germany you have to

63
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:55,199
think Health protection at the same time

64
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:57,300
every decision you make you have to keep

65
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,359
that goal in mind

66
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:03,120
as well as child and youth protection

67
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:06,360
and product quality and productive

68
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,000
engine and of course will be fight

69
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,239
against the illegal market and crime

70
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,699
displacement

71
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:18,239
this is the magic number we estimated

72
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:20,359
amount of 400 tons plus X of dried

73
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,819
flowers alone from the German Market

74
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,680
probably 500 tons if the tourists are

75
00:03:23,818 --> 00:03:29,419
allowed to purchase the recreational

76
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,980
Cannabis which means we have a lot of

77
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:34,378
gram 400 million

78
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:38,098
and for

79
00:03:34,378 --> 00:03:42,560
a billion dollar market plus X so it's

80
00:03:38,098 --> 00:03:42,560
extreme huge Market we expect

81
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:47,878
compared to the medical Market we

82
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:52,378
imported Germany about the 25 tons of

83
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:55,560
dried flowers in 2022 so then you see

84
00:03:52,378 --> 00:03:56,939
how much of the Cannabis is needed for

85
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,658
the German mark

86
00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:02,280
uh the problem is how to secure the

87
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:04,139
supply chain for medical for

88
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,539
recreational cannabis in in Germany

89
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:09,298
there was one proposition by the bean

90
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:11,519
party that it is limited to Farmers not

91
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:13,200
a good idea outdoor cultivation in

92
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,539
Germany is it possible at all under

93
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:18,120
these climate conditions do you have the

94
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:20,279
white genetics before that you see that

95
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,740
this is possible in Switzerland but on a

96
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:25,138
large scale in Germany I think it's

97
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,300
questionable indoor cultivation on the

98
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:30,360
other hand is extremely energy intensive

99
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:32,639
climate protection aspects you have to

100
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,740
consider maybe a glass house production

101
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,740
is that a middle ground is that the

102
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:40,560
middle way how to secure production in

103
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:42,660
Germany all questions are still open or

104
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:47,939
still debating they're still debated

105
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:49,919
and yeah the Imports is another question

106
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:51,839
it's another problem

107
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:54,060
um when you want to import your

108
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,179
immigration cannabis to Germany you have

109
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,860
to deal with the single convention

110
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:01,079
one proposition is to terminate the

111
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:04,620
single convention and re-entry under

112
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:06,180
reservation of cannabis like Olivia did

113
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,300
for the coca leaves

114
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:12,060
or you can think about the interstate

115
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:14,579
modification procedure without the

116
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,860
enunciation of the single convention

117
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:20,459
and with the conclusion of trade

118
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:23,879
agreements between the states some call

119
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:25,859
it the most elegant way out but then you

120
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:27,418
have to identify of course potential

121
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:30,360
international trading partners maybe

122
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:33,418
like Canada or Uruguay uh

123
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:37,020
but the problem is these agreements take

124
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:39,000
a long time so maybe it's two years

125
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:40,740
three years four years it's very

126
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,699
complicated to agree on such an

127
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:47,400
international trade treaty

128
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:49,400
and this doesn't solve the problem of a

129
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:53,339
product availability in Germany

130
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:56,038
and we have the EU law just to

131
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:59,638
scratch that there is this framework

132
00:05:56,038 --> 00:06:04,139
decision which obliges European member

133
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:07,680
states to prohibit and to um to prohibit

134
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:10,319
the trade of cannabis as long as it is

135
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,978
without authorization and now we have

136
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:16,978
legal Scholars saying if you legalize

137
00:06:13,978 --> 00:06:19,099
nationally domestically it is with

138
00:06:16,978 --> 00:06:22,258
authorization okay

139
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:25,259
but another point is Imports and foreign

140
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:28,319
trade agreements is that under EU

141
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:31,560
restriction this does did the member

142
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,580
states delegate this competence to the

143
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,819
EU

144
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:38,219
so everything is highly disputed in

145
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:39,780
these every every question if

146
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,460
determination is possible if an

147
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:45,000
interesting modification procedure is

148
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:49,258
possible because the single convention

149
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,538
was agreed on before this Arctic 241 and

150
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:53,819
so it's really hard to get a way through

151
00:06:51,538 --> 00:06:56,339
there

152
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:59,340
so the German government came up with an

153
00:06:56,339 --> 00:07:03,060
idea with this so-called interpretive

154
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:05,698
interpretative statement they issued a

155
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:08,038
key Point paper in October and

156
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:10,560
everything I tell us about the status of

157
00:07:08,038 --> 00:07:13,139
October okay we have

158
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,538
the end of February no the major

159
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:17,340
developments coming up in March so

160
00:07:15,538 --> 00:07:20,279
forgive me if my predictions are

161
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:23,698
obsolete in in three weeks

162
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:24,719
um but what is that this interpretative

163
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:27,240
statement

164
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,400
so legalization under strict conditions

165
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,978
of State regulation and Improvement of

166
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:33,959
health and use protection is compatible

167
00:07:31,978 --> 00:07:40,318
with the goals of the drug conventions

168
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:42,899
from 61 72 and 88. and the government is

169
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,300
invoking the German legal order the case

170
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:47,219
law of the Supreme Court and particular

171
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:50,699
declaration at the time of the

172
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:52,800
ratification of the 1988 agreement

173
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:55,259
the aforementioned grounds of a legal

174
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:59,460
order are subject to change and exactly

175
00:07:55,259 --> 00:08:02,660
this change has happened now in 2022 and

176
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:04,859
3 right now so

177
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:08,039
and they are not talking about

178
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:09,360
terminating the single convention or

179
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:10,680
they're not talking about right now

180
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,620
about Interstate multiplication

181
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:16,860
procedures or all these legs to take a

182
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:20,220
Firm Stance and say we interpret the

183
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:22,979
treaties that legalization is better for

184
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:24,780
our people is better for our community

185
00:08:22,978 --> 00:08:27,360
and

186
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:29,459
can achieve further more Health

187
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,979
protection yeah

188
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:34,139
the consequences that the calculation

189
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:37,019
must take place in Germany No Imports

190
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:39,418
for the time being so the 400 500 tons

191
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:41,939
have to be produced have to be

192
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:43,500
cultivated in Germany as it stands right

193
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,000
now

194
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,458
the the

195
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,559
um this is the interpretative statement

196
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:51,778
is discussed with the EU commission

197
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:55,018
right now and they're trying to find a

198
00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:56,639
solution for for that

199
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:57,539
okay

200
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:00,240
um

201
00:08:57,539 --> 00:09:03,480
there's also discussed right now in Plan

202
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,539
B Plan B would be decriminalization of

203
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:09,360
cannabis of recreational Cannabis the

204
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:11,939
allowance of homegrown and Collective

205
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:15,200
homegraph and cannabisotic flaps this is

206
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:19,260
privileged under a year under the year

207
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:21,180
U.N treaties and under Euler but this is

208
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:22,559
not the goal of the government the goal

209
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:25,439
of the government as I explained earlier

210
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:26,518
was licensed stores and controlled

211
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,100
quality

212
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:31,139
and to really assure consumer protection

213
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,019
through tested products in a regulated

214
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:35,699
market

215
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:38,519
okay so I think these interpretation

216
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,560
solution is a bold step like Uruguay

217
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:43,259
invoked human rights and they still

218
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:45,079
stand they still have a Firm Stance on

219
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:48,179
these human rights

220
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:51,000
interpretation similar to Canada

221
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:54,719
the first development of course remains

222
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,519
to be seen it when and a new level and

223
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,680
the health Minister wants to have an

224
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:01,320
European expertise which is also

225
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:04,919
published with the first draft in March

226
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:08,278
to convince the other EU member states

227
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:11,099
that the German Way is the better way

228
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:12,899
and we have the federal drug

229
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:16,440
commissioner he is traveling all over

230
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:19,559
Europe and he's in talks with all the

231
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:22,260
other health ministers because

232
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:25,319
the Luxembourg Malta Czech Republic

233
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:27,899
Spain Netherlands Portugal they all

234
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:30,899
wanted another Direction in cannabis

235
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:33,000
policy they want to change and if they

236
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:36,958
get together and work on a new solution

237
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,940
then maybe we see also a change in the

238
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:41,399
ruler in this in this framework decision

239
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:45,240
so that all European member states can

240
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:48,200
legalize the Cannabis on a safe ground

241
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,200
okay sorry

242
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:57,180
so the consequence without inputs

243
00:10:54,778 --> 00:11:00,539
Market at the beginning that's for sure

244
00:10:57,179 --> 00:11:02,639
without products in our Cannabis stores

245
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:04,500
you won't get a license I can't imagine

246
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:06,419
when you can't prove that you have

247
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:09,000
product if you have no product you can't

248
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:11,399
get a list so the first ones we have

249
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,399
product in the market will have an

250
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:16,740
advantage maybe we also see and a

251
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,778
vertically integrated value chain if the

252
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:21,360
the ones we have the first product get

253
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:23,519
the first licenses for the stores and

254
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,079
yeah the production in Germany will be a

255
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,419
challenge in terms of logistics and

256
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:29,879
energy that's not the best solution

257
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:32,578
that's not a good solution not at all so

258
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:35,939
I hope that the German government which

259
00:11:32,578 --> 00:11:37,699
is which is doing right now these

260
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:40,620
intensive talks to the EU member state

261
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:42,899
that we find another solution Imports

262
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:46,259
must be possible it's a it I can't

263
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:49,500
imagine how that should work

264
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:52,740
yeah maybe the solution would be um home

265
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:56,100
cultivation we also we all already have

266
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:57,259
a sea trade in Spain in the Czech

267
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,759
Republic

268
00:11:57,259 --> 00:12:02,879
we have a large marked market for

269
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:04,500
equipment for home growing equipment

270
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:07,639
and um

271
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:11,519
the Cannabis Social Club model is also a

272
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:13,139
route which may make sense so that you

273
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,440
have in big cities like Hamburg or

274
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:19,220
Berlin Social Clubs with 500 000 members

275
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:23,160
and their own production facilities

276
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:27,060
but this is not clear right now how this

277
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:29,338
will be regulated it's all in a in a

278
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:31,619
flow right now yeah and of course low

279
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:35,220
threshold and then generous licensing of

280
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:37,019
cultivation in Germany but this must be

281
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,180
as the key Point paper of the government

282
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:40,860
says there must be in compliance with

283
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:44,278
the sustainability goals of the German

284
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:45,720
government which are the UN goals of the

285
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:48,240
sustainability

286
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,680
but what that what does that mean do you

287
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,100
have a do you have to have a windmill

288
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:56,578
next to your indoor production facility

289
00:12:52,100 --> 00:13:00,300
or a photo will tag or whatever but you

290
00:12:56,578 --> 00:13:01,458
probably won't can't meet uh a zero

291
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:04,559
carbon

292
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:06,659
facility because it's just too intensive

293
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:08,719
in terms of energy

294
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:10,919
so lots of questions

295
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,180
we have to solve in the next couple of

296
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:13,679
months

297
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:14,578
okay

298
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:15,439
yeah

299
00:13:14,578 --> 00:13:19,138
um

300
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:22,579
the schedule is like we're expecting now

301
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:26,879
in March the first draft of the law

302
00:13:22,578 --> 00:13:29,638
as I said before the the draft will be

303
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:33,480
probably in two phases so we have plan B

304
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:37,379
first decriminalization home growth and

305
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,379
Collective home grow and

306
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:43,740
the commercialized value chain will come

307
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:47,220
in a further step in the second step in

308
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:50,339
2024 we're expecting this plan B to be

309
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:52,379
um implemented in in

310
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:54,180
June before the summer break of

311
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:57,120
moonstack

312
00:13:54,179 --> 00:14:01,379
and uh then with the further notice

313
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:03,720
period for for cultivation licenses and

314
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:07,879
Retail licenses

315
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,879
and we're expecting sorry

316
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:16,679
and we're expecting a Federal Supreme

317
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:19,139
Court decision also in March on the

318
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:21,838
legality of the ban of cannabis in

319
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:22,399
general so the March will be a decisive

320
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,180
um

321
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,519
a month

322
00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:29,159
for the further development for the

323
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:31,019
further developments in in Germany and

324
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:33,139
for the final plan of the of the

325
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:33,139
government

326
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,559
okay CBD Market

327
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,839
um

328
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:43,078
the CBD Market the CBD hype is

329
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,760
definitely over in in Germany

330
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:49,138
um the enforcement of the noble food

331
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:51,179
regulations since 2019 work very well so

332
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:54,360
we only have a few products on the

333
00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:58,500
market still still left and you can't

334
00:14:54,360 --> 00:15:00,919
CBD oil Market to no longer as food but

335
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:03,539
mainly as a cosmetic oval care product

336
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:06,179
and you see that on the shelves of the

337
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:08,519
uh of the big truck store chains

338
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:10,259
we still see party persecution on the

339
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:13,139
ground of the narcotic act against the

340
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:14,838
CBD product still a fight going on we

341
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:18,480
still need these

342
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:22,740
clarification within you with a new law

343
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:25,139
and to really make clear that the THC is

344
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:28,560
not a problem anymore for these kind of

345
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:30,480
products the CBD flowers hemp leaf tea

346
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:32,219
we still have to proceeding chemical

347
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,180
proceedings against these products as

348
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:36,778
well

349
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:40,138
my office has received the for two

350
00:15:36,778 --> 00:15:41,939
clients suit the German government in in

351
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:44,339
the administrative code of Braunschweig

352
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:47,160
on the grounds of the free movement of

353
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:50,040
goods principle because uh CBD flowers

354
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:53,879
are legal in Luxembourg and Belgium and

355
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:56,219
Austria and Hamley tea the same so but

356
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:59,578
this is still pending we need the final

357
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:01,560
clarification with the legalization and

358
00:15:59,578 --> 00:16:04,078
the changing of the law what is

359
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:06,599
marketable is CBD cosmetics and CBD

360
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:09,299
e-liquids if no Health claims are made

361
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,579
so these products are on the market and

362
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:14,000
are safe on the market

363
00:16:11,578 --> 00:16:17,638
we had some

364
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:22,259
important courtesy in the last year CBD

365
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:22,799
as a medicine so the the court said

366
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:26,100
um

367
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:29,338
if you have a product which exceeds 18

368
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,360
milligrams CBD as a daily intake it's a

369
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:32,279
medicine

370
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:37,259
okay that's not much

371
00:16:32,278 --> 00:16:40,980
the FSA in in the UK says 70

372
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:44,419
um 70 and 18 with the difference

373
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:48,600
but it does conflict with the court

374
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:51,000
rulings of the ECG because you meet the

375
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,399
significant threshold and another core

376
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,440
decision was that cosmetic oval care

377
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:57,379
sprays like you see over there you see

378
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,540
cosmetic

379
00:16:57,379 --> 00:17:03,000
moonflake spray so this is the only

380
00:17:00,539 --> 00:17:06,119
route you can Market CBD oils right now

381
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,660
because cosmetic studies find out that

382
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:11,099
um

383
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:13,679
uh CBD has an antibacterial effect for

384
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:15,659
for carrying for for treating your mouth

385
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,179
the cavity

386
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:20,880
so this is the but this is also a

387
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:24,059
dispute right now if this route will

388
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,240
prevail will be decided this year as

389
00:17:24,058 --> 00:17:26,240
well

390
00:17:26,818 --> 00:17:32,099
okay A little some words to medical

391
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:34,500
cannabis market so you can export

392
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:36,480
medical cannabis to Germany in principle

393
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:39,119
from every other country in the world

394
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,120
you just need to have

395
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:44,579
a medical cannabis production under

396
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:48,319
State control and the state has to

397
00:17:44,579 --> 00:17:48,319
establish a cannabis agency

398
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:54,059
and

399
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,880
yeah the product has to have this gacp

400
00:17:54,058 --> 00:17:58,558
and EU GMP

401
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:01,140
properties they must met these Auto

402
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:03,119
relax for regulations and the German

403
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:06,000
monographies

404
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:08,519
there's only a deviation of 10 allowed

405
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,079
for the from in terms of the

406
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:13,440
specification made

407
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:15,178
and patient numbers is about 120 000

408
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,960
right now the exact figure is not

409
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:22,259
documented the market is uh 200 million

410
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,779
euros plus 30 to 60 million Euros for

411
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:28,619
the private payer market so still a very

412
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:31,740
small market in terms of numbers

413
00:18:28,619 --> 00:18:34,979

445
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,200
my colleagues here

446
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:16,799
um so I'm gonna talk about the French

447
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,240
regulation in cannabis and just hearing

448
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:20,940
um Kai

449
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,940
um it's difficult to imagine that our

450
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:27,779
countries are so close and yes yet so

451
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:30,779
far away in terms of Regulation so

452
00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:33,178
the French regulation in cannabis in a

453
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:36,359
nutshell uh therapeutic cannabis is

454
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:38,460
still not legal we're under a pilot

455
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:40,500
program that was supposed to last for

456
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:42,240
two years initially started in March

457
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,519
2021

458
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,579
um was extended this year for another

459
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:51,119
year so legalization is now not expected

460
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:51,859
until uh 2024.

461
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:53,538
um

462
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:56,879
CBD

463
00:20:53,538 --> 00:20:58,980
and wellness hemp is legal to a certain

464
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,140
extent and I will come back to that and

465
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:03,419
adult use cannabis I will not be talking

466
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:05,880
about it simply because it's not even

467
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:09,720
under a discussion right now and we

468
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:11,780
don't see any legalization coming soon

469
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:14,819
in this country

470
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:17,639
as far as medical cannabis is concerned

471
00:21:14,819 --> 00:21:20,700
friends decided to go through a pilot

472
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:24,780
program rather than legalizing directly

473
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:26,519
so in March 2021 the they started a

474
00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:27,660
pilot program

475
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:31,440
um and

476
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:33,600
um so just before I go into little

477
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,940
details regarding the program

478
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:39,839
as far as the legal framework is

479
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:42,659
concerned um the principle in French law

480
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:46,379
is that cannabis is illegal whatever

481
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:48,179
activity related to it is illegal there

482
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:50,520
are three exceptions that are set up by

483
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:52,620
law the first ones are cannabis based

484
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:55,440
medicines so traditional medicines

485
00:21:52,619 --> 00:21:57,479
containing cannabinoids that have gone

486
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,580
through the four stages of clinical

487
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,860
trial and have obtained a marketing

488
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:03,418
authorization like any other medicinal

489
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:05,939
product

490
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:08,880
um from the company authorities the

491
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:11,519
second one that was added recently to go

492
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:15,020
through the pie and and to match with

493
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:15,019
the pilot program is

494
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:21,360
medicine like medicinal cannabis which

495
00:22:18,538 --> 00:22:23,460
is like flowers and and oils that are

496
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:25,379
used for medicinal purposes but that

497
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:28,500
have not obtained a marketing

498
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:30,840
authorization and yet they are compliant

499
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:34,619
with a certain number of criterias

500
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:36,178
including eugmp and the third exception

501
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:38,639
is r d

502
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:40,320
so you can obtain licenses from the

503
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:45,299
French competent and health authorities

504
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:47,579
to to run r d programs on campus

505
00:22:45,298 --> 00:22:51,179
the pilot program that started two years

506
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:52,500
ago was initially designed to enroll 3

507
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:57,480
000 patients

508
00:22:52,500 --> 00:23:00,900
uh one year in we had only 1500 patients

509
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:04,259
enrolled and to date one fourth of them

510
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:06,840
has already left the the program either

511
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:07,980
due to side effects or to lack of

512
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:10,199
efficacy

513
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:12,599
uh what we need to know is that medical

514
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:15,058
cannabis under the spider program is the

515
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:17,639
last recourse prescription product so

516
00:23:15,058 --> 00:23:20,779
it's for patients that I've tried any

517
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:25,740
other available therapeutic

518
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:28,740
Solution on the market and that are for

519
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:31,558
for whom nothing is working anymore

520
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:34,740
the pilot program in cannabis is

521
00:23:31,558 --> 00:23:39,000
available uh under for five therapeutic

522
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:41,819
indications so neuropathic pain serious

523
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:46,740
pharmacal resistance epilepsy supportive

524
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:50,240
care in oncology palliative care and uh

525
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:53,159
central nervous system related diseases

526
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:56,359
friends decided to go with finished

527
00:23:53,159 --> 00:24:00,179
products and like Germany we don't have

528
00:23:56,359 --> 00:24:01,759
a magistrar preparations with cannabis

529
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:05,220
yet

530
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:07,919
and it's used in under three forms so

531
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:09,140
dried flowers for evaporizations no

532
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:16,799
smoking

533
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:16,799
oral forms like capsule gels and oils

534
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:23,460
so as you can see the requirements for

535
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,799
the quality and safety of cannabis to be

536
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:31,019
used under the program are pretty

537
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:32,940
stringent so of course like jacp ugmp

538
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:35,700
um the the ansm which is the French

539
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:37,700
health authority requires uh the

540
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:40,440
products to be a pharmaceutical quality

541
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:42,840
and they have to comply with all the

542
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:46,140
other guidelines that are basically

543
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:49,259
pharmaceutical guidelines and the plans

544
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:51,919
also must meet the specifications of the

545
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:51,919
European monograph

546
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:56,340
um

547
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:59,279
specific requirements also related to

548
00:24:56,339 --> 00:25:02,418
France is that suppliers or All Foreign

549
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:04,259
companies since we don't have a local

550
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:08,100
production line

551
00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:11,220
in place but those companies cannot

552
00:25:08,099 --> 00:25:13,019
distribute directly the products to uh

553
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:15,179
the centers and health centers that are

554
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:17,759
involved in the program they had to

555
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:19,919
enter into partnership agreements with

556
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:22,859
French pharmaceutical companies that had

557
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:25,220
already the authorizations to

558
00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:27,899
um to deal with

559
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:32,159
narcotic drugs

560
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:35,400
um and so this was uh pretty long to put

561
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:38,039
in place and and as Kai said about

562
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:41,159
agreements earlier those Agreements are

563
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:43,740
pretty long to put in place so even if

564
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:46,799
we are fast forwarding to legalizations

565
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:48,859
any operator that is looking to enter

566
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:52,019
the French Market in a way or another

567
00:25:48,859 --> 00:25:55,319
and is Seeking a partnership with a

568
00:25:52,019 --> 00:25:57,720
French company really needs to start if

569
00:25:55,319 --> 00:26:00,000
they haven't started yet to seek for

570
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,460
partners and discuss those Partnerships

571
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,140
because it's not taking like one month

572
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:06,140
to to put in place obviously

573
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:11,099
um

574
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:13,319
so that's about the medical cannabis not

575
00:26:11,099 --> 00:26:16,379
not much has happened and unfortunately

576
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:20,099
in the past years but if we are talking

577
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:22,260
about a legalization in 2024 there are

578
00:26:20,099 --> 00:26:26,339
still a few questions that remain

579
00:26:22,259 --> 00:26:27,839
unanswered uh one of them is the pricing

580
00:26:26,339 --> 00:26:31,139
and the reimbursement of the medical

581
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:33,500
cannabis medicinal products and friends

582
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:36,360
have their price and reimbursement

583
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:38,940
determined as per a certain number of

584
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:40,379
criterias but medical cannabis and I'm

585
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:42,240
not talking about pharmaceutical

586
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:45,419
cannabis which are like traditional

587
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:48,778
medicines medical cannabis hasn't gone

588
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:52,860
through the traditional clinical trial

589
00:26:48,778 --> 00:26:58,980
process we don't have those status like

590
00:26:52,859 --> 00:27:00,839
SMR and ASMR and all those like proof

591
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:02,940
that are traditionally used by the

592
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:05,178
pricing authorities in France to to set

593
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:07,798
up the price and the reimbursement level

594
00:27:05,179 --> 00:27:10,440
so we don't know yet what their

595
00:27:07,798 --> 00:27:13,200
authorities are going to do to and how

596
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,480
they're going to determine the criterias

597
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,538
for that

598
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:22,019
the supply is another question because

599
00:27:17,538 --> 00:27:24,000
even though since February 2022 the

600
00:27:22,019 --> 00:27:25,679
French law has incorporated the

601
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,980
possibility to cultivate medical

602
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:31,500
cannabis on the French territory

603
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:34,019
the the implementation texts are not

604
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:36,599
published yet so it's in the law we know

605
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:39,298
it's there but it you cannot put it in

606
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:41,219
place and the reality is that no one is

607
00:27:39,298 --> 00:27:43,500
ready yet to cultivate medical cannabis

608
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:46,079
in France it takes Millions to build a

609
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:49,859
facility it takes time you need

610
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:53,359
authorizations and so we know that in

611
00:27:49,859 --> 00:27:56,399
case of legalization in 20 March 2024

612
00:27:53,359 --> 00:28:00,240
there will not be a domestic production

613
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:02,278
line in place so the supply will rely on

614
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,980
foreign suppliers

615
00:28:02,278 --> 00:28:07,440
again and

616
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:10,319
um so this this is definitely an

617
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:13,679
opportunity for foreign operators but it

618
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:15,058
it's also time now as I was saying

619
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,759
before to

620
00:28:15,058 --> 00:28:20,759
um to start discussing how they're going

621
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:23,220
to supply how they're going to to win

622
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:27,298
their place on the French Market

623
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:29,819
um and and this is now at the latest and

624
00:28:27,298 --> 00:28:31,798
the last question we we have which is a

625
00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:33,658
major one is the number of patients that

626
00:28:31,798 --> 00:28:35,700
will benefit from medicinal cannabis

627
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:37,260
because as we know before we started the

628
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,480
title program everybody was talking

629
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:41,700
about a tremendous number of patients

630
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:44,400
that would benefit from it and that

631
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:46,558
would and and they were

632
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,720
really really nervous about the fact

633
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:51,119
that 3 000 patients for the pilot

634
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,798
program was not enough and that a lot of

635
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:55,199
people would be left on the side of the

636
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:57,740
road the reality when you're in is that

637
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,480
only half of the patients that were

638
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:03,659
planned to to be enrolled in the program

639
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:07,019
entered the program and one-fourth of

640
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:09,720
them are already out so that's an

641
00:29:07,019 --> 00:29:12,240
unanswered questions and and we see the

642
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:15,240
difference the the patients will benefit

643
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,278
from this pilot program or most of the

644
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:19,740
time people who never use cannabis

645
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:22,140
before and then you have all the people

646
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:25,079
who use cannabis

647
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:27,419
um and in the illegal way and as a

648
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:29,278
so-called recreational way and among

649
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:30,960
them you have people who use it for real

650
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:33,960
recreational purposes and you have

651
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:38,100
people who use it for medicinal purposes

652
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:40,259
whatever it is and so because everything

653
00:29:38,099 --> 00:29:42,240
seems to be mixed up at the moment we

654
00:29:40,259 --> 00:29:44,940
don't really see and really know how

655
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:48,200
many patients will really benefit from

656
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,200
what happens yes

657
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:58,440
just a few menable conditions and that

658
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:00,840
they were the inclusion verification

659
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:03,480
they live in Houston

660
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:06,359
they've increased the scope over the

661
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:08,640
first year especially in oncology they

662
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:11,759
have opened and enlarged the criterias

663
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:15,360
uh for enrollment especially in breast

664
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:18,240
cancer and pediatric cancer I think and

665
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:21,058
so um they have but it's also

666
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,759
complicated because the doctors that are

667
00:30:21,058 --> 00:30:27,119
involved were trained it was like a few

668
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:28,619
hours training and we see doctors not

669
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:30,418
complaining but explaining the

670
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:33,719
difficulties they have with titration

671
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:35,700
for instance in the NSA okay but we we

672
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,220
have to adapt the product to each

673
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:40,740
patient and it's very highly monitored

674
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:44,759
and so it's it's I think it's a

675
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:48,179
combination of factors that

676
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:50,339
makes it and also one factor that

677
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:53,340
appeared is that a lot of people

678
00:30:50,339 --> 00:30:54,538
left the the program because they can't

679
00:30:53,339 --> 00:30:58,259
drive

680
00:30:54,538 --> 00:31:00,599
and so it's it's complicated you know to

681
00:30:58,259 --> 00:31:02,940
to run your daily life if you're you're

682
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:05,278
using a product and you a new contract

683
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:08,700
so that's there are a lot of factors

684
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:10,619
involved but for sure it doesn't help

685
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:13,200
with you know like navigating the

686
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:15,658
numbers and and knowing exactly the real

687
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:19,319
picture of of it yes

688
00:31:15,659 --> 00:31:21,860
and then you're right and uh building

689
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:24,720
for program is being added

690
00:31:21,859 --> 00:31:27,898
it cuts mad at the what maintaining

691
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:31,140
deferred he is the best program is being

692
00:31:27,898 --> 00:31:36,298
advertising advertised by you can't

693
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:38,399
write uh the meaning it will be the the

694
00:31:36,298 --> 00:31:40,980
Secretary of picks but adverse effect

695
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:42,839
based on that people is not going to

696
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:45,240
come even carved because of this speed

697
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:48,658
map all around the world so I think that

698
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:51,720
that that there are a possible solution

699
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:54,179
here is number one how they are as their

700
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:56,460
facing this program number two is the

701
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:59,419
earthquake more skip Mark is very

702
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:02,880
already existing as Sigma I never agree

703
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:04,559
which stations are if your aimed Limited

704
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,440
in this program with the say I'm really

705
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:09,898
sure if you go to the party areas of the

706
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,778
hospital those stations will be very

707
00:32:09,898 --> 00:32:15,359
happen for Sap's treatments but it is

708
00:32:12,778 --> 00:32:17,398
about how we are planning up to a

709
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:20,219
wedding thankful these programs and

710
00:32:17,398 --> 00:32:22,678
again you work only executing programs

711
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:25,558
for executing programs or really what to

712
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:28,500
to attach any goal or something like

713
00:32:25,558 --> 00:32:30,960
that I don't know well it's not it's not

714
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:33,240
I wouldn't say the user advertised first

715
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:36,000
of all I mean there's a program put in

716
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:38,339
place but the number of centers and

717
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,339
health hospitals that are involved is

718
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:44,639
listed so it's not all the centers in in

719
00:32:41,339 --> 00:32:46,980
France that are involved in this program

720
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:49,140
first of all so if you're a patient and

721
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:52,200
you're not in the geographical area and

722
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:54,360
you're not already followed up by a

723
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:57,360
healthcare professional that is involved

724
00:32:54,359 --> 00:33:00,178
himself in the in the pilot program you

725
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:03,298
don't have access to that so that's one

726
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:05,278
point the second point is of course like

727
00:33:03,298 --> 00:33:07,319
any other medication if you're using

728
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:09,058
morphine you're not gonna drive that's

729
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:11,700
for sure

730
00:33:09,058 --> 00:33:15,298
um and so it's like any other medication

731
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:16,980
that comes with a warning that you

732
00:33:15,298 --> 00:33:19,099
shouldn't be driving if you're using

733
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:21,899
something that alterates your

734
00:33:19,099 --> 00:33:23,879
Consciousness or whatever and depending

735
00:33:21,898 --> 00:33:27,898
on the ratios and the dosages that are

736
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:30,360
used that's like any other drug then the

737
00:33:27,898 --> 00:33:32,639
side effects like any other medicinal

738
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:34,798
products the doctor has to inform you

739
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,860
when you enter the program or you're

740
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:40,379
being prescribed a medication that there

741
00:33:37,859 --> 00:33:42,658
it may come with side effects but again

742
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:46,460
the side effects and especially with

743
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:49,500
these medicinal products which is really

744
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:51,419
active on a personal level and each

745
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:53,700
patient will will actually have a

746
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:56,100
different response to it and the

747
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:58,919
adaptation of the dosage and is is going

748
00:33:56,099 --> 00:34:00,599
to vary from a patient to another

749
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:02,820
um some patients will not have side

750
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:04,918
effects some will have side effects and

751
00:34:02,819 --> 00:34:06,658
and and it's an ongoing curve it's a

752
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:10,800
learning curve it's you you constantly

753
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:13,320
discover new things and so I think

754
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,960
um it's not so much about how the

755
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:18,838
program was advertised but it's more

756
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:21,599
first of all was it available where you

757
00:34:18,838 --> 00:34:24,418
live for the patient live is the

758
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:26,519
patients already has already tried all

759
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:30,358
the drugs before and all the therapeutic

760
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:32,039
solutions that were available and has is

761
00:34:30,358 --> 00:34:34,199
it not working anymore for these

762
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:38,099
patients so those criterias are strict

763
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:40,980
for sure and limited limiting but

764
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:44,039
um I think it's uh we would need to to

765
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:46,320
see a little further and in time to

766
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:49,559
really gather all the different reasons

767
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:52,039
why the number of patients is remains

768
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:52,039
Limited

769
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:59,579
um so the second part is about CBD and

770
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:02,460
wellness hemp so I'm not going to go

771
00:34:59,579 --> 00:35:04,619
through too deeply in that into that but

772
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:07,260
I'm going to refer to what happened in

773
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:08,940
2022 because we had a pretty active year

774
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:12,180
in France

775
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:15,599
um so after no the this is the kind of a

776
00:35:12,179 --> 00:35:17,639
decision in 2020 uh France was forced to

777
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,380
review the regulation which was judged

778
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:21,719
too restrictive compared to your

779
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:25,460
European law and so they came up with

780
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:28,679
the umete of December 30th 2021

781
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:31,800
According to which uh the Hem plans that

782
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:35,659
can be used legally and cultivate it

783
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:40,260
um are must be listed either on the EU

784
00:35:35,659 --> 00:35:43,259
strains list or on the French list of

785
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:47,520
hemp varieties the plants must contain

786
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:50,099
less than 0.3 percent of THC the

787
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:52,858
extracts and products containing the the

788
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:55,980
the extracts musk also contain less than

789
00:35:52,858 --> 00:35:58,139
the 0.3 percent of THC subject to

790
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:01,679
specific rules depending on the kind of

791
00:35:58,139 --> 00:36:04,139
products concerned and notably cosmetic

792
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:07,319
products and food products for which

793
00:36:04,139 --> 00:36:10,500
there are like a general safety rule

794
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:13,920
um a principle applying and so but the

795
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:16,079
regulation didn't didn't come with any

796
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,380
further detail on what they were

797
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:22,700
expecting so basically I will mention a

798
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:25,140
case later but we go with a 0.3 percent

799
00:36:22,699 --> 00:36:25,799
THC limit

800
00:36:25,139 --> 00:36:28,078
um

801
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:33,240
the hemp flowers and leaves are

802
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:36,839
authorized only for industrial use but

803
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:38,699
the retail sale to consumer of rawhand

804
00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:41,539
flowers and leaves whatever other form

805
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:45,419
which means including herbal tea

806
00:36:41,539 --> 00:36:48,838
was prohibited by this regulation

807
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:51,720
so you can imagine that the entire

808
00:36:48,838 --> 00:36:54,299
industry jumped off their chair went mad

809
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:57,419
and was like okay we're gonna Sue this

810
00:36:54,300 --> 00:37:00,119
uh regulation because uh first of all

811
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:03,000
this prohibition of the retail sale of

812
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:05,940
hemp flowers to Consumer created a real

813
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,639
problem regarding the principle of free

814
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:11,659
movement of good Goods in Europe because

815
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:15,299
having hand flowers

816
00:37:11,659 --> 00:37:18,420
illegal in the neighbor countries these

817
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:20,640
could be imported into France while the

818
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:25,260
same product manufacturing France was

819
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:27,900
illegal the second legal issue we had

820
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:31,200
about and I'll come back about this

821
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:35,579
regulation and in this prohibition was

822
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:37,679
that basically it means it that the hemp

823
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:40,260
flower you use the hemp strain you're

824
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:42,598
using and the plant is legal as long as

825
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:45,300
it's on the list one of the list and it

826
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:47,338
contains less than 0.3 percent of THC

827
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:50,460
but at the same time

828
00:37:47,338 --> 00:37:54,059
the flowers and the leaves from the same

829
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:55,920
plant are considered as a narcotic go

830
00:37:54,059 --> 00:37:57,960
for your why I'm still trying to

831
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:01,200
understand how they came up with this

832
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:04,559
but still that's what happened

833
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:09,059
um so this regulation on the field

834
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:10,739
created basically two main issues the

835
00:38:09,059 --> 00:38:15,960
first one is the noble food regulation

836
00:38:10,739 --> 00:38:19,618
so Noble food is in the EU problem

837
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:22,139
um and it's it's eu-wide and in theory

838
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:24,240
you're not supposed to put any CBD

839
00:38:22,139 --> 00:38:27,838
product edible products on the market

840
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:31,799
including the French market and we have

841
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:34,199
as far as food supplement or concern the

842
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:36,539
French regulation is pretty very clear

843
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:40,199
on that you cannot use Noble food that

844
00:38:36,539 --> 00:38:40,858
has not been authorized by the FSA

845
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:44,159
um

846
00:38:40,858 --> 00:38:45,838
and um in in the manufacturing or food

847
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:49,259
supplements

848
00:38:45,838 --> 00:38:52,980
however in practice the reality is that

849
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:54,980
we've seen very limited controls on the

850
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:59,699
French Market over the past few years

851
00:38:54,980 --> 00:39:02,338
which has resulted in a num tremendous

852
00:38:59,699 --> 00:39:05,039
number of products invading the French

853
00:39:02,338 --> 00:39:08,099
market so you can find CBD products and

854
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:09,619
CBD oils and CBD gummies and CBD showing

855
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:14,220
chewing gum

856
00:39:09,619 --> 00:39:16,400
everywhere in pharmacies in CBD shops in

857
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:19,919
supermarkets

858
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:22,019
and so if you're lucky you will not be

859
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,480
controlled if you're not lucky you will

860
00:39:22,019 --> 00:39:29,400
get a control and depending on where you

861
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:31,980
are it can be bad timing but location so

862
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:35,280
it's it's all it creates real

863
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:36,960
discrepancy in in inequality on the on

864
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,579
the market

865
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:42,320
um

866
00:39:37,579 --> 00:39:45,119
and what we see and and and two two

867
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:48,359
consequences we've seen so the first one

868
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:51,539
is not directly related to CBD that the

869
00:39:48,358 --> 00:39:53,819
the the the second one is that a lot of

870
00:39:51,539 --> 00:39:57,659
companies have started suing each other

871
00:39:53,820 --> 00:40:00,300
for competition and for competition and

872
00:39:57,659 --> 00:40:03,960
judges because the French authorities

873
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:06,599
have not taken real clear position and

874
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:08,460
official position regarding uh the

875
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:10,140
enforcement of the novel food regulation

876
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:11,820
even though they will say and they

877
00:40:10,139 --> 00:40:14,460
rewrite somewhere you're not supposed to

878
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:17,519
place until those products on the market

879
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:20,159
until the FSA has given the marketing

880
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:22,259
authorization yet

881
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:25,618
um you still have

882
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:28,619
no real enforcement and so the courts

883
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:30,599
whenever you will have a competitor

884
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:32,820
suing another competitor for unfair

885
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:36,420
competitions claiming that said

886
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:39,119
competitor is selling his products on us

887
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:44,159
in supermarkets while he's not doing it

888
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:44,160
because he wants to remain clean

889
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:48,358
um

890
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:52,380
the judge will say will simply decide

891
00:40:48,358 --> 00:40:55,858
most of the time that uh he is not the

892
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:57,960
one who has to make decision until the

893
00:40:55,858 --> 00:41:02,759
competent authorities have taken a clear

894
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:05,460
position on what to do regarding notably

895
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:08,400
um the transitional measures that are

896
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:09,480
contained in the noble food regulation

897
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,460
um

898
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:16,800
the second issue is the hemp flower so

899
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:19,679
with the prohibition of the retail sale

900
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:22,380
of hand flowers to Consumers

901
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:25,919
um the a lot of Industry players

902
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:29,220
actually sued the government and and to

903
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:31,858
have the uh the regulation repealed or

904
00:41:29,219 --> 00:41:35,399
at least the article that was setting

905
00:41:31,858 --> 00:41:36,000
out the Prohibition repealed and so

906
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:39,599
um

907
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,119
in 2022 we had three major Court

908
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:44,760
decisions the first one was the

909
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:47,820
Constitutional Council in January 7th

910
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:50,520
2022 that reminded the definition of

911
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:52,820
Narcotics and that precise that by

912
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:54,780
narcotic we we must understand

913
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:57,900
psychotropic substances that

914
00:41:54,780 --> 00:42:01,500
characterize by risk of addiction and

915
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:04,079
harmful effects on health so that was

916
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:08,099
pretty important for the CBD industry

917
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:11,640
because it kind of confirmed what had

918
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:13,039
already been set up by the the ECG in

919
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:18,239
2020

920
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:21,659
in on January 24th 2022 the French the

921
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:24,479
Council of State suspended the provision

922
00:42:21,659 --> 00:42:28,940
of the regulation that prohibited the

923
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:34,380
retail sale of hemp flowers to Consumer

924
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:36,320
so the retail sales resumed and in

925
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:40,740
December 29th

926
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:44,039
2022 the Council of States ruled on the

927
00:42:40,739 --> 00:42:47,639
merits of the case and uh decided to

928
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:50,519
repeal the article one paragraph two of

929
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:53,578
the regulation and hence repealed the

930
00:42:50,519 --> 00:42:56,219
prohibition of rooted sale of raw hemp

931
00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:58,560
flowers and leaves to Consumers so it's

932
00:42:56,219 --> 00:43:01,818
now

933
00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:05,219
um the the legalization is uh

934
00:43:01,818 --> 00:43:07,380
confirmed what's next further following

935
00:43:05,219 --> 00:43:10,439
this decision is that the government is

936
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:12,480
supposed to review the regulation what

937
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:14,818
they will come up with it's a question

938
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,679
because we know they're still reluctant

939
00:43:14,818 --> 00:43:19,440
and they don't want to have smoking

940
00:43:16,679 --> 00:43:21,239
products on the French market so uh it's

941
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,639
a big question

942
00:43:21,239 --> 00:43:26,279
um

943
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:27,679
T may be easier to solve because even

944
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:30,540
the European

945
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:34,559
commission has already indicated to

946
00:43:30,539 --> 00:43:38,039
France that t is a food product so you

947
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:40,739
cannot rule as you know an architect but

948
00:43:38,039 --> 00:43:42,420
the smoking product issue remains a real

949
00:43:40,739 --> 00:43:44,519
question

950
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:47,220
um and

951
00:43:44,519 --> 00:43:49,800
um we would expect more clarifications

952
00:43:47,219 --> 00:43:52,799
in the regulation itself notably

953
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:56,579
regarding the safety the THC levels in

954
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:59,160
in food products in cosmetics and but we

955
00:43:56,579 --> 00:44:01,560
are not sure that the legislator is

956
00:43:59,159 --> 00:44:04,920
going to come up with any clarification

957
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:07,739
anytime soon so those are questions that

958
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:10,440
are still remain 2023 may be an

959
00:44:07,739 --> 00:44:13,769
interesting year so we'll see what

960
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:18,200
happens thank you

961
00:44:13,769 --> 00:44:21,719
[Applause]

962
00:44:18,199 --> 00:44:25,578
thank you very much Marie so uh next

963
00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:25,578
speaker up is Robert Jeff

964
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:34,980
all good good to go out uh

965
00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:38,539
hi everyone my name is Robert jappy I'm

966
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:41,880
a regulatory lawyer um based in London I

967
00:44:38,539 --> 00:44:43,739
focus on uh advising medical cannabis

968
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,358
and CBD companies on all this or

969
00:44:43,739 --> 00:44:46,259
day-to-day Regulatory Compliance and

970
00:44:45,358 --> 00:44:48,358
that's

971
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:49,740
graduated interval regulatory support

972
00:44:48,358 --> 00:44:52,380
first or big corporate commercial

973
00:44:49,739 --> 00:44:54,959
transactions as well

974
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:56,940
um today I'm going to be talking about

975
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,920
the disaster Zone that is medical

976
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:00,960
cannabis in the UK

977
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:03,139
um it's going to sound like

978
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,400
I'm being very negative about things

979
00:45:03,139 --> 00:45:07,679
there is still huge huge growth

980
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:10,440
potential in medical cannabis in the UK

981
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:12,059
and I genuinely believe in it but

982
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:15,539
um the next two to three years is going

983
00:45:12,059 --> 00:45:16,500
to be a decisive time make or break for

984
00:45:15,539 --> 00:45:19,800
this sector

985
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:22,500
so um firstly medical cannabis has been

986
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:26,039
legal in the UK for more than four years

987
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:28,380
now uh patient numbers have increased

988
00:45:26,039 --> 00:45:30,779
slowly last year we think there was

989
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:33,119
about twenty thousand patients in the

990
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:35,160
legal regime which are receiving

991
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:38,519
prescriptions and having them fulfilled

992
00:45:35,159 --> 00:45:41,940
that's an increase from 7 000 patients

993
00:45:38,519 --> 00:45:44,880
in 2021 which is positive

994
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:46,858
but we are still way short of uh the

995
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:49,440
numbers that are needed to make this a

996
00:45:46,858 --> 00:45:53,159
successful and sustainable industry in

997
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:55,500
the UK so um medical cannabis is paid

998
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:57,480
for privately uh

999
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:59,519
we don't have the same position as in

1000
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:02,818
Germany where medical insurance will pay

1001
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:04,800
for for cannabis medications and there's

1002
00:46:02,818 --> 00:46:06,960
been a handful and I mean literally a

1003
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,060
handful four or five uh prescriptions

1004
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:11,699
are being paid for by the NHS at the

1005
00:46:09,059 --> 00:46:13,739
moment so that's obviously the end goal

1006
00:46:11,699 --> 00:46:15,419
is to try and get the NHS to to start

1007
00:46:13,739 --> 00:46:17,098
paying for more and more prescriptions

1008
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:18,900
but we seem to be quite far away from

1009
00:46:17,099 --> 00:46:20,460
that at the moment

1010
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:21,960
so this is the agenda for today so I'll

1011
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:24,240
just do a brief history of how we got

1012
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:26,400
medical cannabis legalized in the UK

1013
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:28,379
I'll talk about the five stages of the

1014
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,420
supply chain I'm going to go through

1015
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:33,119
some of the issues uh the challenges

1016
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:34,619
that the sector that is facing and that

1017
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:37,440
will include things like being able to

1018
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:39,660
advertise medical cannabis uh the

1019
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:42,900
restrictive prescribing

1020
00:46:39,659 --> 00:46:45,779
um situation and also cost and quality

1021
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:47,460
of of products is a real issue as well

1022
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:49,440
and then

1023
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:51,960
um I'm going to give you my ideas on how

1024
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:54,240
we can solve things uh some of them will

1025
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:56,699
probably be quite controversial

1026
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:58,858
um but I don't think it's uh being

1027
00:46:56,699 --> 00:47:00,719
talked about enough about how we we make

1028
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:03,838
an industry where businesses can

1029
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:07,078
actually be profitable and successful

1030
00:47:03,838 --> 00:47:10,920
um so 2018 we had a a stellar media

1031
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:12,780
campaign whereby mothers with uh sick

1032
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:15,119
children children who had epilepsy were

1033
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:17,220
going across to the Netherlands

1034
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:19,260
um getting the Cannabis medications for

1035
00:47:17,219 --> 00:47:21,059
them bringing them back into the UK and

1036
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:23,099
as they entered the UK the Border force

1037
00:47:21,059 --> 00:47:25,679
would seize the the medications from

1038
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:27,440
them and this was on the front page of

1039
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:30,899
every newspaper across the country

1040
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:32,460
public opinion swung very quickly behind

1041
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,900
medical cannabis and the home office had

1042
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:36,300
to act

1043
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:38,280
um and you know they did a six weeks

1044
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:39,960
six-week concert consultation and then

1045
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:41,880
they they legalized and it just caught

1046
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:44,400
everyone by surprises you know for the

1047
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:47,780
home office to act that quickly is is

1048
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:50,280
unheard of in the UK so we have

1049
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:50,880
cannabis-based medications

1050
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:53,579
um

1051
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,619
are now in schedule two of the misuse of

1052
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:58,079
drugs regulations so it's accepted that

1053
00:47:55,619 --> 00:48:01,800
finished product uh cannabis medications

1054
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:04,619
have a medical purpose and a medical use

1055
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:07,460
um they've been placed into the specials

1056
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:09,780
medicine regime for unlicensed products

1057
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:11,460
there are a couple of licensed

1058
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:14,819
medications in the UK so you're talking

1059
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:17,280
epidial exercise the GW

1060
00:48:14,818 --> 00:48:18,719
um medications otherwise it's all

1061
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:21,780
brought in under the specials license

1062
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:24,179
regime where there is a an unmet

1063
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:26,880
clinical need for certain conditions so

1064
00:48:24,179 --> 00:48:28,858
that's that's the current regime

1065
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:31,680
um and I think a lot of the problems

1066
00:48:28,858 --> 00:48:33,960
that I'm going to identify today will

1067
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:36,000
basically boil down to the the industry

1068
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:38,400
being hampered by the the regulatory

1069
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,900
regime

1070
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,760
so these are the five stages of the

1071
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:43,740
medical cannabis supply chain

1072
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:46,200
this isn't Like official five stages

1073
00:48:43,739 --> 00:48:48,598
this is my made-up five stages that I

1074
00:48:46,199 --> 00:48:50,399
use to get it right in my head so this

1075
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:52,559
is how I explain it to people so you've

1076
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,180
got stage one is the EU GMP certified

1077
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:56,818
products

1078
00:48:54,179 --> 00:48:58,440
pretty much all of the medical cannabis

1079
00:48:56,818 --> 00:49:01,380
um being prescribed in the UK is coming

1080
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:03,119
from overseas we we do not have a

1081
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:05,460
situation where cannabis companies are

1082
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,800
growing medical cannabis for the the

1083
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:11,220
Medical Market so it'll be coming from

1084
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:13,260
Canada it'll be coming from Europe uh

1085
00:49:11,219 --> 00:49:15,239
there are starting to be some products

1086
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:16,500
coming online from places like Colombia

1087
00:49:15,239 --> 00:49:18,598
and Africa

1088
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:20,280
so you've got to have GMP certified

1089
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:21,180
products to be able to issue it to

1090
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:23,519
patients

1091
00:49:21,179 --> 00:49:25,019
stage two is import so you need a

1092
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:26,699
license from the home office to be able

1093
00:49:25,019 --> 00:49:28,858
to receive the medical cannabis as it

1094
00:49:26,699 --> 00:49:31,019
comes into the UK stage three is

1095
00:49:28,858 --> 00:49:32,699
logistics and storage and so you need

1096
00:49:31,019 --> 00:49:34,139
another license from the home office

1097
00:49:32,699 --> 00:49:36,179
which is a wholesale distribution

1098
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:37,679
Authority usually stage two and stage

1099
00:49:36,179 --> 00:49:39,299
three go together so you will have a lot

1100
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:41,159
of companies in the UK that hold these

1101
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:42,839
two licenses they will import the

1102
00:49:41,159 --> 00:49:45,960
product they'll store it and then

1103
00:49:42,838 --> 00:49:47,818
they'll distribute it via pharmacies and

1104
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:50,818
and they will need a license from the

1105
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:53,279
the mhra to allow them to to to bring in

1106
00:49:50,818 --> 00:49:54,779
these unlicensed medications and then

1107
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:57,480
finally you've got the front line you've

1108
00:49:54,780 --> 00:50:00,420
got the clinics who are facing the

1109
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:02,219
patients and you've got the doctors who

1110
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:05,039
are issuing the prescriptions and they

1111
00:50:02,219 --> 00:50:07,980
have to be uh specially trained doctors

1112
00:50:05,039 --> 00:50:10,380
to to issue prescriptions and that's the

1113
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:13,500
the restrictions on prescriptions is is

1114
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:15,680
something I'll come on to uh so what

1115
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:18,420
progress have we made since 2018

1116
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:20,940
well uh the good news is as I said there

1117
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:24,838
is an increase in patient numbers

1118
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:27,300
um there are around 20 to 24 companies

1119
00:50:24,838 --> 00:50:30,480
running medical cannabis clinics in the

1120
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:32,700
UK uh at present so you can imagine you

1121
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:35,400
can do the math yourself 20 000 patients

1122
00:50:32,699 --> 00:50:36,960
amongst 24 clinics it is not a huge

1123
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:38,760
number of patients that these clinics

1124
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,679
are dealing with and the more I'm

1125
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:43,200
hearing is that a lot of the time they

1126
00:50:40,679 --> 00:50:44,940
are just passing around patients between

1127
00:50:43,199 --> 00:50:46,618
them you know moving there's the same

1128
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:48,300
number of patients around from Clinic to

1129
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:49,858
clinic so we are not seeing a big

1130
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:52,019
increase in patient numbers for these

1131
00:50:49,858 --> 00:50:54,838
clinics which will help them have a

1132
00:50:52,019 --> 00:50:57,179
sustainable business

1133
00:50:54,838 --> 00:50:59,219
so really it's only consultant doctors

1134
00:50:57,179 --> 00:51:01,318
that can do it there's about 30 or 40

1135
00:50:59,219 --> 00:51:03,419
000 doctors in the UK that are able to

1136
00:51:01,318 --> 00:51:05,699
prescribe medical cannabis we probably

1137
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:07,740
maybe have about 100 to 150 who are

1138
00:51:05,699 --> 00:51:09,058
actually doing it so that's a really big

1139
00:51:07,739 --> 00:51:11,338
problem you know there's very few

1140
00:51:09,059 --> 00:51:12,900
doctors who are actually actively out

1141
00:51:11,338 --> 00:51:15,119
there prescribing medical cannabis and

1142
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:17,039
that needs to change as well

1143
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:19,140
um there's a huge problem with awareness

1144
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:20,818
about medical cannabis in the UK the

1145
00:51:19,139 --> 00:51:22,920
majority of the population don't even

1146
00:51:20,818 --> 00:51:25,019
realize that medical cannabis is legal

1147
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:26,400
uh so when you are trying to increase

1148
00:51:25,019 --> 00:51:27,900
patient numbers that is very very

1149
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:31,200
difficult if people actually don't even

1150
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:34,019
know that it's a it exists

1151
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:35,879
um you only go to the US and you go into

1152
00:51:34,019 --> 00:51:39,119
a hotel and you turn on a TV and every

1153
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:40,440
other advert is for a medication or a

1154
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:42,119
treatment or a clinic or something like

1155
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:43,318
that we don't have that in the UK so

1156
00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:45,180
that's a real big problem for medical

1157
00:51:43,318 --> 00:51:46,920
cannabis companies they cannot advertise

1158
00:51:45,179 --> 00:51:48,539
their services they cannot advertise

1159
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:50,338
their products

1160
00:51:48,539 --> 00:51:51,779
um and it's driving them crazy to be

1161
00:51:50,338 --> 00:51:53,880
honest not being able to tell people

1162
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:57,680
that they're there and the products are

1163
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:57,680
available and that people can get access

1164
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:03,299
you've then got the cost product cost is

1165
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:05,519
is still relatively High you know a

1166
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:06,960
medical cannabis patient in in the UK

1167
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:10,380
will probably be looking at paying

1168
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:12,240
around 200 to 250 pounds a month for

1169
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:14,039
their uh to fulfill their prescription

1170
00:52:12,239 --> 00:52:16,259
and you know most people can't afford

1171
00:52:14,039 --> 00:52:19,019
that if you've got patients who are

1172
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:20,160
receiving opioid medication from the NHS

1173
00:52:19,019 --> 00:52:21,659
for free

1174
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:23,159
and you're saying you know stop using

1175
00:52:21,659 --> 00:52:25,318
those opioids and come and use medical

1176
00:52:23,159 --> 00:52:26,519
cannabis and you have to pay 200 250

1177
00:52:25,318 --> 00:52:27,960
pounds a month a lot of them will say

1178
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:30,119
well I'll just stay with the free

1179
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:32,818
medication thank you very much and the

1180
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:35,280
cost uh is increased by the regulatory

1181
00:52:32,818 --> 00:52:36,838
burden that is is placed on the the

1182
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,720
companies that are operating in the

1183
00:52:36,838 --> 00:52:40,739
supply chain

1184
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:42,118
incredibly enough when you're only

1185
00:52:40,739 --> 00:52:44,219
dealing with such a small number of

1186
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:46,740
patients it's a surprise that we still

1187
00:52:44,219 --> 00:52:48,719
have such problems with

1188
00:52:46,739 --> 00:52:49,858
um quality product and reliability of

1189
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:54,299
products

1190
00:52:49,858 --> 00:52:56,719
um in the UK so it's one thing to get

1191
00:52:54,300 --> 00:53:00,000
a patient into the medical cannabis

1192
00:52:56,719 --> 00:53:01,919
regime it's it's even harder to keep

1193
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,440
them in it and if you're having

1194
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,579
patients receiving prescriptions and

1195
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,960
having to wait two or three months

1196
00:53:05,579 --> 00:53:09,059
before they actually get their their

1197
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,260
product the likelihood is they'll get

1198
00:53:09,059 --> 00:53:12,240
tired of waiting they'll go back to the

1199
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:14,339
illicit Market if they do get their

1200
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:17,098
product and it's a poor quality

1201
00:53:14,338 --> 00:53:19,500
you know we've had problems with mold

1202
00:53:17,099 --> 00:53:20,760
and seeds and all kinds of nonsense in

1203
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:22,980
in the products that are being issued to

1204
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:24,480
patients again they'll go back to their

1205
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:26,519
dealer they won't they won't hang around

1206
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,679
for this it's a way for a quality

1207
00:53:26,519 --> 00:53:30,000
product to turn up

1208
00:53:28,679 --> 00:53:31,558
so there's a lot of issues that need to

1209
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,440
be addressed

1210
00:53:31,559 --> 00:53:35,819
um

1211
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:37,679
one of the things that we really want in

1212
00:53:35,818 --> 00:53:39,900
the UK is for GPS to be able to

1213
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:43,078
prescribe medical cannabis

1214
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:45,539
um and in 2001 we had the medical

1215
00:53:43,079 --> 00:53:48,119
cannabis access bill

1216
00:53:45,539 --> 00:53:49,500
um was brought to Parliament uh I'm not

1217
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:51,420
going to go into parliamentary procedure

1218
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:53,099
but effectively a Bill gets bounced back

1219
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:54,780
and forth between the house and Commons

1220
00:53:53,099 --> 00:53:57,000
and the House of Lords and then if it

1221
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:58,680
gets enacted it becomes a enact a piece

1222
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,760
of legislation

1223
00:53:58,679 --> 00:54:05,519
um this was a really sort of narrow

1224
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:07,619
proposed legislation really had two two

1225
00:54:05,519 --> 00:54:10,139
key points and one was to allow GPS to

1226
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:12,559
be able to prescribe it as well as these

1227
00:54:10,139 --> 00:54:14,578
specialist doctors and the Tory party

1228
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:16,319
filibustered it and he got talked out

1229
00:54:14,579 --> 00:54:18,300
and it never went anywhere and the

1230
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:20,039
expectation is um

1231
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:22,160
that bill is probably dead and nobody's

1232
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:24,838
going to try and bring it back and

1233
00:54:22,159 --> 00:54:27,719
initially I was surprised I thought you

1234
00:54:24,838 --> 00:54:29,639
know it's such a a small change that

1235
00:54:27,719 --> 00:54:31,739
we're asking for but in fact when you

1236
00:54:29,639 --> 00:54:34,019
think about it if suddenly Nationwide

1237
00:54:31,739 --> 00:54:35,639
all of the GPS in the UK could prescribe

1238
00:54:34,019 --> 00:54:38,219
medical cannabis you would probably see

1239
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:39,719
patient numbers increase exponentially

1240
00:54:38,219 --> 00:54:41,338
and I think that's probably what the

1241
00:54:39,719 --> 00:54:44,399
government was worried about too much

1242
00:54:41,338 --> 00:54:46,558
too soon too quickly

1243
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:49,260
um The Hodges review was a report that

1244
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:52,319
was done recently which has called again

1245
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:54,180
for GPS to prescribe but they've they've

1246
00:54:52,318 --> 00:54:55,619
suggested a nationwide trial and I think

1247
00:54:54,179 --> 00:54:57,899
this is actually potentially a really

1248
00:54:55,619 --> 00:55:01,740
good idea you know pick a a small area

1249
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:03,660
get five or ten GPS who are Keen to be

1250
00:55:01,739 --> 00:55:05,338
involved and and you know let them

1251
00:55:03,659 --> 00:55:07,558
prescribe for six months 12 months with

1252
00:55:05,338 --> 00:55:10,739
the oversight of a specialist consultant

1253
00:55:07,559 --> 00:55:14,099
and see how it goes the difficulty with

1254
00:55:10,739 --> 00:55:15,779
that is GPS are already overwhelmed in

1255
00:55:14,099 --> 00:55:17,579
the UK right and you're going to say to

1256
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:19,980
them look guys come and do some training

1257
00:55:17,579 --> 00:55:22,260
come and uh you know give some time to

1258
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:25,199
this endeavor you're going to have to

1259
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:27,420
explain to them what's in it for them

1260
00:55:25,199 --> 00:55:29,578
um the good thing is we've now got

1261
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:32,579
countries like Australia where GPS are

1262
00:55:29,579 --> 00:55:34,980
prescribing regularly and I think if you

1263
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:37,200
can perhaps demonstrate to GPS in the UK

1264
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:38,699
that by prescribing medical cannabis in

1265
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:40,259
place of some of the other treatments

1266
00:55:38,699 --> 00:55:42,239
that you are giving whether it be

1267
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:44,640
opioids or whatever you may actually

1268
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:46,199
start to see your patients coming less

1269
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:47,818
and less because they're able to manage

1270
00:55:46,199 --> 00:55:50,578
their conditions more on their own with

1271
00:55:47,818 --> 00:55:52,079
the medical cannabis that would be in my

1272
00:55:50,579 --> 00:55:54,599
view the way you could really encourage

1273
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:57,059
GPS to get involved and and make that

1274
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:59,280
effort and put that time in to um

1275
00:55:57,059 --> 00:56:02,099
to get involved in this in this

1276
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:04,500
prescribing regime we're still waiting

1277
00:56:02,099 --> 00:56:07,380
to see whether the NHS or or the

1278
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:08,699
authorities would authorize a GP trial

1279
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:11,160
but hopefully it will happen soon

1280
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:13,939
because it's a really important part in

1281
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:13,940
moving things forward

1282
00:56:14,338 --> 00:56:18,358
so advertising medical cannabis is

1283
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:19,920
really really tough as I said the

1284
00:56:18,358 --> 00:56:22,199
medical cannabis companies are desperate

1285
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:25,079
to advertise and in fact

1286
00:56:22,199 --> 00:56:27,539
um there was a recent well in the last

1287
00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:30,059
year there's been a a company in the UK

1288
00:56:27,539 --> 00:56:32,279
called dispensaroo which is basically a

1289
00:56:30,059 --> 00:56:34,200
recreational Cannabis company okay it's

1290
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:36,420
a website you can go on there you can

1291
00:56:34,199 --> 00:56:38,039
buy your weed you can buy THC Vapes you

1292
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:39,119
pay in crypto it gets delivered to your

1293
00:56:38,039 --> 00:56:41,579
house

1294
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:42,960
obviously completely illegal and they

1295
00:56:41,579 --> 00:56:44,960
had quite a lot of press attention

1296
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:47,338
because they did some Guerrilla

1297
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:50,159
advertising whereby they made up some

1298
00:56:47,338 --> 00:56:53,338
tube posters to go on the train and just

1299
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:54,960
slid it over the the legit posters uh it

1300
00:56:53,338 --> 00:56:56,818
got picked up by all the mainstream

1301
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:58,858
media the guy behind it is giving

1302
00:56:56,818 --> 00:57:02,159
interviews to National newspapers

1303
00:56:58,858 --> 00:57:04,558
obviously anonymously and I thought this

1304
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:06,539
guy's gonna be in jail very soon you

1305
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:07,920
know nine to 12 months on is still

1306
00:57:06,539 --> 00:57:09,539
happening and it's getting picked up in

1307
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:11,159
the Press again and I just can't cannot

1308
00:57:09,539 --> 00:57:12,539
believe that

1309
00:57:11,159 --> 00:57:15,539
um the police haven't done anything

1310
00:57:12,539 --> 00:57:16,980
about it they're clearly quite smart you

1311
00:57:15,539 --> 00:57:18,539
know to cover their tracks and make it

1312
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:20,338
as hard as they can for the authorities

1313
00:57:18,539 --> 00:57:23,880
to um

1314
00:57:20,338 --> 00:57:25,440
to find them but the the point of that

1315
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:27,420
story is that medical cannabis companies

1316
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,980
would kill for that kind of exposure you

1317
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:30,659
know to have articles being written

1318
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:32,579
about what they are doing in The

1319
00:57:30,659 --> 00:57:34,679
Independent in the guardian in the in

1320
00:57:32,579 --> 00:57:36,720
the evening standard on a regular basis

1321
00:57:34,679 --> 00:57:39,598
they would love to be able to do that

1322
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:41,719
but our regulations are very very strict

1323
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:41,720
um

1324
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:52,880
is it this one

1325
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:56,119
yeah

1326
00:57:56,338 --> 00:58:02,578
anyway much like um

1327
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:04,980
uh Silk Roads the the you know the

1328
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:07,380
online platform for a listed products

1329
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:09,599
the on the dark web

1330
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:11,400
they caught the dread pirate Roberts in

1331
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:13,500
the end you know what I mean so how long

1332
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:14,700
these guys at dispensaru can get away

1333
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:17,219
with it

1334
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:18,719
um I don't know but the the fact of the

1335
00:58:17,219 --> 00:58:20,578
matter is that medical cannabis

1336
00:58:18,719 --> 00:58:23,519
companies are worried about

1337
00:58:20,579 --> 00:58:24,900
uh businesses like dispensaru

1338
00:58:23,519 --> 00:58:27,179
um how are they going to be able to

1339
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:30,240
encourage patients to to get into the

1340
00:58:27,179 --> 00:58:31,618
legal Medical Market if the with these

1341
00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:33,299
recreational cannabis companies are

1342
00:58:31,619 --> 00:58:34,858
effectively setting up and are able to

1343
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:36,359
to get away with it

1344
00:58:34,858 --> 00:58:40,098
um I suspect the police are under

1345
00:58:36,358 --> 00:58:44,539
pressure to try and um

1346
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:44,539
I can take it from there I think yeah

1347
00:58:44,639 --> 00:58:50,699
spray but that's okay no worries

1348
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:52,798
um but yeah it's it's a real issue for

1349
00:58:50,699 --> 00:58:55,139
for medical cannabis companies and what

1350
00:58:52,798 --> 00:58:57,420
happened recently there was an article

1351
00:58:55,139 --> 00:59:00,719
in some of the Cannabis Publications

1352
00:58:57,420 --> 00:59:03,659
like business can like um uh cannabis

1353
00:59:00,719 --> 00:59:05,639
wealth about an import of some medical

1354
00:59:03,659 --> 00:59:07,379
cannabis from by an Australian company

1355
00:59:05,639 --> 00:59:08,699
into the UK

1356
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:10,619
um and it had come from I think their

1357
00:59:08,699 --> 00:59:12,899
cultivation site in Jamaica and it was

1358
00:59:10,619 --> 00:59:15,119
the first import of medical cannabis

1359
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:16,740
from Jamaica into the UK and business

1360
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:18,240
can and cannabis wealth they wrote These

1361
00:59:16,739 --> 00:59:19,858
amazing articles saying what a great

1362
00:59:18,239 --> 00:59:22,199
company what a great product what an

1363
00:59:19,858 --> 00:59:23,818
amazing thing and the CEO of another

1364
00:59:22,199 --> 00:59:27,239
medical cannabis company who I won't

1365
00:59:23,818 --> 00:59:28,739
name emailed the Australian company they

1366
00:59:27,239 --> 00:59:31,318
emailed the Jamaican company they

1367
00:59:28,739 --> 00:59:33,419
emailed cannabis wealth email business

1368
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:35,279
can and said guys this is promotional

1369
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:37,019
material if you don't take this down by

1370
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,519
4 pm today I'm going to snitch on you to

1371
00:59:37,019 --> 00:59:40,559
the medicines and Healthcare regulatory

1372
00:59:38,519 --> 00:59:42,000
Authority so whilst this medical

1373
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:43,798
cannabis company is desperate to

1374
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,420
advertise they will absolutely make sure

1375
00:59:43,798 --> 00:59:46,798
that nobody else is able to do it if

1376
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:48,838
they can't as well that's that's the

1377
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:51,420
current state of the industry

1378
00:59:48,838 --> 00:59:53,159
um I know about this because the

1379
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:54,780
Australian company sent the article to

1380
00:59:53,159 --> 00:59:56,159
me and said Robert what's our exposure

1381
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:58,140
here and I was like yeah you've got this

1382
00:59:56,159 --> 01:00:00,358
is this is promotional material you've

1383
00:59:58,139 --> 01:00:01,920
gone beyond factual into the promotional

1384
01:00:00,358 --> 01:00:04,139
realm you're starting to you know tell

1385
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:05,940
everyone it's an amazing product and you

1386
01:00:04,139 --> 01:00:06,900
just can't do it

1387
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:11,039
um

1388
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:13,500
and this is where maybe now there is a

1389
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:15,239
potential crossover between the CBD

1390
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:17,940
market and the medical cannabis market

1391
01:00:15,239 --> 01:00:20,098
now I'm not talking about CBD today and

1392
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:21,900
I think the reality in the UK is that

1393
01:00:20,099 --> 01:00:23,460
CBD is about reaching its peak there's

1394
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:26,760
not too much growth left in that that

1395
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:29,338
market what cud companies do have

1396
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:30,900
is they've got a huge database of CBD

1397
01:00:29,338 --> 01:00:33,058
consumers that they that have been

1398
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:36,420
buying their products for the last four

1399
01:00:33,059 --> 01:00:40,920
five six years right and if you have a

1400
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:43,920
CRM of 80 000 consumers who maybe are

1401
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:46,318
paying between 100 and 200 pounds a

1402
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:49,400
month for your products

1403
01:00:46,318 --> 01:00:52,619
that would be a really really useful

1404
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:54,900
platform to to leverage to try and pull

1405
01:00:52,619 --> 01:00:55,798
those consumers into the legal Market if

1406
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:58,260
you could

1407
01:00:55,798 --> 01:01:00,599
you know access that 80 000 you only

1408
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:02,640
need a conversion rate of about three

1409
01:01:00,599 --> 01:01:05,818
four five percent and you're starting to

1410
01:01:02,639 --> 01:01:07,078
generate serious serious numbers so one

1411
01:01:05,818 --> 01:01:08,699
of the things that I've been thinking

1412
01:01:07,079 --> 01:01:10,619
about is how can

1413
01:01:08,699 --> 01:01:12,659
medical cannabis companies team up with

1414
01:01:10,619 --> 01:01:15,660
CBD companies now to leverage that

1415
01:01:12,659 --> 01:01:18,000
consumer base and try and pull more

1416
01:01:15,659 --> 01:01:19,798
people into the into the market

1417
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,539
um whether it will happen or not I don't

1418
01:01:19,798 --> 01:01:24,259
know but um I think it would be a really

1419
01:01:21,539 --> 01:01:24,259
really good idea

1420
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:30,298
so here's a really interesting one

1421
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:32,520
um patient power in the UK is

1422
01:01:30,298 --> 01:01:34,199
substantial okay the medical cannabis

1423
01:01:32,519 --> 01:01:35,940
patients in the UK have a very very

1424
01:01:34,199 --> 01:01:37,679
powerful voice

1425
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:40,079
um and this is a screenshot from a

1426
01:01:37,679 --> 01:01:42,480
website called Med Bud Wiki

1427
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:44,400
um it is a website that is run by a chap

1428
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:46,260
called Ralph Leonardo McMurray and he is

1429
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:48,119
a phenomenal resource the amount of time

1430
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:49,200
and effort he puts into putting this

1431
01:01:48,119 --> 01:01:51,358
together

1432
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:54,118
um he's quite astonishing and what this

1433
01:01:51,358 --> 01:01:55,558
website does is it lists all of the

1434
01:01:54,119 --> 01:01:57,119
available medical cannabis products

1435
01:01:55,559 --> 01:02:00,000
currently on the market it lists the

1436
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:03,720
price point it lists uh where it comes

1437
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:05,818
from it has patient reviews it is an

1438
01:02:03,719 --> 01:02:07,739
incredibly powerful resource amongst the

1439
01:02:05,818 --> 01:02:09,420
patients and now it's being used by the

1440
01:02:07,739 --> 01:02:11,039
medical cannabis companies to see which

1441
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:13,500
products the patients like which

1442
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:17,639
products they are coming back for

1443
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:19,798
um and a bad review on midbud Wiki for

1444
01:02:17,639 --> 01:02:21,539
your product is is a serious serious

1445
01:02:19,798 --> 01:02:23,818
deal now most medical cannabis companies

1446
01:02:21,539 --> 01:02:26,579
in the UK will have a patient liaison

1447
01:02:23,818 --> 01:02:28,558
officer who is you know dedicated to

1448
01:02:26,579 --> 01:02:29,940
monitoring this resource and making sure

1449
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:31,559
that their products are getting good

1450
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:33,720
reviews

1451
01:02:31,559 --> 01:02:35,160
um and and it means that these companies

1452
01:02:33,719 --> 01:02:38,279
have to work really really hard to get

1453
01:02:35,159 --> 01:02:41,219
rid of delays and poor quality products

1454
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:43,440
because as I said getting a patient into

1455
01:02:41,219 --> 01:02:48,259
the medical cannabis Market is one thing

1456
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:48,260
keeping them is is is is even harder

1457
01:02:48,659 --> 01:02:52,259
as I said the cost is a big problem

1458
01:02:51,539 --> 01:02:55,380
um

1459
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:56,819
again this goes into who are you

1460
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:58,858
targeting to get into the medical

1461
01:02:56,818 --> 01:03:00,779
cannabis market now obviously we'd love

1462
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:02,039
to have all of the pain patients in

1463
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:03,480
there but as I said before if they're

1464
01:03:02,039 --> 01:03:05,579
already receiving medication and

1465
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:06,960
treatment for free from the NHS it's

1466
01:03:05,579 --> 01:03:09,059
going to be very hard to persuade them

1467
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:11,760
to stop that and start paying 200 250

1468
01:03:09,059 --> 01:03:14,460
pounds a month for medical cannabis so

1469
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:16,920
this is where it perhaps starts to get a

1470
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:18,599
bit controversial and and in the UK for

1471
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:20,760
the last four or five years every time

1472
01:03:18,599 --> 01:03:22,619
you go to see a talk or a panel events

1473
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:24,540
on medical cannabis it's the same thing

1474
01:03:22,619 --> 01:03:27,240
put the patient first put the patient

1475
01:03:24,539 --> 01:03:28,199
first put the patient first right

1476
01:03:27,239 --> 01:03:30,298
um

1477
01:03:28,199 --> 01:03:32,939
don't get me wrong patient access and

1478
01:03:30,298 --> 01:03:35,639
patient experience is a vital importance

1479
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:36,539
okay but if we don't start to figure out

1480
01:03:35,639 --> 01:03:38,338
a way

1481
01:03:36,539 --> 01:03:39,900
so these companies to actually make

1482
01:03:38,338 --> 01:03:41,639
money and be profitable I know a lot of

1483
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:43,260
patients think that medical cannabis

1484
01:03:41,639 --> 01:03:45,179
companies are incredibly greedy and

1485
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:46,559
they're making millions I promise you is

1486
01:03:45,179 --> 01:03:49,019
quite the opposite

1487
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:50,880
um if we don't figure out a way to ease

1488
01:03:49,019 --> 01:03:53,219
the cost burden and the regulatory

1489
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:54,780
burden on medical cannabis companies

1490
01:03:53,219 --> 01:03:56,699
um we're not going to have a medical

1491
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:59,460
cannabis industry for patients to access

1492
01:03:56,699 --> 01:04:01,379
so it's really important yes you've got

1493
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:03,059
to put the patient first and it is an

1494
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:04,260
important factor

1495
01:04:03,059 --> 01:04:06,359
but we've got to start talking about

1496
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:07,559
profits as well how is it that these

1497
01:04:06,358 --> 01:04:10,019
companies are actually going to be

1498
01:04:07,559 --> 01:04:14,059
profitable be successful and and still

1499
01:04:10,019 --> 01:04:14,059
be here in three four five years time

1500
01:04:14,099 --> 01:04:19,019
as I said you ignore the patient lobby

1501
01:04:17,099 --> 01:04:21,599
at your peril you know they are they are

1502
01:04:19,019 --> 01:04:23,699
they are well voiced they are they are

1503
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:25,619
influential

1504
01:04:23,699 --> 01:04:28,318
um and and medical cannabis companies

1505
01:04:25,619 --> 01:04:30,119
are really taking notice

1506
01:04:28,318 --> 01:04:32,818
and finally look

1507
01:04:30,119 --> 01:04:35,760
if it fits the

1508
01:04:32,818 --> 01:04:37,858
if it's the regulatory burden that is

1509
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:39,660
causing a lot of these problems then you

1510
01:04:37,858 --> 01:04:41,519
would look to the government to try and

1511
01:04:39,659 --> 01:04:43,739
help okay we need some sort of

1512
01:04:41,519 --> 01:04:46,858
intervention from the government here to

1513
01:04:43,739 --> 01:04:49,798
either ease the regulatory burden uh to

1514
01:04:46,858 --> 01:04:53,039
to boost the industry in some way

1515
01:04:49,798 --> 01:04:55,259
I went to an event with this CMC a few

1516
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:56,579
months ago and we were told the center

1517
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:59,339
for medicinal cannabis a very

1518
01:04:56,579 --> 01:05:01,140
influential organization in the UK very

1519
01:04:59,338 --> 01:05:02,940
closely linked to the Tory party you

1520
01:05:01,139 --> 01:05:05,818
know they were influential in getting

1521
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:08,099
medical cannabis legalized in the UK and

1522
01:05:05,818 --> 01:05:10,798
we were told that the government doesn't

1523
01:05:08,099 --> 01:05:13,980
care they their their position was that

1524
01:05:10,798 --> 01:05:15,900
in 2018 we took action to legalize our

1525
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:18,719
job is done you know we did what we had

1526
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:20,579
to do it's up to you to run with it

1527
01:05:18,719 --> 01:05:22,500
um

1528
01:05:20,579 --> 01:05:24,359
the government doesn't care

1529
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:26,059
then that's a really really big problem

1530
01:05:24,358 --> 01:05:29,400
you're going to need

1531
01:05:26,059 --> 01:05:32,579
governmental support to to actually make

1532
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:35,039
the UK a thriving medical cannabis

1533
01:05:32,579 --> 01:05:36,720
industry if they don't help then it's

1534
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:38,940
not going to happen

1535
01:05:36,719 --> 01:05:40,500
um hopefully I think we'll have a change

1536
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:43,858
of government in the relatively near

1537
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:45,539
future and um again and that's a meeting

1538
01:05:43,858 --> 01:05:46,920
when I suggested you know we need a

1539
01:05:45,539 --> 01:05:48,599
change of government I was told no no no

1540
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:50,400
no no nothing good will come from that

1541
01:05:48,599 --> 01:05:51,838
well in my view what could be worse than

1542
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,818
they don't care

1543
01:05:51,838 --> 01:05:55,679
you know it couldn't be any worse with a

1544
01:05:53,818 --> 01:05:56,940
change of government so I'm very hopeful

1545
01:05:55,679 --> 01:05:59,159
we'll have a change of government soon

1546
01:05:56,940 --> 01:06:00,659
and then hopefully we may start to get

1547
01:05:59,159 --> 01:06:02,578
the support that we need to move the

1548
01:06:00,659 --> 01:06:05,719
industry forward yes

1549
01:06:02,579 --> 01:06:08,400
so the United States at the retail book

1550
01:06:05,719 --> 01:06:10,798
the biggest cost drivers are performed

1551
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:13,798
at that position costs labor and then

1552
01:06:10,798 --> 01:06:16,199
Federal Taxation and settled from there

1553
01:06:13,798 --> 01:06:18,719
there's really nothing no profitability

1554
01:06:16,199 --> 01:06:21,899
yeah not even for your rents or anything

1555
01:06:18,719 --> 01:06:24,000
about that in church of profitability in

1556
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:26,880
the UK what what are the big cost

1557
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:29,460
writers that's that's preventing the

1558
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:31,140
profit bill so is the the licensing

1559
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:33,240
obligations the actual cost and

1560
01:06:31,139 --> 01:06:36,239
difficulty of getting the licenses and

1561
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:38,098
maintaining the licenses is substantial

1562
01:06:36,239 --> 01:06:40,199
um

1563
01:06:38,099 --> 01:06:42,359
what companies want to do is they want

1564
01:06:40,199 --> 01:06:44,098
to bring in just you know big bags of of

1565
01:06:42,358 --> 01:06:45,659
dried flour and then package it up

1566
01:06:44,099 --> 01:06:49,440
themselves and distribute it they can't

1567
01:06:45,659 --> 01:06:51,179
do that unless um in certain conditions

1568
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:52,920
um so the product is having to come in

1569
01:06:51,179 --> 01:06:54,960
as a finished product and and obviously

1570
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:57,059
every other step of the supply chain

1571
01:06:54,960 --> 01:07:00,000
someone is taking their margin so by the

1572
01:06:57,059 --> 01:07:02,640
time we then get to the doctors uh

1573
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:05,159
you've got uh you know the the fee of

1574
01:07:02,639 --> 01:07:07,019
paying the doctors uh running the clinic

1575
01:07:05,159 --> 01:07:08,818
and as I understand it with a lot of

1576
01:07:07,019 --> 01:07:10,920
these medical cannabis clinics and that

1577
01:07:08,818 --> 01:07:13,500
that have physical clinics their cash

1578
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:15,838
burn rate is insane right so until you

1579
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:18,298
can start getting the patient numbers up

1580
01:07:15,838 --> 01:07:19,019
they are just losing money

1581
01:07:18,298 --> 01:07:21,538
um

1582
01:07:19,019 --> 01:07:23,400
so so this is this is where we come to

1583
01:07:21,539 --> 01:07:24,720
the the inflection point in the next two

1584
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:25,798
or three years if the government is not

1585
01:07:24,719 --> 01:07:27,659
going to help what are we going to do

1586
01:07:25,798 --> 01:07:29,699
it's my last slide no I'm nearly

1587
01:07:27,659 --> 01:07:32,338
finished

1588
01:07:29,699 --> 01:07:36,000
um so first of all

1589
01:07:32,338 --> 01:07:38,519
2023 is going to be survival okay uh

1590
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,798
most medical cannabis companies would

1591
01:07:38,519 --> 01:07:42,358
playing the survival game last year is

1592
01:07:40,798 --> 01:07:43,440
probably going to continue this year as

1593
01:07:42,358 --> 01:07:45,900
well

1594
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:47,880
um you're going to see uh a lot of

1595
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:49,619
consolidation in the market we're

1596
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:52,140
already starting to see it in CBD

1597
01:07:49,619 --> 01:07:53,818
lovehem filed for administration

1598
01:07:52,139 --> 01:07:57,179
um a lot of sort of mergers as well have

1599
01:07:53,818 --> 01:07:58,619
have fallen away do not be surprised if

1600
01:07:57,179 --> 01:08:00,118
you see some of the really big players

1601
01:07:58,619 --> 01:08:02,640
in the medical UK medical cannabis

1602
01:08:00,119 --> 01:08:05,640
Market disappear either disappear or be

1603
01:08:02,639 --> 01:08:07,078
acquired or or be absorbed by by a

1604
01:08:05,639 --> 01:08:09,798
bigger player that's definitely going to

1605
01:08:07,079 --> 01:08:09,798
happen this year

1606
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:16,798
presence no that's okay so the last

1607
01:08:14,099 --> 01:08:19,980
thing I'm going to say is um

1608
01:08:16,798 --> 01:08:22,079
my first experience of of legal cannabis

1609
01:08:19,979 --> 01:08:24,419
was in California in 2012 and I was

1610
01:08:22,079 --> 01:08:26,338
walking down Venice Beach and there was

1611
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:28,319
all of these touts on this on the on the

1612
01:08:26,338 --> 01:08:30,119
beach saying you know come in and see

1613
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:31,319
our doctor pay your forty dollars and

1614
01:08:30,119 --> 01:08:33,420
you'll get your prescription and it was

1615
01:08:31,319 --> 01:08:35,219
amazing because they had this sign of

1616
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:37,259
medical conditions and you had really

1617
01:08:35,219 --> 01:08:38,399
serious stuff at the top cancer multiple

1618
01:08:37,259 --> 01:08:40,079
sclerosis that sort of thing and then

1619
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:42,119
down at the bottom you had stress and

1620
01:08:40,079 --> 01:08:43,738
you know sleep and that sort of thing

1621
01:08:42,119 --> 01:08:45,179
and you go in and they say oh do you

1622
01:08:43,738 --> 01:08:47,218
ever get stressed at work and you say

1623
01:08:45,179 --> 01:08:49,440
yeah I do I do get stressed at work

1624
01:08:47,219 --> 01:08:51,600
there's your prescription you know and

1625
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:53,219
and it was amazing and then you know I

1626
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:54,960
was there with a girlfriend at the time

1627
01:08:53,219 --> 01:08:56,640
and one of the towels shouted after us

1628
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:59,460
you know couples that blazed together

1629
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:02,160
stays together you know and and the

1630
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:05,460
reality of that in California in 2012

1631
01:09:02,159 --> 01:09:08,278
you had a wreck Market masquerading as

1632
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:10,679
as a as a medical Market okay and

1633
01:09:08,279 --> 01:09:12,600
unfortunately this is where I'll get

1634
01:09:10,679 --> 01:09:14,219
lots of stick for saying this this is

1635
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:15,900
what needs to happen in the UK we need

1636
01:09:14,219 --> 01:09:16,859
to stop thinking about just patience and

1637
01:09:15,899 --> 01:09:19,920
you had to start thinking about

1638
01:09:16,859 --> 01:09:22,140
consumers one less person buying from

1639
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:23,699
the illicit Market is one more person

1640
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:25,500
buying from the legal Market whether

1641
01:09:23,698 --> 01:09:28,259
they are a patient whether or a consumer

1642
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:29,579
whatever it may be so it to my mind that

1643
01:09:28,259 --> 01:09:31,560
is the only way we are going to start

1644
01:09:29,579 --> 01:09:33,238
generating the patient numbers that we

1645
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:36,779
really need

1646
01:09:33,238 --> 01:09:38,879
um and hopefully we'll then end up like

1647
01:09:36,779 --> 01:09:41,400
places like California moving to a full

1648
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:44,279
adult use Market the risk of course is

1649
01:09:41,399 --> 01:09:46,379
if the media get hold of uh you know

1650
01:09:44,279 --> 01:09:48,239
evidence that we have a wreck Market

1651
01:09:46,380 --> 01:09:49,980
masquerading as medical then that could

1652
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:51,298
be really problematic in the UK but

1653
01:09:49,979 --> 01:09:53,278
unfortunately

1654
01:09:51,298 --> 01:09:54,899
um we've got to get patient numbers up

1655
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:56,820
and that means taking some fairly

1656
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:58,139
radical and Innovative approaches to

1657
01:09:56,819 --> 01:09:59,340
putting more people into the legal

1658
01:09:58,140 --> 01:10:00,490
Market

1659
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:06,800
thank you very much

1660
01:10:00,489 --> 01:10:09,179
[Applause]

1661
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:10,980
how did you

1662
01:10:09,179 --> 01:10:14,000
a final speaker of the league of hell up

1663
01:10:10,979 --> 01:10:17,039
today Daniel Heyman from Switzerland

1664
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:20,819
there's a lot of activity in this uh

1665
01:10:17,039 --> 01:10:24,719
also crap I like have you

1666
01:10:20,819 --> 01:10:27,920
yeah promise me so I'm sad this thing is

1667
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:27,920
banged up that's okay

1668
01:10:28,319 --> 01:10:32,939
okay hi thank you very much my name is

1669
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:35,640
Daniel Heyman I'm a corporate and life

1670
01:10:32,939 --> 01:10:38,039
science lawyer from Zurich I was

1671
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:41,940
previously a Commodities Trader so I'm

1672
01:10:38,039 --> 01:10:44,939
not sure on Woody Allen's uh Stairway To

1673
01:10:41,939 --> 01:10:48,119
Hell whether I moved up or down I I

1674
01:10:44,939 --> 01:10:50,039
leave that to you I know that we don't

1675
01:10:48,119 --> 01:10:51,899
have too much time left so I'm gonna do

1676
01:10:50,039 --> 01:10:53,819
that relatively quick and dirty without

1677
01:10:51,899 --> 01:10:57,119
presentation

1678
01:10:53,819 --> 01:11:00,179
um the framework that is embraced in

1679
01:10:57,119 --> 01:11:03,238
Switzerland for uh legal

1680
01:11:00,179 --> 01:11:04,199
for the whole Market is the narcotics

1681
01:11:03,238 --> 01:11:06,959
Act

1682
01:11:04,198 --> 01:11:09,899
and in Switzerland cannabis with the THC

1683
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:12,480
content up to one percent is considered

1684
01:11:09,899 --> 01:11:15,960
is not considered a narcotic drug and

1685
01:11:12,479 --> 01:11:20,158
everything above is a narcotic drug

1686
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:22,500
in the law it says Delta 9 THC and its

1687
01:11:20,158 --> 01:11:25,139
isomers so here already the first

1688
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:27,658
question thc8

1689
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:30,659
and any other compounds that have the

1690
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:32,179
same sum formula and molecular weight as

1691
01:11:30,658 --> 01:11:35,279
thc9

1692
01:11:32,179 --> 01:11:37,679
Delta 9 is considered a narcotic drug

1693
01:11:35,279 --> 01:11:41,158
and based on that framework we basically

1694
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:44,520
have three different classifications the

1695
01:11:41,158 --> 01:11:47,339
first one is cannabis with a THC content

1696
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:49,679
below one percent let's say the CBD

1697
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:51,779
market and then everything that goes

1698
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:54,658
above one percent is either the medical

1699
01:11:51,779 --> 01:11:56,579
Market or the non-medical adult use

1700
01:11:54,658 --> 01:11:58,859
Market or slash recreational Market

1701
01:11:56,579 --> 01:12:02,279
let's speak first about the CBD Market

1702
01:11:58,859 --> 01:12:03,420
Switzerland's relatively big on cannabis

1703
01:12:02,279 --> 01:12:04,559
flower

1704
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:06,840
it's probably one of the biggest

1705
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:08,760
producers in Europe of cannabis flour

1706
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:12,300
and also one of the biggest exporters of

1707
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:15,239
cannabis flour and the way CPD is

1708
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:17,279
regulated really depends on how you as a

1709
01:12:15,238 --> 01:12:19,619
producer classify and bring the product

1710
01:12:17,279 --> 01:12:21,539
to Market so cannabis flour is a

1711
01:12:19,619 --> 01:12:24,420
smokable mostly

1712
01:12:21,539 --> 01:12:26,760
and as a smokable it's tobacco

1713
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:28,560
substitute law that applies in

1714
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:30,600
Switzerland freely marketable which

1715
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:32,340
makes it relatively special in Europe

1716
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:35,100
now other markets are joining Czech

1717
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:36,199
Republic and so on but this Market is

1718
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:39,960
still

1719
01:12:36,198 --> 01:12:42,178
depending on on where the flower is sold

1720
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:43,500
in growth or in retraction mode but it's

1721
01:12:42,179 --> 01:12:46,679
cyclical

1722
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:49,859
then we have other products like e

1723
01:12:46,679 --> 01:12:53,760
cigarettes and vaporizers that are

1724
01:12:49,859 --> 01:12:57,539
considered as classified as a

1725
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:59,820
utility article for human contact and as

1726
01:12:57,539 --> 01:13:01,920
such it is also absolutely freely

1727
01:12:59,819 --> 01:13:04,079
marketable in Switzerland

1728
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:05,640
then we have the Cosmetic products all

1729
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:08,399
the Cosmetic problems I can tell you a

1730
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:10,260
lot about the Cosmetics it's been quite

1731
01:13:08,399 --> 01:13:14,039
a ride because

1732
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:17,520
cannabis oils for example either with

1733
01:13:14,039 --> 01:13:21,119
CBD isolate or full spectrum have been

1734
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:25,020
marketed in Switzerland as chemicals

1735
01:13:21,119 --> 01:13:27,119
first then or even as foodstuffs first

1736
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:29,580
and once all this advertisement the

1737
01:13:27,119 --> 01:13:31,619
government realized that doesn't work

1738
01:13:29,579 --> 01:13:33,899
because of Novel food regulation also

1739
01:13:31,619 --> 01:13:35,420
applies in Switzerland by the way as in

1740
01:13:33,899 --> 01:13:38,219
the EU

1741
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:39,719
they moved to chemicals and then they

1742
01:13:38,219 --> 01:13:40,319
moved to

1743
01:13:39,719 --> 01:13:43,079
um

1744
01:13:40,319 --> 01:13:45,899
cosmetic products which is an

1745
01:13:43,079 --> 01:13:48,420
interesting stretch and obviously the

1746
01:13:45,899 --> 01:13:50,039
authorities don't like this change in

1747
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:52,199
classifications because the product

1748
01:13:50,039 --> 01:13:54,600
themselves didn't really change

1749
01:13:52,198 --> 01:13:56,519
our arguments was always that as long as

1750
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:58,620
the products are safe and comply with

1751
01:13:56,520 --> 01:14:00,960
all the regulations they should be

1752
01:13:58,619 --> 01:14:02,760
in the market and there should be a

1753
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:06,060
valid way to be able to Market these

1754
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:09,119
products so that's for the CBD Market

1755
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:12,360
in general let's speak about the medical

1756
01:14:09,119 --> 01:14:14,939
market so ta cannabis with the THC

1757
01:14:12,359 --> 01:14:19,738
content of one percent and above in

1758
01:14:14,939 --> 01:14:21,839
Switzerland was an exception so there

1759
01:14:19,738 --> 01:14:24,119
was a way to market for these products

1760
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:26,039
but only with the special permit from

1761
01:14:24,119 --> 01:14:28,019
the health Ministry and that changed

1762
01:14:26,039 --> 01:14:31,500
last October where the market really

1763
01:14:28,020 --> 01:14:33,360
opened up so cannabis with a THC content

1764
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:37,859
of one percent and up for medical

1765
01:14:33,359 --> 01:14:40,559
purposes became a controlled substance

1766
01:14:37,859 --> 01:14:43,380
no longer prohibited narcotic

1767
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:45,900
with limited marketability so these

1768
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:47,579
products today they can go to market and

1769
01:14:45,899 --> 01:14:49,439
the big difference is that doctors can

1770
01:14:47,579 --> 01:14:50,880
prescribe them freely they no longer

1771
01:14:49,439 --> 01:14:53,879
have to run to the health Ministry and

1772
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:55,619
ask for a special permit and also the

1773
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:57,719
patient doesn't have to be half dead and

1774
01:14:55,619 --> 01:14:59,939
have tried everything else before you

1775
01:14:57,719 --> 01:15:03,060
can get access to medical cannabis

1776
01:14:59,939 --> 01:15:05,819
obviously we have quite a big problem in

1777
01:15:03,060 --> 01:15:08,100
the medical Market also just one

1778
01:15:05,819 --> 01:15:10,559
there's a licensing system that was

1779
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:12,659
introduced it's all now transparent

1780
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:14,400
there's a way to market for producers

1781
01:15:12,658 --> 01:15:15,658
but it's quite complex I'm not going to

1782
01:15:14,399 --> 01:15:17,879
go into that today

1783
01:15:15,658 --> 01:15:19,079
but in reality it's already been

1784
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:21,960
mentioned so I'm not going to repeat

1785
01:15:19,079 --> 01:15:23,640
most of that there's still a problem of

1786
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:26,039
awareness doctors don't have enough

1787
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:28,020
education and the biggest issue is

1788
01:15:26,039 --> 01:15:29,760
reimbursement medical cannabis is that

1789
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:31,620
person reimbursed by the health

1790
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:34,020
insurance in Switzerland

1791
01:15:31,619 --> 01:15:37,859
you actually have to show and you have

1792
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:39,780
to prepare a whole dossier and hand it

1793
01:15:37,859 --> 01:15:41,279
in in order to get reimbursement but

1794
01:15:39,779 --> 01:15:43,139
it's getting there it's there's

1795
01:15:41,279 --> 01:15:46,559
companies Who start and help with this

1796
01:15:43,140 --> 01:15:49,020
process I'm also helping the doctors

1797
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:51,060
with administrative burdens so just to

1798
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:53,179
go back to what Robert just said earlier

1799
01:15:51,060 --> 01:15:55,920
I agree we need to show medical

1800
01:15:53,179 --> 01:15:57,719
companies how to make money but one of

1801
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:59,460
the big big issues is that we don't have

1802
01:15:57,719 --> 01:16:01,800
the buy-ins from the from the healthcare

1803
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:05,158
professionals and we really have to find

1804
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:07,739
a way to educate doctors and to

1805
01:16:05,158 --> 01:16:09,658
facilitate their life in order to

1806
01:16:07,738 --> 01:16:11,639
understand how they can easily prescribe

1807
01:16:09,658 --> 01:16:14,279
medical cannabis and actually have a

1808
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:16,679
benefit from that also we have another

1809
01:16:14,279 --> 01:16:18,840
challenge that for a lot of GPS General

1810
01:16:16,679 --> 01:16:22,199
Practitioners in Switzerland one of the

1811
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:24,360
big income streams is self-dispensation

1812
01:16:22,198 --> 01:16:27,299
as B and because we have like a

1813
01:16:24,359 --> 01:16:29,639
magisterial preparation framework in

1814
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:33,000
Switzerland where you need to have a

1815
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:35,340
two-tiered consultation first by the GP

1816
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:38,399
and then also by the pharmacy you cannot

1817
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:41,279
self-dispense cannabis in the Swiss uh

1818
01:16:38,399 --> 01:16:42,839
when you go to a GP so also the

1819
01:16:41,279 --> 01:16:46,559
financial incentive there is a bit lower

1820
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:48,119
for the GPS but it's not all GPS and we

1821
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:49,679
believe that there's various ways to

1822
01:16:48,119 --> 01:16:51,840
solve this problem but that's definitely

1823
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:53,399
one of the things that's uh that that's

1824
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:54,960
a problem

1825
01:16:53,399 --> 01:16:57,299
last

1826
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:59,880
we also have a data collection

1827
01:16:57,300 --> 01:17:01,920
obligation for doctors they have to

1828
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:03,840
collect data it's not sanctioned if they

1829
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:06,000
don't do it so let's see how what's

1830
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:08,159
going to happen there but

1831
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:10,380
they would like to comply and it's

1832
01:17:08,158 --> 01:17:12,599
definitely

1833
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:14,940
um a little bit of a burden for them and

1834
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:17,100
it might also be one of the reasons that

1835
01:17:14,939 --> 01:17:18,839
many people or many doctors say well I

1836
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:20,520
don't know I'm not going to page for

1837
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:22,020
this additional time additional burden

1838
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:25,620
I'm not going to do it

1839
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:28,699
let's speak about the lastly about the

1840
01:17:25,619 --> 01:17:32,340
recreational markets now in Switzerland

1841
01:17:28,698 --> 01:17:34,319
these products are illegal

1842
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:36,060
however there's been a change in the

1843
01:17:34,319 --> 01:17:38,519
narcotics act that allows for pilot

1844
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:41,880
trials so actually the first legal

1845
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:45,360
dispensation in pharmacies for the first

1846
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:49,739
pilot trial just happened last month in

1847
01:17:45,359 --> 01:17:53,219
Basel which is a great uh precedent I

1848
01:17:49,738 --> 01:17:55,259
would say and these these products come

1849
01:17:53,219 --> 01:17:57,719
in various ways at the moment the first

1850
01:17:55,260 --> 01:17:58,880
products are cannabis flowers that are

1851
01:17:57,719 --> 01:18:01,859
packaged

1852
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:03,179
the trials are always in the context of

1853
01:18:01,859 --> 01:18:07,259
a scientific

1854
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:09,539
trial scientific research and you have

1855
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:11,520
public and private organizations that

1856
01:18:09,539 --> 01:18:14,158
can apply at the federal Office of

1857
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:16,560
Public Health the health Ministry to

1858
01:18:14,158 --> 01:18:19,439
conduct such a trial so usually you need

1859
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:21,600
someone to finance the trial you need to

1860
01:18:19,439 --> 01:18:23,759
have a research institution you have to

1861
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:26,699
have the buy-in from a municipality

1862
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:29,460
because you can do it in one or a few

1863
01:18:26,698 --> 01:18:32,039
municipalities but not federal on the

1864
01:18:29,460 --> 01:18:33,840
federal level Nationwide and once you

1865
01:18:32,039 --> 01:18:37,738
have all these buy-ins and you have

1866
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:39,600
prepared your project if it is approved

1867
01:18:37,738 --> 01:18:43,259
you can go to market you can go to

1868
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:46,140
market either via Pharmacy social clubs

1869
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:48,480
or coffee shops so it's quite flexible

1870
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:50,579
you can even have edible so all the

1871
01:18:48,479 --> 01:18:52,619
product regulatory constraints that you

1872
01:18:50,579 --> 01:18:55,979
have for novel food and so on don't

1873
01:18:52,619 --> 01:18:58,140
apply in in this scheme

1874
01:18:55,979 --> 01:19:01,259
so you can have up to five thousand

1875
01:18:58,140 --> 01:19:03,179
people in in such a trial the term is

1876
01:19:01,260 --> 01:19:05,760
limited to five years possible to extend

1877
01:19:03,179 --> 01:19:09,239
another two years and you can actually

1878
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:12,780
dispense up to 10 grams per page per

1879
01:19:09,238 --> 01:19:14,459
consumer per month of pure THC which

1880
01:19:12,779 --> 01:19:17,039
translates to

1881
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:19,980
depending where you are the maximum THC

1882
01:19:17,039 --> 01:19:22,979
content is 20 in the product or 10

1883
01:19:19,979 --> 01:19:26,879
milligrams per serving it translates to

1884
01:19:22,979 --> 01:19:29,459
basically maybe 50 60 grams of

1885
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:31,679
of flour which is a lot of cannabis for

1886
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:32,819
one for one consumer

1887
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:34,319
so that's what's happening in

1888
01:19:32,819 --> 01:19:36,960
Switzerland at the same time there's

1889
01:19:34,319 --> 01:19:38,099
also and parallel to these to these uh

1890
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:40,800
trials

1891
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:44,340
there's also development parliamentary

1892
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:48,000
initiative that was um handed in a while

1893
01:19:44,340 --> 01:19:49,739
back it already passed through the

1894
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:52,439
national and state Council now the

1895
01:19:49,738 --> 01:19:54,359
National Council has the mandate to

1896
01:19:52,439 --> 01:19:57,419
prepare draft legislation for full

1897
01:19:54,359 --> 01:20:00,000
legalization of cannabis for non-medical

1898
01:19:57,420 --> 01:20:01,440
use in Switzerland I'm quite involved in

1899
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,079
the process with the industry

1900
01:20:01,439 --> 01:20:07,439
Association that they represent and it's

1901
01:20:04,079 --> 01:20:10,920
quite fun it's quite a challenge to find

1902
01:20:07,439 --> 01:20:12,719
the right framework on how public policy

1903
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:16,319
considerations

1904
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:18,658
can be aligned with uh with the goal of

1905
01:20:16,319 --> 01:20:23,340
of getting rid of the black market and

1906
01:20:18,658 --> 01:20:25,319
and also satisfy consumer the consumer

1907
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:26,940
perspective so we're trying to put all

1908
01:20:25,319 --> 01:20:28,738
these under one hat

1909
01:20:26,939 --> 01:20:30,539
and um

1910
01:20:28,738 --> 01:20:32,459
I believe that by the end of the year

1911
01:20:30,539 --> 01:20:34,800
this year or beginning of next year

1912
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:37,380
we're going to have the first draft for

1913
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:40,860
legalization of cannabis in Switzerland

1914
01:20:37,380 --> 01:20:43,440
and let's see where it goes from there

1915
01:20:40,859 --> 01:20:47,659
that's basically for me

1916
01:20:43,439 --> 01:20:54,000
I think was pretty quickly

1917
01:20:47,659 --> 01:20:56,880
[Applause]

1918
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:59,460
another q a I guess so yeah now it's to

1919
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:03,359
open it to the floor for any questions

1920
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:06,239
of a lot of issues uh you can see

1921
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:08,519
we're dealing with Germany the largest

1922
01:21:06,238 --> 01:21:11,299
beverage station in the European Union

1923
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:13,739
and that's movement towards regulation

1924
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:17,039
France which traditionally has a very

1925
01:21:13,738 --> 01:21:19,799
strong domestic market for cannabis and

1926
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:21,899
yet seems to be stuck in the soils

1927
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:24,600
the UK well

1928
01:21:21,899 --> 01:21:26,279
you know formerly in the EU now outside

1929
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:28,920
the EU

1930
01:21:26,279 --> 01:21:31,559
having made some progress towards

1931
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:33,899
regulation for medical use and then

1932
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:36,840
effectively the market evaporating as I

1933
01:21:33,899 --> 01:21:38,639
see it before uh the eyes of those are

1934
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:40,500
trying to get into the industry and then

1935
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:43,619
Switzerland kind of coming up with a

1936
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:45,000
very interesting pilot scheme um which

1937
01:21:43,619 --> 01:21:48,059
is of course going to be fodder for

1938
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:50,760
false for other jurisdictions who may be

1939
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:52,140
considering to get down that road first

1940
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:54,079
question I'm going to direct unless

1941
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:57,960
there are any questions from the floor

1942
01:21:54,079 --> 01:22:00,439
is this case that is coming before the

1943
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:03,179
federal courts in Germany on the

1944
01:22:00,439 --> 01:22:05,759
constitutionality of cannabis perhaps

1945
01:22:03,179 --> 01:22:09,960
Kai you might just a little elaborate a

1946
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:10,860
little bit on that for our listeners

1947
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:14,100
um

1948
01:22:10,859 --> 01:22:16,500
you can't really seriously right now I

1949
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:19,320
think it's coming or probably all at the

1950
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:21,359
same time in March so but what are the

1951
01:22:19,319 --> 01:22:23,819
general thrusts of what they are going

1952
01:22:21,359 --> 01:22:26,399
to argue in that case have you any kind

1953
01:22:23,819 --> 01:22:28,319
of insight in terms of what exactly do

1954
01:22:26,399 --> 01:22:30,119
you mean these in terms of for example

1955
01:22:28,319 --> 01:22:32,219
if we were taking a constitutional

1956
01:22:30,119 --> 01:22:34,019
challenge of an issue before a supreme

1957
01:22:32,219 --> 01:22:36,239
court we'd have certain grounds for

1958
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:37,980
making the art human human rights of

1959
01:22:36,238 --> 01:22:42,000
course just on the basic Article 2 and

1960
01:22:37,979 --> 01:22:45,979
article three article two is the free um

1961
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:49,140
free personality and article 3 is the

1962
01:22:45,979 --> 01:22:52,079
comparence to alcohol and the different

1963
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:54,119
treatment of these two substances and in

1964
01:22:52,079 --> 01:22:55,859
terms of the hierarchy of law obviously

1965
01:22:54,119 --> 01:22:57,658
and train

1966
01:22:55,859 --> 01:22:59,460
um German constitutional law the

1967
01:22:57,658 --> 01:23:01,500
International Convention on human rights

1968
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:02,480
and then the single narcotic stress

1969
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:05,658
convention

1970
01:23:02,479 --> 01:23:08,819
in terms of the trust of the argument

1971
01:23:05,658 --> 01:23:09,779
are they saying well the rights of the

1972
01:23:08,819 --> 01:23:11,939
individual

1973
01:23:09,779 --> 01:23:14,099
take precedence over some International

1974
01:23:11,939 --> 01:23:15,960
Convention is that the gist of the

1975
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:19,140
argument I'm making

1976
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:21,060
yes yes but for first and foremost it's

1977
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:22,940
the new scientific findings that

1978
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:26,400
cannabis is not

1979
01:23:22,939 --> 01:23:28,559
damaging in health and

1980
01:23:26,399 --> 01:23:31,619
is not a Gateway at work and all these

1981
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:35,820
old arguments which have we which we

1982
01:23:31,619 --> 01:23:39,238
have overcome so the mix of them all of

1983
01:23:35,819 --> 01:23:41,279
a lot of aspects the expansion of the

1984
01:23:39,238 --> 01:23:44,158
argument because under International no

1985
01:23:41,279 --> 01:23:47,099
of course we talk about you know control

1986
01:23:44,158 --> 01:23:49,559
drugs but cannabis is limited for

1987
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:51,300
medical and scientific use so they're

1988
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:53,820
really using this is the argument saying

1989
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:56,400
that at the time of the framing of the

1990
01:23:53,819 --> 01:23:59,340
convention of 1961 and the subsequent

1991
01:23:56,399 --> 01:24:01,319
psychotropic conventions in 72. the

1992
01:23:59,340 --> 01:24:04,619
understanding of medical and scientific

1993
01:24:01,319 --> 01:24:06,599
was nemeshit but in the current state of

1994
01:24:04,619 --> 01:24:08,880
our research knowledge that it should be

1995
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:10,140
expounded upon is that the just the way

1996
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:13,079
they're going with us

1997
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:15,420
ground spread okay Daniel

1998
01:24:13,079 --> 01:24:18,000
I'm very curious

1999
01:24:15,420 --> 01:24:19,980
um about the Swiss pile of Marvel in

2000
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:23,100
fact somebody said to me recently with

2001
01:24:19,979 --> 01:24:27,599
Switzerland is that no jurisdiction as

2002
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:30,719
of yet has managed to get regulation of

2003
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:32,039
cannabis whether it's the 21 states in

2004
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:34,679
the United States or some of the

2005
01:24:32,039 --> 01:24:37,140
jurisdictions like Uruguay

2006
01:24:34,679 --> 01:24:40,079
but they were very confident that the

2007
01:24:37,140 --> 01:24:41,820
Swiss model could be the route to go

2008
01:24:40,079 --> 01:24:44,519
down and I'm just kind of curious of

2009
01:24:41,819 --> 01:24:46,738
your perception how long is this

2010
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:49,080
particular pilot scheme set to run and I

2011
01:24:46,738 --> 01:24:53,099
understand it correct me if I'm wrong is

2012
01:24:49,079 --> 01:24:55,319
this burn was the first or uh Basel yes

2013
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:56,880
a Basel so how long is it supposed to

2014
01:24:55,319 --> 01:24:59,158
run for

2015
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:01,980
supposed to run by law between five and

2016
01:24:59,158 --> 01:25:03,899
seven years so five is the base and then

2017
01:25:01,979 --> 01:25:05,579
there's a possibility to extend by

2018
01:25:03,899 --> 01:25:07,500
another two years but as I mentioned

2019
01:25:05,579 --> 01:25:09,300
earlier yes and that's going to be the

2020
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:10,579
interesting question is we have a

2021
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:13,320
parallel

2022
01:25:10,579 --> 01:25:16,140
development happening on the legislative

2023
01:25:13,319 --> 01:25:18,599
side where again

2024
01:25:16,140 --> 01:25:21,239
we are and the government is really and

2025
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:24,420
the National Council is really trying to

2026
01:25:21,238 --> 01:25:27,119
to put a bit momentum into drafting the

2027
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:29,340
first uh legislation and if that goes

2028
01:25:27,119 --> 01:25:31,380
through Parliament we have a semi-direct

2029
01:25:29,340 --> 01:25:33,239
democracy so there's a possibility that

2030
01:25:31,380 --> 01:25:35,579
it will end up on the ballot again and

2031
01:25:33,238 --> 01:25:37,738
we'll we'll see how that develops but if

2032
01:25:35,579 --> 01:25:39,539
that doesn't happen the fastest road to

2033
01:25:37,738 --> 01:25:41,698
legalization could be within two years

2034
01:25:39,539 --> 01:25:44,158
already two three years

2035
01:25:41,698 --> 01:25:47,339
um it could be also four years but

2036
01:25:44,158 --> 01:25:49,139
that's my estimate is that the latest in

2037
01:25:47,340 --> 01:25:51,420
five years we have a legal cannabis

2038
01:25:49,140 --> 01:25:53,100
Market in Switzerland and that would be

2039
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:55,500
of course dependent on neighboring

2040
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:58,199
jurisdictions as well as part of the

2041
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:59,760
calculation I assume it would probably

2042
01:25:58,198 --> 01:26:02,158
be yes

2043
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:04,260
at the same time I think Switzerland is

2044
01:26:02,158 --> 01:26:06,960
a bit of of

2045
01:26:04,260 --> 01:26:08,820
a special kid in Europe not being part

2046
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:11,039
of the European Union and I could

2047
01:26:08,819 --> 01:26:14,279
imagine that Switzerland might actually

2048
01:26:11,039 --> 01:26:16,198
go its own way yes some extent

2049
01:26:14,279 --> 01:26:18,658
a Mary I have a question for you and

2050
01:26:16,198 --> 01:26:22,379
there's um there's one that probably

2051
01:26:18,658 --> 01:26:24,539
some of our Irish delegates here will

2052
01:26:22,380 --> 01:26:27,960
have questions about them obviously it's

2053
01:26:24,539 --> 01:26:29,760
the free movement under article 34 of

2054
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:31,980
the treaty for the furthering of the

2055
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:34,139
European Union and really where this

2056
01:26:31,979 --> 01:26:38,519
comes down to is that our classic case

2057
01:26:34,139 --> 01:26:41,400
of canovape back in 2019 28 years ago

2058
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:44,159
the smoke one of the major problems that

2059
01:26:41,399 --> 01:26:47,279
we've had in this jurisdiction and it

2060
01:26:44,158 --> 01:26:49,920
happened uh just before Christmas was an

2061
01:26:47,279 --> 01:26:52,920
appeal case and I appreciate you haven't

2062
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:55,219
had an opportunity to look at this in

2063
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:57,960
which a judge in the Irish high court

2064
01:26:55,219 --> 01:27:00,119
was presented with a judicial review

2065
01:26:57,960 --> 01:27:02,340
application and the judicial review

2066
01:27:00,119 --> 01:27:05,460
application was in relation to the

2067
01:27:02,340 --> 01:27:08,460
seizure of CBD products that were

2068
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:10,739
imported from Slovenia

2069
01:27:08,460 --> 01:27:13,139
the upshot of course this application

2070
01:27:10,738 --> 01:27:15,178
was that they wanted a declaration but

2071
01:27:13,139 --> 01:27:17,819
the seizures were wrong

2072
01:27:15,179 --> 01:27:21,060
and secondly they were seeking a

2073
01:27:17,819 --> 01:27:24,238
declaration that the minister for health

2074
01:27:21,060 --> 01:27:27,120
showed of course Define what the

2075
01:27:24,238 --> 01:27:29,579
appropriate limits for CBD now this all

2076
01:27:27,119 --> 01:27:33,658
comes down to the classic 0.2 as it was

2077
01:27:29,579 --> 01:27:37,619
0.3 percent but the orange course took a

2078
01:27:33,658 --> 01:27:41,519
very very conservative

2079
01:27:37,619 --> 01:27:43,979
um take on this in other words a literal

2080
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:46,380
um understanding of article 7 of the

2081
01:27:43,979 --> 01:27:51,119
single narcotic Strokes convention by

2082
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:51,980
saying that any presence of THC in a

2083
01:27:51,119 --> 01:27:54,960
product

2084
01:27:51,979 --> 01:27:57,178
that might come across you know the

2085
01:27:54,960 --> 01:28:00,420
Frontiers from other EU member states

2086
01:27:57,179 --> 01:28:03,060
Falls within the context of article 36

2087
01:28:00,420 --> 01:28:04,980
as the state's right to prohibit it now

2088
01:28:03,060 --> 01:28:07,080
my understanding of this is the Irish

2089
01:28:04,979 --> 01:28:09,238
courts have actually got it wrong so

2090
01:28:07,079 --> 01:28:11,399
perhaps maybe just for some of the

2091
01:28:09,238 --> 01:28:13,198
delegates here you might explain a

2092
01:28:11,399 --> 01:28:15,779
little bit more about the candidate

2093
01:28:13,198 --> 01:28:17,879
decision and The Wider context of free

2094
01:28:15,779 --> 01:28:19,319
movement if I haven't put you on this

2095
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:22,260
far too much

2096
01:28:19,319 --> 01:28:24,658
no well so the the canary case was

2097
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:26,579
really about so if I take the French

2098
01:28:24,658 --> 01:28:29,099
regulation the former one before the

2099
01:28:26,579 --> 01:28:33,359
cannabeb case the regulation was

2100
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:37,920
limiting the legality of CBD products to

2101
01:28:33,359 --> 01:28:43,259
products that were made from extraction

2102
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:46,440
of the hemp seeds and fibers only which

2103
01:28:43,260 --> 01:28:49,679
meant that basically any extract that

2104
01:28:46,439 --> 01:28:52,079
was made from the hemp plant in needs

2105
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:54,480
entirety was considered illegal in

2106
01:28:52,079 --> 01:28:57,359
France the problem in the candidate case

2107
01:28:54,479 --> 01:28:59,359
was that the products the liturgist

2108
01:28:57,359 --> 01:29:02,339
product was a

2109
01:28:59,359 --> 01:29:04,579
e-cigarette and vaping products that was

2110
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:08,100
imported from Czech Republic

2111
01:29:04,579 --> 01:29:11,300
where it was made legally from the

2112
01:29:08,100 --> 01:29:13,920
entire hemp plant and the French

2113
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:17,100
authorities considered that it was an

2114
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:20,639
earthquake because the the

2115
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:23,340
the extract was made from the Hem plate

2116
01:29:20,639 --> 01:29:26,279
in this in its entirety so it ended up

2117
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:31,039
in front of the ECG and the ECG

2118
01:29:26,279 --> 01:29:34,399
considered that a member states

2119
01:29:31,039 --> 01:29:38,579
domestic law that is too restrictive

2120
01:29:34,399 --> 01:29:43,259
compared to EU law unless the state

2121
01:29:38,579 --> 01:29:45,359
actually demonstrate and proves that the

2122
01:29:43,260 --> 01:29:49,679
the restriction and the additional

2123
01:29:45,359 --> 01:29:53,399
restriction is due to health public

2124
01:29:49,679 --> 01:29:55,500
health issues and threat or threat to

2125
01:29:53,399 --> 01:29:58,679
public holder

2126
01:29:55,500 --> 01:30:01,619
um you you can't have a more restrictive

2127
01:29:58,679 --> 01:30:04,560
rule or law in a member states so that's

2128
01:30:01,619 --> 01:30:06,599
where the the kind of a case really

2129
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:10,020
really changed things in France and we

2130
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:13,860
we ended up with those new regulations

2131
01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:16,199
and we also had further domestic

2132
01:30:13,859 --> 01:30:19,139
regulations because the kind of a case

2133
01:30:16,198 --> 01:30:22,019
was actually about extracts everybody

2134
01:30:19,139 --> 01:30:24,179
made it about like flowers and and raw

2135
01:30:22,020 --> 01:30:28,199
flowers but it was really about extracts

2136
01:30:24,179 --> 01:30:31,560
we then had a few months later a case a

2137
01:30:28,198 --> 01:30:33,658
decision in France from the spring the

2138
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:35,060
administrative Supreme Court

2139
01:30:33,658 --> 01:30:37,219
um

2140
01:30:35,060 --> 01:30:41,039
judging that

2141
01:30:37,219 --> 01:30:43,679
it would apply also to Raw flowers that

2142
01:30:41,039 --> 01:30:46,198
would be imported from another EU member

2143
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:48,840
state where it was legally produced and

2144
01:30:46,198 --> 01:30:51,119
and then you could not prevent their

2145
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:54,000
sales in France

2146
01:30:51,119 --> 01:30:57,059
um on the basis of the free movement of

2147
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:59,520
goods so I'm quite surprised actually to

2148
01:30:57,060 --> 01:31:02,159
see the Irish decision because it goes

2149
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:04,020
against the entire principle free

2150
01:31:02,158 --> 01:31:06,899
movement of goods and in particular

2151
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:09,900
since now the the THC level for

2152
01:31:06,899 --> 01:31:12,119
industrial hemp in Europe is 0.3 percent

2153
01:31:09,899 --> 01:31:14,158
France was actually ahead when they

2154
01:31:12,119 --> 01:31:17,819
published published the regulation in

2155
01:31:14,158 --> 01:31:21,539
late 2021 by using the 0.3 they

2156
01:31:17,819 --> 01:31:24,779
anticipated the the agricultural EU

2157
01:31:21,539 --> 01:31:28,039
regulation and so they put 0.3 percent

2158
01:31:24,779 --> 01:31:33,119
before all the other EU member states

2159
01:31:28,039 --> 01:31:35,819
but so saying that any trace of THC in

2160
01:31:33,119 --> 01:31:38,698
in products if even though legally

2161
01:31:35,819 --> 01:31:41,219
produced produced in another EU member

2162
01:31:38,698 --> 01:31:42,419
state is considered as an architect then

2163
01:31:41,219 --> 01:31:45,179
we

2164
01:31:42,420 --> 01:31:47,520
in my opinion there's a real problem

2165
01:31:45,179 --> 01:31:50,158
with this decision I think there is

2166
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:53,159
definitely an arguable case now I'm

2167
01:31:50,158 --> 01:31:55,198
obviously very blessed to discuss uh the

2168
01:31:53,158 --> 01:31:57,719
Goose's case too much because I'm not

2169
01:31:55,198 --> 01:32:00,299
sure whether that is under appeal to the

2170
01:31:57,719 --> 01:32:02,939
court of appeal but I can certainly see

2171
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:05,219
some reference points to the European

2172
01:32:02,939 --> 01:32:07,500
court of justice my understanding is

2173
01:32:05,219 --> 01:32:09,300
summer some approach was made and I can

2174
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:11,760
only say this from just general

2175
01:32:09,300 --> 01:32:15,320
awareness to the European commission to

2176
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:19,199
ask whether this decision was in line

2177
01:32:15,319 --> 01:32:21,840
with the current perception of things at

2178
01:32:19,198 --> 01:32:25,319
Europe but I understand nothing was

2179
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:27,679
forthcoming there so the fact is as I

2180
01:32:25,319 --> 01:32:29,880
see it the Irish Court seems to ignore

2181
01:32:27,679 --> 01:32:32,699
that principle that the least

2182
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:35,400
restrictive rule within another member

2183
01:32:32,698 --> 01:32:36,960
State should be the rule to follow but

2184
01:32:35,399 --> 01:32:39,539
it's taking a um this would be

2185
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:41,639
interesting to policy question to Robert

2186
01:32:39,539 --> 01:32:44,219
to a certain extent because

2187
01:32:41,639 --> 01:32:45,300
they are applying the misuse of drugs

2188
01:32:44,219 --> 01:32:48,060
act

2189
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:50,579
um the misuse of drugs act 1977 is the

2190
01:32:48,060 --> 01:32:52,500
gracious knockoff in terms of

2191
01:32:50,579 --> 01:32:54,779
legislation because it's basically the

2192
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:57,719
UK equivalent

2193
01:32:54,779 --> 01:33:01,259
um from 1971 as transposed into the

2194
01:32:57,719 --> 01:33:04,020
Irish into Irish law so it's largely

2195
01:33:01,260 --> 01:33:06,239
based on the UK law all beers they're

2196
01:33:04,020 --> 01:33:10,440
taking a very strict field so becoming

2197
01:33:06,238 --> 01:33:12,359
curious as to the perception of

2198
01:33:10,439 --> 01:33:16,979
um the UK courts in relation to the

2199
01:33:12,359 --> 01:33:20,158
presence of any component of THC uh in

2200
01:33:16,979 --> 01:33:22,439
any products such as a CBD product

2201
01:33:20,158 --> 01:33:24,960
um uh what the UK courts would view it

2202
01:33:22,439 --> 01:33:27,419
at the bones

2203
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:30,300
so the the misuse of drugs Act is more

2204
01:33:27,420 --> 01:33:31,619
than 50 years old okay it is not fit for

2205
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:33,179
purpose

2206
01:33:31,619 --> 01:33:36,179
um it doesn't make any distinction

2207
01:33:33,179 --> 01:33:39,119
between high THC

2208
01:33:36,179 --> 01:33:40,859
flower and and low THC flour because in

2209
01:33:39,119 --> 01:33:44,279
1971 you know we didn't really know

2210
01:33:40,859 --> 01:33:47,119
about these things to to a wide extent

2211
01:33:44,279 --> 01:33:50,279
um the misuse of drugs act

2212
01:33:47,119 --> 01:33:54,960
disproportionately impacts upon uh

2213
01:33:50,279 --> 01:33:54,960
communities of color and and communities

2214
01:33:55,198 --> 01:34:00,479
um poorer communities

2215
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:02,520
and you know for for a good long period

2216
01:34:00,479 --> 01:34:05,099
everyone the middle classes in England

2217
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:08,219
have been absolutely fine with that so

2218
01:34:05,100 --> 01:34:10,980
it needs radical reform and overhaul

2219
01:34:08,219 --> 01:34:11,639
um I can't see it happening anytime soon

2220
01:34:10,979 --> 01:34:14,459
um

2221
01:34:11,639 --> 01:34:17,659
the issue therefore then is

2222
01:34:14,460 --> 01:34:20,698
the the the the misuse of drugs Act

2223
01:34:17,658 --> 01:34:22,679
implements the UK's obligations under

2224
01:34:20,698 --> 01:34:26,519
the UN narcotics convention into

2225
01:34:22,679 --> 01:34:29,460
domestic law and decisions like can a

2226
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:31,739
vape have made it very very clear in my

2227
01:34:29,460 --> 01:34:33,719
view that

2228
01:34:31,738 --> 01:34:37,500
um domestic legislation should not be

2229
01:34:33,719 --> 01:34:39,239
used to pro uh to prohibit products

2230
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:41,880
which don't have any narcotic properties

2231
01:34:39,238 --> 01:34:44,698
and that's the issue with things like

2232
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:47,159
hemp flower CBD flower people are

2233
01:34:44,698 --> 01:34:49,019
consuming it but the THC content is so

2234
01:34:47,158 --> 01:34:50,759
low that nobody's getting high from it

2235
01:34:49,020 --> 01:34:52,139
so it's it's not considered to be a

2236
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:53,699
narcotic

2237
01:34:52,139 --> 01:34:55,020
um and it's much the same with CBD

2238
01:34:53,698 --> 01:34:57,658
products as well you know there's the

2239
01:34:55,020 --> 01:34:59,100
THC content is is low enough that people

2240
01:34:57,658 --> 01:35:02,219
aren't actually getting high from these

2241
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:04,800
products so why is the misuse of drugs

2242
01:35:02,219 --> 01:35:07,800
act being used to prosecute people

2243
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:09,600
selling CBD flare in the UK the bizarre

2244
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:11,159
thing I just didn't have to journalists

2245
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:13,100
the Irish courts are taking such a

2246
01:35:11,158 --> 01:35:16,799
ridiculous view

2247
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:19,380
of 0.2 percent which is of course which

2248
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:21,300
is a 0.3 percent of that is in the plant

2249
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:23,760
that they're you know kind of

2250
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:25,920
complaining that this would be an attack

2251
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:28,320
on public health if we read the judges

2252
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:29,940
decision it's it's you know anyone with

2253
01:35:28,319 --> 01:35:32,639
any knowledge at cannabis would say that

2254
01:35:29,939 --> 01:35:35,819
is like um I suppose we used to have a

2255
01:35:32,639 --> 01:35:38,400
product called Club Shandy as most Irish

2256
01:35:35,819 --> 01:35:40,619
people would be aware of which is

2257
01:35:38,399 --> 01:35:42,779
lemonade and I think it's almost zero

2258
01:35:40,619 --> 01:35:44,698
percent one percent alcohol all in it

2259
01:35:42,779 --> 01:35:47,399
you know that nobody could possibly get

2260
01:35:44,698 --> 01:35:49,319
pissed on but this is the equivalent but

2261
01:35:47,399 --> 01:35:51,539
anyway Daniel was about to you know I I

2262
01:35:49,319 --> 01:35:52,679
just wanted to add one thing on on the

2263
01:35:51,539 --> 01:35:55,619
CBD

2264
01:35:52,679 --> 01:35:58,139
um oils for example it's really about

2265
01:35:55,619 --> 01:36:02,158
the ratio so you can have a CBD oil with

2266
01:35:58,139 --> 01:36:04,139
0.2 percent THC and 0.1 percent CBD

2267
01:36:02,158 --> 01:36:06,779
shoots you to the moon it's incredibly

2268
01:36:04,139 --> 01:36:10,260
psychoactive it's it's it's uh it's a

2269
01:36:06,779 --> 01:36:12,840
narcotic so in Switzerland also now when

2270
01:36:10,260 --> 01:36:14,820
we're discussing uh an entire framework

2271
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:16,800
we're thinking about how do we deal with

2272
01:36:14,819 --> 01:36:20,420
these products and on top of that how we

2273
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:24,179
do we deal with all these hhcs and other

2274
01:36:20,420 --> 01:36:26,600
cannabinoids that can also really uh be

2275
01:36:24,179 --> 01:36:29,340
regarded as THC equivalence but are not

2276
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:31,679
specifically mentioned in law

2277
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:34,139
yeah so the the public health argument

2278
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:36,179
that you mentioned Nile that to my mind

2279
01:36:34,139 --> 01:36:37,800
I don't know Marie will agree with this

2280
01:36:36,179 --> 01:36:39,300
but that flies in the face of the

2281
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:42,840
verdict in canovape you know the

2282
01:36:39,300 --> 01:36:44,840
European Court justice was quite clear

2283
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:47,520
um you should not be using domestic

2284
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:50,699
narcotics legislation

2285
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:52,620
um to prohibit non-narcotic proper

2286
01:36:50,698 --> 01:36:54,839
products on the basis of Public Health

2287
01:36:52,619 --> 01:36:56,840
because there's no evidence to show that

2288
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:59,520
there is a an issue for public health

2289
01:36:56,840 --> 01:37:02,039
and that's the situation in the UK the

2290
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:04,199
UK authorities are deathly afraid of THC

2291
01:37:02,039 --> 01:37:04,859
you know they they

2292
01:37:04,198 --> 01:37:06,479
um

2293
01:37:04,859 --> 01:37:08,339
that the home officers ask the The

2294
01:37:06,479 --> 01:37:11,039
Advisory Council on issues of drugs to

2295
01:37:08,340 --> 01:37:13,380
to carry out a consultation on what

2296
01:37:11,039 --> 01:37:15,179
should be the illegal limit of THC in a

2297
01:37:13,380 --> 01:37:17,400
CBD product and we all know that the

2298
01:37:15,179 --> 01:37:18,779
result is going to be so low that you're

2299
01:37:17,399 --> 01:37:21,359
going to end up in a situation where you

2300
01:37:18,779 --> 01:37:22,859
only have isolate-based CBD products and

2301
01:37:21,359 --> 01:37:27,000
these products don't work people want

2302
01:37:22,859 --> 01:37:29,579
full spectrum so this is the elephant of

2303
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:31,198
the room about these isolated products

2304
01:37:29,579 --> 01:37:33,960
yeah I could say a little bit more about

2305
01:37:31,198 --> 01:37:35,759
that yeah sure and um you know for

2306
01:37:33,960 --> 01:37:37,500
regulatory lawyers it's great because it

2307
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:39,420
means there's going to be endless legal

2308
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:42,238
challenges as soon as the the home

2309
01:37:39,420 --> 01:37:43,920
office adopts its new position on THC

2310
01:37:42,238 --> 01:37:46,319
that's going to get judicially reviewed

2311
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:47,880
and and you know because because the

2312
01:37:46,319 --> 01:37:49,799
limit the limit will be so low it won't

2313
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:51,359
have any evidential basis it will be a

2314
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:54,900
policy decision rather than a decision

2315
01:37:51,359 --> 01:37:58,019
based on actual evidence

2316
01:37:54,899 --> 01:38:00,420
yeah and uh so so the public health

2317
01:37:58,020 --> 01:38:03,060
um issue and the the public order

2318
01:38:00,420 --> 01:38:05,699
because in France that we had both and

2319
01:38:03,060 --> 01:38:07,199
it's exactly what the the Council of

2320
01:38:05,698 --> 01:38:11,158
State ruled

2321
01:38:07,198 --> 01:38:12,198
um in in December last December uh it

2322
01:38:11,158 --> 01:38:15,119
actually

2323
01:38:12,198 --> 01:38:19,138
said that the French government hadn't

2324
01:38:15,119 --> 01:38:21,000
proved in any way whatsoever any threat

2325
01:38:19,139 --> 01:38:22,440
um and the the public health threat or

2326
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:24,779
the the public order threat that they

2327
01:38:22,439 --> 01:38:26,939
were claiming to prohibit the retail

2328
01:38:24,779 --> 01:38:28,738
sale of hemp flowers

2329
01:38:26,939 --> 01:38:30,178
um to Consumer

2330
01:38:28,738 --> 01:38:32,939
um and that was the government's

2331
01:38:30,179 --> 01:38:35,880
argument all along saying uh yes but you

2332
01:38:32,939 --> 01:38:38,819
can't for for the the law enforcement

2333
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:42,179
for instance you cannot distinguish uh

2334
01:38:38,819 --> 01:38:46,019
raw ham flowers from Cannabis flowers

2335
01:38:42,179 --> 01:38:47,819
with a high THC when everybody proved to

2336
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:50,040
them because this is what any other

2337
01:38:47,819 --> 01:38:51,840
member state does already

2338
01:38:50,039 --> 01:38:54,238
um that there are tests and specific

2339
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:56,460
tests that are very easy to use that

2340
01:38:54,238 --> 01:38:58,859
don't cost too much money that you can

2341
01:38:56,460 --> 01:39:00,960
put in the flower and depending on the

2342
01:38:58,859 --> 01:39:04,439
color that comes out it's either

2343
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:07,739
cannabis THC cannabis or hemp

2344
01:39:04,439 --> 01:39:10,619
um so so the the French government was

2345
01:39:07,738 --> 01:39:13,218
really really lost the this case

2346
01:39:10,619 --> 01:39:16,260
um in this aspect

2347
01:39:13,219 --> 01:39:19,079
another aspect and issue we have is the

2348
01:39:16,260 --> 01:39:21,300
with the zero three percent THC and the

2349
01:39:19,079 --> 01:39:24,179
fact that it's not precise depending on

2350
01:39:21,300 --> 01:39:27,779
the the products we're talking about

2351
01:39:24,179 --> 01:39:31,560
um zero three percent we we we saw

2352
01:39:27,779 --> 01:39:34,158
fairly recently legal geniuses that

2353
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:38,960
decided to convert zero three percent

2354
01:39:34,158 --> 01:39:41,158
into milligrams and we saw gummies

2355
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:43,260
appearing on the market with five

2356
01:39:41,158 --> 01:39:45,599
milligrams of THC and then they came up

2357
01:39:43,260 --> 01:39:49,500
and say hey about five milligrams of THC

2358
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:52,079
it's far below 0.3 percent so it's legal

2359
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:53,579
obviously this is if it's still on the

2360
01:39:52,079 --> 01:39:55,619
market it's not going to stay long

2361
01:39:53,579 --> 01:39:58,698
because it's definitely that doesn't

2362
01:39:55,619 --> 01:40:01,738
fall down of the reference dosage

2363
01:39:58,698 --> 01:40:03,899
this is an issue that we we see often

2364
01:40:01,738 --> 01:40:07,559
raised by the likes of the hpra about

2365
01:40:03,899 --> 01:40:09,059
the amount of Tolerance in the system so

2366
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:11,460
I'm very curious how they get around

2367
01:40:09,060 --> 01:40:13,800
that in perhaps huge reference we don't

2368
01:40:11,460 --> 01:40:15,899
we don't see but we we saw that popping

2369
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:17,760
out and people claiming about that and

2370
01:40:15,899 --> 01:40:21,179
we were like yeah well you know that's

2371
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:23,400
the the exact issue we see with the lack

2372
01:40:21,179 --> 01:40:26,158
of clarity in the regulation at some

2373
01:40:23,399 --> 01:40:28,259
point you have to to Define exactly what

2374
01:40:26,158 --> 01:40:30,119
you want what is legal what is not legal

2375
01:40:28,260 --> 01:40:33,480
what you mean by

2376
01:40:30,119 --> 01:40:35,639
um the THC level the T the CBD levels

2377
01:40:33,479 --> 01:40:38,638
and or any other cab you know it's level

2378
01:40:35,639 --> 01:40:41,520
in in this type of this type of products

2379
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:44,039
because without those precisions you

2380
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:46,380
will always end up with people trying to

2381
01:40:44,039 --> 01:40:48,300
circumvent and going through and using

2382
01:40:46,380 --> 01:40:50,940
the you know the weaknesses of the

2383
01:40:48,300 --> 01:40:53,880
regulation to place products on the

2384
01:40:50,939 --> 01:40:57,839
market if we're talking about consumer

2385
01:40:53,880 --> 01:41:00,800
protection we need to have curry in in

2386
01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:03,239
the regulation and and not

2387
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:05,820
legislators that are dragging their feet

2388
01:41:03,238 --> 01:41:06,718
because they don't want to move on with

2389
01:41:05,819 --> 01:41:10,198
this

2390
01:41:06,719 --> 01:41:12,000
we are there so at some point we they we

2391
01:41:10,198 --> 01:41:14,039
need to take their responsibilities and

2392
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:16,439
to and to work

2393
01:41:14,039 --> 01:41:19,139
um to have clarifications where they're

2394
01:41:16,439 --> 01:41:21,599
needed okay thank you very much now I

2395
01:41:19,139 --> 01:41:23,940
wonder instructions that were 10 minutes

2396
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:28,100
15 minutes soon for two so I may have

2397
01:41:23,939 --> 01:41:28,099
time for one more question anyone

2398
01:41:28,139 --> 01:41:34,380
Bob sorry bring it

2399
01:41:31,079 --> 01:41:39,479
it's been said that the CPP regulation

2400
01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:41,159
in UK is a model for the rest of the

2401
01:41:39,479 --> 01:41:43,500
world and I know you didn't comment much

2402
01:41:41,158 --> 01:41:45,479
on it but could you just describe why

2403
01:41:43,500 --> 01:41:48,359
people's talk about it that way and and

2404
01:41:45,479 --> 01:41:50,519
what are some of those basic features

2405
01:41:48,359 --> 01:41:52,439
so so novel food regulation is

2406
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:55,440
effectively The Benchmark globally for

2407
01:41:52,439 --> 01:41:58,198
food standards and quality it is it is

2408
01:41:55,439 --> 01:42:00,178
um akin to a pharmaceutical procedure

2409
01:41:58,198 --> 01:42:02,879
the amount of data and the studies that

2410
01:42:00,179 --> 01:42:05,760
need to be prepared in relation to

2411
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:07,679
um the products is extensive

2412
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:10,079
um you're effectively talking about full

2413
01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:12,658
toxicology studies to show the impact of

2414
01:42:10,079 --> 01:42:13,920
taking the product for every day for 30

2415
01:42:12,658 --> 01:42:15,658
years you know so you can imagine

2416
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:18,000
there's a huge amount of laboratory work

2417
01:42:15,658 --> 01:42:18,799
that goes into that

2418
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:21,539
um

2419
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:23,340
so so the expectation is once you have a

2420
01:42:21,539 --> 01:42:25,019
novel food compliant product you should

2421
01:42:23,340 --> 01:42:27,420
be able to introduce it into any Market

2422
01:42:25,020 --> 01:42:29,760
in the world because you will have the

2423
01:42:27,420 --> 01:42:31,618
safest most highest quality products

2424
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:34,739
that there is

2425
01:42:31,618 --> 01:42:36,779
um the problem is that because of the

2426
01:42:34,738 --> 01:42:38,158
nature of of the data and the the

2427
01:42:36,779 --> 01:42:41,219
information that needs to be generated

2428
01:42:38,158 --> 01:42:42,658
it is an expensive and lengthy process

2429
01:42:41,219 --> 01:42:44,639
right

2430
01:42:42,658 --> 01:42:47,158
um it's it's effectively using a

2431
01:42:44,639 --> 01:42:48,719
sledgehammer to crack a walnut so the

2432
01:42:47,158 --> 01:42:50,819
regulatory burden that has been placed

2433
01:42:48,719 --> 01:42:52,618
on UK CBD companies to achieve novel

2434
01:42:50,819 --> 01:42:56,420
food compliance

2435
01:42:52,618 --> 01:42:59,639
um has in fact stifled the market it has

2436
01:42:56,420 --> 01:43:02,399
stopped Innovation you cannot bring new

2437
01:42:59,639 --> 01:43:04,980
products to to Market you cannot uh

2438
01:43:02,399 --> 01:43:06,658
bring new formulations to Market until

2439
01:43:04,979 --> 01:43:08,039
you have a cheese nut and achieved full

2440
01:43:06,658 --> 01:43:09,599
marketing authorization and the

2441
01:43:08,039 --> 01:43:11,698
expectation is that could take it some

2442
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:14,219
anything between two and six years

2443
01:43:11,698 --> 01:43:16,319
so whilst

2444
01:43:14,219 --> 01:43:18,539
the introduction of Novel foods for the

2445
01:43:16,319 --> 01:43:20,519
CBD sector was supposed to be a platform

2446
01:43:18,539 --> 01:43:23,760
for the industry to really take off and

2447
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:26,340
and hit the mainstream instead it has

2448
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:28,440
caused a number of operators to drop out

2449
01:43:26,340 --> 01:43:30,239
of the market and he has placed a

2450
01:43:28,439 --> 01:43:32,579
significant Regulatory and financial

2451
01:43:30,238 --> 01:43:34,919
burden on the existing operators and

2452
01:43:32,579 --> 01:43:37,500
unfortunately sales have not increased

2453
01:43:34,920 --> 01:43:39,420
um at the rate that is needed to sustain

2454
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:40,920
the the financial success of these

2455
01:43:39,420 --> 01:43:43,560
companies so so that's why there is a

2456
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:45,719
general feeling that novel Foods uh has

2457
01:43:43,560 --> 01:43:48,600
has had the opposite effect of what it

2458
01:43:45,719 --> 01:43:50,460
was intended to do and you know it also

2459
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:51,659
reflects on medical cannabis what

2460
01:43:50,460 --> 01:43:54,239
they're doing in the UK is they're

2461
01:43:51,658 --> 01:43:56,099
shoving these industries into existing

2462
01:43:54,238 --> 01:43:58,019
regulatory regimes that don't suit

2463
01:43:56,100 --> 01:43:59,940
cannabis so you you know putting medical

2464
01:43:58,020 --> 01:44:02,520
cannabis into the specials licensing

2465
01:43:59,939 --> 01:44:04,618
regime doesn't work

2466
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:06,199
um and unfortunately amongst the UK

2467
01:44:04,618 --> 01:44:09,238
government there doesn't seem to be any

2468
01:44:06,198 --> 01:44:11,579
inclination to create bespoke regulatory

2469
01:44:09,238 --> 01:44:13,500
environments for cannabis products which

2470
