14
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,679
golf event that you had over in

15
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,960
america and i think a couple of other

16
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:36,558
different events that you're going to be

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,558
changing the course how people network

18
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:40,558
in the cannabis industry can you maybe

19
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:42,799
give everybody a quick overview of how

20
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:45,439
you kind of went from american football

21
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:47,359
college coach into uh founding lemon

22
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:49,039
hayes in the cannabis industry

23
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:50,079
yeah you know it's funny literally it's

24
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,600
almost like you take three steps

25
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,280
backwards and tripped over the dog and

26
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,760
fell into cannabis but it's been an

27
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,359
absolute amazing ride but yeah you hit

28
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:59,519
that nail around the head you know

29
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,198
growing up and coming out of college my

30
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,600
goal had always been to coach college

31
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:06,560
football which i did after playing uh

32
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,079
did that for 12 years um and as that

33
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,400
started you know i did that all over the

34
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:12,319
country from schools here in the big 12

35
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,000
to the ivy league

36
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:14,879
and as that kind of started to run its

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,239
course

38
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:20,239
i ended up actually moving back to my

39
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:23,759
hometown of austin texas

40
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:25,118
and starting my first company

41
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,640
back in austin that was actually a

42
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:29,118
construction company

43
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,719
did that for a few years when uh kind of

44
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:33,790
out of the blue

45
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,879
a um an opportunity came about for me to

46
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:36,720
[Music]

47
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:39,199
move to seattle and get into the

48
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:41,679
cannabis industry when at that time only

49
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:45,040
two states washington state and colorado

50
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,439
were legal so i got in very very early

51
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,880
um in washington state

52
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:53,679
uh and after the the original reason i

53
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,438
had moved there kind of fizzled out i

54
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,799
decided that i really liked the industry

55
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,039
and i wanted to

56
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:02,719
i wanted to

57
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,759
keep going so i started uh what was a

58
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:05,438
company called ted trigger it's a

59
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,599
precursor to lemon haze it's what is now

60
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:09,758
currently lemonade and believe it or not

61
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,598
we actually started as a data company we

62
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,839
were doing a lot of the data for the

63
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,598
recreational marijuana industry

64
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,680
in washington state

65
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:20,000
um we started putting on events to

66
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,520
promote our data we started doing those

67
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,280
events were strictly business to

68
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,239
business industry events

69
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,560
and all of a sudden we looked up and we

70
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,200
were having a whole lot of success with

71
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,560
events and the dad was kind of uh

72
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:35,199
stagnant so

73
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,519
we moved over full time into events and

74
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:40,238
i was in you know started in 2015 and

75
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,239
started 2019 started expanding uh

76
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,080
nationally um

77
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,200
started getting into oregon california

78
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,200
and nevada

79
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:48,639
um then this funny little thing called

80
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:50,479
covid came around you might have heard

81
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,238
about it um

82
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:54,079
put a put brakes on pretty much all of

83
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,239
our expansion plans

84
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,040
then you know we started looking at an

85
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,599
idea of how to come out of covid with

86
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:02,878
events and golf was socially distance it

87
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,359
was outdoors

88
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,799
it made sense and

89
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,080
we just said you know what let's just

90
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,920
limit it to

91
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,719
executives for networking like you

92
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:14,238
talked about c-suite vps and directors i

93
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:15,759
know and it just took off like a bottle

94
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,840
ship and before we knew it we were doing

95
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:19,679
eight tournaments around the country in

96
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,598
eight different states so it was just a

97
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,800
ton of fun and we just keep going with

98
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:24,158
it now

99
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,680
amazing that's kind of brings me

100
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:27,919
straight on to the first topic i wanted

101
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,840
to talk about lemon haze going for a

102
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:32,158
hole in one which are kind of new

103
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,840
networking events

104
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:35,840
i'm over in dublin and i kind of heard

105
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,680
about it about golf channels and to the

106
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,519
cannibals channel so it kind of proves

107
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,120
to you that the event was a roaring

108
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,879
success if it kind of found its way to

109
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,959
me without anybody kind of sending any

110
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:46,719
information i think there's definitely a

111
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,959
need you probably agree in the industry

112
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:50,560
there's enough events that people go to

113
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,319
and it's the same kind of circular thing

114
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,080
you go around a couple of boots and

115
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:55,679
unless you're a sociable person it's

116
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,239
very hard to kind of network at those

117
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,319
events it'll get dominated by a specific

118
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,080
kind of personality person wears with

119
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:04,158
golf you're stuck with a group of four

120
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,599
people you can get to know that person a

121
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:07,759
hell of a lot better let them know their

122
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:09,119
industry but better maybe you have a few

123
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:11,840
different questions that you'll be able

124
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,480
to formulate over a couple of hours time

125
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,759
do you see this being the cure sore for

126
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:16,959
you kind of moving into the other

127
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:19,199
territories where you're going to have

128
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,798
networking events outside of gulf as

129
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,000
much as golf will be a success for you

130
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:25,359
guys do you see

131
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,199
other uh other territories for growth

132
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,960
absolutely and it's the perfect segue to

133
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,520
get into new states it's perfect way to

134
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:33,359
get in to new markets um

135
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:36,000
even markets outside the united states

136
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,680
but yeah and so it's funny how you said

137
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,600
that about about the trade show and

138
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,040
that's really where the concept came

139
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,160
around and which has really always been

140
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,600
our basis here at lemonades is when i

141
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,759
just mentioned before when i got out of

142
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,680
coaching i started my first company down

143
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,120
in austin as a construction company and

144
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,040
i would go to the and i would do trade

145
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,040
shows and i would sit for three days

146
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,040
behind the booth and i talked to 350

147
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,400
people of which only eight of them were

148
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,919
the ones i actually wanted to talk to

149
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,159
because everybody else was

150
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:04,159
was you know just a random somebody from

151
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,840
a different area and then i found that

152
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,240
after three days of sitting at a booth i

153
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:10,638
was making all my business deals at the

154
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,319
after party so the whole concept the

155
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,160
lemonades is really simple

156
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,240
it was

157
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,320
kind of eliminate the actual trade show

158
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,918
part of it of all the of all the the

159
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,079
random randoms

160
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:24,240
and get the exact people you want to

161
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:25,839
network with put him put him in some

162
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,439
kind of a party in this case a golf

163
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:30,719
tournament and uh and at that point

164
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:32,399
you're basically putting the trade show

165
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,320
in the after party and that's where your

166
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:36,560
networking is and

167
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,800
so when you do one of our golf terms not

168
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,160
only are you playing with the uh

169
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,759
executives that you may want to that you

170
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,759
want to meet around the country but we

171
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,840
also have you know cocktail parties

172
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,680
before you know before the actual

173
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,198
scramble and then we have the cocktail

174
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,319
party afterwards with the awards and

175
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,400
everything

176
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:54,000
so you have a you have actually

177
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:56,000
at our events you have you know two

178
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,360
hours before the golf two hours after

179
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,199
the golf and four and a half to five

180
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,120
hours during the golf to network with

181
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,038
executives from all over the industry

182
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,120
and being able to move that around from

183
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:06,719
market to market because as you know

184
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,959
we're not federally legal here in the

185
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,720
states yet and so

186
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:13,279
we're only legal on the state on the

187
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,680
state level so normally if you go from

188
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:18,478
state to state not a lot changes but in

189
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,680
this case doing an event in california

190
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:22,159
nevada

191
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,840
massachusetts and florida you might as

192
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,319
well be doing them in france belgium

193
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:28,560
germany and you know and ireland it's

194
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,520
just there it's you're they're totally

195
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,519
different

196
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:33,198
uh they're totally different industries

197
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:34,318
from each other and there's people you

198
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,360
need to meet in each one of those

199
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,439
industries and that's what we've been

200
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,600
able to give people

201
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:41,519
yeah the layout of the different uh

202
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,520
nuances of government in each state is

203
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:46,079
going to allow for you guys to step in

204
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:48,318
and basically be a great interstate kind

205
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:50,000
of networking event it's a genius idea i

206
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,160
have to admit and i look forward to at

207
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,160
some stage i'll get over to you guys and

208
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,919
i'll get to have a few rounds and throw

209
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,840
down because i'm a pretty mean golfer i

210
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:00,000
like to think myself so i'm going to

211
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:01,598
move on to the next topic and it's

212
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,519
something that uh you probably agree

213
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:04,639
with me in this and a lot of people who

214
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:07,359
actually know what they're talking about

215
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,280
well bud tenders did he underestimated

216
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,038
entry point to consumers

217
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:13,519
how important do you think

218
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:15,360
both tenders are to brands and their

219
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:17,519
entry point into the consumer because

220
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,759
i've i've talked to a number of people

221
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:21,359
excuse me on the on this uh

222
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,199
series of episodes and some of the

223
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,639
smartest guys have been previous both

224
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:29,280
tenders in stores and in cannabis are in

225
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,120
canada and in colorado so what do you

226
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:33,119
think the future for the boat tenders

227
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,639
and some of the events and stuff and and

228
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,759
connection events you see happen for

229
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,519
these

230
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,439
yeah and the bud tenders in my opinion

231
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:41,279
the blood tenders are just as important

232
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:44,240
as the executives are when it comes to

233
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:46,719
this industry so we have the you know

234
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,879
obviously with our golf tournament where

235
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,199
all our golf tournaments are limited to

236
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,800
c-suite vp and directors

237
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,720
uh of those cannabis companies and

238
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,759
because those are the decision makers of

239
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,440
who's going to buy their treatment

240
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,520
equipment their pos their data equipment

241
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,839
whatever it may be however

242
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,918
the blood tender is as equally important

243
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:06,318
to the industry as anybody else and the

244
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:08,639
reason being the blood tender is quite

245
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,840
literally the sales person for every

246
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,280
single brand in existence to the

247
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:14,318
consumer um you know every other like we

248
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:16,000
talked about every state's different

249
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,840
every country is different but

250
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,959
at least here in the united states right

251
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:23,359
now if you walk into a dispensary or a

252
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,959
retailer in any state in this country

253
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,720
whatever product you buy is going

254
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:28,239
through the hands of a butt tender that

255
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,520
but you're gonna you don't you don't

256
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,120
walk up to the shelf here and pull

257
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:33,360
something off the shelf and walk it up

258
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,519
to the cashier you literally walk in you

259
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,519
just talk with the butt tender and you

260
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,360
ask them what they have or you tell them

261
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,399
what you want and they're and if you

262
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,560
know what you want they're going to grab

263
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,080
it for you but 90 of the time people

264
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,838
walk in and say

265
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,839
i want marijuana and the blood tender

266
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,440
kind of goes you know which one

267
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,120
and then they have to ask you know

268
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,920
you're looking for something for for

269
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,000
energy to sleep to whatever and whatever

270
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:57,838
that bud tender recommends is usually

271
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,278
what that consumer is going to pay for

272
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,160
so that bud tender is the sales person

273
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:04,799
to

274
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:06,399
to the for the entire industry to the

275
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:08,319
entire consumer base

276
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,958
in that market so they they're just as

277
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,800
important as anybody else

278
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:14,958
yeah i would agree which i think when

279
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:16,639
you have uh for federal legalization

280
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:18,958
over the states the m a's that will

281
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:21,199
happen will then uh

282
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,799
i think blood tenders real value will

283
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,879
come to market then i think it'll be

284
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:26,879
like having the high end similier in a

285
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:28,240
michelin star restaurant the guys who

286
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:29,679
really know what they're talking about

287
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,320
and really understand the ingredients

288
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:34,239
and like a good dj know what genetics

289
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,839
are coming out before they kind of hit

290
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,360
the market are those kind of guys will

291
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,640
be at a premium

292
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,759
value

293
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:41,278
and i'll tell you what that's going to

294
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:42,559
i'll give you one step further where i

295
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:44,480
exactly agree with you it'll be in the

296
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:46,319
same way especially when we do get into

297
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,920
federalization where all of a sudden

298
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,560
you'll probably see a lot of the growing

299
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:51,838
in the country you know uh go to certain

300
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:53,518
areas of the country similar to how

301
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,200
breaks are generally done in florida

302
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,120
you'll see a lot of the i think a lot of

303
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,040
the outdoor brewing go to tobacco

304
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,278
tobacco row or southern oregon northern

305
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:03,120
california and it's going to become like

306
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:05,360
wine where you're going to have these

307
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,679
huge outdoor crops that come in and you

308
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,839
know your you know 2023 crop is not

309
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:11,838
going to be the same as your 2024 crop

310
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,440
but that button is going to be just like

311
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,240
a somebody

312
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,040
at a at a great wine bar or wine shop is

313
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,720
going to be able to tell you the

314
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:19,838
different vintages and the different

315
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,278
years you're gonna start seeing the

316
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,839
exact same thing

317
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:26,879
in marijuana not only when it comes down

318
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,160
to um simple things like

319
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:29,838
i hate these but the good old-fashioned

320
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:31,679
state of indica um

321
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,720
a hybrid but when it comes down to

322
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:35,039
actually

323
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,320
your your premium products and and which

324
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:37,838
crops they come out of them which props

325
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,360
are better than other ones same way

326
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,959
advantages of one

327
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,959
yeah i agree

328
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:44,639
the the real cannabis consumer doesn't

329
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,399
really care about having a high thc

330
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,278
content it's more about a blend of

331
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,278
terpenes uh a mix of caramel noise that

332
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:53,360
are basically going to suit whatever

333
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:54,559
lifestyle they fit cannabis into for

334
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,560
them because i think cannabis is a

335
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:58,239
lifestyle for a lot of consumers and

336
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:00,159
they're they're long

337
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,120
are lifelong consumers as well when you

338
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,958
get them

339
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,320
it's been a great year for yourself for

340
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:06,559
the last 12 months what have you got

341
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,959
planned for 2022

342
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:11,518
so we are you know we are doubling down

343
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:13,119
on what we have so we've identified

344
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,480
we've identified three segments in the

345
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,399
industry to be the most important

346
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,839
segments in the industry one we just

347
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,679
discussed which is the blood tenders the

348
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,360
butt tenders are

349
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,759
the sales person for every brand in the

350
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,360
industry the second is the actual buyers

351
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:27,439
because you know those buyers that

352
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,278
decide decide which products are going

353
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,200
into those dispensaries that the butt

354
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:33,120
tenders can push and the third is the

355
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,959
executives that we talked about so

356
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,759
currently we're in 12 states doing

357
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:40,719
events with bud tenders

358
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:42,720
with bud tenders buyers and executives

359
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,160
going into 22 we are going to expand

360
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,480
that now so we're adding four more

361
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:49,039
states onto our repertoire so we have

362
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,320
we're going to be doing events next year

363
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:52,639
in addition to the states we're already

364
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,760
doing also now in colorado new jersey

365
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,360
missouri and missouri and ohio and

366
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:58,958
that's in the addition to the art the

367
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,120
states we already do of washington

368
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:03,919
colorado or excuse me washington oregon

369
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,078
california nevada oklahoma massachusetts

370
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:07,599
florida michigan and illinois um and

371
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:09,838
then in subsequent years we'll just keep

372
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,440
adding more and more states going on and

373
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,519
we'll just be coming back with events

374
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,000
specifically for those butt tenders

375
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,278
events specifically for those buyers and

376
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,480
events

377
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,958
you know the golf events which we

378
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,600
started with exclusively for those

379
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:25,359
executive c-suite vps and directors

380
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,200
because at the end of the day those are

381
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,120
the three segments of the industry those

382
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,720
are the decision makers the decision

383
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,879
makers in canvas are the executives the

384
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,920
buyers and the butt tenders and so we'll

385
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:37,439
do specific events targeted specifically

386
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:39,759
for people that want to talk to those

387
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,519
targeted groups uh to meet with them and

388
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,200
we're really excited we're really

389
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,320

390
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,079

391
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,680
