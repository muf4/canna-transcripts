you got to here

22
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,719
sure um so the story starts uh actually

23
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:48,878
with me

24
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,759
looking into a bunch of industries bunch

25
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:52,238
of companies

26
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:53,599
as an investment banker uh at nomura and

27
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:57,359
the m a team in

28
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,359
2011 um and then i'm kind of spending

29
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:00,399
six years as an investor for various

30
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,840
family offices

31
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:06,320
and and a private equity fund and

32
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,280
basically seeing cannabis doing

33
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:11,359
extremely well

34
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:13,200
in canada in the us around 2019

35
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:14,959
and thinking to myself okay there is

36
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,960
nothing um

37
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:18,319
big or nothing in terms of high quality

38
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:21,199
companies

39
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:23,118
in the uk europe and maybe i should look

40
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,680
into that and so i spent a month

41
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:27,680
traveling canada and california talking

42
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,159
to more than 50 companies

43
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,799
and realized that there is a there's a

44
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,840
market

45
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:37,200
to have a platform in europe to offer

46
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,719
top brands to european and uk customers

47
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,960
and provide them with the top brands

48
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:44,478
beat the us brands canadian brands

49
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:47,039
or uk brands and so that was really

50
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:47,679
the background um and then yeah it was

51
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,159
kind of like

52
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,079
okay what's the team and i was really

53
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,359
lucky i have a super strong co-founder

54
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:57,039
and cto

55
00:01:53,359 --> 00:02:00,078
and he was the cto of a copycat of etsy

56
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,000
in germany for many years and i

57
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,679
pitched him the idea and said look do

58
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,840
you want to join me and so

59
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,319
uh we we launched alpha green in october

60
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,080
2019.

61
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:12,479
amazing yeah i think having a good

62
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,599
co-founder is hugely important to the

63
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,399
success of your

64
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:18,000
enterprise for sure that's a a good

65
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,879
overview for everybody now in the the

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,479
alpha grain group

67
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:22,799
what i'd like to do is chat about the

68
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:24,159
current landscape of the cbd of cbd in

69
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,640
the uk

70
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:28,479
the novel food licenses that's really

71
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:29,679
gone true i see that they push back the

72
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,399
deadline

73
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,439
again there last week can you tell us

74
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,439
what you think the

75
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:37,680
cbd landscape looks like in the uk is it

76
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:38,479
promising are the regulations going in

77
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,280
your favor

78
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:42,560
or is it like the rest of uh like not

79
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,000
even europe but ireland

80
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,640
seems to be living in the stone age when

81
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
it comes to this yeah

82
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:53,279
yes it's a great question um so the uk

83
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,878
is making progress for sure um

84
00:02:53,280 --> 00:03:00,158
with fsa pushing out the deadline

85
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:01,840
um ultimately gives some brands more

86
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:05,199
time to submit the dossier

87
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:08,239
uh for the novel food application uh

88
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:11,439
we do see that

89
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,000
the landscape is huge right there are

90
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,959
more than

91
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,400
500 brands um i think just on alpha

92
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,400
green we have more than

93
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:24,000
100 uk based uh cbd brands

94
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:27,519
um but we also know that probably

95
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,039
70 of them are getting their ingredients

96
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,158
from kind of like

97
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:34,079
five suppliers and so what you see is

98
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:34,798
that as long as these five suppliers are

99
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,480
getting

100
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:41,680
their noble food application validated

101
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:45,119
um the let's say 70 of brands

102
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,439
will be safe let's say um

103
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,400
at the same time of course that whole

104
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:52,000
mobile food

105
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,158
process um brings a lot of let's say

106
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,120
problems because it it then questions

107
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:58,959
the

108
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,438
it then basically makes it makes a

109
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,000
makes the process of kind of you ask

110
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:04,079
players

111
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,680
launching a brand suddenly in the uk

112
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,519
much harder because they

113
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,438
deficit can then argue okay well you've

114
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,319
not been on the market before

115
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:14,000
february wherever 2020 and you haven't

116
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:15,598
submitted your application

117
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,839
so you can't actually launch a brand

118
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:21,358
which obviously is kind of like against

119
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:22,638
the free market and so it will be

120
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:26,079
interesting to see

121
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:28,639
but i think the fact that there is

122
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:30,079
the novel food application and that

123
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,040
there is actually

124
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,839
some sort of clarity how you get

125
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,000
compliant

126
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:37,679
is already better than what's happening

127
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,560
in europe where

128
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,519
the european court decided cbd is not a

129
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,399
narcotic

130
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:45,279
which was great for industry but at the

131
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,599
same time the

132
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:48,638
european court didn't actually say well

133
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,240
it's a food

134
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,439
right so it remains somehow a gray area

135
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,720
and so you do

136
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:58,800
see um from time to time

137
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,240
certain rates on the retail market in

138
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,478
germany where suddenly

139
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,720
all the product is now illegal and then

140
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:06,560
one month later the same retailer

141
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,800
puts all the same products back on the

142
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,399
retail shelf saying actually now it's

143
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,280
legal again so you have this kind of

144
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:14,959
zigzag strategy in europe which

145
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:17,038
doesn't really help anybody so in that

146
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:20,079
sense i think uk is definitely

147
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:22,719
a bit ahead of europe um

148
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:23,359
and then ireland as you say right i

149
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,080
think

150
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,759
ireland uh is an interesting market it

151
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:28,319
actually is a super interesting market

152
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,840
from

153
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:34,478
if you look at thc habits statistics

154
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:35,519
it's it's probably the highest kind of

155
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:38,959
usage

156
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:42,719
market for thc uh like the kind of

157
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:45,519
black market thc um it's like 20

158
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,080
of the of the population is using that

159
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:48,399
it's a

160
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,159
statistic i saw it in the prohibition

161
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:52,159
partners

162
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,439
and newsletter so i'm not sure how

163
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,280
accurate it is but

164
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:56,478
ultimately you can argue that there is a

165
00:05:55,279 --> 00:06:00,239
huge culture

166
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:02,560
in ireland um but around the regulations

167
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,918
it's probably closer to uh what europe

168
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,399
is doing i.e

169
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:08,639
not much clarity versus what the uk is

170
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,959
trying to do

171
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,560
yeah no i think there's a there's

172
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:14,318
definitely a little bit of lack of

173
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,319
enthusiasm from the politicians here in

174
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,039
ireland to kind of act on

175
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,560
what is being applied across european

176
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:21,120
law ireland seems to be just lagging

177
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,639
behind

178
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,639
but i think it's still some of the

179
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,240
scenarios you could pipe down to

180
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,319
the police are raiding places that are

181
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,000
selling cbd flower and the police don't

182
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,840
have a clue what cbd flower compared to

183
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,560
tac or flower looks like so to them it's

184
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:34,799
just

185
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,600
it's it's cannabis or it's weed and they

186
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,520
need to

187
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,680
lock down on it so i think it's more

188
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:41,758
having clarity from the government that

189
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,600
a bit of education and a bit of training

190
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,120
and being able to know the differences

191
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,960
or even be able to apply for a certain

192
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,399
license might be able to clear that up

193
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:50,959
one thing you might be able to clear up

194
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:52,399
for me and it's almost like swimming in

195
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:54,318
muddy water when you go through the

196
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:55,038
novel food license applications and

197
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,120
everything

198
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:58,560
the novel food for the uk does that

199
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,639
apply to the eu

200
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,478
or the eu have a completely separate

201
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,439
novel food license that uk companies

202
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:06,959
will have to have

203
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:08,079
as well as the uk so the novel food

204
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:12,799
obligation

205
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:15,598
right now is only uh good for the uk one

206
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,960
because it's under the uk fsa and the

207
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:19,199
european has

208
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:20,959
the fsa so the european food and

209
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,439
sundance authority

210
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:25,198
and so it's it's i guess you can kind of

211
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,279
submit the same application

212
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,360
but you need to submit it to a separate

213
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:32,799
authority

214
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,240
okay perfect um i'm going to now finish

215
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,240
on our last topic and there's some of

216
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,720
the success stories recently and the

217
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,478
listings on the london stock exchange

218
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,840
how excited are you guys about the

219
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:44,399
future of the

220
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:47,119
listings over there and some of the ipos

221
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:50,560
that may be happening

222
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,639
um well it's definitely good for the

223
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,839
industry that you see

224
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:58,960
a lot more capital coming into it and

225
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:02,159
can as cannabis becoming um well an

226
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:06,159
investable let's say industry

227
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:09,199
um so you obviously had cannibal

228
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:12,639
ipowing at 6.5

229
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:15,919
pence and now it's trading at

230
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:18,240
100 up so i mean i think

231
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:19,198
north of north of 25 pence or something

232
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,319
so

233
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:26,000
uh it's doing extremely well uh despite

234
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,800
actually having well a lot of sales so

235
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,560
let's say

236
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,720
back to story up right if you look at

237
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,240
the prospectus of that 14 000 pounds of

238
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,080
revenue last year

239
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,080
and it's trading at more than 100

240
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,479
million market cap now

241
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,200
so while it's exciting that you have

242
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,320
this

243
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:45,759
um you know hype and this

244
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,720
flow of capital i'm also very

245
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,838
uh let's say cautious to say okay these

246
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,080
are the companies

247
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,040
who are going to be the winners in the

248
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,600
future

249
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:56,879
and what i don't want is obviously a lot

250
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,959
of retail investors who

251
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:00,159
suddenly lose a lot of money now and

252
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:02,958
kind of like write off

253
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:03,519
cannabis when actually cannabis then

254
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,479
becomes

255
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,039
a much bigger industry uh and and should

256
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,920
be

257
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:12,079
a really big uh sector also for kind of

258
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:15,360
institutional investors so i think

259
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,360
in summary yeah you had three ipos in

260
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,159
the last three weeks doing extremely

261
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,039
well

262
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:22,000
uh cellular goods mgc pharma and

263
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:26,000
cannibal

264
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,120
at the same time um

265
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,958
i'm i'm still very cautious on how the

266
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,360
market will perform when they actually

267
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,399
see

268
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,919
some of the numbers okay

269
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,240
tell me doesn't tell me more do you

270
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:38,799
think the european cannabis industry is

271
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,360
going to be

272
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:41,919
pharmacy based for distribution and for

273
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,320
sales

274
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:46,079
and kept to a medical or can you see

275
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,720
full-on dispensaries like they have over

276
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,639
in north america

277
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,480
um so if you look at the north american

278
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:56,080
market it's very much

279
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:58,959
split into um yes you have

280
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,240
cvs pharmacy distributing some of the

281
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:03,359
cbd products but

282
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,079
also um some of the medical cannabis

283
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,800
products

284
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:07,838
you don't have medical cannabis

285
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:10,559
dispensaries

286
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,240
so purely medical cannabis especially in

287
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,518
states where there is no recreational

288
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,480
market and then once there is

289
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,000
recreational

290
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,480
in the state so for example let's say

291
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,440
new york which is about to go wreck

292
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,200
uh you have you see medical cannabis

293
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,640
dispensaries flipping

294
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,920
to recreational uh dispensaries reason

295
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:30,559
being that

296
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:32,399
the same customer can then still buy the

297
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:34,799
medical cannabis and show their

298
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,240
let's say prescription and get uh the

299
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:37,039
government to reimburse some of the

300
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,120
costs

301
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:40,958
but at the same time you also open up to

302
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,919
a much larger market which is direct

303
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:44,958
market

304
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:45,759
so i actually think a similar evolution

305
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:49,039
will happen

306
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:50,319
in in europe and the uk with the

307
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:52,879
exception that the medical

308
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,399
market is still tiny so you actually

309
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:56,879
don't even have

310
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,078
medical dispensaries neither you have

311
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:59,759
pharmacies

312
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:01,759
who are selling it of course you can

313
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,519
have pharmacies who can dispense it but

314
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,120
it's a very very little number

315
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,600
so instead what you have you have

316
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,039
already let's say vape shop cbd shops

317
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,839
and you have just a much more

318
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:15,278
developed online market for the cbd

319
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,399
products which is very different to

320
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:18,078
again to the

321
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,440
north american market because it's much

322
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:22,239
more thc

323
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,720
uh in terms of kind of like heritage and

324
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,278
so

325
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,759
online was never very big because it was

326
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:27,600
kind of

327
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:29,679
well because you needed to pick up the

328
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,079
product or you needed to go to the store

329
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:32,159
so

330
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:33,278
the online was much more about finding

331
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:35,199
this train

332
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:36,559
in a certain dispensary rather than

333
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,640
actually buying this train

334
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:40,719
and getting it delivered so the way i

335
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:43,360
see the uk evolving is

336
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,839
you will have still the online market

337
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,240
being

338
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,160
very very dominant when it comes to cbd

339
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,680
you will then gradually have

340
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:52,719
a pharmacies opening up to medical

341
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,638
cannabis

342
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,879
and then down the line you will

343
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,919
definitely see the cbd shops and vape

344
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:59,759
shops of today

345
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:01,039
converting to some sort of dispensary

346
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:02,958
structure but then again

347
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:05,838
that will be you know three four five

348
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:07,439
years uh in the future i think

349
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,519
yeah well i've started to see a lot of

350
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,760
even over here some of the cb stores now

351
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,560
call themselves cbd dispensaries

352
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:16,399
and starting to offer a flower cbd

353
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:18,479
flower under 0.2 percent

354
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,000
thc so i think that's a step in the

355
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,839
right direction for

356
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,679
allowing the free markets and and

357
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,519
dispensaries owned by

358
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,278
competent human beings who've gone

359
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,639
through a full regulatory process to

360
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:30,320
apply for a license

361
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,680
to be able to bring to the market as

362
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,160
opposed to limiting to

363
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:36,319
uh pharmacies and what we know will be

364
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:37,360
inferior cannabis if it does go that

365
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,079
route so

366
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,120
let's hopefully yeah it goes the way of

367
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:43,039
the free markets and

368
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,639
it all goes well for the next few years

369
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:47,519
