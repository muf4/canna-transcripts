to make it seem seamless that's the

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,960
what I mean

30
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:10,379
yeah exactly you just jump into ICBC

31
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:12,658
Barcelona in March how did cucumber

32
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:15,719
berries happen to Barcelona event and

33
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:17,219
partnering with spanavus was that an

34
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:18,840
ongoing conversation which is a pretty

35
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:19,798
easy deal to get done when you started

36
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,978
just

37
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,780
it was the easy deal I had this kind of

38
00:01:21,978 --> 00:01:28,438
uh I when I first came into Europe I

39
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:30,239
think this was around 217 I made the uh

40
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:31,559
partnership with spanibus

41
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:34,640
you know honestly I don't even remember

42
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:38,400
if I think I contacted

43
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,900
them I although I it it it's so long ago

44
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,939
and so much has happened in between I'm

45
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,500
not sure but basically I think I

46
00:01:41,938 --> 00:01:46,919
contacted them

47
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:49,680
and uh we basically I basically said hey

48
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:53,280
I want to do this B2B event with you

49
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,420
guys and I they were enough to

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,180
understand that

51
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,560
B2B was a important element that was

52
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,420
going to come to Europe because they'd

53
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,799
everybody had seen it already happen in

54
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:06,719
the states and we did the we we just I

55
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:12,180
don't know it was like it was a totally

56
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:16,680
seamless uh uh uh partnership and uh you

57
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:18,060
know with Carlos and with uh Jose uh

58
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,939
we've always had a wonderful

59
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:24,120
relationship and it just kind of we just

60
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:25,919
really just just just hit the ground

61
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,539
running with them and we didn't look

62
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:29,818
back so I'm really

63
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:32,280
I was really happy then when I did it

64
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:34,439
because I was I wanted to associate with

65
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:38,219
other big brands in Europe because I was

66
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:40,919
the the Newbie they saw the value and

67
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:43,318
now and then it was really uh incumbent

68
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:45,299
upon me to be like okay I'm gonna show

69
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:48,419
you the value of this B2B and make it a

70
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:51,840
success and they they loved it because

71
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:55,079
they see it as a as a compliment uh uh

72
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,239
to what they do and to just make that

73
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,700
whole span of this week have that much

74
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:02,099
more fervor

75
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:03,899
incredible so what part of what Berlin

76
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:06,000
coming just around the corner now is

77
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,400
there a process that you guys go to when

78
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,840
you're choosing the panel speakers do

79
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,879
you sit down and start right well we

80
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,219
want industry leaders first or we want

81
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:15,899
our keynote speaker first what is the

82
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:19,039
kind of first piece of the jigsaw when

83
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,039
you're putting together the panels

84
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,699
experts we we have a meeting we come

85
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:25,500
together and I mean this is actually one

86
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:28,079
of the bane of my existence the

87
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:30,419
discourage putting this uh putting these

88
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,000
these curating these uh

89
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:35,219
all these panels and and finding what

90
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,019
what is uh what's the most germane and

91
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:39,060
relevant topics you need for that

92
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:41,459
particular time I mean you could come up

93
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,739
we got to come up schedule right but

94
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:45,120
cannabis is dog years right so if we

95
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:47,280
come up with a schedule three months

96
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,620
ahead four months ahead

97
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,900
we we pretty much have to stick to it

98
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,900
but I like to be a little malleable

99
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,000
um and flexible because things change so

100
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,099
so quickly a case in point with what's

101
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,139
happening in in Germany right now but

102
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:02,579
basically I sit down with my with my

103
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:06,359
content team

104
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:09,360
and my most trusted uh confidence and uh

105
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:12,360
uh experts and then we just we just say

106
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,340
what you know what's the most germane

107
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,220
and relevant topics that maybe talked

108
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:19,439
about right now in this in whatever uh

109
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,660
respective jurisdiction we're having the

110
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:23,939
event in

111
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,340
for young entrepreneurs or entrepreneurs

112
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:28,379
who might not have visited the icpcs

113
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:31,859
what is the main reason that they should

114
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:35,399
be attending Berlin they're similar for

115
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:38,340
it's it's networking you know I mean we

116
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:41,339
there's no networking like the ICBC in

117
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:44,698
the entirety of Europe everybody pays

118
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:47,279
500 a ticket or more

119
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:48,960
people come from over 80 countries so

120
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,638
it's not just okay we're having an event

121
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:53,459
in Germany and you're going to meet all

122
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,860
these Germans no I'd say maybe 25 of the

123
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:59,159
people are German in at the Berlin event

124
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:01,680
and then we have Americans in Canadians

125
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:05,220
and South Africans and Australians and

126
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:10,079
Russians and Finnish and Czech and Dutch

127
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:13,259
and Spanish and and uh uruguayans and

128
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:16,139
it's it's truly an international uh

129
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:18,660
Affair and I think that's what network

130
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:20,160
if you want to just take two days out of

131
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,660
your life and you want to get the most

132
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,880
done you don't have to travel all these

133
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:26,880
countries they all come to Berlin and

134
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:29,819
it's a One-Stop shop a trefpunt as they

135
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:31,259
would say in uh German and so any

136
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:33,240
entrepreneur okay you're going to get

137
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:35,038
information from the panels there's

138
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,600
going to be stuff stuff here you're

139
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:39,779
you're you're you'll you'll glean and

140
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:42,000
that that'll soak in but there's no more

141
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:45,359
there's no bigger value than actually

142
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,740
coming face to face with your potential

143
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,020
uh

144
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,699
uh partners and helpers in this industry

145
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:53,639
and to be able to just have that

146
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:55,560
one-on-one uh time with them it's

147
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:57,780
invaluable

148
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,220
yeah I couldn't agree more the ability

149
00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:00,659
to network at these events and

150
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,340
especially the caliber of guests that

151
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,539
you have make it definitely one of the

152
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:05,478
most sought after if not sought after

153
00:06:03,538 --> 00:06:08,219
events of the year on the calendar

154
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:09,959
Germany's recent uh announcement that

155
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,820
made where they kind of rolled back or

156
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:14,519
did a diet version of what the

157
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:16,560
legalization was going to be there is an

158
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:18,060
argument that it could potentially be a

159
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,620
good thing because it allows the medical

160
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,019
side of the industry to get more

161
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:24,360
validation and to have a bigger range of

162
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:25,978
products and it also gives home grow to

163
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,319
a lot of let's say the activist side of

164
00:06:25,978 --> 00:06:30,719
the industry do you see any positive

165
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,000
with the step back that they've done or

166
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,500
is it all well it should have pushed on

167
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,600
further we don't look at it as a step

168
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,519
back I see it as a completely positive I

169
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,860
mean it's so funny I think people had

170
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:43,620
certain it's kind of like buy the rumor

171
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:46,680
sell the fact and so everyone we were

172
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:48,120
telling people for six months that this

173
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,620
is what's going to happen they're good

174
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,199
there's a good chance that it's going to

175
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:54,660
be a decrimp thing first with these

176
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:56,699
Social Clubs and then we didn't know

177
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,259
exactly how the social we're going to

178
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:59,699
look we'll know that very soon I think

179
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:02,400
that's actually going through Parliament

180
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:05,819
the bundis uh top right right now as we

181
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:08,279
speak and uh uh and then we we didn't

182
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:10,020
know if what the pot if there's gonna if

183
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:14,038
they were even gonna talk about

184
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:16,740
excuse me pilot projects and um so so so

185
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:18,899
what I mean as an act there's a few

186
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:21,240
problems of this as an activist the

187
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:25,138
first thing I said in 217 when I when I

188
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:28,019
was uh uh when I when I let let off the

189
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:29,879
the first uh Berlin event was that The

190
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:31,318
Regulators are going to [ __ ] [ __ ] up and

191
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:34,379
the what you need the most is a home

192
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:36,720
garden and decrim of cannabis because

193
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:39,779
that just takes the wind out of out of

194
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,979
uh the constant the constabulary sale

195
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:43,799
right

196
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:46,139
and then as a legalizer and as someone

197
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,939
who feels that cannabis is uh is the

198
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:51,538
people's plan and it's a human right to

199
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:53,759
to grow it to use it that's a good thing

200
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:55,199
for me but on a business side I found it

201
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,660
funny when people like oh they didn't

202
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,879
just go for well guess what we've seen

203
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,439
them go for license and regulations in

204
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,879
certain areas like you said that were

205
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:06,240
medical before and we've seen medical

206
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:11,159
getting destroyed right so to do a slow

207
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:13,978
roll out like this and uh uh hopefully

208
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:16,080
methodical uh rollout

209
00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:19,019
it's the best for business actually

210
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:21,240
because all people like all the VCS not

211
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:24,180
the money's not there now good we don't

212
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:29,098
want you money right we want to create a

213
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:31,620
a a a a device verse batch of

214
00:08:29,098 --> 00:08:35,700
entrepreneurs and not have this limited

215
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:37,799
just to Rich Venture capitalists right

216
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,899
that's not how I ever made any of my

217
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:41,299
businesses that's not how I didn't rely

218
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:43,379
on those business those big

219
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:46,679
multi-billion dollar businesses to build

220
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:48,539
the ICBC the ICBC was built on mom and

221
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:50,699
pop businesses and of course we have

222
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:52,860
some bigger businesses too you know like

223
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,680
the 100 200 million dollar range and the

224
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:57,659
private Equity side but really we don't

225
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:59,159
we if the money's not going to pour in

226
00:08:57,659 --> 00:09:01,079
great because look what happened when

227
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:03,539
the money poured in to the Canadian

228
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:06,060
companies you had pump and dumps you had

229
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:08,599
it really [ __ ] up the industry in a

230
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:11,879
lot of ways and was a real bad bad look

231
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:14,519
so that all being said there's plenty of

232
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:16,679
business that can be done with this even

233
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:18,480
with the social club model and we're

234
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:21,958
going to be talking about that in Berlin

235
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:25,740
and then the pilot project model is

236
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:27,239
where we see a uh it turning into which

237
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,620
they'll basically introduce around

238
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,039
December

239
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:35,339
uh which will basically a de facto end

240
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:39,599
around legalization because of the the

241
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:42,240
eu's uh resistance to to license and

242
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,220
regulation so we knew that the EU wasn't

243
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,580
going to go for it we knew Germany was

244
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:49,379
thinking about uh this decrim notion

245
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:52,560
um and we'll see how the social club

246
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:55,379
aspect plays out we'll see how the pilot

247
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:57,359
project uh plays out because as far as I

248
00:09:55,379 --> 00:09:59,278
understand though they will limit the

249
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,740
amount of patients that could or people

250
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:04,080
or participants that can be part of the

251
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:06,778
pilot project specifically they won't

252
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,940
limit how many pilot projects there are

253
00:10:06,778 --> 00:10:11,700
and we can look in Switzerland to start

254
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:14,760
to get an idea of how this might look in

255
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:17,640
Germany but basically there could be one

256
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:20,039
2 000 pilot projects within two three

257
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:22,799
years uh all around Germany which is

258
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:25,139
very exciting and in some ways we've

259
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:27,719
seen when it's kind of gray area which

260
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:29,220
you know we would rather have them just

261
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,680
do like you know let's get it going

262
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,600
let's rock it but because they didn't it

263
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:36,659
actually it actually really helps the

264
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,759
people the average person is going to

265
00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:40,620
have a bigger Advantage now in the

266
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:42,179
market now if you're a big cat and you

267
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:45,360
want to be the Walmart a weed and blah

268
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:47,879
blah blah [ __ ] off anyway because we

269
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,980
don't we don't we don't we don't need

270
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:52,379
that [ __ ] we want we we're here to have

271
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:55,079
every the most amount of people have

272
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:56,700
their slice of their little slice or

273
00:10:55,078 --> 00:10:58,319
bigger depending on how smart they are

274
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:01,259
how much risk they take how hard they

275
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,300
work piece of the pie but we want an

276
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:05,879
even playing field and so for me

277
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:08,099
personally I see this as a

278
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:10,019
um just the movement in itself is good

279
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,700
no matter what just to see Germany do

280
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:13,679
something like that the movement's great

281
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:16,019
but to really then how does that

282
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:19,739
translate into business

283
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:21,839
and business is thriving it it does and

284
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,820
it will

285
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,860
and do you see we've just mentioned

286
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,420
Switzerland there we're off to Prague

287
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,100
now at the end of the month you see that

288
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:31,019
little Trifecta of country is having a

289
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,459
massive influence on Europe or out of

290
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:33,778
those three who do you think is going to

291
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:36,500
have the most success for let's say

292
00:11:33,778 --> 00:11:38,939
adult use Market

293
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,919
Germany by far I mean there's just no

294
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:43,079
question they're already there by far by

295
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:44,299
far it's I don't even I don't even I

296
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:47,099
mean

297
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:49,139
who I mean Germany has the size they

298
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:51,240
have the movement going they have

299
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:53,100
everything uh and you see with

300
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,839
Switzerland they're just

301
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:59,100
if they're very you know it can be

302
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:00,959
bureaucratic and you can get caught up

303
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,720
with a lot of things in Switzerland and

304
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:05,458
things go slow in general even though

305
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,560
Switzerland's been really cool on weed

306
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:09,179
you know for for since I used to live

307
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:13,500
there when it was quasi-legal in the

308
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:15,419
late 90s right it was amazing but uh so

309
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,759
Switzerland is always a fun country but

310
00:12:15,419 --> 00:12:20,039
in terms of business no we Switzerland

311
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:22,439
just got decimated their their CBD

312
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:26,099
market right they banked it all on CBD

313
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:27,779
and it's now these pilot okay cool but

314
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,519
there's not how many pilot projects are

315
00:12:27,778 --> 00:12:31,919
there and who's really doing it and What

316
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,899
needs what what has to happen for things

317
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:36,059
to get done there the real process

318
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:38,639
Germany I don't see that I don't see

319
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:40,679
it's going to be as cumbersome in in uh

320
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,078
to start these pilot projects but

321
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:45,239
certainly not these Social Clubs and so

322
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:48,000
if you're an ancillary business and you

323
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,759
make trim machines or you make uh

324
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,639
extract machines you're golden in the

325
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:55,799
German Market because that's what that

326
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:58,079
because all these because what we want

327
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:59,759
is more if more cannabis is being grown

328
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:02,879
then

329
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:04,919
and more uh and used that all these

330
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:09,720
ancillary products are going to be

331
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:11,639
needed so it's uh it's wonderful uh it's

332
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,560
it's wonderful to see this happen in

333
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:16,139
Germany and I I think there's no

334
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:19,679
question that we're going to see in just

335
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:22,320
a few months or all these opportunities

336
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:24,539
about abounding

337
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,800
yeah I think some of the big Winners had

338
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:27,599
at the German announcement there are

339
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:29,519
companies like Scott's Miracle Grow or

340
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,200
companies that actually sell products

341
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,519
for people to grow at home I think

342
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,800
there's got to be a massive massive

343
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:35,940
Market just in regular consumers wanting

344
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:37,139
to go there a couple of plants every

345
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,300
year

346
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:41,940
right and then but you have to know that

347
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:43,620
that all people now can be get a

348
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:46,380
surrogate to grow it and there will be

349
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:49,379
these big grows starting just under the

350
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:51,299
social club auspices right now you're

351
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:53,338
ready in your mind your auntie all have

352
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:55,799
two or three fronts you're you're

353
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:57,420
looking at 1500 plant Gardens because if

354
00:13:55,799 --> 00:14:00,599
there could be 500 people for the Social

355
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:02,778
Club and three plants allotted per 1500

356
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,278
plant Gardens well I don't know about

357
00:14:02,778 --> 00:14:10,019
what they're doing

358
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:11,700
you know in in in in in America a fit

359

team playing Garden let me tell you

360
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:16,139
something right now that that those

361
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:17,519
those folks know how to grow so we're

362
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:19,500
going to see a lot of American Master

363
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,740
Growers come over to Europe right now

364
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:26,339
and start getting these grows on and

365
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:28,560
then uh we'll see how how the creative

366
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:32,339
lawyering how they how they'll how

367
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:35,819
they'll uh uh set up and and structure

368
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:38,639
these entities you know it's it's uh we

369
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:41,278
saw you know we saw under this kind of

370
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,680
gray area in Oregon we saw gray area in

371
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:45,539
Canada and we've got those multi-billion

372
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:48,599
dollar businesses in Canada evaluated

373
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:51,179
under medical auspices right which no

374
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,339
one even thought would be possible a few

375
00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:54,299
years ago and then you certain things

376
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:56,940
happen

377
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:57,799
in the market and so many people are

378
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:01,260
like

379
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:03,179
it's like who thinks that you're not a

380
00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:05,458
real entrepreneur if something happens

381
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:09,899
if movement goes forward and you're like

382
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:13,138
oh no it's kind of a soft soft way of

383
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:15,778
thinking and a a champion way of

384
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:18,659
thinking is we've had this movement

385
00:15:15,778 --> 00:15:20,338
1500 plant Gardens pilot projects and

386
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:22,319
that's just the start

387
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:24,120
let's get in let's roll let's see what's

388
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,220
let's see what's going on and where we

389
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:28,440
can get in where we fit in and that's

390
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,060
those are the folks that are gonna I

391
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,160
think that's gonna be an obvious thing

392
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:33,479
though in it by by the end of the year I

393
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:35,039
think all these things I'm saying now

394
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,139
are gonna be like oh Alex was right I

395
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:40,740
can't yeah and now people are a little

396
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:42,180
bit nay saying it but there's no there's

397
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,799
I've just seen it happen in too many

398
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:45,359
markets too many jurisdictions and I

399
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:47,338
know exactly what's going to happen the

400
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,800
people are going to figure it out man I

401
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:51,959
think it's a huge boon not only for the

402
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:53,819
German Market but it's going to resonate

403
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:55,979
all around Europe

404
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,360
yeah I couldn't agree more amazing we've

405
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,680
