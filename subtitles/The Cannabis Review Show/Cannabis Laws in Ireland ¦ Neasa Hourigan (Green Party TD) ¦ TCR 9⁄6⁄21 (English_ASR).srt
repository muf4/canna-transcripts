00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,359
yeah yeah now as i said this is a

18
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:40,640
business show this is nothing more than

19
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:42,238
basically trying to provide some

20
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,280
information and education to any of the

21
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:45,439
viewers who are

22
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,960
looking young entrepreneurs or people

23
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:47,439
looking to pivot into this industry

24
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,359
would

25
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:50,558
which will be an exciting new sector

26
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:52,719
regardless of

27
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:54,959
the political party in charge it i think

28
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,679
it's it's an if not when now

29
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,039
uh or when not if it's basically the

30
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:59,520
first thing i wanted to talk to you

31
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,960
about

32
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,520
i'm going to keep you in and out in

33
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,320
within the time slot it's

34
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,719
basically the laws that the that ireland

35
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:08,798
have

36
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:10,478
are not in tandem with the eu are you

37
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,040
aware of the european ruling that

38
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:13,280
happened

39
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,400
in relation to the regulation of toc

40
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,519
quantities in

41
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,960
hemp i am and i think you know

42
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:20,879
increasingly what we're seeing

43
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,239
is other jurisdictions and countries

44
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:23,759
moving beyond

45
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:25,599
um ireland's understanding of the

46
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,560
cannabis issue and the hemp issue and

47
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:29,199
thc and cbd there's a real recognition

48
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,799
of

49
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,118
not just the medicinal qualities of

50
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:36,560
cannabis but the the therapeutic

51
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:39,040
qualities of us um and therefore i think

52
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,159
you know whereas we we do need to

53
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,680
probably reform

54
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,000
um do we from my point of view we

55
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,360
definitely need to reform domestically

56
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,280
i do think that there's a serious

57
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,920
question now around um

58
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,799
bringing ourselves into line with the

59
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,439
the european

60
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,640
norm because we do live within you know

61
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:58,959
a community

62
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:02,079
of of um nations and it only makes sense

63
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:05,280
that for trade and for business

64
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:07,359
um we have some similar

65
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,560
standards and we see that in food we see

66
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:10,560
that in medicines

67
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,840
and and i think that that you know we

68
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,400
need to make sure that we align very

69
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,280
well in this area too

70
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,159
perfect and who do you who do you think

71
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,159
is the person that

72
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:23,199
is responsible for enacting that is

73
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:24,799
there a series of um

74
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:26,639
people working in the background working

75
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,319
out there's a specific party who

76
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,238
is there something that can happen to be

77
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:31,598
able to enact that further and to stop

78
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,039
some of let's say the

79
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:34,399
the clamp downs that have happened on

80
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,239
some of the stores like blooms and

81
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,920
little collins which have kind of been

82
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,400
completely unnecessary and seems to be a

83
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:42,238
waste of taxpayer money just because

84
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,080
there hasn't been a catch up within the

85
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,878
european ruling is there a specific

86
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,840
person yeah

87
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,399
i i i think when we saw those kind of

88
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,439
incidents

89
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,879
it just shows you know how lacking in

90
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:56,639
clarity our own

91
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:58,318
domestic policies are and how

92
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:59,839
you know like the guardian will will

93
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:01,439
take their instruction from legislation

94
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,560
and when when there's a lack of clarity

95
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:03,919
there

96
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,680
you know they'll revert to the status

97
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:07,199
quo and so i i think those very

98
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,800
unfortunate incidents and i'm sure

99
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:12,158
incredibly difficult for the people

100
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:15,920
involved um really showed that

101
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:16,959
you know the the the the eu community in

102
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:18,958
which we live

103
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,479
has moved beyond what our domestic law

104
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,280
is capable of dealing with

105
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:25,119
um and i think there are it it it

106
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,759
straddles a number of departments

107
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,640
so um you know that that would be

108
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:30,158
something i think for

109
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:32,000
for the enterprise department to

110
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:33,759
consider really um

111
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,639
and you know certainly if you're talking

112
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:37,919
about uh the the eu region

113
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:39,919
that's something that they they should

114
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,598
be concerning themselves with um but

115
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:43,199
obviously a lot of the regulation would

116
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:44,079
be happening in the department of health

117
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:45,439
so it's something that we're going to

118
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,200
need collaboration across a number of

119
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:50,079
departments to get right

120
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,759
but i do think that it implies a

121
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,040
requirement for greater reform more

122
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:54,479
generally

123
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,158
yeah i agree and i don't think there's

124
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,359
any blame that needs to be put towards

125
00:03:56,158 --> 00:03:59,120
the guards and this i think they're

126
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,879
following basically laws that

127
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,239
they're being told to enact and they

128
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:04,239
have no

129
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,840
ability to be able to understand the

130
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,599
difference between what a cbd border

131
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,400
flower looks like compared to a thc

132
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:09,919
board so

133
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,920
there's there's no well this is it

134
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:15,119
absolutely and and i would say that

135
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:16,000
more generally like i'm politicians

136
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,680
aren't the experts

137
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,040
on this because usually what you're

138
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,720
doing is you're trying to get the

139
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,960
experts in the room and the experts are

140
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,919
not just the professional experts or the

141
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:25,439
business experts

142
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,758
but all the also the people who have the

143
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:29,759
lived experience of of what the impact

144
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,400
of particular legislation is

145
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,439
um and so uh it's really important to

146
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:35,439
kind of start listening

147
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:38,079
to what people's on the ground

148
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:39,600
experience of this kind of thing is and

149
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:40,560
certainly the guardian are not expected

150
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,360
to be experts

151
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,879
you know they'll be instructed how to

152
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,479
deal with certain legislation or the

153
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:47,839
lack thereof

154
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:49,519
and therefore they're sometimes in a

155
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:51,279
very difficult position i i have to say

156
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:54,319
my experience with guardi is that they

157
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:56,319
are very well aware of um

158
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:58,319
you know the kind of spectrum of of

159
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:00,399
usage that's involved here

160
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:01,680
um and it's just that they don't we

161
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:03,359
don't necessarily have um the

162
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,918
legislative framework in place to help

163
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,600
them to do their job well in this area

164
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:08,959
yeah and i think one of the trends

165
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,240
that's going to be happening and grow

166
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:12,560
bigger and bigger that probably at the

167
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,680
very start now was kind of the crux of

168
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,560
the issue is

169
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,000
the ability for a cbd flower to be sold

170
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,680
you've never seen that on the market

171
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,959
before it's always been kind of

172
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,439
illegal illicit uh high thc content

173
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:26,079
where

174
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:27,839
that european ruling allows for a cbd

175
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:28,719
flower to be sold and said it's that

176
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:31,038
understanding

177
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,400
from the guards and the retailer that uh

178
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:34,639
is kind of the little like

179
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:36,159
hole in that area there one of the next

180
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,560
topics i want to jump onto

181
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,759
is the biggest fears from politicians on

182
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:45,120
a legal industry

183
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:47,439
is this it is it basically

184
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,639
lack of education on the topic here or

185
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:50,560
is it

186
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,639
uh won't somebody please think of the

187
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,839
children type screaming from the roof

188
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:58,079
is there is there a direct employee

189
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:00,079
there's such a hindrance against it

190
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:01,599
there's definitely a bit of that and and

191
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:03,279
i think that you know

192
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,280
during the government negotiations we

193
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:07,119
had it was probably one of the most

194
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:08,478
fraught conversations that we had with

195
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,240
our government partners

196
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:15,279
because our own policy would be

197
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:18,240
um to make it a a category four

198
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:18,959
drug and that we would we would be

199
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,400
promoting

200
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:25,599
the the creation of cannabis cafes um

201
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:28,719
and that there would be a legal um

202
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:32,160
pathway like a fully taxed legal

203
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,560
pathway to to the provision of of

204
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,840
cannabis substances and

205
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,319
um that did elicit reactions that i

206
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:41,038
would say

207
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,319
are kind of fear-based um and one of the

208
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:43,680
phrases i heard a lot was that it's a

209
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,080
gateway drug

210
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,680
and i think that my reaction to that is

211
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:49,519
always it is right now

212
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,038
it is it is a gateway drug now because

213
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,399
it's an illegal drug and you place

214
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:54,560
people in the realm of of

215
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:56,560
of criminal behavior and therefore if

216
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,160
you want to access any of these products

217
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,240
you often have have to have an

218
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,039
engagement with criminal actors

219
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,598
and therefore you know it's it's more

220
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:05,918
likely

221
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:07,199
that that misuse would escalate when

222
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:10,478
you're into that world

223
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,478
so we have through a lack of

224
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:13,519
you know moving with with the times and

225
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:16,000
moving with the

226
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:16,959
the the requirement for new legislation

227
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,120
we have

228
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:23,519
created a situation where um

229
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,199
this product can can be a gateway drug

230
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:26,000
because it moves people into an area

231
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,840
that they shouldn't be

232
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,360
and it should be something that is legal

233
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:33,359
and regulated um

234
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,960
so i think that my there is a definite

235
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,560
and genuine concern

236
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:40,239
for younger people and and i wouldn't um

237
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,959
discount that and i wouldn't underplay

238
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:46,079
that but my my feeling is that that is

239
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:48,959
mostly based on

240
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:50,079
not a direct experience of the issue and

241
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:51,680
i think that

242
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:53,199
um and where i know we're going to talk

243
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,680
later about you know the way forward and

244
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,400
everything but

245
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,879
i think it's incredibly important that

246
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:00,000
we

247
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:03,520
expose um both the general public

248
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,519
and politicians um to

249
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:07,439
you know the reality of what this means

250
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:08,959
for people but the reality of what a

251
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:10,959
more legal framework

252
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,318
would would provide for people and and

253
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:13,918
how it might safeguard them

254
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,840
but also the reality of what we do right

255
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:16,799
now which has placed them in contact

256
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:20,079
with you know

257
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,319
um gangs and an illegal and criminal um

258
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:23,839
conduct uh we also make them incredibly

259
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,598
unsafe because the product isn't

260
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:26,239
regulated and people can be imbibing

261
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:29,439
anything

262
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,800
so i think it's just more about um

263
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:32,559
educating them and making that

264
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,240
information available to them

265
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,478
i think it's an argument that you you

266
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,320
know or it's a discussion that

267
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,519
would be really useful and you could win

268
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,760
the argument by

269
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,839
simply placing all of the facts on the

270
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:46,958
table and having an honest

271
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,320
not fear-based discussion around it yeah

272
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,518
well i couldn't agree with you more i

273
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,959
think the simplest way to try and

274
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,519
explain to some of the politicians that

275
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,879
is

276
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:57,519
if their teenage child has gone out in

277
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:59,360
to let's say test something whether it's

278
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,639
alcohol or whatever it is kids are kids

279
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,080
they're all going to get into some sort

280
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:03,360
of mischief at some stage

281
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,440
at the moment if you're going to get

282
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,879
into cannabis your only market is to go

283
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,200
to a dealer who's also selling

284
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:10,958
cocaine could also sell them pills could

285
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,440
also sell them a myriad of other drugs

286
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:14,159
where

287
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,000
the option should be that there's a cafe

288
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:18,480
that sells cbd flour

289
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
that has no thc in it and if there is a

290
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,680
route into this

291
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,360
into smoking cannabis or consuming

292
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:23,838
cannabis in any way shape or form that

293
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,639
it's

294
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,000
the most temp tepid version you could

295
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:29,679
possibly get as opposed to

296
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,440
they're sending kids out into scenarios

297
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:34,559
that's either a gonna harden them or

298
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:37,519
b send them down the wrong path

299
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:39,278
well i i agree with you and i think that

300
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:42,399
um

301
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:44,799
you know it's there is a real spectrum

302
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,679
of of opinion about this and i think

303
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:48,879
that um

304
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:52,000
people's politicians particularly

305
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:55,039
are overly influenced by

306
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,480
an older more conservative voter because

307
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:58,240
those are the people that vote

308
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,480
right and that's the reality and there's

309
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,720
there's also there's always a framing

310
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,519
on all political action like that i i am

311
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,200
worried

312
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,959
that even as we kind of start to make

313
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,320
more progress on kind of the medicinal

314
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:10,559
side of things and we see

315
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,160
we start to see reform there that all of

316
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,919
the larger three parties are

317
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:15,919
really still at the stage of maybe

318
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:18,000
considering decriminalization

319
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:19,360
now to me decriminalization is is in

320
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
some ways the worst of all worlds

321
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,120
because

322
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,440
it's still an unregulated drug and um

323
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,320
and and that doesn't really protect that

324
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,120
young person

325
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:33,360
and and you know that's really my my

326
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,799
my uh concern here is that like i would

327
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,919
be coming from the the place where

328
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:40,000
look on balance and i'm not

329
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:41,120
under i'm not undercutting or saying

330
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,078
that there is no negative

331
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,360
um aspects to cannabis use i i of course

332
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:46,719
completely agree that

333
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,480
and and i and i take those very

334
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,879
seriously but on balance

335
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,039
i would prefer to trust people and help

336
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:54,639
them to make decisions in a safe way

337
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:57,039
than have a draconian criminal

338
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:59,199
legislation around the issue and put

339
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:00,799
all of the actual decision-making in the

340
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,720
hands of criminal gangs

341
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:04,319
yeah no i couldn't agree with you more

342
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,920
on that one we're going to move on to

343
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,760
the last topic now before i do i just

344
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:09,679
want to get clarity on

345
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:11,278
we basically talk to pretty much most of

346
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:11,919
the departments it's the minister for

347
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:14,159
health

348
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:15,679
who's responsible for any legislation

349
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:17,199
that would move forward or we're all

350
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:19,519
correct so everybody can agree

351
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,399
on that that is the person who does make

352
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,399
the decision

353
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,679
it's not the justice department it's not

354
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,519
the guards it's

355
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:28,239
the realm within the department of

356
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,399
health to to make this uh reform

357
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,440
discussion

358
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,919
yes that that's my understanding of it

359
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,120
and

360
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:39,838
because it would be um

361
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,278
a regulated drug um it would be it would

362
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,399
be in that

363
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:45,120
public health and well-being um area and

364
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,839
that's why

365
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,120
um you know i've been talking to um

366
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,959
minister frank feen

367
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,078
around pushing forward the the drugs

368
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,039
citizens assembly which i know we're

369
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:55,439
going to talk about now but

370
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:56,719
that he would be in the minis in the in

371
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,519
for health so

372
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,480
although i have to say um as we move

373
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,240
through

374
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,159
there absolutely would be issues around

375
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,079
like well how would we regulate it then

376
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:08,639
and that would be an issue for justice

377
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:10,078
and then how taxes that's a really

378
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,759
important part of us because

379
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:13,759
obviously we we don't want to tax it out

380
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:14,480
of existence so then it still remains in

381
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:15,919
in

382
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,278
uh in the waste in the way cigarettes

383
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:18,639
have become so expensive and now there's

384
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,838
a whole kind of criminal enterprise

385
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,278
around cheap cigarettes

386
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,120
we don't want to we maybe there's a

387
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:24,399
sliding scale of taxation around the

388
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,879
content

389
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,240
we sent in a good uh a good taxation

390
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,759
system to the chairman of the revenue

391
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,639
and got a reply from the office so again

392
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:32,000
i think you're right

393
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,079
it's the different departments need to

394
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,639
come together but somebody needs to put

395
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:37,278
on

396
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,278
their leadership hat and realize that

397
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:41,360
this population that's getting old

398
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:42,958
are all used to this it's not as if

399
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,879
they're that older population

400
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:46,399
the the 40 and 50 year olds now have

401
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:48,399
lived to nightclubs

402
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,399
they've lived through socializing it's

403
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,759
not as if it's a different mentality

404
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,519
mindset and they're going to want to

405
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:54,720
have a comfortable later on in life

406
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,399
and this is one of the products that

407
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,759
will be available to somebody who's 50

408
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,600
or 60 with arthritis

409
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:02,000
or a number of other different ailments

410
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,079
so i'm conscious at a time now i want to

411
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,879
get you out on the last topic so the way

412
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:07,120
forward

413
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:09,200
is it a citizens assembly or what do you

414
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,360
suggest is the best way forward for the

415
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,639
industry to get legalized in ireland

416
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,720
well as as i said we in the greens have

417
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,360
have for a long time been supportive of

418
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,360
of um

419
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,399
kind of reform in this area and our

420
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,639
policy is for

421
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,519
cannabis cafes and for a fully regulated

422
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,959
provision

423
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:31,120
uh like a pathway to supply um and

424
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:33,278
uh that you could have you know your own

425
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,839
personal plans and

426
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:37,278
so i i think it was very important to us

427
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,760
to get something into the program for

428
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:40,000
government

429
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:41,039
around this uh now we're dealing with

430
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,519
two parties who

431
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:45,039
really don't share our views at all and

432
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,320
it was a very heated

433
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:48,319
discussion and what we got in the end

434
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,600
was the citizens assembly now

435
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:54,000
i suppose my view on this is that

436
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,759
uh there genuinely is very strong

437
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,399
opinions on both sides

438
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:00,399
on this and some people want to see it

439
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,198
completely criminalized and absolutely

440
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,679
nothing

441
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:04,399
um and won't accept that the kind of war

442
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:06,879
on drugs meant

443
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,480
you know um strategy has kind of failed

444
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,039
and on the other hand you have people

445
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,800
who want

446
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:12,319
absolutely no regulation they just want

447
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:13,679
to be able it's a natural thing

448
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,519
let's just everybody do what they want

449
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:16,879
with it and i mean in a world where

450
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,320
we're starting to tax sugar because we

451
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:19,838
know it's bad i don't think that that's

452
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,879
reasonable either

453
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,160
so um i i think the best thing to do is

454
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:25,600
to get everybody in a room and then

455
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:26,879
nobody has to have the answer going into

456
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,600
the room but we'll come out with the

457
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:28,958
answer

458
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,720
afterwards and that's what a citizens

459
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:33,198
assembly does and where

460
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,800
there is a social issue where there's a

461
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:36,719
real and genuine

462
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:38,399
and i and i have to say even even those

463
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,360
who i strongly disagree with on the full

464
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,440
criminalization

465
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,120
side of things their concerns are

466
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,480
genuine and and need to be heard and

467
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,959
need to be taken seriously

468
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,039
where there's a genuine fear around it

469
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:50,799
and i would liken this to repeal

470
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:52,240
getting people in that room and allowing

471
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:54,159
them to

472
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,680
to consider all of the science and all

473
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:58,240
of the lived experience

474
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:59,439
and and come to some you know serious

475
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,480
conclusions around that i think that

476
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,199
that's

477
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,480
the best way forward none of the three

478
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:06,719
larger parties

479
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,680
finale final fall shinton support

480
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,920
legalization

481
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:13,838
fully and therefore there is no um

482
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:16,159
legislative route

483
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,920
with the larger parties to get there yet

484
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:19,439
and if we can get us in this assembly

485
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:21,519
that's based on

486
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,880
you know hearing testimony and and based

487
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,278
on those 100 people

488
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:27,039
taking the time to do it properly i

489
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:27,600
think that is a way to find that middle

490
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:29,759
ground

491
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,839
that works for people and i have to say

492
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,278
you know the irish public generally are

493
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,320
a little bit further along than

494
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:36,720
politicians on

495
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,320
on a lot of social issues i think

496
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,680
they're further along on this and i

497
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,839
think they're very mindful

498
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:42,879
that you know there's increasingly

499
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,959
strong

500
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:46,320
substances available out there that have

501
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:47,838
you know kind of

502
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,000
cannabis that's been sprayed with all

503
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,079
sorts of things um

504
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,078
you know high levels of we don't know

505
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:56,159
what and spray it onto stuff

506
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,679
i i think there's a real acceptance now

507
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:00,319
that we need to move ahead

508
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:00,958
i would like to see legalization um but

509
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,920
i don't need

510
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,958
i think the great thing about the

511
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,240
citizens assembly is i don't need to

512
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:06,838
have all of those answers

513
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,360
um all we need to do is create a

514
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,880
situation where those 100 people

515
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,800
can come up with some right answers that

516
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:14,399
work for for the irish context and for

517
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,679
irish society

518
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,600
yeah i couldn't agree with you more

519
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:19,758
about size that a coin need to be heard

520
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,680
equally and that the facts should be

521
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,519
able to win the argument out so

522
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:24,719
if we can ever help in reaching out and

523
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,240
finding people i think

524
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,839
the top five stories from either

525
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,399
argument for and against

526
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,000
and have five real life stories for and

527
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,519
against and see which ones are the most

528
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,159
compelling and offer the best

529
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,519
argument for legalization i want to
