00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:10,960
welcome to the next episode of the

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,240
Cannabis review I'm delighted to join in

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,679
this episode by yuran Penn who's a

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,519
co-founder at hortica a their Precision

6
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:19,559
Horticultural company how you keeping

7
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:22,160
today

8
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:26,159
youran thank you very much thank you for

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,759
having me here on pleased get to talk to

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,640
you you guys have some incredible

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,720
technology do you maybe want to give

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,200
everyone a little overview of how you

13
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:35,960
ended up founding hortica and what the

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,960
purpose of the company

15
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:44,679
is I would be glad myself I'm coming

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:48,600
from academic background from a I have

17
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:52,159
my PhD and postdoc in

18
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:56,558
Neuroscience ER doing my PhD I was part

19
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:59,038
of my research was around ER addiction

20
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:02,000
drug addiction in general more specific

21
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:06,760
and this drw drove me actually back then

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:11,039
it was already more than 15 17 years ago

23
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:15,240
H to the medical cannabis which was just

24
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:20,040
started back then in

25
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:24,438
Israel and after having a few

26
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:28,479
ventures in the medical cannabis field I

27
00:01:24,438 --> 00:01:33,559
decided to focus on the raw material

28
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:35,799
itself and this is what drove me ER to

29
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,320
establish

30
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:41,840
hortica very interesting I'm going to

31
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:47,078
jump straight in can we explain what a

32
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:49,399
gas model is a g AAS model um what is a

33
00:01:47,078 --> 00:01:54,319
grow as a service model and how can

34
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:58,200
everybody understand it sure so we are

35
00:01:54,319 --> 00:02:00,839
not hortica istia is a technological

36
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,640
company in the field of controlled

37
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,759
environment

38
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:11,318
agriculture one of our focuses is

39
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:14,840
around cannabis but this is our field is

40
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:16,878
also focus on local food security and

41
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:20,200
when we talk about grow as a service

42
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:23,439
grow as a service mean that we tailored

43
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:24,479
the project for a specific client for a

44
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:27,639
specific

45
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:30,439
geography for specific

46
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:34,318
regulation and then the

47
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:36,800
end user he doesn't need to be an expert

48
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:39,639
in in that growth field and if we are

49
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:44,360
going back to cannabies we know at least

50
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:49,518
in the US it's more common when people

51
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:53,040
talk about ER all those grow experts and

52
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:59,599
and so here with our system there is no

53
00:02:53,039 --> 00:03:00,439
need for the A and expert in term of a a

54
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:02,598
a

55
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:06,680
is it

56
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:08,039
a in general the whole system is being

57
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:12,879
managed

58
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:16,878
remotely and it's operating more like a

59
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:21,120
a server Farm than a

60
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:24,039
real farm so

61
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,200
okay for everybody who hasn't seen

62
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:28,000
something like this it basically allows

63
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:30,399
an entrepreneur who might not have

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,840
extensive cultivation experience to be

65
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,438
able to say I'm actually going to be

66
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,719
able to develop a flower product I don't

67
00:03:34,438 --> 00:03:39,519
need the expertise I can bring in your

68
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:41,878
software your Hardware The Internet of

69
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:45,000
Things capabilities and the precise

70
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:47,598
management of each individual strain and

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,598
nutrients depending on whatever location

72
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:52,438
and target audience you

73
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:56,399
have it's it's completely completely

74
00:03:52,438 --> 00:03:59,400
right to describe it very nice ow

75
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,319
and a customer can think of the system

76
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:05,120
as a 3D printer you know getting the

77
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:07,679
right genetics and pushing the right

78
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,560
bottom for protocol and then it's run

79
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,480
actually also hands off and this is part

80
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,238
of the the process we are training

81
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:19,199
technicians in the end of support of the

82
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:21,279
system but we take the also the

83
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,400
responsibility on the grow and this is

84
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:26,319
done remotely as you mentioned through

85
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:30,439
the iot which sits in the heart of the

86
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:32,680
system this very unique control card

87
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:35,120
that we developed again it's not

88
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:38,280
specific only for cannabis but is now

89
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,840
today's the most advanced uh control

90
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:40,839
card in

91
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:47,439
agriculture and this gives us the

92
00:04:44,038 --> 00:04:50,000
ability actually from one control center

93
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:52,399
to control those growth doesn't matter

94
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,439
where they are in the world I'm now

95
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:57,239
sitting with you I'm controlling I'm in

96
00:04:54,439 --> 00:05:00,519
Israel located now I'm controlling our

97
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,560
facility in Tulsa Oklahoma uh in real

98
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:05,758
time

99
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,839
and and I would imagine that it's a very

100
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,479
uh advantageous product for people who

101
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:12,758
might want to Vertical who might not

102
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:16,639
have expansive space and or

103
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:20,000
um House of other things such as ding

104
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:22,879
electricity or water or or nutrients if

105
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,839
it's Precision managed then the waste in

106
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:28,199
the overhead be

107
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:31,119
minimiz so the this is actually where

108
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:33,759
the advantage of H of the system comes

109
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:37,079
also when we compare to competitors

110
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:40,319
today or what exist today on the

111
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:42,918
market and this goes to our basic

112
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:46,439
pattern of environment within

113
00:05:42,918 --> 00:05:50,038
environment and the and growing in those

114
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:52,639
closed loop modules so instead of

115
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:55,839
dealing with a huge volume of a

116
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:59,120
warehouse building where the plans

117
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:02,399
themselves only take very little space

118
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:05,120
out of of this huge space needs to be

119
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:08,000
dealt with hortica because we broke it

120
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:13,280
we are only dealing with one tenth to

121
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:17,279
115th of this volume this brings a a

122
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:20,598
very big reduction in the cost of

123
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:23,758
electricity and needed to

124
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:28,319
be this is one of the biggest as indoor

125
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:31,360
Growers familiar expenses in the end ER

126
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,199
is electricity so the efficienc and the

127
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,199
second is the efficiency of the growth

128
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:39,720
that we go so we go to a very short

129
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:43,560
Cycles in the way that we also we don't

130
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:46,880
grow big plants but we grow in a method

131
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:50,120
similar to a sea of green many short

132
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:52,839
plants per square meter per box we call

133
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:57,399
it growing the top of the muffin so we

134
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:58,598
are only growing the central flower and

135
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:01,638
this is also how we get the

136
00:06:58,598 --> 00:07:05,598
standardization between that we get to

137
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:08,960
already in Oklahoma to a 60 days cycle

138
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:11,319
including dry and this is the second and

139
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:14,239
the most I don't know if to say the most

140
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:16,560
but the system is the only system in the

141
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,038
world that the dry is part of the

142
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,399
process of the same process it's being

143
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:26,199
done before Harvest so the system

144
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:32,399
finishes seven weeks of grow and

145
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:34,960
switches to a dry mode then the the dry

146
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:39,359
is being done before Harvest when they

147
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:43,359
are still standing maximizing both a

148
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:46,720
terapin levels but also Vis visually we

149
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:49,240
are not losing a troms in this most

150
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,319
sensitive part and this is also the most

151
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:55,400
sensitive part in term of risk

152
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:58,800
management in Catching contamination so

153
00:07:55,399 --> 00:08:01,560
har it is being done a box by box only

154
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,240
after dry and this is a huge advance and

155
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:07,680
this is also reduce the need for having

156
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:11,478
drying rooms

157
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,038
and it's incredible um on a time scale

158
00:08:11,478 --> 00:08:15,399
what is the time scale from first

159
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:18,120
initially planting seed to cultivation

160
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:21,239
to drawing and what's the quantities

161
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:23,918
that one component can can

162
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:27,280
hold so we are talking about in the

163
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:30,439
system um we are starting with

164
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:33,240
propagation room but in the it will be

165
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:36,320
actually on those we call it the ink the

166
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,278
ink will come from one Central

167
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,240
propagation facility in order not to

168
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:44,480
have it in any facility it will come as

169
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:48,039
cassettes and the introducing this

170
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:51,879
cassette which is a a rooted clone okay

171
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:55,159
in the size and and shape it's a eight

172
00:08:51,879 --> 00:09:00,519
weeks including for most strains eight

173
00:08:55,159 --> 00:09:05,199
weeks 60 days including rine and with at

174
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:07,919
least half a kilo 500 gram per box per

175
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:12,600
cycle of two month including the

176
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:16,078
dry we achieved something that not many

177
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:20,000
indoor grower achieve beautiful result

178
00:09:16,078 --> 00:09:22,078
with sativa strains they take a little

179
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,480
bit longer but when we talk in our

180
00:09:22,078 --> 00:09:27,319
system a little bit longer it's a week

181
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:31,039
longer but they give higher yields

182
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:34,720
actually than the indic strengths and we

183
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:39,078
are achieving above in the US where the

184
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,440
focus is on THC high THC as possible H

185
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:43,879
we are

186
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:46,760
achieving above 25

187
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:48,480
27% about 28 total

188
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:50,360
cannabinoids

189
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:55,600
with

190
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:58,720
2% terapin and it's a play with lower

191
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,959
THC lower canabo Str we get to higher

192
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,079
therapy

193
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:06,919
levels so in one of them we reached

194
00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:11,039
almost 5% th

195
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:13,120
cannaboid therapin my apology

196
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:15,360
levels it really is incredible

197
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,839
technology I wanted to move on to now

198
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,519
your uh position on the editorial board

199
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,320
at the Journal of cannabis research by

200
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,919
Nature group can you let tell us a

201
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,680
little bit about this organization and

202
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:30,599
what the work that is that they do so

203
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:34,319
the journal is a is is an academic perod

204

clinical ER related to cannabis

208
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:54,480
cannabinoids um each year I'm doing

209
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:59,000
something like three for

210
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:00,839
reviews for them on paper for public

211
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,639

editorial board member which is

219
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,360
affiliate to the industry and not from

220
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,278
the

221
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:34,440
Academia together with me there are all

222
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:37,600
the including was Professor mulam which

223

is not with us anymore

224
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:45,879
but Professor El suil from Mississippi

225

prominent

227
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:53,279
researcher in the field and it's an

228
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:55,838
honor big honor to

229
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,439
contribute yeah another uh uh

230
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,560
publication everybody should be checking

231
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,480
out and going to Arch you guys have a

232
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:04,799
partnership with the German Institute of

233
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,240
AI and Robotics can you maybe elaborate

234
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:08,599
a little bit on what that partnership

235
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:12,480
outlines and the benefits for both

236
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:15,120
parties yeah sure thank you um as I

237
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,399
mentioned hka is first controlled

238
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,360
environment agriculture technological

239
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,720
company with

240
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:25,560
the German Institute of artificial

241
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:30,480
intelligence and Robotics the

242
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:34,518
dfki it is a a The Institute is part of

243
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:37,600
Breman University sits under Breman

244
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:41,519
University ER the head of the

245
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:44,600
Institute Professor Frank kishner also

246
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:47,120
sit on our Advisory Board of the company

247
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:51,240
The Institute is actually focusing

248
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:54,360
mainly on extreme environment space and

249
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:59,360
deep water this is their

250
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:03,278
core and with them we are looking on H a

251
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:06,919
we took an IP for an a robot H for an

252
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:10,120
Imaging robot that we are now working on

253
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:12,679
introducing to the H system to replace

254
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:15,078
the robots that we are currently using

255
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:17,958
and the second is with them they

256
00:13:15,078 --> 00:13:20,719
actually just order system for their

257
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:23,239
multifunctional Hall it should be a

258
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,480
platform for developing

259
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:30,759
Technologies and when we look for the

260
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:30,759
future at space agriculture

261
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,000
the technology you guys have really is

262
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,600
very impressive the more you research

263
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,799
I've talked to over 250 people on this

264
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,560
podcast and this is one of the most

265
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:43,679
exciting bits of tech that I've come

266
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:45,958
across so I've have no doubt that

267
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,679
the the hortica name is going to be

268
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:49,638
around for a long time to come anybody

269
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:51,078
who doesn't know more or wants to know

270
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:53,480
more about hortica you can visit the

271
00:13:51,078 --> 00:13:55,758
website the link is below it'll be

272
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:59,320
wherever you view or listen to this

273
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:01,399
podcast what is the uh is the German

274
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,759
Market the the B exciting thing for you

275
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:07,320
guys this year to see what the rules

276
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:10,320
look like in April so most definitely uh

277
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,519
the the new development in the German

278
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,040
recreational market and more

279
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,919
specifically the model that is going to

280
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,838
be

281
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:21,879
implied are of great interest and

282
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:26,160
potential for our

283
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:29,519
Technology based on the club model ER

284
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:33,799
that is going to be adapted

285
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:36,879
ER it mean that a most of all

286
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:39,639
cultivation should be done in Germany in

287
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:41,838
contrast to medical cannabis program

288
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:46,320
which can be imported

289
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:51,199
also second each Club in a club we talk

290
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:56,600
about five up to 500 member each

291
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:59,559
can purchase up to 50 grams per month so

292
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:03,480
it puts the consumption of a Club at

293
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:05,879
maximal 25 kg and they need to each Club

294
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:08,959
needs to grow for

295
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:12,480
himself and this is with our system

296
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:15,319
those modular system takes the burden of

297
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:20,759
them and enable also

298
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:22,959
Brands ER although a different location

299
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:25,039
but the system enabled to have the same

300
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:29,000
quality the same

301
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:32,519
results and with very low risk and our

302
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,799
ability also to offer in a very confined

303
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:39,600
space and this is a small go facility

304
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:43,639
that suppli 25 kg per month to be able

305
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:46,759
to supply more than 10 strains

306
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:51,440
simultaneously working in these small

307
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:55,959
batches and still H being constant and

308
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:57,720
safe and above organic most importantly

309
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:59,599
not most importantly but it's important

310
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,879
to say

311
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,680
Yeah well yeah it's been fantastic

312
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:06,039
talking to you youron I'll be definitely

313
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:07,679
keeping my eye on your technology over

314
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:08,639
the coming months and I wish he nothing

315
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:11,278
but

316
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,440
success it is most appreciative it was a

317
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:15,720
real

318
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:18,720
pleasure you mentioned it was actually

319
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:21,560
for me the most pleasure interview I I
