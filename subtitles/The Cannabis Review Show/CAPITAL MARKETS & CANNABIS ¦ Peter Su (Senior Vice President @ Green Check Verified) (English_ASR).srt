00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:35,920
uh banking solutions and expected

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,440
advisory services to financial

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,800
institutions established in 2017

17
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:43,519
you guys have brought a couple of

18
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:45,439
leaders in technology and banking and uh

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,039
to enable financial institutions to kind

20
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:49,039
of bring themselves to market in this

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,359
industry am i correct with that

22
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,399
that's exactly right yeah uh so so where

23
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:55,519
software and um you know in the cannabis

24
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,759
space

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,840
for the us anyway the the regulatory

26
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:02,238
burden for a financial institution

27
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,640
getting into this space can be very high

28
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:06,319
um perhaps prohibitively so

29
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,239
um and so in the early days that that's

30
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:10,319
kind of what lets a lot of banks jumping

31
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:11,839
in and jumping back out

32
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:14,079
and so like any good software we're a

33
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,159
force multiplier um

34
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:17,920
and you know the the the effects are

35
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,118
staggering like if you have a manual

36
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,879
program

37
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:22,400
you have to dedicate for every five to

38
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:24,719
eight cannabis businesses you would have

39
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,680
to dedicate another body to your to your

40
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:27,519
program

41
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,118
versus using software we have clients

42
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:33,039
with 50 60 80 accounts per fte per

43
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:34,959
full-time employee

44
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,400
okay amazing and i'm just going to jump

45
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:37,679
straight into the first topic here and

46
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,040
it's kind of capital markets and

47
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,880
cannabis it's something i wanted to be

48
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,640
talking about because it kind of brings

49
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:44,798
together a couple of different topics in

50
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,200
my opinion it's the capital raises that

51
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,000
are happening the m a activity and then

52
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,240
the cannabis banking sector so in terms

53
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,239
of the capital raises have you seen a

54
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:56,319
dramatic increase in new york in the

55
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,959
past 12 to 18 months since they

56
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:00,398
announced legalization last march or was

57
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:01,919
there already a lot of activity

58
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,920
happening for the last three to four

59
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,759
years with the lieu of this known people

60
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,920
this is gonna happen

61
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,919
uh yes to both uh you know the first

62
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,080
thing to consider is that the capital

63
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,439
market or just capital in general in

64
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,319
cannabis is probably the number one

65
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,239
thing

66
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:18,799
um but largely because the public

67
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,400
markets are not still not available yet

68
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,200
we have certain companies that are

69
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,719
actually canadian listed so canadian lps

70
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:26,719
um i mean if you look at some of the

71
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:28,878
msos that we have here that they're

72
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:30,959
essentially rollups right so they're in

73
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:33,039
their entire business is based on uh

74
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,120
continual m a activity

75
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,039
um and so in new york yeah we've seen a

76
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,120
lot of people for years now that have

77
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:41,439
kind of laid the groundworks of what

78
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,920
they knew was coming which is now a

79
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:47,359
legal you know adult use market

80
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:49,119
um that said yes uh recently of course

81
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,120
that that activity has significantly

82
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,519
ticked up

83
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,759
and have you guys seen is the m a

84
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,200
activity pretty heavy in new york at the

85
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:59,598
moment or are the investors kind of

86
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:01,439
waiting to see let's see the gate opens

87
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:02,878
up let's see who kind of gets the market

88
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,800
share and then

89
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,959
we'll make our purchases then or is

90
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,080
there somebody in the background as it

91
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,759
is kind of

92
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,239
combining brands that are already

93
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:14,719
established for the past few years

94
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,120
um definitely in the background um keep

95
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:19,199
in mind we don't have actual regs out as

96
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,599
yet um so technically no one can be

97
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,759
doing any activities um as yet

98
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,199
except for the original 10 ro's the

99
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:27,359
registered organization so the original

100
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,119
10 license holders yes

101
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,640
those guys have significantly ticked up

102
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,360
their uh

103
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:36,158
you know columbiacare just just bought a

104
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,640
huge property out in the hamptons

105
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:41,039
um it's it's but by square footage it's

106
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,878
the largest cultivation site in america

107
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:45,199
um so they're clearly you know setting

108
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:47,759
the grounds for what's coming next but

109
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:49,280
as far as actual you know capital kind

110
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,199
of flooding into space that's not really

111
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,120
happening as yet i think in the

112
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:55,359
background a lot of that a lot of the

113
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,200
groundwork is being laid right now um

114
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,120
and frankly if you hadn't if you hadn't

115
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:01,199
started if you didn't start a year ago

116
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,959
you're late to the game

117
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,119
yeah i think it's it's definitely an

118
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,199
industry that you want to have your uh

119
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,719
your feet already already in the water

120
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:10,958
for the past year or two because i think

121
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:13,199
the amount of information and the the

122
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,640
legal nuances and the financial nuances

123
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:16,399
to get up to speed where people are

124
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:17,918
already here hurry is going to be swift

125
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,758
do you see colombia care having a

126
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,439
dominance uh

127
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,960
in new york or do you see other players

128
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:25,120
that have the equivalent size and

129
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:26,079
capital to go after them

130
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,160
yes

131
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:30,319
again the original 10 rows have had such

132
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,360
a huge leg up you know they already have

133
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:35,040
operations already have the contacts um

134
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,800
obviously you know employment already in

135
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,120
place uh uh

136
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,600
and plus they get to keep their vertical

137
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,040
status uh versus everyone else that has

138
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,479
to kind of pick a lane

139
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,840
um

140
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:48,560
sorry to interrupt you there can you

141
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:51,198
explain to everybody what the 100s are

142
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,879
oh i apologize yeah so we uh new york

143
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:57,040
state was a medical only uh states um

144
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:59,439
and there were five and then they they

145
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,520
quickly added another five so so they're

146
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:03,360
collectively referred to as the ros the

147
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:06,560
register organizations

148
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,080
um so the original 10 from i guess 2018

149
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,720
roughly

150
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:12,879
those 10 organizations

151
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,440
which were medical only were given the

152
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:18,159
opportunity to simply you know

153
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:20,160
convert over into the new adult

154
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,880
market so they're guaranteed essentially

155
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,960
a license they just have to apply for it

156
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:26,639
so of course why wouldn't they right

157
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:29,038
um but not only that but they have a

158
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,478
very distinct advantage uh whereas

159
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:32,478
everyone else that's applying for a

160
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,319
license now needs to pick a lane you

161
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:36,959
could be a cultivator you could be a

162
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,399
grower you could be you know retail it

163
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:40,000
could be distribution

164
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:42,959
consumption lounges but you can only

165
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,560
have one you need a license whereas the

166
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:45,839
original ros the original 10

167
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,759
organizations

168
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,918
they got to keep their vertical status

169
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:54,240
so they are their own supply chain their

170
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:56,719
their own distribution and outlets

171
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,120
okay very interesting do you see them

172
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,479
being able to grow a quality

173
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,840
of flower that's going to be able to

174
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:03,199
take it down within the market or do you

175
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:05,279
see something happen like in canada

176
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,160
where the craft growers are in essence

177
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:09,758
after reading away the tilray aurora and

178
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,720
the kind of big companies shares up

179
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,800
there

180
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,000
that's a great question i um i'm not

181
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,520
sure i mean i i assume that they have

182
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,680
they're confident obviously they know

183
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,680
how to grow marijuana

184
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,680
the question is is it good is it quality

185
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,720
well is it is it craft

186
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,000
um

187
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,240
now the other question would be do the

188
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,120
consumers care um because you know let's

189
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,280
be honest for for decades despite the

190
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,120
fact it was illegal people have had no

191
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:36,079
problem buying you know cannabis

192
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,639
anywhere

193
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:39,839
uh but by and large at least in new york

194
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,199
um

195
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:43,198
we don't really have the connoisseurs

196
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,160
you know the the way the market you know

197
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,160
you get what you get

198
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,039
and so is is there a sector of the

199
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:52,399
market that will also simply carry over

200
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:55,759
like i don't care i'm just walking into

201
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:57,918
store and picking up you know a bag um i

202
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,840
i imagine there is that demographic and

203
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:02,478
then yes i do think there is that

204
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,959
demographic that has a very specific

205
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:06,959
taste of what they want and don't want

206
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,399
and that's probably not the mso

207
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,159
demographic

208
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:11,519
yeah i think what might happen in new

209
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,840
york is you've got such a tourist

210
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:15,519
consumer base there that it'll be that

211
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:16,560
anything goes mcdonald's type of stuff

212
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:19,038
but i think the hippies out in

213
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,560
williamsburg now aren't going to be

214
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:23,038
dealing with anything that hasn't been

215
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,639
perfectly organically grown and fed in a

216
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:27,199
specific way so i think there's a huge

217
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,879
opportunity there for the kind of small

218
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,720
cultivars themselves to come to the

219
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:34,800
market yeah yeah you know again uh um i

220
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,120
i think that for decades that the the

221
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,280
consumers that are in let's say new york

222
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,199
right versus like a california where

223
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:42,879
where where craft strains have has

224
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,560
always been a thing it's much more

225
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:47,000
ingrained into the culture

226
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,918
uh my belief is that uh uh the

227
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,120
northeastern consumers are are more like

228
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:53,038
you know you get what you get and you

229
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,038
don't get upset kind of people

230
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:56,959
yeah i'm gonna move on to the next topic

231
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:58,639
and it's kind of as banking so again

232
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:00,478
specifically did you guys read you guys

233
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,319
have created software the partnership

234
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:04,079
that you guys had with abrego there in

235
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,759
last september was a massive thing for

236
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:07,519
you guys can you ever give everybody an

237
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,960
overview of the strategic importance of

238
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:11,198
that deal

239
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,799
oh i think that's huge you know i i well

240
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,759
first of all in any situation where you

241
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,759
can leverage a good name alongside your

242
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,759
good name um you know that's certainly

243
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,919
symbiotic right we i think we help them

244
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,080
as much as they help us but to the

245
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:26,240
extent that they are in x number of

246
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:28,079
financial institutions and we're trying

247
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,960
to offer a solution that can run

248
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:32,718
parallel to theirs um yeah it was

249
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:35,278
definitely a good get and from a pr

250
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,240
perspective of course was was huge

251
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:38,958
um

252
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,360
that said i mean i i think uh we we have

253
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:43,679
uh arguably the largest presence in the

254
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,240
financial institutions um you know as is

255
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,958
today in america uh we have just under a

256
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,399
hundred that use our software um so i'd

257
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:52,159
like to think we brought as much to the

258
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,440
table as they did

259
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:55,519
yeah now i think it seems to be a

260
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,600
mutually beneficial partnership to great

261
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,839
countries with their complementing

262
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,600
technologies and talent is that is

263
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,160
always a win-win for everybody

264
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,600
absolutely yeah yeah yeah so

265
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:07,439
i just want to basically give everybody

266
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,278
an overview your guys software works

267
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,120
with what's called community banks now

268
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:12,320
over in america so they wouldn't really

269
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,919
exist to an

270
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,680
extent over here so i just want to give

271
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:17,759
everybody the demo definition between a

272
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:20,079
community bank and a commercial bank so

273
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:21,679
community bank is basically a localized

274
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,278
bank that's locally owned and the money

275
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:24,559
is kept locally

276
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:26,320
am i right and saying that versus

277
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:27,518
commercial bank which has a nationwide

278
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,000
presence

279
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:32,399
um so yes uh i wouldn't say it's a true

280
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,080
distinction uh uh so it's not as if you

281
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,159
have a license that's that that makes

282
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,839
you only a community bank or you have a

283
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:40,000
license you know that's only a

284
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:43,200
commercial bank the difference really is

285
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,039
is how you envision your bank doing

286
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,720
business the mandate that you have from

287
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:47,759
your investors from your board of

288
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,800
directors

289
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:52,958
but yes as a community bank you your

290
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,399
specific mandate is hey we want to bank

291
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:56,958
locally we want to take the local

292
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:59,440
businesses that exist here whether i'm

293
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:00,559
in new york long island um

294
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,720
and

295
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:04,319
you know if if you're mandated say we

296
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,560
want we're going to bank locally invest

297
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,800
locally be owned locally yeah like that

298
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:10,000
that is what you will look for in your

299
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:11,278
clientele

300
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,320
versus a commercial bank which might

301
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:16,078
have a very broad mandate hey we do uh

302
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,240
residential loans it really doesn't

303
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:20,159
matter you know whether that's that's

304
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,680
here locally or

305
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:24,958
in washington state across the country

306
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:26,639
okay

307
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,479
it's it's a nice industry to learn about

308
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:30,319
because it's the one thing we hear about

309
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,399
the most i think over here is the safe

310
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,399
biking acting

311
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,639
seems to be the biggest thing that you

312
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,440
guys seem to be the perfect solution to

313
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:40,879
uh to this problem

314
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,200
yeah you know for all the belly who

315
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:46,559
about the safe banking act um you know

316
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,839
the truth is i think today um

317
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:49,679
and look it's a quickly dynamic

318
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,440
situation right

319
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:53,278
versus even a year ago two years ago

320
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,640
things have changed very quickly and a

321
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:57,120
lot

322
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:59,759
but i think today where we sit

323
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,919
uh the barrier of entry into cannabis

324
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,919
banking is a decision

325
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:06,000
that's it you know granted there's work

326
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:07,278
to be done you need to do build a policy

327
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,720
you need to understand the market you

328
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:11,200
need to show the regulators you've done

329
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,040
the work but these are works that any

330
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,278
you know whether it be a community bank

331
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:16,879
commercial bank credit union they know

332
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:18,320
how to do the work they just have to

333
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:20,159
make the decision that they're willing

334
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,240
to do it um

335
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:25,039
hiring a vendor like like green check

336
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,600
verified is very beneficial to a program

337
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:29,759
obviously i'm bias in saying that but uh

338
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,200
um but that you know but again that's

339
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:32,559
something that banks financial

340
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,959
institutions know how to do they know

341
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:36,639
how to find a vendor that are experts in

342
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:38,559
a certain area and they can carry that

343
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,078
forward at the end of the day they just

344
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:40,958
have to make that decision to to get

345
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:43,439
into

346
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:45,039
you know a very lucrative space

347
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,560
yeah well i think if we were setting up

348
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:48,078
an industry over here in ireland now in

349
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,799
a week or two one of the things i'd be

350
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:52,319
pretty adamant about is that each

351
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:54,159
person applying for a license would have

352
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,920
to have banking solutions already in

353
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:58,240
place and i think you guys offer a

354
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:00,559
solution where it makes the politicians

355
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,240
decision a lot easier because you're

356
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:04,638
kind of offering their look we can get

357
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,959
rid of crime or we can manage crime and

358
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,480
and fraud to a degree and all of the

359
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,838
other aspects that kind of seem to be

360
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,879
the puzzle for people to give at the

361
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,360
okay

362
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:15,838
no absolutely and i i do think that the

363
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,600
the regulators examiners will look at a

364
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,000
situation and say look you you need to

365
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,440
put some experience on your bench i get

366
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,440
it you've done the homework you've done

367
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,200
your research but don't think you can

368
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,200
just get out there and bank this

369
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,200
high-risk vertical without some sort of

370
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,278
help um and hey you know when you guys

371
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,440
are ready we'd love to help our founder

372
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:35,278
kevin hart uh his family's from ireland

373
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,880
so he has roots there i hope we could be

374
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:38,720
a resource for you guys

375
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:40,559
yeah for sure and with the movement of

376
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,560
uh goods over in europe it's access to

377
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:43,838
the whole of europe when uh when we're

378
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:46,638
talking about this which i think the

379
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,720
industry over here will need a unified

380
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,919
answer to this because you have so many

381
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,680
different markets over here between

382
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:53,679
spain italy france and germany and what

383
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:56,319
not last topic i kind of wanted to jump

384
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:58,239
onto is the race for new york i we were

385
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,160
reading there the other day that so the

386
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,079
first hundred licenses is going to

387
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:04,240
people who had passed criminal

388
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:06,559
convictions so those hundred licenses

389
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,079
are they basically they get to choose

390
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:12,078
what section they want to be in as i

391
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:13,838
said cultivation retail consumption lens

392
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:15,838
first hundred people just get to choose

393
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,880
randomly from those different sectors is

394
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,880
it

395
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:20,639
no no uh so that first hundred license

396
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:23,200
uh you know first of all my hat's off to

397
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,759
the regulators here in new york i mean

398
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:28,000
um they they've seen that the social

399
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:31,838
equity movement in other states have had

400
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,440
largely underwhelmed um and you know i

401
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,519
it's funny i was talking to ruben

402
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,639
mcdaniel who's one of our regulators on

403
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,159
the ocm

404
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,440
and he said look you know we're not

405
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:42,159
going to make the same mistakes that

406
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,000
other states made we might make new ones

407
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:45,679
but we're not going to make the old ones

408
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,600
um and so

409
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:50,159
these first hundred licenses for the

410
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,079
justice involved applicants that is to

411
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:53,600
say you you've had a you know marijuana

412
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:54,958
conviction on your record in the state

413
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,639
of new york

414
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:59,198
the first hundred licenses will go

415
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,879
towards that pool of applicants

416
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:02,879
it is retail only it is meant to be

417
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:04,320
dispensaries only uh that doesn't mean

418
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:06,399
there won't be other programs other

419
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,440
licenses but that what you're referring

420
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,799
to there is specific to retail

421
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,040
it's great to see how debate it's

422
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:14,479
commendable to the guys in charge the

423
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:16,639
next thing for the race new york that

424
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,320
i'm looking about how serious is the

425
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,000
money that's already in the industry we

426
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,000
talked just off our camera that somebody

427
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
like ray galio is already present in

428
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,759
this century are the hedge funds really

429
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,958
starting to get into this space now or

430
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:32,720
is it still just angel investors and vcs

431
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:34,719
um so it is starting to tick up for from

432
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,800
an institutional perspective but no it

433
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,959
is largely smaller that the biggest

434
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:41,039
players the biggest funds are are not in

435
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:44,239
the space as yet um

436
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:45,679
uh so i i would say you know the the

437
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,039
bigger fun the biggest funds that we

438
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:49,919
have right now would probably be like

439
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:52,078
the the afc gammas uh the the chicago

440
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:54,399
atlantic's of the world um those are

441
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:56,239
mostly debt funds though so so they are

442
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:59,839
kind of lending to

443
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:02,079
you know existing performing players um

444
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,880
for pure play equity

445
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:06,479
it is still hard to find

446
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:09,120
yeah no i think that seems to be the

447
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,680
holy grail for the cannabis entrepreneur

448
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,440
at the moment is access to true capital

449
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:15,278
and i think it's only a matter of time

450
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,120
now somebody like new york i think is

451
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:19,039
just going to change the game completely

452
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,198
when we see the industry hopefully come

453
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,879
to fruition at the end of this year

454
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:24,319
yeah yeah no i mean it's exciting if you

455
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:26,799
think about new york new jersey

456
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,040
connecticut um you know the inside that

457
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:31,120
from a population perspective that is a

458
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:33,679
huge dynamic shift i mean

459
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,759
right after these three states more than

460
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:37,278
half of the u.s population will now live

461
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,039
in a legal state

462
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:41,519
yeah and i think new york did the

463
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:43,759
significance for europe how new york on

464
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,078
legalization can't be underestimated

465
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,680
it's it's such as much of not too far

466
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:49,679
it's as close to the end of america as

467
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:51,198
europe gets so generally what happens in

468
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:52,479
new york travels to europe a hell of a

469
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:56,159
lot when it happened in california in

470
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,759
colorado it's not that big of a deal but

471
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,278
new york now the amount of people that

472
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,919
travel there i think it's only a matter

473
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:03,679
of time before that uh infectious this

474
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,599
starts to spread over this side of the

475
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:06,879
pond

476
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,800
well maybe we will have to phrase it

477
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:10,480
that way but yeah well you know i it's

478
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:13,599
an exciting it's an exciting time to be

479
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,839
at the forefront of a growing industry

480
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,079
um honestly in my lifetime i can't think

481
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,079
of a scenario where

482
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:21,519
you had this type of opportunity some

483
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:23,278
people like to compare it to like the

484
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,399
internet for example

485
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:26,000
but to me it was a little different

486
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,278
because when the internet came out let's

487
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,320
be honest some of us didn't know what it

488
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:32,399
was it was a brand new concept whereas

489
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,879
here you know there's a built-in

490
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,639
audience built into man

491
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:38,399
and it's just a matter of capturing it

492
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,480
and making it legal

493
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,000
yeah best brands and the best products

494
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,959
are going to win the race at the end of

495
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,639
the day

496
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:46,000
yeah absolutely

497
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,919
it's been amazing time to be the right

498
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,600
to actually go on all day we've got over
