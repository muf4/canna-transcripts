14
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:38,839
really built to be a global cannabis

15
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:41,840
media

16
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:44,399
platform um you know been in the

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,280
business most of my life or you know the

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,399
plant has been a part of my life um

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,359
since my teens um but formally and

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,920
professionally started in the recck

21
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:58,559
market in about 2015 in Washington state

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,719
launched one of the Premier CBD brands

23
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,558
that got into Dillards and selfridges as

24
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,519
you would know in the UK and Lane

25
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:08,438
Crawford in Hong Kong that brand was

26
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:11,200
Wildflower Brands and that position

27
00:01:08,438 --> 00:01:13,118
promoted me and moved me to Los Angeles

28
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,478
where I ran a series of regulated

29
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:19,799
licenses there and really built I feel

30
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:21,840
like that was the um you know the

31
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,680
foundation of my career was that move to

32
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,000
Los Angeles there and my connections to

33
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,680
that Community where the major project

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,560
that I was leading was we were one of

35
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,079
the leading ease delivery Depot in Los

36
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,000
Angeles so that was an amazing

37
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:39,118
experience getting to work with you know

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,280
one of the Premier Tech plat Platforms

39
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:45,359
in cannabis at that time and uh that was

40
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,799
that was great and it was a colorful

41
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:52,159
experience and uh long story short um

42
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,880
the the Wildflower company purchased

43
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,880
those licenses um they were never signed

44
00:01:54,879 --> 00:02:01,078
over so um that kind of left myself in a

45
00:01:57,879 --> 00:02:03,959
strange position um in the the company

46
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:05,798
and um decided to move to Phoenix and

47
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:07,399
that's where I cut my teeth here in this

48
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:09,840
market where I'm currently at in Phoenix

49
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:11,680
Arizona getting to work um to help

50
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,519
launch some of the Premier Brands here

51
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:18,120
the top Vape brand in the state amused

52
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:20,560
and launching their CBD CBG Wellness

53
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,680
brand here and eventually working with

54
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:27,360
Shango as sales director which is a top

55
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:30,519
flower brand here and yeah so long story

56
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,959
long my journey was through more or less

57
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:36,879
you know touching and selling almost

58
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:40,360
every ancillary part of the business um

59
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:42,759
from finished goods to Hardware to Tech

60
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,519
and that's kind of what brought me here

61
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:48,878
um to the TV channel where I met Shane

62
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:51,920
um late last year and once I heard what

63
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:55,000
he had I was kind of like what how do I

64
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:57,280
join so that's what brings me here now

65
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,439
and thank you ow for having me my

66
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,199
pleasure um there seems to be a mass big

67
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:04,519
gap for a platform for cannabis media

68
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:06,919
and it seems to be a h that you guys

69
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:09,080
look Prime to be able to fill do you

70
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:11,280
want to maybe give me elaborate a little

71
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,080
bit on what do you think the platform

72
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,000
for cannabis media looks like and is it

73
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,519
going to involve a wave of m&amp;a activity

74
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,439
of the best offerings to the market and

75
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,039
bring them all under what umbrella like

76
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:24,400
current media would

77
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:27,199
do right so you know generally speaking

78
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,239
I think you know whether you're a brand

79
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:31,000
or a leading Creator or voice in the

80
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:33,920
industry

81
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,120
um we are at the will of the big pet

82
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:40,119
Giants the YouTubes particularly as the

83
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,959
host you know for you know storing that

84
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:46,480
content and distributing it mostly for

85
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,878
creators um from Instagram and Linkedin

86
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:50,679
particularly um you know my experience

87
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:53,078
in the wreck Market pretty jaded with

88
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,640
Instagram having you know dozens of

89
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:58,920
accounts shut down and banned and you

90
00:03:55,639 --> 00:04:00,559
know um some pettiness of uh reporting

91
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:03,318
each other and all of those things that

92
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,158
happen when you're at the will of one of

93
00:04:03,318 --> 00:04:09,158
these Tech Giants so again um a lot of

94
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:12,359
these creators are able to monetize the

95
00:04:09,158 --> 00:04:14,158
content that that they create and

96
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,519
companies whether you are a direct

97
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:19,238
cannabis brand or an ancillary product

98
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:22,079
you're not able to Market your product

99
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:23,519
to reach the end consumer um especially

100
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,240
through paid ads you have to be very

101
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:28,319
creative and it's a fine line of what

102
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,639
you post versus getting thrown in jail

103
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:33,240
and all of those things on social media

104
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,840
so that is kind of the basis of what we

105
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,519
want to build here we want to be a

106
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:41,560
platform for the voice of the global

107
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:43,879
cannabis Community whether that is a

108
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,918
consumer you know someone interested in

109
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:49,120
learning more on the educational side of

110
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:51,240
it or a company looking to reach the

111
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,360
global cannabis

112
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,280
audience it also seems to me that

113
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,520
there's a massive gap for the content

114
00:04:55,279 --> 00:05:00,478
creation side of this industry for such

115
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:02,959
there's so many potentials stories that

116
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:04,839
could be turned out of from this sector

117
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:07,000
like they've done with some of the we

118
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:11,279
work shows or kind of these kind of

119
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,160
elements there's tailes having a a a

120
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:16,399
publisher that's able to actually go out

121
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,639
and purchase these H shows or movies and

122
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,839
then sell them on to bigger

123
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:23,840
opportunities seems like a very good

124
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:26,198
advantage point absolutely so um you

125
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:29,758
know advertising partners that come to

126
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:31,319
join the channel um you know 100% of

127
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,400
that money stays within in the Canabis

128
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:37,000
Community one

129
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:39,120
because 70% or so of those funds will be

130
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,240
going towards the production of a new

131
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,560
show which is an asset that we will

132
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,759
share together as you know the ad brand

133
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:48,720
that helped produce it as now that show

134
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:51,720
is brought to you by that brand of

135
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,160
perpetuity and that is now again an

136
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,919
asset of ours so if that show blows up

137
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,680
we can put that on Amazon Prime

138
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:01,639
streaming or Hulu or Netflix and things

139
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:04,560
like that so so you know it's not

140
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:06,960
limited to our Network we're able to

141
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,439
take it to the masses we're also able to

142
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:12,239
lease content for major Production

143
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:14,879
Studios to play on our channel so um

144
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,519
Sony and Paramount in particular we can

145
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:19,399
pick from those rolodexes lease that

146
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,000
content and have it brought to you by

147
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:23,439
your favorite brand so think of your

148
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,279
favorite you know Cannabis movie I like

149
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:27,560
to use the example Harold and Kumar

150
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:29,918
brought or Harold and Kumar Go to White

151
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,918
Castle could be brought to you by White

152
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:35,120
Castle or brought to you by your

153
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:38,198
favorite brand so um the possibilities

154
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,519
really are endless and I think that's I

155
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:43,400
feel like part of the challenge um here

156
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:44,519
in the United States in particular is

157
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:47,758
you know I don't think people really

158
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:51,159
believe it that we're able

159
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,680
to yeah it as I said of all the sectors

160
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,599
if you analyze from the Cannabis

161
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,240
industry from biotechnology to

162
00:06:54,598 --> 00:06:59,079
cultivation retail the media side of it

163
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,478
seems to be one of the biggest markets

164
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:02,878
that you could potentially get into with

165
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:04,800
the fewest competitors in it but it

166
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,759
seems like whoever gets in and becomes

167
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,800
the dominant leader now has to build the

168
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:10,800
whole foundations and the building

169
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,280
itself whereas cultivation could take

170
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,639
expertise from another industry and

171
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:16,719
bring it in I think making cannabis

172
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:20,360
media would have to involve I would

173
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,759
imagine a blend of either consumers or

174
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:25,160
industry expertise to be able to ensure

175
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:27,598
that the the content is as factual and

176
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:30,720
and correct as possible correct and you

177
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:32,680
nailed it because I I often get asked a

178
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,800
question to the effect of well who are

179
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,038
you trying to reach are you trying to

180
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,478
reach companies or are you trying to

181
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:43,318
reach consumers um you say you're a

182
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:45,560
global Channel but you're us um but the

183
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:48,240
fact is we are all that we have to reach

184
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:51,120
the consumers consumers want to know

185
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,240
about the brands and companies and how

186
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,639
it's cultivated How It's Made maybe do a

187
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,680
tour of the manufacturing facility or

188
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:00,240
lab I think that's important for

189
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,959
consumers to see from their top Brands

190
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,918
and plus partnering with us we want to

191
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:10,000
you know give as much Roi and roas back

192
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:13,120
to you as possible which automatically

193
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
brings the CEO onto a talk show that we

194
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,319
have kind of a satire comedy talk show

195
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,598
and you know really just crank up that

196
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:23,039
partnership as you know make it mutually

197
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:25,639
beneficial which I think is another

198
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:29,399
thing that um you know companies here in

199
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:31,158
the US are apprehensive about um and you

200
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:34,038
I will say part of what connected you

201
00:08:31,158 --> 00:08:36,000
and I here Owen was my Outreach this

202
00:08:34,038 --> 00:08:38,718
year to particularly the European

203
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,719
markets and they excitement actually in

204
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,760
it so on the US side you know I hear

205
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:44,920
it's like oh yeah that's amazing you

206
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:47,958
know we'll

207
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:50,120
see um sort of thing where the European

208
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:52,559
side is more like wow you built

209
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:57,039
something amazing and let's

210
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:59,199
go it seems to the move when we have a

211
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:01,039
lot of m&amp;a activity across the industry

212
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,399
let's say schedule three allows that to

213
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:05,879
happen the big brands that end up coming

214
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:08,278
out on top that control massive partions

215
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:11,320
of the industry it would be the most

216
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:14,278
prudent thing for them to have a large

217
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,879
cap capex budget for Content creation

218
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:18,320
all the Red Bull model where it's more

219
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:20,559
sense to be able to create our own

220
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,600
content and generate consumers as

221
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:26,559
opposed to targeted ad Billboards and

222
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,200
ads on TV which might necessarily be

223
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:32,039
preferential for the non-cannabis

224
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:35,160
consuming or the non-cannabis favorable

225
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:36,599
side of the the population so is that

226
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:38,360
one of the medium to long-term

227
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,639
strategies that you guys are saying that

228
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,919
okay when this does happen these budgets

229
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:43,759
for these billion dollar companies are

230
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:45,879
going to be available to actually said

231
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:48,078
write some serious checks to create some

232
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:49,799
real content because as we all know

233
00:09:48,078 --> 00:09:52,919
everybody at this moment there kind of

234
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:54,559
is self-made content and the budget

235
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:56,240
behind a lot of stuff could be a hell of

236
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:59,439
a lot better once they had access to

237
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,240
that Capital absolutely so you you know

238
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:05,959
the long story short the answer is yes

239
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:09,600
you know the strategy is um to increase

240
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:12,479
the production value and to you

241
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,879
know not just the production value of

242
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,360
podcasts and you know news shows um you

243
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:20,159
know stock trading shows and you know

244
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,200
other educational and cooking shows that

245
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:26,360
we will be producing um but just

246
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:29,879
leveling it up each quarter um and you

247
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:32,440
know to your point as things go schedule

248
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:35,480
three if they do I'm not confident in

249
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:38,160
that personally but we'll see

250
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,200
um things will change in that regard you

251
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:42,439
already see the paps blue ribbons and

252
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,639
some of the big dogs entering the space

253
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,040
well that's when you'll continue to see

254
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,799
that happen and those Brands the brands

255
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:52,519
that we know that are imprinted in our

256
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:55,000
brains well they know how to Market and

257
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:57,159
they spend money on media and those

258
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,600
Productions and getting their voice out

259
00:10:57,159 --> 00:11:02,958
there so you made a great example when

260
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,159
you mentioned Red Bull so I think you

261
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:07,479
know there's a lot of parallels to what

262
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:11,120
we can do with Red Bull I think you know

263
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:13,159
X Games and um you know the yacht races

264
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,240
and the plane races and all the cool

265
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:18,639
stuff actually that unique stuff that

266
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,039
Red Bull produces well that's generally

267
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:23,480
a lot of what we will be doing over here

268
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:25,599
at the channel you know um we will be

269
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,639
having our own sports leagues and

270
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,839
Esports um and things like that so you

271
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:33,079
can expect that from us but obviously

272
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:35,240
with our you know cannabis Community

273
00:11:33,078 --> 00:11:38,039
Twist on it and think of it I guess

274
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:40,120
we're kind of like the the new MTV in a

275
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:43,838
way almost is a bit of our

276
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:46,039
model yeah well comedy music Sports I

277
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,800
think the V diagram of those three

278
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:50,120
things kind of it sits perfectly in the

279
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:52,838
middle so if you can get a global

280
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,720
audience viewing those three different

281
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:57,360
uh genres then I think as I said you've

282
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,079
got a recipe success on your hands

283
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,879
absolutely and yeah thank you and it's

284
00:11:59,078 --> 00:12:06,439
you know um the sky is really the limit

285
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:09,320
um for what we can do and generally

286
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,800
speaking the vision of the companies

287
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,040
that choose to enter IM mediate

288
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:15,838
partnership with us is you know those

289
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:19,519
first Partners going to have a large

290
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:22,240
part in you know forming the direction

291
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,799
of the channel into the future and

292
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,879
that's why it's interesting starting

293
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:27,879
this year really again the enthusiasm

294
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:31,600
from

295
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:36,600
Europe has got me going um absolutely

296
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:40,079
because I think that um I think a lot of

297
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:42,680
companies that are eyeing that market um

298
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:46,638
you know they see huge potential right

299
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:48,838
and they see um opportunity Beyond

300
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,879
what's here in the United States it's

301
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:53,720
incredibly difficult again here to

302
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:55,559
Market and operate and you know I think

303
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,600
it's kind of the New Horizon that's

304
00:12:55,559 --> 00:13:00,599
exciting and for those that are already

305
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,920
there you know they see advertising on a

306
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:06,079
US Channel as that bridge you know to

307
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:07,759
gain more brand awareness from you know

308
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:12,198
probably the largest legal cannabis

309
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:15,000
Market in the world so or country right

310
00:13:12,198 --> 00:13:16,599
yeah no very much so um it's been

311
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,519
incredible talking to you and going
