the show now covering that

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,679
a topic that i'm sure most people talk

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,000
about but very few people have an inside

13
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:32,000
knowledge like you'll have on this so

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,200
first and foremost i just want to let

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,238
everybody if you want to inform

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,079
everybody how you're in

17
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:37,679
the cannabis industry in europe and how

18
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,799
you got to this stage now in a quick

19
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:41,119
brief

20
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:43,359
yeah sure on yeah thanks uh yeah well

21
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:45,038
medicinal cannabis europe was started up

22
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:47,679
about three years ago

23
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,840
as a pro bono project and just over a

24
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:51,280
year ago we established the association

25
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,440
as a non-profit

26
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,198
association in belgium under belgian law

27
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,759
i think unlike a lot of associations

28
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:00,558
we're a multi-stakeholder association so

29
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,198
we

30
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:05,518
welcome members from the patient and

31
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:08,719
medical community right through to the

32
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,840
the industry um and basically our

33
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:13,599
our objectives are to

34
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,320
advocate for harmonize european

35
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:18,079
regulation on medicinal cannabis

36
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:20,158
create a level playing field for the

37
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:22,158
industry to operate across all european

38
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,479
countries

39
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,439
push for funding for research and

40
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:29,920
development funding from european funds

41
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:30,959
for investigation into medicinal

42
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,759
cannabis

43
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,798
and last but not least try to educate

44
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,599
the public

45
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,600
stakeholders the medical community about

46
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:41,759
the benefits of medicinal cannabis and

47
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:44,158
try and get rid of the stigma

48
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,079
which is in some places still attached

49
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,920
to it

50
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:49,759
yeah brilliant thanks very much for that

51
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,519
can you give us any fresh news that's

52
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,519
that you've heard coming out of europe

53
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:54,719
in terms of uh council's been formed or

54
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:55,599
something you can inform the audience

55
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:57,039
about

56
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:58,959
yeah i think there's a couple of things

57
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,840
to pick up on uh very recent

58
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:02,158
developments

59
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,640
um we've been working for quite some

60
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,240
time now about six months together with

61
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,000
various members of the european

62
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:11,598
parliament um

63
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,680
and trying to be part of the process

64
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,759
of bringing together an interest group

65
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,959
in the medicinal cannabis

66
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:22,079
issue so the good news on that front is

67
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,840
that there is now an interest group

68
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,800
being formed within the european

69
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,120
parliament

70
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,719
um of several members of the parliament

71
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,039
from different political

72
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,318
directions different geographies around

73
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,318
europe

74
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,598
and an interest group in the european

75
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:36,560
parliament for those of your audience

76
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:38,479
who maybe

77
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,719
are not that familiar with the european

78
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:41,598
institutions it's a mechanism whereby

79
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:43,120
these

80
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:45,518
members of the parliament can come

81
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,560
together around a common issue

82
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,519
they can pull in input from external

83
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,640
stakeholders

84
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:55,120
so via associations like ourselves

85
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,318
industry can have access into that

86
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,360
process

87
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:02,839
um they can collect knowledge

88
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,080
information hear about people's

89
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,598
challenges uh

90
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,400
the barriers preventing trade or or the

91
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:11,359
use of

92
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,680
medicines and they can digest all of

93
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,840
that

94
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,080
as a as a group of members of parliament

95
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,878
and then they can take those issues

96
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,239
forward to the european commission who

97
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:23,039
are the regulators

98
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,959
who will be the ones uh creating any

99
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,759
draft regulations in the future

100
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,598
on this issue and they can say hey guys

101
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:31,840
you know these are the problems which

102
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:33,839
the industry which patients which the

103
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,360
medical community are facing

104
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,280
and how are you going to fix this how

105
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,560
are you going to start harmonizing

106
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,598
regulation

107
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:45,199
to make these medicines available

108
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:47,199
to european patients equally across all

109
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:49,280
european countries so i think the

110
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:52,318
formation of that interest group is a

111
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,360
huge step forward um and it really

112
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:55,839
indicates that

113
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,519
the parliamentarians are starting to

114
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,080
understand the need for regulation

115
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,000
around this

116
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,120
issue and that's where the process has

117
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,759
to begin

118
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,959
um it will not be a quick process it

119
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,959
will take time but

120
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,120
you know we need to start sometime so

121
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,920
now is as good as any

122
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,878
so i think that's the first fairly

123
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:16,000
significant

124
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:19,439
recent development um some

125
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,199
sorry no work awake um

126
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:23,120
yeah one other thing which i think is

127
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,120
worth mentioning is um

128
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,360
the well medicinal cannabis europe held

129
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,399
a another conference back in october

130
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,720
last year

131
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:32,159
and we had a member of the european

132
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,360
commission there from

133
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,840
directorate general sante that's the

134
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,040
directorate general which is responsible

135
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:42,560
for

136
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,720
public health issues and

137
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,879
they made it uh clear then that they

138
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,240
were going to start a process of

139
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:51,439
creating

140
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,040
a glossary of definitions which could be

141
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:55,120
used to describe

142
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,199
medicinal cannabis and that was in

143
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,720
relation to the herbal medicines

144
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,720
directive

145
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,880
and now the herbal medicines directed

146
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,240
might be a way

147
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:09,360
in for the medicinal cannabis

148
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,199
products into european regulation and

149
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,960
they have recently just announced that

150
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,560
their now their committee and the

151
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:17,680
committee looking at this will

152
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,800
will start work in 2021

153
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,280
and collecting views and information

154
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,879
around definitions how to define

155
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:26,959
medicinal cannabis

156
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:29,038
because that's that's an absolute

157
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:31,680
essential starting point for any

158
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:34,319
european regulation is we need a clear

159
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,560
definition of what is medicinal cannabis

160
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,000
right now there is no legal clear

161
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,800
definition under european

162
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,478
law um and without the definition you

163
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,360
can never start to regulate

164
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:46,159
so so that process at least is beginning

165
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,479
um

166
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,919
so those two things i think are are

167
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:52,159
quite significant

168
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:54,079
as i say quite recent developments in

169
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,439
brussels

170
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:57,599
yeah well i think we both agree the

171
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:59,439
rules in the framework of any industry

172
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,960
are paramount and ensuring that it has

173
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:05,120
longevity and there's no corruption and

174
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:07,038
a gray market as opposed to defining the

175
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,560
two markets individually

176
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:09,759
and one of the things that i'd like to

177
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,000
kind of talk to you about in this

178
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,280
episode is harmonizing the eu

179
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,439
regulations

180
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:17,119
also over in ireland at the moment it's

181
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,639
kind of comical the situation that's

182
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,160
been at the moment you've got

183
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,280
the enactment of the law that happened

184
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,919
with the european council back in

185
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:23,679
december

186
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:25,359
that hasn't been fully enacted over here

187
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,720
and i can understand the police point of

188
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,400
view when they see

189
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,520
a big field full of cannabis or the big

190
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:30,719
plan for the cannabis they're not to

191
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:32,560
understand which is the difference

192
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,360
between cbd and thc

193
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,120
so are you seeing a mishmash of

194
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,000
implementations of these regulations

195
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,600
across the eu

196
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,600
like what's happening in ireland or has

197
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,479
there been a cohesive action

198
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:49,280
and we're kind of the the odd one out as

199
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:51,279
per usual

200
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:53,439
well yeah i don't know if you're the odd

201
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:54,478
one i don't think so i think on this

202
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,240
particular issue

203
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:58,478
maybe you're the odd one out but i think

204
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,759
in terms of harmonized

205
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:03,758
uh view or regulation on all kinds of

206
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,960
aspects of medicinal cannabis

207
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,800
it's absolutely not harmonized across

208
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,000
europe and and that really is the

209
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,520
problem um

210
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,639
you know you have well nowadays we have

211
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:16,318
27 eu member states and and in each of

212
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,680
those member states there's a there's a

213
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,960
different implementation

214
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,840
of all kinds of aspects of the

215
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:25,279
regulation

216
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:28,799
and i mean our particular focuses are

217
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:29,758
on um the regulation allowing an

218
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,478
industry to

219
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,319
to operate so again that's very

220
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:35,680
different from one country to another at

221
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,280
the moment you know you have the german

222
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,598
model where it's

223
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:42,159
there's a relatively clear model there

224
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:43,199
and relatively clear regulation on how

225
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,199
to do this

226
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,199
and there are other member states where

227
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,439
it's absolutely prohibited to

228
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,639
have an industry operating in the middle

229
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:54,000
medicinal cannabis

230
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,720
sector equally for patients patient

231
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,478
access

232
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,560
to existing cannabis medicines

233
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,318
is radically different from one member

234
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,959
state to the other reimbursement

235
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,560
on those medicines costs is radically

236
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:07,439
different from one member state to the

237
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,478
other

238
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:13,680
so it's all of those aspects

239
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:14,478
and the irish cbd issue is is one of

240
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,360
those

241
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:19,439
although it's uh it's a cbd issue not uh

242
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,639
let's say not a regulated medicine

243
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:26,000
issue as such um

244
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:29,199
but yeah all of those things are in

245
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,199
dire need of harmonization so that

246
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,320
you know at least there should be a

247
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,320
minimum level

248
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,640
of harmonized regulation of how these

249
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,800
things are handled in all 27 member

250
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:42,240
states so a patient in

251
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:45,359
italy needing access to a drug

252
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,919
um for let's say epilepsy

253
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,080
has the same ability to access that

254
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:51,759
medicine as a patient in spain or a

255
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,120
patient in ireland

256
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:58,720
equally those drugs should be able to

257
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,720
move cross-border with the patient

258
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,720
in their hand baggage just like any

259
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,920
other medicine would move across a

260
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,639
border

261
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:06,958
so all those things need to be sorted

262
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:09,838
out

263
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:10,559
so that we have equal treatment for

264
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,360
patients

265
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:14,399
in in all countries and an industry

266
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,800
which

267
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,559
can operate on a level playing field

268
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,319
across all those countries and today

269
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:24,319
that just simply doesn't exist

270
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:27,440
and your irish cbd art issue is is one

271
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,200
example of that yeah well

272
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,800
hopefully the people in paris central

273
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,720
can form these rules and these

274
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:34,399
regulations that can the other countries

275
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,278
could just take it this is how it's done

276
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,440
as opposed to

277
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:39,120
i can understand a lot of politicians

278
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,600
trying to learn this as a new industry

279
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,879
must be a lot overwhelming for them to

280
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,800
the myriad of things they'd have to

281
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:45,519
learn and how fast some things are

282
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:46,879
moving

283
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,159
it's difficult enough when you're

284
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:49,600
already at the tip of the spirit this

285
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:51,199
industry never mind

286
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,200
trying to catch up on 15 years of

287
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,080
learning yeah no that's right and i

288
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,320
think that's where

289
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,399
um to go back to my first point about

290
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,920
the the interest group of members of

291
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,440
parliament forming an interest group you

292
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:05,278
know that interest group can

293
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:07,360
can then listen to existing experiences

294
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:09,039
on regulation in different places what

295
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,039
works what doesn't work

296
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:13,199
and and then hopefully channel that

297
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:15,199
through and eventually be reflected in

298
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,600
european uh regulation

299
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,040
yeah tell me this and tell me no more i

300
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,079
have yet to come across

301
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:23,360
a proper economist's predictions of a

302
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:25,759
european

303
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,440
medical cannabis i've seen this is what

304
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:29,039
the industry looks like in three years

305
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,320
time with a rough figure thrown out

306
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,240
there but there's the likes of you

307
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,839
whitney over in the us who's the head of

308
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,879
whitney economics he does them for the

309
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,360
hemp industry

310
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,958
and there is detailed a financial report

311
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,240
as you should be getting for an industry

312
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:42,958
have you come across

313
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,560
a proper financial report yet or is this

314
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,559
something that still is yet to be done

315
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:49,278
by an economist

316
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:50,479
yeah i mean i i think that's a little

317
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:53,360
bit outside of our

318
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,120
our kind of field we're more looking at

319
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,000
policy and regulation rather than the

320
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,720
economics

321
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,600
i mean i think would you not think that

322
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,839
the economics goes hand in hand with the

323
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,120
convincing the politicians because a lot

324
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,760
of them are going to see a number and

325
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,440
say well

326
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:08,480
we could create x amount of jobs because

327
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,760
all you're hearing coming out of new

328
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,600
york at the moment is

329
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:13,278
it's worth x amount of billion they're

330
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,079
doing x amount of projects to create x

331
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:16,078
amount of jobs

332
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:17,838
nobody really cares about anything else

333
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:19,599
after that and i think that should be

334
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,360
one of the doors for

335
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,120
the politicians it's it's easy it's

336
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,800
digestible it's something that they'd

337
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,200
understand as opposed to hitting them

338
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,879
with

339
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,800
all the different myriads of medical and

340
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:29,838
recreational kind of do you get to get

341
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:31,759
your best

342
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,680
yeah i know i think i've you know like

343
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:35,519
you i've seen the same

344
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:37,519
the same predictions of you know x

345
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,679
billion this this market will be worth x

346
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,399
billion by 2030

347
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:43,599
so those are the kind of analyses i've

348
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,679
picked up on

349
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,278
um i think what you're talking about is

350
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:48,078
something much more detailed so you

351
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:50,720
would say

352
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:52,239
you know what what jobs would how many

353
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,680
thousands of jobs would be created

354
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,919
around europe etc

355
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:57,519
and yeah you're right i think that kind

356
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:00,078
of detail

357
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,200
at the moment is is lacking at least i

358
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:03,838
haven't seen it

359
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,278
and even to put to put a figure on the

360
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,200
like industry at the moment like how

361
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:09,838
many jobs are currently in cbd

362
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,879
in each country what's the total revenue

363
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,360
gdp

364
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,639
taxation for the country so it's again i

365
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,000
think it's something that

366
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,600
when the funding and the research

367
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,720
development has been done i think this

368
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,200
is one of the things that needs to be

369
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,959
looked at

370
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,800
as carefully as this is the benefits

371
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:24,958
that the plant has for everybody

372
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:27,039
yeah no i would agree i think you know

373
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,799
that's that was certainly the case in

374
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:31,679
the united states i think that's what

375
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,679
convinced a lot of

376
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,959
dates in the um because of the the

377
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:40,240
potential tax revenues

378
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:41,518
which would come from it yeah now

379
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,600
hopefully now that's something that we

380
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,679
can maybe press on i would say over the

381
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,480
next 12 months of comprehensive

382
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:49,919
financial and economy report done for

383
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,440
about the hemp industry

384
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:53,919
and then subset for the cbd industry

385
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,920
because

386
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:57,519
i think this uh information is going to

387
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:00,879
be the key to us getting

388
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:03,278
a fully regulated eu industry yeah

389
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:06,320
sure i i think i mean just to pick up on

390
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:07,919
your cbe point again if i can um

391
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,519
you know i think from a medicinal point

392
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:12,559
of view um

393
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:16,000
we are we are talking much wider than

394
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:18,559
cbd obviously yeah i think cbd

395
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,440
you know the recent ruling on cbd is is

396
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:21,838
a kind of

397
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,600
it's an easy one if you like uh although

398
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,920
it's cause problems in ireland it's a

399
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,600
relatively easy one for regulators to

400
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:30,159
cope with and to

401
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,480
um to take on board because it has the

402
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:36,319
connection with the wellness

403
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:38,399
issues and you know it's it's relatively

404
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,199
soft and comfortable to deal with people

405
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:44,480
know that cbd in general is not harmful

406
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:47,198
um but when you talk about medicinal

407
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,079
products then you're talking about cbd

408
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:50,958
thc

409
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:52,879
and many other compounds which are found

410
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:54,799
in the cannabis plant

411
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:56,480
and that's where that's where the issue

412
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:58,879
of definitions becomes

413
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,278
much more important you know what do we

414
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:04,240
mean when we talk about

415
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:06,559
medicinal cannabis most likely it's a

416
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,600
combination of all those compounds

417
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:12,078
um maybe in terms of definitions we need

418
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,399
to talk about specific compounds

419
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:16,000
when we come to regulate rather than

420
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,198
just medicinal cannabis

421
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,958
as a blanket term yeah well i i think

422
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:22,399
i i think i couldn't agree with you more

423
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:24,638
i think medical cannabis is the

424
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,039
equivalent of saying it's jazz

425
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,399
genetics is it bebop isn't modern is it

426
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:30,480
slow there's maybe

427
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,679
a hundred different subsets of jazz and

428
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,278
i think meta

429
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,799
cannabis needs to be treated the exact

430
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:36,639
same as you said cbd is just one of

431
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:38,479
those little myriad of topics it's just

432
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,198
a hot topic at the moment but

433
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,959
yeah hopefully it's a something we get

434
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:44,879
to see more detail in each individual

435
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,399
component of the industry and more

436
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:47,838
financial reporting

437
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,278
