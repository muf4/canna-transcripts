00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,879
first topic where the can sativa story

19
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:42,878
how you guys set up and how long you

20
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:45,759
guys have been in the industry

21
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:49,119
yes so the canzativa story is uh first

22
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:51,280
of all a story about two brothers so

23
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:54,558
my brother benedict and me we founded

24
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,079
the company in 2017

25
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:58,238
right before

26
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,480
there was a significant change in law

27
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:01,839
liberalizing the cannabis market for

28
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:03,679
medical use

29
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,719
so this was one of the main turning

30
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:07,760
points

31
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:09,599
in the the german legal ecosystem and

32
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,200
this was right the beginning when

33
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:12,719
benedict and me

34
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,359
decided at a

35
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:19,039
family reunion at a party that we want

36
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:21,759
to engage in this market and yeah the

37
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,000
the company was set up uh quite quickly

38
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,719
um like overnight

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,400
and together with our father who's a

40
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,560
co-founder not an active member of the

41
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,000
management but still a co-founder

42
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,159
we elaborated

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,799
quite intense on what is the business

44
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,118
case this was mainly a part of

45
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,720
my brother who's a

46
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:42,959
business engineer

47
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:44,959
and i worked on the regulatory framework

48
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:47,118
so i have a background in law

49
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:49,519
and uh since then uh now since four

50
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:51,280
years i'm only focusing on the overall

51
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:52,399
regulation of cannabis as a controlled

52
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,439
substance

53
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:58,799
but both uh in the pharmaceutical and um

54
00:01:55,438 --> 00:02:00,319
the um emerging recreational or to be

55
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,280
recreational market in germany and

56
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,839
europe

57
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,680
and uh over the the the first few months

58
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,520
and the first year uh 2017 and early

59
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,439
2018

60
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,439
we built up the business rented our

61
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:16,560
first offices we did everything on our

62
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:18,479
own from cleaning the restrooms to doing

63
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,959
all the packaging stuff

64
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:24,639
this was like a two-man show at this

65
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:26,878
time and in early 2018 still one of the

66
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:30,238
early movers we started our distribution

67
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:32,560
in may um 2018 the first additional

68
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,840
cannabis products that we imported from

69
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,239
the netherlands

70
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,239
yeah were shipped to two pharmacies and

71
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,840
this was the point in time

72
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:45,759
in the beginning of 2018 that we decided

73
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,439
uh to start a fundraise um and yeah have

74
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:50,639
the the first few people join the

75
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:54,000
company and this is clearly the story of

76
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:56,639
uh 2017 and 2018 um and the end of 2018

77
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,598
we had our seed financing round uh which

78
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:04,000
yeah somehow uh brought the business uh

79
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:06,959
into yeah a very fast-growing um vc

80
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,959
funded startup company and i mean this

81
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,719
is like the the first uh one and a half

82
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,719
years of cansativa

83
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:14,400
okay yeah so like when everybody when

84
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:15,919
you set up a company you get their your

85
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,200
roll up your sleeves for the first

86
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:18,639
couple of years and if everything goes

87
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,639
according to plan then you can start

88
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:23,679
utilizing investors money one thing i'm

89
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:25,119
curious about how did you guys uh go

90
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,319
about getting your products in

91
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,840
pharmacies did you bring on

92
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:31,679
pharmaceutical sales staff or is there a

93
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,360
main

94
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,959
let's say holding company for a number

95
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,040
of pharmacies around germany where it

96
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,319
goes directly to that company and

97
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:40,318
acquire let's say 100 different

98
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:42,079
pharmacies with your products

99
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,798
so first of all it's important to

100
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,879
understand how the pharmacy ecosystem in

101
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,040
germany works so

102
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:50,959
pharmacies are operated by individual

103
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:53,840
pharmacists so it is only allowed to

104
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,799
operate up to four pharmacies um that's

105
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,640
why

106
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:00,000
there is no

107
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:03,199
huge pharmacy network or some kind of a

108
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
corporate uh entity that that you could

109
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:09,438
um yeah like like lobby to source

110
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,759
products from you so it is a individual

111
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:13,840
business that is quite intense in terms

112
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:14,959
of building relationships and building

113
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,478
trust

114
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,959
but at this time

115
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,798
cannabis was a very young and new market

116
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,040
so we could

117
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:25,359
be or we challenged the market being

118
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,840
best in service best in

119
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,479
delivery times we were not that much

120
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:32,399
into best price at this time

121
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:35,599
because we decided to build our

122
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:37,519
relationship by by customer service and

123
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,520
getting into a real relationship with

124
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:40,959
the individual pharmacists and what is

125
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:43,758
important is that

126
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:44,959
there are some very big full-line

127
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,160
wholesalers

128
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:49,439
that serve pharmacies up to three or

129
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,360
four times a day

130
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,040
so this is the route of

131
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,479
general pharmaceuticals towards

132
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,280
pharmacies

133
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:59,120
this is a kind of a close shop um you

134
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:01,839
don't really manage to get into this

135
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:05,120
niche uh just being a pharmaceutical uh

136
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:07,758
yeah wholesaler so we decided um to um

137
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,800
focus uh only on direct sales to

138
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,720
pharmacies in this special portfolio of

139
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,319
medicinal cannabis flowers

140
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,479
and if you

141
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:19,839
manage to to meet the expectations in

142
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:21,918
terms of delivery time communications

143
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:23,519
sales channels and so on at this time it

144
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:24,879
was quite easy to get into touch with

145
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:27,038
the pharmacies because they were

146
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:28,639
desperately looking for cannabis

147
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:29,839
suppliers

148
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,918
we see

149
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,038
like in the last few years a significant

150
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:35,279
change so

151
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:37,599
today it is very hard to get into touch

152
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:40,719
with the pharmacies because there are

153
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,280
i think 80 importers that always want to

154
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,800
sell just for example one product source

155
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:46,478
from the netherlands

156
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,879
but the pharmacies today are quite

157
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:53,439
annoyed uh they don't want to get

158
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:54,639
addressed by the 1880s or 19

159
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:56,959
importer that only wants to sell

160
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,680
bettercom but they want to have a single

161
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:02,239
point of contact and we developed

162
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,160
over time from someone who had a product

163
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,280
they were desperately looking for in the

164
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,439
beginning

165
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:09,198
towards a one-stop shop that now is

166
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:10,319
offering everything that the pharmacy

167
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,319
needs

168
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:15,199
and this is a transition phase where we

169
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,360
profited a lot from being an early mover

170
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,280
at this time

171
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,800
okay amazing that kind of leads me on to

172
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:23,599
the next topic i want to talk about and

173
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,199
it's the european opportunity we can

174
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,639
obviously anybody would have been a

175
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,240
sense who knows the industry it's got to

176
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,240
be medical for the first couple of years

177
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,918
but we see the the rumorings of a

178
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,478
recreational market happen in germany

179
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:36,079
with the recent elections there how do

180
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,599
you see the european uh european

181
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:39,599
opportunity do you think recreational is

182
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,120
going to be here within five years and

183
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,000
if it does happen in germany do you

184
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,319
think that's going to open the

185
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,680
floodgates for the rest of europe

186
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:49,520
uh yes so first of all i see um as he

187
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,680
outlined a european opportunity so we

188
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:54,240
have a harmonized european

189
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,800
economic zone or economic market

190
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,879
and that's why we see more or less in

191
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,160
whole europe those two dimensions the

192
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,000
first dimension is medical or

193
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,039
pharmaceutical use the other dimension

194
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,478
is

195
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:09,199
in the broader sense recreational use

196
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:10,719
what do we differentiate in those

197
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,038
segments first medical and

198
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,880
pharmaceutical is what we see

199
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:17,519
in germany especially as one of the

200
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:19,759
leading roles especially because we have

201
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:21,519
a cost reimbursement system

202
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,759
this always is a driver for for

203
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:25,120
innovation in in those

204
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,439
sectors or those

205
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,680
yeah pharmaceuticals if there's no cost

206
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:31,519
reimbursement it is always hard to bring

207
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,759
products in so this is why germany is

208
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:34,879
most important in the medical sphere

209
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,919
right now

210
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:38,159
but we

211
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:39,839
see that other jurisdictions are

212
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,560
important as well so especially if you

213
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:45,439
look at the production

214
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,759
it might be portugal or spain or

215
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:49,839
denmark which is the place to go to have

216
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,919
your products of pharmaceuticals grown

217
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:55,279
in a high quality

218
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:57,839
um this uh i think is in the medical

219
00:07:55,279 --> 00:08:00,000
ecosystem something that is currently

220
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:02,239
developing over um different countries

221
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,560
in europe there is the the

222
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,439
the first trials in france um there are

223
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,000
experiments uh in other jurisdictions as

224
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:13,038
well um so in the first dimension

225
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,759
medical i think there is a ongoing and

226
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:18,240
and continuing development towards a

227
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,800
more liberalized approach over europe

228
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,759
towards cannabis as a pharmaceutical

229
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,360
substance as a medicinal product what we

230
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,199
see in the second dimension is clearly

231
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,400
recreational in the broader sense as i

232
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,240
said because

233
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:32,718
we observed that in whole germany we

234
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,440
have in three different segments the

235
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,560
development first is hemp especially

236
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,959
fiber

237
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:41,838
clothing foodstuff

238
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:44,559
we see uh the development of novel food

239
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:47,440
so there will be a decision on the novel

240
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:50,079
food status of cbd and this will be only

241
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,839
the beginning of a roaring and bursting

242
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,680
market because there is a significant

243
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,360
demand for cbd products even though they

244
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:57,439
are now still in the gray or black

245
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,680
market um so this will be the second

246
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,839
part this will be a holistic development

247
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:03,599
in europe that we observe and the second

248
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,920
or the the third

249
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,519
is anything relating to

250
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:09,759
thc containing products and i think

251
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,799
there will germany definitely be again a

252
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:13,360
leader

253
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:15,599
i would assume that if our so-called

254
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,560
traffic light coalition

255
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,800
will get

256
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:20,879
to operations and if they constitute the

257
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:22,639
government over the next few weeks

258
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:24,879
it will be quite obvious that over the

259
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:26,879
next two or three years we have

260
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:28,480
legal thc

261
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:31,519
containing cannabis in germany and this

262
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,680
will again be a leading role model for

263
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,799
europe because it will show proof that

264
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:39,120
this system works with view to uh drug

265
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:40,240
addiction policy with view to uh

266
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,959
protection

267
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,639
of miners and so on

268
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,919
okay kind of leads me into it the next

269
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:47,360
topic that i want to talk about is

270
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,439
european imports versus european

271
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,519
homegrown you mentioned that the place

272
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,120
to kind of grow with your uh your

273
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,639
product at the moment will be portugal

274
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,799
denmark denmark have the ornamental

275
00:09:54,639 --> 00:10:00,319
flower industry portugal has a great

276
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:01,679
climate do you see there being a nuanced

277
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,600
difference between

278
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:05,519
the the warmer climates in europe grown

279
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,278
it and then the specialized farming

280
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,959
countries growing it because let's say

281
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:10,480
somebody like ireland where where i'm

282
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,399
from we have one of the best some of the

283
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,360
best farming community in the world

284
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,958
never mind just from europe and

285
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,959
the way i see it happen when the when

286
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:20,559
the regulations fall down you're going

287
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:22,159
to have the ability for each nuanced

288
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:23,599
country to have their own individual

289
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:24,639
strain with their own individual

290
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,639
benefits

291
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:28,879
do you see that happening or do you see

292
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:31,039
the imports from low-cost territories

293
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:33,039
like south america and africa imported

294
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,679
into malta place like that crate turned

295
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:38,240
into products which do you see being the

296
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:41,838
future for the european industry

297
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:44,959
um i think it always uh depends uh so as

298
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:47,040
the the whole industry is getting a bit

299
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:48,799
more liberal first in the medical

300
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:50,958
ecosystem than in the recreational

301
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:53,039
ecosystem it's uh we will see that there

302
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:55,679
is a product differentiation so it will

303
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:57,679
begin that pricing is something which is

304
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:59,759
very important to get access for the

305
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:01,519
mass market so i think for the the

306
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:05,039
low-cost products there will be a

307
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:07,600
significant need um for yeah competitive

308
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:10,639
cultivation in latin america for example

309
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,759
in southern africa because um you cannot

310
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:15,600
really compete with the labor cost

311
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:16,799
applied to those products there but on

312
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,879
the other hand especially in the

313
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:20,559
recreational ecosystem

314
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:23,200
it is more about the right brand the

315
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:25,759
right strain right product claim and

316
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,320
product quality and still today in the

317
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:30,559
medical ecosystem patients are very

318
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,440
aware of where is the product coming

319
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:33,599
from

320
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,600
they are very aware of is the product

321
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,680
for example treated with irradiation or

322
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,360
not so those are always topics that are

323
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:41,759
important and

324
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,879
the the difference between

325
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:47,519
non-eu cultivation and eo cultivation

326
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:50,799
might always be a difference between is

327
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:53,278
it indoor or auto so

328
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:55,838
producing a low-cost product is

329
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:58,879
then a huge advantage

330
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,720
if you are not only cultivating in an uh

331
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:03,278
climate that is that that is good for

332
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,800
the product not only cultivating in a

333
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:08,320
area where labor cost is is is low but

334
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:09,679
it's always about

335
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,639
do you need

336
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:14,078
all those extensive investments in

337
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,720
the greenhouses

338
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:18,958
that are closed and so on so we we see a

339
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,639
competitive advantage here for those

340
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,958
that cultivate

341
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,639
in in areas that have a better climate

342
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:26,799
than for example germany

343
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:29,919
if you take germany as the domestic

344
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:31,519
grown cannabis um it is still ridiculous

345
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:34,559
that that cannabis plants have to be

346
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,360
grown um not only uh without sunlight

347
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:38,078
but

348
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,639
in a safe room and this this this can't

349
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:44,000
be uh something that is here uh a

350
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:46,480
benefit uh for for the um yeah for

351
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,440
domestically grown cannabis um so i

352
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,920
would uh consider that um especially in

353
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,160
the recreational industry there will be

354
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:55,919
a product

355
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:57,439
need or there will be a demand for

356
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:58,479
product that that have a specific

357
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,240
terroir

358
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,240
that is more important about where is it

359
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,240
coming from how is the product be

360
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,800
made um because it is more about uh

361
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:14,720
having a product that that that is like

362
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:16,799
in the wine industry um has a a a origin

363
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,560
a signature uh which is not only

364
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:21,359
pertaining to a strain or genetic but

365
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:23,759
always to the origin in terms of what is

366
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,519
the the to

367
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:26,958
what is the the climate zone it has been

368
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,440
grown in and i think this will be a

369
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:31,838
story that is that is working uh when

370
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,360
building brands better than uh when

371
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,880
building a pharmaceutical product

372
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,480
because their product quality

373
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:39,120
standardization is more important and

374
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:42,159
this is always easier in a controlled

375
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,639
ecosystem controlled greenhouses where

376
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:45,519
you can control all those parameters

377
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,320
from

378
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,078
light

379
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,760
to water to nutrition and so on

380
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:53,039
yeah i think the medical industry are

381
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:54,958
going to be able to get that product

382
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:56,480
perfect with the amount of capital and

383
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,919
investment in research and development

384
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,839
whereas the recreational brands are

385
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:01,679
going to be the story as you said the

386
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,920
carbon footprint a number of different

387
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:05,278
variables that the consumer will go for

388
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:06,479
it's been an absolute pleasure talking

389
