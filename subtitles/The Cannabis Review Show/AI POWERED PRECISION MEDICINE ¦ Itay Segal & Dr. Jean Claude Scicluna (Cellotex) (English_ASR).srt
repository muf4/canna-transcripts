2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,359
welcome everybody to the next episode of

3
00:00:11,798 --> 00:00:16,399
the Cannabis review I'm delighted to be

4
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:19,640
on to this episode by it seal and

5
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:22,278
jeanclaude shakuna from cotex how are

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,278
you guys

7
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:25,879
keeping thank you all good and thanks

8
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,198
for having

9
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:30,118
us I'm delighted to have you both on

10
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:31,199
you're one of the the hot companies in

11
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:32,799
Europe at the moment so I thought

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,879
everybody would like to find out what it

13
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:37,119
is that you guys exactly are doing can

14
00:00:34,878 --> 00:00:38,799
we first and foremost start with a t and

15
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:40,320
go through what's your area of expertise

16
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:41,640
in this industry and how did you come to

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,719
set up celotex and then we'll do the

18
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,719
same with Sean Claud after

19
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:52,000
that perfect so I'm coming from

20
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:54,000
technology background product Ai and

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,159
actually following a personal story from

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,759
my father getting to understand bit more

23
00:00:57,159 --> 00:01:02,878
on on medical cannabis he actually got

24
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:05,840
me curious why why no one knows why

25
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:07,759
doctors refer to anour effect or it's

26
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,680
personalized no one actually knows the

27
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:12,759
dosage or what you should take or or

28
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,040
when it's all about the patient and

29
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:16,640
going through trial and error without a

30
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,920
real

31
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:24,040
compass this is where actually we have

32
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,920
thought on on celotex having more data

33
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,719
come into play understanding more on

34
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,799
what's going on with the patient what's

35
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:32,920
the actual intake

36
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,759
the goal is eventually to create a Clos

37
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,320
Loop medication by Clos Loop medication

38
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,920
you can actually have it much more

39
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:42,599
precise and optimized and customized

40
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,759
towards the patient symptoms not as a

41
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:47,319
generic one fitall as I would say

42
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,759
conventional medicine is doing but

43
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:52,718
something which is more personalized and

44
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,560
medical cannabis actually is the great

45
00:01:52,718 --> 00:01:57,399
treasure which is out there waiting to

46
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,478
be unlocked and this is what actually

47
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:00,280
what we have

48
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:03,200
started okay thank thank you very much

49
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,200
and Sean Claud to

50
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:10,520
you um really and truly it's it's

51
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,839
something which also changes the

52
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,599
experience um for patients and when we

53
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,920
we talk about the patient experience

54
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:21,839
often patients uh in traditional medical

55
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:25,039
settings have issues accessing their

56
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,400
data um have issues owning their data

57
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:28,878
and most importantly um have issues

58
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,080
sharing this data with with the

59
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:33,280
professionals they want to

60
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,840
um be a doctors and and with medical

61
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,239
data uh it's always hard to get the

62
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,959
balance just right to get the balance

63
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:44,719
between um What patients can interact

64
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,039
with and ultimately the data and

65
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:50,318
insights that doctors need in order to

66
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:51,799
make good diagnosis to reduce errors in

67
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:55,039
diagnosis and in

68
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:57,000
prescription um so really what we're

69
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:59,878
building here is is is a as a middle

70
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,199
ground a sweet Middle Ground where where

71
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:05,280
this this can be shared and where this

72
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:06,839
uh can lead to better insights better

73
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,680
data better diagnosis and ultimately

74
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,360
better

75
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,040
care okay incredible thank you very much

76
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,760
I'm going to move on to the first topic

77
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:18,039
now which is AI powered precision and it

78
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:20,079
t we'll start with you when it comes to

79
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:22,199
the technology behind the AI that you

80
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,799
guys are building is it large language

81
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:27,798
models is it computer science to drove

82
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,719
through large chunks of data what is the

83
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:31,519
exact technology but that that make

84
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:32,840
makes it special to be able to give this

85
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,360
Precision

86
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,680
medicine this is a perfect question the

87
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,920
short answer is a bit of all of the

88
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,799
above what we're starting off is

89
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:44,719
obviously assessing the patient symptoms

90
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,599
the assessment of the patient symptoms

91
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:50,639
is not always easy we are discussing

92
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:52,798
about pain anxiety so you need a lot of

93
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:56,399
biomarkers and this is where we collect

94
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:59,079
as much biomarkers as possible both

95
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,840
passively and actively from the patients

96
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:04,400
who are using yeah the best example for

97
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,479
that would be connecting to my weall and

98
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,799
my were ball actually knows how am I

99
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:11,438
sleeping he knows my hard variance

100
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:13,079
different bio feedbacks which are

101
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:16,918
relevant to understand what's actually

102
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:20,639
going on with with that person obviously

103
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:22,599
capturing the medicine intake alongside

104
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,199
with that you're able to understand what

105
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:29,000
actually happened to the symptoms during

106
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,919
the following hours that was the passive

107
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,038
assessment active assessment can be

108
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:37,000
visual or audio or anything that can be

109
00:04:34,038 --> 00:04:38,879
captured from that patient in order to

110
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,199
again assess the symptom and assess the

111
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:44,639
outcome so really put on the engineering

112
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,680
hat it's an input output problem and in

113
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,639
order to do that yes as you said you

114
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,918
need as much data as possible on that

115
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:53,600
specific patient in order to better

116
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:55,439
understand it symptoms potentially

117
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,759
forecast them and of course suggest to

118
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:00,319
the doctor what would be the right

119
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,160
course of treatment referring to the

120
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:05,038
language model which is an interesting

121
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,199
one what we're actually incorporating

122
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:09,038
these days on the next version of seatex

123
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,560
is a language model which is essentially

124
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:13,159
your digital caregiver what we have

125
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,519
understood from the first patients it

126
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,000
kind of be cumbersome because you always

127
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:19,839
need to collect also the patient

128
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,639
feedback how do you feel the way that

129
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:25,839
it's being done today is okay a scale 1

130
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,319
to 10 how is your pain where is that but

131
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,758
with language models you can actually

132
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:31,960
gain a lot more information from from

133
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,439
that patient him doing it in a much more

134
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:37,560
convenient manner which is natural to

135
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:38,959
him it can be by text or by Audio to

136
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,759
actually tell your doctor what's going

137
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:43,120
on instead of running through a

138
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:45,360
questionnaire so by the language model

139
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,199
Incorporated and empowered with the

140
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,360
symtoms and the medicines you actually

141
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:53,360
have almost full circle of of what you

142
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,479
can learn about that patient obviously

143
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,879
taking into account is ZR and background

144
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:01,478
information uh but bottom line here as

145
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:03,680
you have mentioned this is an AI model

146
00:06:01,478 --> 00:06:06,639
and what we're doing is actually

147
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,598
imparing that with as much data as

148
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,639
possible yeah it seems to be the

149
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:12,839
opportunity as you said that the current

150
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,519
standard is 1 to 10 on a scale how do

151
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:17,119
you feel how is your pain being given

152
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:19,038
patients the opportunity to be able to

153
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,959
talk directly to whether it's a a

154
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:23,959
custombuilt applications with a

155
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:25,120
smartphone or an at home device and be

156
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:27,359
able to actually have a full

157
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,560
conversation and get more nuanced

158
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,080
information per patient would be where

159
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,720
some of the Holy Grail to be able to

160
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:34,639
build these targeted medicines is going

161
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,800
to

162
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,680
be exactly that so just to refer to to

163
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,680
one of the points that you have

164
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:44,439
mentioned our solution is at the moment

165
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,519
Hardware less that means that we're

166
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:50,000
tapping into existing wearables exting

167
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:52,758
mobile devices our goal is for that to

168
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,439
be within reach of of any patient and

169
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:57,038
and the way to go about it is is on the

170
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:59,279
software

171
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:00,560
side what we're seeing is that a lot of

172
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:02,679
the research at the moment is very

173
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,680
limited in terms of the number of

174
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:10,038
participants and also very

175
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:13,038
geographically focused and what celotex

176
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:15,800
and part of our goal is actually for for

177
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:19,000
that data to serve Mankind and not

178
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:21,560
specific companies or or products this

179
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,319
is why we're agnostic to the products

180
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,439
what we're are here for is actually to

181
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:27,400
to set the compass for doctors and

182
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:30,879
patients to have their personalized

183
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:33,918
Compass instead of okay medical cannabis

184
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:36,840
go ahead and and

185
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:38,519
try Okay moving to yourself M Jean claw

186
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:40,719
the next topic I wanted to bring up was

187
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:42,560
data and insights for doctors one of the

188
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,440
big things we see across the industry is

189
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,918
the lack of data for doctors to be able

190
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:49,478
to a prescribe the medicine and be then

191
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:52,198
prescribed confidently based on the

192
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:53,598
nuanced uh metrics of each individual

193
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:55,280
patients that's going to walk through

194
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:58,959
whether it's high tolerance to

195
00:07:55,279 --> 00:08:01,519
cannaboids or whatever this variable may

196
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:03,239
be how important is gathering this data

197
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:04,560
and providing this insights for doctors

198
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,879
around the

199
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,000
world right well um starting off uh

200
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:11,439
medicine uh evidence-based medicine

201
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,279
which which we practice is increasingly

202
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:14,680
becoming data driven and this is not

203
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:17,279
simply in

204
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:19,000
cannabinoids simply looking at other

205
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:22,038
disciplines like radiology and oncology

206
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,759
we can appreciate that um as time goes

207
00:08:22,038 --> 00:08:26,598
by uh the doctor's tool of choice will

208
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:31,080
be looking at a computer screen rather

209
00:08:26,598 --> 00:08:33,918
than using a stethoscope for example um

210
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:36,559
and definitely um with with plant

211
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:39,199
medicine and cannabinoids having uh such

212
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:42,518
a complex way of of of interacting with

213
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,959
each other um the need for

214
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:46,879
evidence-based medicine and the need for

215
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:50,599
data driven insights is is bigger than

216
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:53,200
ever before so uh increasingly it's very

217
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:56,120
difficult for doctors to be able to

218
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,920
understand um what the medication is

219
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,078
doing in their patients bodies because

220
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:01,240
first and foremost they're not with

221
00:08:59,078 --> 00:09:03,519
their their patients once they go home

222
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,480
and your patient is medicating we have

223
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,000
the term uh we sometimes refer to as

224
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,480
self-medicating when someone medicates

225
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,679
without the supervision of a doctor but

226
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,680
truly even when you're you're being

227
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:17,359
supervised and coming from the point of

228
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:19,439
view of uh of of my experience in in

229
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,200
prescription uh sometimes patients come

230
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,920
back and you understand that there are

231
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,480
communication issues you understand

232
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:29,838
there are uh nuances of both taking the

233
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,759
cannaboid medication or um

234
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,640
the time taken or certain other

235
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:35,159
activities around that and you

236
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:37,559
understand that really cannaboid

237
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:40,240
medication is not a simple um

238
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:42,958
prescription Silver Bullet it it takes

239
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,320
care it takes a journey with the patient

240
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:47,518
you really need uh to have a degree of

241
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:51,879
of handholding and a lot of time with

242
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,799
the patient and um this creates in in in

243
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:55,720
modern clinics with with the under

244
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:58,679
Staffing even in medicine we've seen

245
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:02,680
since the co pandemic uh it has created

246
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:06,439
a really huge bottleneck so the need um

247
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:10,639
to be able to convert all that data all

248
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:12,800
these insights about not simply um THC

249
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:15,600
or CBD now we have more and more doctors

250
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:17,240
being uh sometimes specialized in minor

251
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,240
cannabinoids and a lot of work we're

252
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,560
seeing with minor cannaboids and

253
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:25,440
research data uh it's a lot to keep up

254
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:29,199
with so something um we we think will

255
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,959
will release that bottleneck will be um

256
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,879
the the ability of of a solution to

257
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:36,518
Crunch the numbers uh and give the

258
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:39,919
insights for the doctors and then from

259
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:43,360
the doctor's point of view um just like

260
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:45,759
we work with Radiology we we look at um

261
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,959
the data and then uh do actionable

262
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:51,240
decisions based on that data um this

263
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:53,719
will give not just cannabinoid medicine

264
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:57,159
but all plant medicine a significant

265
00:10:53,720 --> 00:11:00,000
boost uh a boost in The credibility

266
00:10:57,159 --> 00:11:02,399
because we know that canab medicine and

267
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
and The credibility and and uh the

268
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:08,679
stigma is definitely still present um

269
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:12,240
but also and most importantly really is

270
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:14,958
a boost in the accuracy um and and in

271
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,919
the in the patient

272
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:20,078
outcome okay very interesting a question

273
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:22,278
for your Bo now I'll let Sean Claud you

274
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:24,319
go first with this one it seems to be

275
00:11:22,278 --> 00:11:26,120
that the mass of opportunity coming in

276
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,399
the next let's say five to eight years

277
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,839
is going to be from the Blends and

278
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,519
formulation that are able to be created

279
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:34,240
whether it's be from fermentation

280
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:36,000
engineering or what it's extracted

281
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,639
individual cannaboids because the

282
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,720
delivery mechanism is similar across the

283
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:43,399
board it uses technology to be able to

284
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,440
consume H the the models that you're

285
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:45,958
going to be able to build are going to

286
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,600
be able to build up this patient data

287
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:51,439
but those unique formulations that

288
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,560
Target whether it's oncology as you said

289
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,440
or chronic pain or cardiovascular

290
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:58,479
inflammation or one of the things is

291
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,800
that the next big massive step that we

292
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,800
we're going to see when it comes to

293
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:03,919
medical cannabis is these unique

294
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:07,278
formulations that end up being delivered

295
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:10,240
for this exact Nuance disease mechanism

296
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:13,078
based on then body body weight

297
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,759
precise well I mean let's look at what

298
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:16,559
has kept this technology from being

299
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:19,198
present with us right now and and and

300
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:22,239
really it's the presence of of Big Data

301
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:23,120
Big Data pools uh which are precise

302
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,198
which are

303
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:30,198
accurate um and and which can be

304
00:12:27,198 --> 00:12:32,240
reliable um mark ERS for for such

305
00:12:30,198 --> 00:12:34,639
products to be made whether it is you

306
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,879
know with with um Precision growing

307
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,759
products or whether it is uh grown in a

308
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:42,720
lab or or or all the Technologies around

309
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:44,519
that um but but a reliable marker of how

310
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,480
humans interact these different strains

311
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:49,240
is is something that we have had not had

312
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:52,000
so far so um it's difficult to tell the

313
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:55,959
future but definitely

314
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:59,039
um datab backed Solutions um will be

315
00:12:55,958 --> 00:13:00,958
will be a treasure throw for um not just

316
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:02,799
patients and doctors but other areas of

317
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:07,319
the industry which can grow

318
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:10,599
exponentially thanks to uh the the data

319
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:13,920
acquired amazing and to aay do you see

320
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:16,278
the a use of AI to be able to run these

321
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:18,599
tests for these potential molecule

322
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:20,559
combinations being another landmark when

323
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,278
it comes to muring this these

324
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:25,000
formulations to a

325
00:13:22,278 --> 00:13:27,320
degree this is definitely a big hype at

326
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,839
the moment a lot of companies are are

327
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:32,160
going about that I would say the the

328
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:35,519
applicability of that because there is

329
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:37,639
no one formula which would fit everyone

330
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,198
I think conventional medicine that

331
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:42,039
thought us that looking at clinical

332
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:44,278
trials and obviously real world data the

333
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:46,919
efficacy is not always the same we are

334
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:48,759
different people different gender

335
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:50,958
different medical condition and even

336
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:53,159
different from one day to the other the

337
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:55,638
ability for those medicines to adapt to

338
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:57,838
the patient and not the patient adapted

339
00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:00,000
to the medicine I guess this would be

340
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:03,079
the the big change here this is what

341
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,839
Precision medicine actually brings in so

342
00:14:03,078 --> 00:14:07,879
a lot more molecules to work with and

343
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:11,240
the ability to understand what works for

344
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:14,559
whom when how much that would be the

345
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,560
next leap the way I see it in in

346
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:18,119
healthcare incredible it's been

347
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:19,559
fascinating chat to you guys what's the

348
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,759
thing you're looking forward to seeing

349
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:24,479
with celotex over the next 12 to 18

350
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:26,000
months are there any uh points on the

351
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,959
horizon that you'd like to let everybody

352
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,519
know but are these still uh company seek

353
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:32,958
for

354
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:35,278
now it's actually another secret we have

355
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:37,479
launched our activity in Germany already

356
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:39,159
working with compounding pharmacy we're

357
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,399
actually doing exactly as we have

358
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:43,838
mentioned the the compounding

359
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:46,159
specifically for those patients we're

360
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,079
going about observational studies

361
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:49,278
starting from Germany but will be

362
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:52,198
expanded

363
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:54,720
soon so it's definitely looking forward

364
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:56,879
to to see where in the year's time where

365
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,240
we will be where the industry will be

366
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:02,879
but the way I see it much more on on the

367
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,480
medical aspect of of cannabis not

368
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:07,919
necessarily adult use which again I can

369
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,199
fully appreciate but more patients

370
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:12,919
actively using it as as their medicine

371
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:14,278
to relieve the symptoms yeah it seems to

372
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:15,679
be Europe is definitely going to be

373
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:17,399
focused on the medical side of the

374
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:18,679
industry for the number of years to come

375
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:20,839
Sean Claude anything you're looking

376
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:22,439
forward to seeing in the the doctor side

377
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:24,800
of

378
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,440
things uh I think definitely having

379
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,958
having better data to treat patients

380
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:31,920
better is is something I look forward to

381
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:34,638
being able to give uh a boost in the

382
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:36,078
accuracy and credibility of the the

383
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,839
increasing number of doctors getting

384
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:41,278
into cannaboids uh facing stigma

385
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:44,680
sometimes from colleagues and and um

386
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:46,759
sort of being um pressured about about

387
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:49,679
data I think being able to to give that

388
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:51,519
to to a growing uh community of of

389
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:53,758
really great clinicians is is for me one

390
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,759

391
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,720
see um and we are working with with

392
