production in medicine at kansas state

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,679
university we're going to be talking

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,240
about a topic of industrial hemp as

9
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:29,118
cattle feed on today's topic like how

10
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:31,919
are you keeping thanks for joining us

delighted to have you on so during my

13
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,520
research i came up with a a lot of

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,759
different names that you see into the

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,160
country in the ticket the midst of this

16
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:44,320
exact topic and as ireland is such a

17
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:46,238
farming heavy nation it's a it's a topic

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,679
i wanted to cover for a number of people

19
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:49,679
can you maybe give everybody a quick

20
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:51,198
overview of how you got into the beef

21
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:54,399
production medicine side of things and

22
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:54,399
where you are at the moment

23
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:59,119
uh yeah so i am uh i'm at kansas state

24
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:01,439
university i'm on faculty and clinical

25
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,640
sciences here and beef production

26
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:03,519
veterinarian

27
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,719
um

28
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,240
i originally am a ohio native so i came

29
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:08,959
from midwest

30
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:10,640
and

31
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:13,039
was in private practice for a handful of

32
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,200
years and found my way back to do a phd

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,720
in clinical pharmacology

34
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,118
and i am

35
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:22,158
now on faculty here at kansas state

36
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:25,040
my research interests are pharmacology

37
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,560
pharmacologics and are that are involved

38
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,880
in pain mitigation

39
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:32,000
and looking for ways to measure pain and

40
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,000
food production animals

41
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,880
okay amazing so you guys uh on my

42
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,159
research i actually come across a lot of

43
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:40,560
stats that i didn't think i know

44
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,040
agriculture is the largest employer in

45
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,519
kansas and a large chunk of the state

46
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,399
has given up to the agricultural sector

47
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:50,319
i didn't think it was as big as it is so

48
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,079
there's no better taste

49
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:53,839
or case study than you guys to be able

50
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,000
to be researching this

51
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,880
first and foremost so from the research

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,040
i've had the biomass from hemp seems to

53
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:04,078
be a good source of protein and fats for

54
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,000
a cow to use biomass but the

55
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:07,519
the the transaction of the milk being

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,239
given from the

57
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:13,680
to the calf from the mother is the point

58
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:16,959
of consternation is this correct and

59
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,959
how far am i off on that

60
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:22,159
and so um here in the united states our

61
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,000
food and drug administration has

62
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:26,159
come straight out and said that feeding

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,400
cannabinoids to any food production

64
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:31,359
animal or any animal in fact

65
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,879
is considered an adulterant in the feed

66
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,840
and so it is not legal here in the

67
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:38,079
united states to feed any sort of

68
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,878
cannabinoid um you know plant matter uh

69
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,280
cbd oil um

70
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:45,439
meal things like that to any and any

71
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,120
animal even food um even your

72
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:48,639
companioning animals like your dogs and

73
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,519
cats

74
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,799
that's

75
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,280
they're they're trying to figure out the

76
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,360
safety profiles of those um which is

77
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,680
kind of odd because the fda considers

78
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,760
hemp seed here to be generally regarded

79
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,040
as safe and um but you know you can't

80
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:02,399
feed it to your dogs but you can give it

81
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:04,158
to yourself

82
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,920
um so it's there's kind of some

83
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:08,878
confusion as to what the laws are and

84
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:11,359
what's legal um and part of our big

85
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:13,840
research and part of our usda funding is

86
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,640
to kind of answer those questions of you

87
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,640
know if a cow is happens to be

88
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:21,119
fed industrial hemp

89
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:23,359
do those cannabinoids enter the system

90
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,920
uh and do where do they go into that

91
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,000
into that animal's body and if it does

92
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,839
enter the milk does it you know how long

93
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,080
is it in the milk and i'm at what

94
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:37,680
levels okay and do you guys have a set

95
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,879
time of uh execution for these studies

96
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,719
is there a point where you're going to

97
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:42,318
sign off and be able to give the fda or

98
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:44,719
something approval and say look we can

99
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:47,598
categorically prove that this does not

100
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:49,840
hinder the process or it does in x y and

101
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:49,840
z

102
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,000
yes so we've um we've completed two

103
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,080
studies um we have one

104
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,878
one single dose study out in publication

105
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,200
now we have a multi-dose uh study that

106
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:02,798
we have under a review right now and the

107
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,119
peer review literature

108
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,360
uh and we've also completed a tissue

109
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,158
residue study so we use the fda's

110
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,920
guidance for industry how they approve

111
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:14,798
drugs and food animals so if you give a

112
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,598
drug drug to a cow

113
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,358
the

114
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:19,199
way they measure how long that that

115
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:21,439
safety period from when that animal is

116
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,360
injected to when that animal can enter

117
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:25,120
the food chain uh we followed those

118
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,759
study guidelines and we're currently

119
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,680
analyzing that study for uh edible

120
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,000
tissues so muscle

121
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,120
kidney fat and liver

122
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,560
we plan to do a milk production um

123
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,720
a milk uh transference study uh the

124
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,759
first part of this summer so that's the

125
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,720
goal for that we should have that data

126
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:49,280
uh wrapped up by the end of the summer

127
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,400
and do you see are a lot of the cows fed

128
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:54,478
on soy feed over in the us as well is

129
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:56,879
that the kind of primary

130
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:59,519
source of feed for cows

131
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,759
or for cattle so um

132
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:04,000
for cattle here depends on the type of

133
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,919
beef cattle here in kansas or a lot of

134
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,879
them are grazed or fed hay over the

135
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:08,639
winter

136
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:10,879
some are given a what's called a total

137
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,478
mixed ration so basically everything

138
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:14,959
into a big pot

139
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:17,038
and fed out to them our dairies are fed

140
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:20,159
primarily on total mixed rations so

141
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:22,319
everything is provided um in a big you

142
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,520
know be like a salad bar all mixed up

143
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:25,680
and then put in front of you on your

144
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:27,918
plate um and so

145
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,400
but the main source of protein a lot of

146
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:32,240
those is alfalfa and soybean meal and

147
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:33,519
there's push especially in the poultry

148
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,918
industry

149
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:38,319
for hemp seed to work in there

150
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:40,319
and as a protein source because hemp

151
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:43,120
seed meal so the

152
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:45,439
extract after they remove the oil um is

153
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,280
pretty similar composition a little bit

154
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:50,319
different fatty acid profile but the

155
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:52,478
protein contents very similar um and

156
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:53,759
whatnot so there's a push in the poultry

157
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:56,560
industry to kind of replace some of the

158
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,400
soybeans oil meal with the hemp meal

159
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,160
for that fatty acid profile is what

160
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,120
they're going after

161
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,199
yeah well i think you've got the

162
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,120
two-pronged attractive you've got lower

163
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,160
carbon emissions if you're able to

164
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,720
utilize a biomass that's being thrown to

165
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,319
the wayside initially anyway you've kind

166
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,720
of got two markets one being able to

167
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,600
create jobs and revenue and another

168
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:21,759
being able to less reliant on an import

169
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:23,280
coming from it a foreign territory

170
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,319
exactly and our

171
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:28,799
um one of our big pushes um for western

172
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,800
kansas and we have a lot of farmland out

173
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,879
there that's irrigated and ran off

174
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,439
what's called the onago onaga aquifer

175
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:37,519
aquifer so there's a finite amount of

176
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:40,240
water there and those producers are

177
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:42,399
looking for ways to basically reduce any

178
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,918
amount of water they have to use to grow

179
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:47,918
crops and so um that's a big push out

180
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:50,399
that way to use things like kemp because

181
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:52,560
it uses so much less water

182
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:55,279
compared to traditional road crops like

183
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,280
corn and soybeans

184
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:59,918
okay interesting second topic i wanted

185
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:02,239
to jump at is if the farm grown version

186
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:04,240
of hemp has a transcendental thc and

187
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,240
that seems to be the barrier for entry

188
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,199
for it being used as a product

189
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:12,240
what are the options of synthetic versus

190
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:16,560
farm grown for uh providers of

191
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:18,240
feed for cattlemen for farm animals

192
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,240
so you when you talk synthetic do you

193
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,000
mean like a plant that's been modified

194
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,360
with no thc

195
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,360
are you mean yeah again are a singular

196
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,919
singular cannabinoid let's say or a

197
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,680
specific set of group of cannabinoids or

198
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:33,519
a mixture or a combination let's say

199
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,879
that's a formula some company might

200
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:36,879
develop themselves as an ip

201
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,478
so that would be

202
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,439
here in the united states those would

203
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:45,279
automatically be labeled as drugs

204
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:48,319
and so you're starting to go you go

205
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:52,399
completely away from you know a forage

206
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:55,039
type diet that's feed to a

207
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:57,198
drug and feed drug and that's a whole

208
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:59,598
set of different regulations

209
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,319
here in the united states

210
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:04,478
there are the fda has come out and they

211
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,160
have said you know thc is one drug they

212
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:08,159
consider a drug and they also consider

213
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,280
cannabidiol here in the united states so

214
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:14,240
cbd to be a drug and that's because

215
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:15,279
there's an fda approved formulation for

216
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,918
humans

217
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:19,519
for seizure control and so they consider

218
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:20,560
automatically they consider that a drug

219
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:22,560
because they have an approved

220
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,639
cannabidiol label here in the united

221
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,680
states so those are the two that would

222
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,519
meet a lot of

223
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,598
pushback from the fda the other ones

224
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:31,120
they would if they were pure

225
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:33,200
chemicals they would still consider

226
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,879
those a drug by definition

227
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,839
um and they you'd have to go through

228
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:39,838
those formal approval processes uh which

229
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,360
are quite lengthy and quite a bit of an

230
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,839
investment

231
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,000
on the back end so

232
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,680
yeah that's the only thing that you

233
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,200
could have one major one or two people

234
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:50,958
who've got the capital to be able to do

235
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,120
this and have got the ability to be able

236
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:55,439
to make a product that are they the ones

237
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,039
that may be able to cut out the farming

238
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,920
industry from being able to use that as

239
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:59,919
a revenue source

240
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,120
that's the um

241
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,958
concern that would be the concern and

242
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,639
you know the big concern they would have

243
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:09,518
then also they would probably also know

244
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:11,278
that

245
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,799
farmers being farmers if it's green and

246
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:13,759
they can feed it to a calf they're

247
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:15,919
they're going to try to feed it

248
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:17,439
somewhere along the way that's the way a

249
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:19,838
lot of producers here in the united

250
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,240
states are if it's a

251
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,440
lower cost but a similar you know

252
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,959
product in the end they're going to go

253
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,240
for the more economical choice when it

254
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,479
comes to feeding cattle because that's

255
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,399
the biggest expense we have here in the

256
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,360
united states for feeding animals for

257
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:36,480
raising animals is that feed intake

258
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,000
and putting feed into them

259
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,759
yeah well i think a farm is a perfect

260
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,600
example of having a circular economy in

261
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:43,360
the one space you need to use everything

262
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,759
for something at some stage along the

263
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,759
lines

264
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,720
yeah exactly and you know cattle for our

265
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,278
you know in the united states are

266
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,000
wonderful recyclers i don't think people

267
00:09:55,278 --> 00:10:00,080
appreciate how much biomass from the

268
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,559
food industry actually ends up in the

269
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,120
cattle uh you know

270
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:07,919
anything from potato chip waste to

271
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,000
carrot waste to vegetable waste that you

272
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:12,240
know that's not fit to enter the

273
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,399
human food chain but it's safe they can

274
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,799
still enter the cattle chain uh they do

275
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,159
that and as well as um the ethanol

276
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:20,078
industry here in the united states

277
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:22,319
really relies on

278
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:24,479
as a cattle feed and so a lot of cattle

279
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,519
here in kansas are fed uh distillers

280
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,278
grains from our ethanol industry um it's

281
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,959
almost to the point where the distiller

282
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:33,200
grains drive the ethanol industry more

283
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:35,439
than ethanol drives the ethanol industry

284
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,839
so

285
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,600
and last topic i just wanted to bring up

286
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,920
is do you guys do much research on the

287
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,800
endocannabinoid system and other farm

288
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:46,559
animals is it a is it something that is

289
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:48,958
even being researched at the moment

290
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:50,958
because i'm sure if it works for cows

291
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:53,759
you know the ecs is in most mammals if

292
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:53,759
i'm not mistaken

293
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:58,719
yes um so we do not do endocannabinoid

294
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:00,799
research in our lab uh

295
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,320
at the current time we just aren't set

296
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:05,039
up for it right now

297
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,760
um we we're focusing kind of on the food

298
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:09,759
safety aspect as well as the

299
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:11,600
um you know transference of cannabinoids

300
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:13,759
in the body um

301
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,440
we originally got into this uh

302
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:17,679
industrial hemp just looking to see if

303
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:21,360
cannabinoids would be a useful tool for

304
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:22,399
analgesics um and we've we were quickly

305
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,320
um

306
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,919
taken back by how little data was out

307
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,200
there and how much had to be filled in

308
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:29,759
and so we're still trying to fill in

309
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,278
those voids before we even get to our

310
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:33,278
original goal

311
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:35,600
for research

312
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:37,679
but there is some research out there

313
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,839
this particularly dairy cattle looking

314
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:42,319
at endocannabinoid system

315
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,079
around the time of calving and there's

316
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,320
some interesting data out there you know

317
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:48,000
they're it's upregulated uh during the

318
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,839
time of the postpartum period so when a

319
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,679
cow gives birth

320
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,040
that system is upregulated um the

321
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,879
receptors are

322
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:56,159
as well as cattle they've once said i

323
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:58,159
found were cattle that have

324
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:59,360
endometriosis with an infection in their

325
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:01,919
uterus or

326
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,680
inflammation of their uterus um have

327
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,078
increased in their cannabinoids um

328
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:08,479
circulating in their system um in those

329
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:10,319
animals so uh the a lot to learn about

330
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,560
that system and how it plays into the

331
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,959
balance of inflammation because

332
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:16,559
all all inflammation is not bad

333
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:18,239
we just have to figure out how to you

334
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:20,000
know balance it so we don't completely

335
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,759
shut off a system that

336
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,440
we know is useful

337
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:26,000
you know kind of likes the cox pathway

338
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,760
we know parts of it are very useful um

339
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,399
and we just want to shut off parts you

340
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:29,919
know

341
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,078
you don't want to get shut off the whole

342
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:34,879
thing and cause you know renal issues

343
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:34,879
and things like that

344
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,720
okay amazing we're just coming up to our

345
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,399
time now michael i could actually talk

346
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,639
to you all day it's been a highly

347
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,078
informative i think the work you guys

348
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,799
are doing there might be going under the

349
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:48,799
radar for a lot of people but there it's

350
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:52,078
cutting edge stuff and i think you guys

351
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:53,759
open up the door for a potential new we

352
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:55,439
can put random figures on these

353
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:57,759
industries like people do but a

354
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,399
potentially lucrative industry that

355
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:02,240
could be homegrown and a circular

356
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,240
company economy within the united states

357
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,959
and replicated in different territories

358
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,240
around the world

359
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,879
exactly

360
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,639
there's a lot to learn about this plant

361
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:14,000
where it can fit into our production

362
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,440
systems

363
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,240
definitely the

364
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,600
varieties of biomass that are you know

365
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,839
considered

366
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,519
byproducts and how those can fit into

367
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,959
cattle rations there's quite a bit of

368
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,959
variety there

369
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:29,278
and i think about all parts of the plant

370
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:31,039
could be and biomass can somehow fit

371
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:33,439
into a cattle ration pretty easily here

372
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:36,000
in the united states

373
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,760
yeah no i think it's a

374
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,120
a lot of people with the sustainability

375
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:41,198
and have been able to develop their own

376
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,560
feed as i said the research you guys are

377
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:44,159
going to do should allow the groundwork

378
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:44,958
for a number of companies as i said

379
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:47,039
we're

380
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,958
farming heavy industry it's already been

381
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:51,120
practiced over here to a degree it kind

382
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:52,799
of just needs the validation of uh

383
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,320
scientific scientific papers like

384
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:55,759
yourself so thank you very much for

385
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,839
coming on michael hopefully we can chat

386
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:59,120
again maybe in a year we can touch base

387
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,360
and see how everything's going for you

388
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,360
guys

389
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,360
absolutely love it

390
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:07,278
perfect thanks everybody for watching

391
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,240
thank you for having me on

392
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:12,730
cheers

393
