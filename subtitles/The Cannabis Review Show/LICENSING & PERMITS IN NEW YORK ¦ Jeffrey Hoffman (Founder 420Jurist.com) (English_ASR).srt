11
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:29,039
second live streams on linkedin and

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,320
doing my research and you seem to be a

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,000
man who's going to be able to bestow

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,359
some knowledge on the audience so do you

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,280
want to maybe give everybody a quick

16
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:37,679
little overview of how you came from

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,439
graduating law school to opening up 420

18
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:40,320
jurist and your space in the cannabis

19
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:43,280
industry

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,039
sure it's a bit of a twisted journey um

21
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,000
i was in law school here in the united

22
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,039
states in the mid 90s um and for those

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,479
of you that

24
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,239
remember that time that was also when

25
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:54,959
the internet was getting going so i

26
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:56,718
actually started my career in tech

27
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,359
started a web development studio was in

28
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,679
a couple of uh sustainability startups

29
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,198
that use technology i was always doing

30
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:04,959
law in the background and a lot of those

31
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:06,000
entities i was a general counsel or

32
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,798
otherwise

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,040
was doing other some legal things

34
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,240
as cannabis legalization really started

35
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,880
rolling here in the united states

36
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:17,519
california started doing medical in the

37
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:20,879
90s and then finally in the

38
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:22,959
early 2010s specifically 2012 colorado

39
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,359
and washington legalized here in the

40
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:27,199
united states we were kind of hoping

41
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:29,438
new york would as well so i started

42
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,280
screaming very loudly about

43
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:32,798
we got to legalize we got to expunge

44
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,560
everybody's records we got to get all

45
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,759
the non-violent cannabis offenders out

46
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,759
of jail

47
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,079
but for various and sundry reasons new

48
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:43,759
york did not get around to legalizing

49
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:45,359
until 2021 and so once new york did that

50
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,280
uh this really became what i started

51
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:48,719
doing full-time

52
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,280
amazing stuff so we're hoping that the

53
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:52,560
delay with new york is uh an ability for

54
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,840
them to learn some lessons from the

55
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,759
mistakes that have been made in other

56
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,280
states and hopefully that's the case

57
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,920
first topic i wanted to talk to you

58
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,200
about was your ask me anything live

59
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,200
stream on linkedin it's become very

60
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,040
popular a lot of people talking about it

61
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,159
was that set up basically just as a way

62
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,679
to help us stow information on let's say

63
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:11,919
you're entrepreneurs who might not have

64
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,000
access to a lawyer of your caliber

65
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:16,399
uh correct so not just those individuals

66
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,360
but frankly to anybody right so

67
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,039
i'm a big believer that information

68
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,200
deserves to be known

69
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:25,199
that we in the legal profession and and

70
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:27,519
people in other professions uh do a

71
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:30,079
disservice uh to the community writ

72
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,319
large if they don't share information

73
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,120
i'm not saying that everyone has to take

74
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:36,878
on every client or do everything they

75
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,680
possibly can

76
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:41,439
in 24 hours in a day but it is important

77
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,599
to me that information gets out and so

78
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:45,359
that's information about what's going on

79
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:48,079
um both in the state as far as the

80
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,920
progression of legalization as well as

81
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,519
the expungement information and the

82
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,839
justice information which i mentioned

83
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:57,039
briefly before um so really i just

84
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:00,560
started doing it um because i'm a long

85
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:02,158
time uh fan of the website reddit which

86
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,920
i think is

87
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:06,639
uh the website that really brought the

88
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:08,399
concept of an ask me anything uh to

89
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:11,279
public consciousness uh if you're on

90
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,599
reddit then um experts in all fields and

91
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,239
frankly these days people perhaps aren't

92
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:18,639
experts but anyone that wants to open up

93
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,280
on reddit and do an ask me anything can

94
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:23,039
do so and then very similarly to what

95
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,439
you're doing with me today

96
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,679
linkedin started rolling out their video

97
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,680
feature uh stream yard is one of which

98
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,680
you're using is one of the ways you can

99
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,000
connect to linkedin and stream video for

100
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,000
any type of presentation or discussion

101
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,959
and so i said hey nobody seems to be

102
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,519
talking about this in cannabis so let's

103
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,560
let's take the ask me anything from from

104
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,200
reddit and and use the technology which

105
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,920
linkedin now has to do live videos and

106
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:52,079
let's do that every week at at 4 20 on

107
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:54,079
wednesday obviously 4 20. everyone knows

108
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,159
why that and just here in the united

109
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,920
states and i'm sure most other places uh

110
00:03:56,158 --> 00:03:59,120
wednesday is the day that most people

111
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:00,639
are at work

112
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,840
monday and friday are the days you might

113
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:05,598
take off so we started doing it

114
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,039
wednesday at 4 20 and off we go

115
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:08,560
yeah no it's been absolutely brilliant

116
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,239
in any young entrepreneur looking to get

117
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,000
into the industry i highly recommend

118
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,200
watching along the sessions you'll learn

119
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,519
an absolute

120
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,199
a good amount of information next thing

121
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,399
i wanted to talk about was basically

122
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,000
your own practice 420 jurist and was

123
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,839
that strategically set up with a

124
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
specific aim in mind like i know you

125
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:28,638
specialize in licensing and permitting

126
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,839
and strategy negotiations and contracts

127
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,199
was uh

128
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:33,519
would the digital should all flow

129
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,600
organically or did the 420 jurist name

130
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,839
come from somewhere in particular

131
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,680
um it just makes sense right i mean i

132
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:41,599
needed something that the url was

133
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,840
available for

134
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,240
and uh here in the united states in

135
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:47,918
particular and i guess worldwide now 420

136
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,879
is just the code for

137
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:52,719
for cannabis right i mean it dates back

138
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:53,519
well into

139
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,440
uh

140
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:59,359
last century and it's funny to say that

141
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:02,319
these days um where this term 4 20 4 20

142
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,000
p.m during the day um you know 4 20

143
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:07,599
april you know we in the united states

144
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,279
do month and then day so april 20th is 4

145
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,479
20 so that's another day that has pretty

146
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:13,038
big significance in the cannabis

147
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:15,199
community um so obviously that was some

148
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:17,759
nomenclature that made a lot of sense

149
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,840
and then again usually the word lawyer

150
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,759
or attorney is taken if you want to look

151
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:23,359
for a domain name but jurist which has

152
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,120
the same root

153
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,439
as juror

154
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,720
so a juror is a person that sits on a

155
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:32,959
trial and makes a decision a jurist

156
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,400
can either be an attorney or a judge or

157
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:37,038
a person that works in the legal

158
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:39,918
profession here in the united states

159
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:41,519
so so 420 juris just made a lot of sense

160
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:43,279
yeah it flows off the tongue right and

161
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:44,639
as i said it's all about that domain as

162
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:46,478
well if you can get that catchy easy

163
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,240
domain is half the aim

164
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:51,439
tell me this the licensing and

165
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,918
permitting that you uh excel at do you

166
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:56,800
think that the new york authorities have

167
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:58,799
managed to get licensing and permitting

168
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,079
correct because we noticed that even

169
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,759
from over in europe you can see that one

170
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:03,599
of the first states that kind of

171
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,038
really set out to do a social equity

172
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,560
program a lot of the others kind of gave

173
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:08,719
it a little bit of fluff but nobody

174
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,319
really executed it are they delivering

175
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,720
on their promise from what you can see

176
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:16,240
and is it designed properly

177
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,759
so so far so good um in most regulatory

178
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,680
schemes that we have here in the united

179
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,400
states it is either a license or a

180
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,079
permit that the organization needs um

181
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:25,839
it's actually quite fascinating to me

182
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:27,758
when you look at different industries

183
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:29,279
where when the license is the important

184
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,038
thing and when the permit is the

185
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:33,359
important thing i used to work in the

186
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:34,879
mobile vending industry here in new york

187
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,560
these are the food carts that you see on

188
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:38,079
the sidewalks everywhere and in that

189
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,160
industry interestingly enough it's the

190
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,359
permit that's important and the license

191
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,800
is something that anybody can get the

192
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,960
permit is the thing that's difficult to

193
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,439
get in the cannabis industry it's almost

194
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:49,680
exclusively licenses the only thing at

195
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:50,639
the moment that they're calling a permit

196
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,079
is

197
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,759
what is going to be available to the

198
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:55,598
testing labs these are the labs that

199
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,000
confirm there's nothing wrong with the

200
00:06:55,598 --> 00:07:01,360
cannabis that you grew that the the thc

201
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,639
level is what you say it is etc etc

202
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,800
for the licensing we are right now

203
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,720
getting ready to roll out and in fact on

204
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,240
thursday of this week

205
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,759
depending on when you air this today is

206
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,160
monday the 22nd that you and i are

207
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,400
talking but on thursday the 25th of

208
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,880
august the state is going to roll out

209
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,879
the first retail license and that

210
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:23,038
license will only be available to

211
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:25,279
individuals that were previously

212
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:27,279
convicted of a cannabis crime in the

213
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:29,519
state of new york or were arrested for a

214
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:31,679
cannabis crime and then convicted of

215
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,439
something else that came out of that

216
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,280
cannabis arrest

217
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:37,680
additionally they also must demonstrate

218
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:39,679
that they were an owner uh at least a 10

219
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,439
percent owner of a business that was

220
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,720
profitable for two years

221
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:45,598
we think that there's going to be

222
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,280
somewhere around 100 or 150 of those

223
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:50,159
licenses given out

224
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:52,719
and so and in addition the state is

225
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,120
actually going to build the dispensaries

226
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,759
for those individuals so the state has

227
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,759
raised 200 million dollars the entity in

228
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,360
the state that controls the real estate

229
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,439
portfolio

230
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,240
of the state here in york is going to be

231
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:09,199
responsible for this program so no other

232
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,680
state has even remotely come close to

233
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,000
some kind of equity program

234
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,360
such as that i mean literally

235
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,478
depending on where the dispensary is

236
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,038
going to be built in the state you're

237
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:22,959
looking at somewhere between an 800 000

238
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:24,478
to a 1.5 million dollar asset that the

239
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:25,918
the license recipient is not going to

240
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:27,918
have to build themselves the state is

241
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:30,719
going to build it and then the licensee

242
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:32,158
will simply rent that from the state

243
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,080
additionally and some of the other

244
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:35,519
licenses that we're going to see coming

245
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,360
either later this year or early next

246
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,560
year what i call the nine standard

247
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,278
licenses

248
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:44,719
this is cultivation uh processing

249
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:46,639
distribution retail etc um there will be

250
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,959
the ability for certain individuals to

251
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:51,199
apply is what we are calling a social

252
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:52,879
and economic equity applicant

253
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,360
and that would be minority-owned

254
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:56,958
business woman-owned business uh here in

255
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,440
new york we have a concept known as

256
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:01,679
distressed farmers so they'll be able to

257
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,920
apply and also service disabled veteran

258
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:07,519
these are members of our own of our

259
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:09,759
armed forces uh that were disabled um

260
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,759
while they were in service and so the

261
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:13,919
state's goal is to give half of the

262
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:15,838
licenses to individuals that would

263
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:17,679
qualify as social and economic equity

264
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,120
applicants they're going to get all

265
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:21,599
kinds of other benefits they're going to

266
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,278
have reduced or waived licensing fees

267
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,879
there's going to be a loan pool from

268
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:26,480
which they'll be able to get low or no

269
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:28,000
interest loans

270
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,680
when they come to the application

271
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,839
process they're not going to have to

272
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:34,159
have a right to property they're only

273
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,920
going to have to have a plan for a right

274
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:38,079
to property and just to unpack that for

275
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:40,000
you real quickly in many other states

276
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,480
that have legalized there's typically

277
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,480
been a lag between when you applied and

278
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,480
when you eventually get your license and

279
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,800
for most of them you had to have this

280
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,639
right to property when you applied that

281
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,559
means you either owned the building

282
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:54,480
where your business was going to be or

283
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:57,039
you already had an active lease and you

284
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,879
could see people sitting on a lease for

285
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:01,039
3 6 12

286
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:02,799
months or even more without being able

287
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:05,199
to open the business simply having to

288
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:06,879
hold on to that lease while the

289
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,959
regulatory authority was waiting to

290
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:11,039
approve their application so that as you

291
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:14,000
could imagine could be tremendously

292
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:15,679
expensive and so these are just really

293
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,879
fascinating benefits that the state is

294
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,958
going to offer to the social and

295
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:21,360
economic equity applicants and if you

296
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:23,919
include this first license that's only

297
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,600
going to convicted individuals all of

298
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:27,120
the things that i just mentioned there's

299
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,519
no state here in the u.s that has even

300
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,480
remotely come close uh to what new york

301
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,399
has proposed and is proceeding with here

302
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,839
yeah it really is amazing to see the

303
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,919
more people i talked to from new york

304
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,279
the more kind of positive news you see

305
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:40,719
that they seem to be doing it right and

306
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:43,120
as i said it might have been a case that

307
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,800
the delay that new york did has actually

308
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,799
been beneficial that they've been able

309
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:49,359
to uh structure this property and learn

310
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:51,278
from mistakes so i think you're right um

311
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,959
let's be very clear

312
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:55,200
we're humans and humans are really good

313
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:57,039
at doing two things blowing up bubbles

314
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,200
and making mistakes that seems to be

315
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:01,599
what we are really good at as humans and

316
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,040
so there are going to be problems as new

317
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,800
york sets up its program right they're

318
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,120
going to be mistakes and frankly they're

319
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:09,039
going to be very big mistakes

320
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,720
but i do think

321
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:12,958
you should be judged on how you address

322
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,879
those mistakes once they get identified

323
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:16,319
not how whether or not they happen

324
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:17,439
because i assure you they're going to

325
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,278
happen

326
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,279
so far new york has done a reasonably

327
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:22,799
good job of addressing problems when

328
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:24,639
they have come up

329
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:26,799
again we've only given out two

330
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:28,240
conditional licenses and this is a

331
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:30,319
conditional cultivation and the

332
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,839
conditional processing license and they

333
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,480
went to people that were already in the

334
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,640
states hemp program this application

335
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,159
that we're about to open later this week

336
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,399
is going to be the first one where we're

337
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:42,559
letting people into the program that

338
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:45,278
have not been part of anything um with

339
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:47,518
the state either hemp or cannabis uh

340
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:48,879
previously so the rubber is really going

341
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,240
to meet the road with this first

342
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:51,838
application and then again as i

343
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,680
mentioned when we get to the nine

344
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,839
standard licenses which are called for

345
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:57,838
in the law which legalize cannabis my

346
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,760
hope is that they start rolling out

347
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,680
those applications either very late this

348
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:04,000
year or probably more likely in the

349
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,359
first quarter of next year but look

350
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,559
there are going to be problems there's

351
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,800
going to be hiccups there's going to be

352
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,799
mistakes the way we will be judged is

353
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:12,958
how we get over those hiccups and

354
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:16,078
mistakes how we address them and how we

355
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:17,759
roll out the program as we go forward

356
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:19,919
yeah no agreed i know you're a busy man

357
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:22,159
so one last thing before you go

358
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:23,519
the we were over in new york just in may

359
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:24,879
there and there was the trucks were

360
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,679
everywhere the cannabis trucks that have

361
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:30,240
recently been impounded was that a case

362
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:32,078
of the license and the permit did not

363
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,320
match for what they were doing or was

364
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:34,958
that just a concerted effort to clean up

365
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,560
the

366
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:38,958
let's say the retail side of the

367
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:40,638
industry uh so i'll tell you exactly

368
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,239
what it is and it you can look i

369
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,320
actually just over the weekend did about

370
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,399
four posts on it on linkedin

371
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,160
and what i previously did i mentioned i

372
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,000
was very involved in the mobile vending

373
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:51,600
scene here in new york and that is

374
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,240
exactly what it is related to in fact

375
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,159
this was not an enforcement action

376
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,919
related to cannabis now that have been

377
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:01,039
it may have been a fallout component of

378
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:03,199
it but the reason why these trucks were

379
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:04,879
um seized and there have been two

380
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,040
incidents of it one

381
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:08,799
several weeks ago and one just recently

382
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:10,559
the one several weeks ago was because

383
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:12,399
the trucks involved had about two

384
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:14,239
hundred thousand dollars worth of

385
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,440
parking tickets and if you've got two

386
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,440
hundred thousand dollars worth of

387
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,360
parking tickets the state of excuse me

388
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,440
the city of new york is going to grab

389
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,039
your vehicle and extract that money from

390
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,880
you so that was the incident that

391
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:26,879
happened a couple of weeks ago and the

392
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:28,639
one that happened just now

393
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:30,480
here in new york city every region of

394
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,159
the city is divided up into what we call

395
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,079
business well not every region but a lot

396
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:36,000
of the the commercial regions of the

397
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:40,000
city are divided up into what we call

398
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,799
business improvement districts bids bids

399
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,480
um and these business improvement

400
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:46,559
districts have a lot to do with them

401
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,639
keeping the quality of life and the

402
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,958
traffic and all of these types of things

403
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,039
at a nominal level for the businesses

404
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:54,638
and the residents that are within their

405
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:57,039
particular district

406
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,519
and none of the trucks that were selling

407
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:01,519
cannabis here on the streets had the

408
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,440
necessary permit and if you remember we

409
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,959
said previously that in the mobile

410
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,480
vending it is the permit that is the

411
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:08,479
critical piece of the puzzle that

412
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,159
literally you can't get in new york city

413
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,000
anymore and if you want to buy one on

414
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:14,000
the black market it's literally twenty

415
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,559
thousand dollars for a two year permit

416
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,639
but none of these trucks had one of

417
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:21,439
those permits so therefore they were all

418
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,120
illegally vending regardless of what it

419
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,600
was they were vending so it was very

420
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,720
easy um for the bid to communicate with

421
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,720
the police

422
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,278
and the police came in and said this is

423
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,240
great so it was specifically the times

424
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:34,240
square

425
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,240
business improvement district that this

426
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,000
did this they reached out to the police

427
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,759
they said let's do an enforcement action

428
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,799
against these folks that don't have the

429
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:44,559
required permit to be vending um by

430
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:46,159
parking there at the curb and that's

431
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:49,039
exactly what they did and i believe they

432
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:50,879
seized 19 trucks and those trucks will

433
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:54,000
be given back to their owners once they

434
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:56,559
come and pay the fine for vending

435
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,559
without the vending permit and it would

436
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:00,399
be my guess that you will see that

437
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,638
enforcement spread to other business

438
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,159
improvement districts around the city

439
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,079
now that they've seen this initial one

440
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:07,759
be successful

441
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:09,278
brilliant amazing real recap for that

442
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:10,559
that's very interesting we're at the

443
