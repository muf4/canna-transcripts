00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,880
especially specializing in neurobiology

11
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:30,879
can you maybe give everybody a quick

12
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:32,079

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,079
yes so

16
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,238
my

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,759
so i study biology

18
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:42,320
and i

19
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:44,640
specialize in neurobiology and at some

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,480
point i joined the love of manuel

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,120
goodman who is a

22
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,159
a big figure in the cannabis research

23
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:53,759
field

24
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:55,679
and i carried out a phd mainly focus on

25
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,159
the roles

26
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,840
go burn by the endocannabinoid system in

27
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:02,640
the process of

28
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,359
brain development so i study

29
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,478
the

30
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:09,200
the proliferation of stem cells

31
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:10,560
neural specification newborn neuron

32
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,640
migration

33
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,040
and all these processors are tightly

34
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,960
controlled by the the cb1 cannon

35
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,118
receptor and

36
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:22,399
the endocannabinoid system but it was

37
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:25,280
interestingly a big lab in which with

38
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,759
different lines of research so i got a

39
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,920
background also in cancer research

40
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,719
neurodegenerative diseases

41
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,439
and

42
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,000
yeah

43
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:36,158
another potential therapeutic

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,840
possibilities of cannabis

45
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,759
okay incredible so you've got a wealth

46
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,200
of knowledge and i'm hoping you're the

47
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,640
demand to be able to give everybody the

48
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,200
information that we're looking for this

49
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,759
episode so the the topic of this episode

50
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,079
is patient access in spain can you maybe

51
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,239
give everybody a breakthrough of

52
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:53,919
the the legal framework that seemed to

53
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:55,839
have been passed over the last couple of

54
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,640
weeks the timeline the patient is

55
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,560
getting access and the the reality of

56
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,079
the timeline shall we say we understand

57
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,920
that it's a certain amount of months but

58
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:06,239
yeah

59
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,399
there are many challenges so first of

60
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:11,759
all i would like to to give a glimpse of

61
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:14,878
the actual uh context because

62
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:17,120
a lot of people actually believe that we

63
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:19,840
we have legal access to cannabis in

64
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,800
spain and that's not true so

65
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,878
most people have heard about the

66
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,920
the cannabis collapse no

67
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:32,000
so this is not actually uh

68
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:35,679
anything legal is something that the the

69
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,479
users and everybody found let's say that

70
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,439
the gray areas in the law

71
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:41,280
and

72
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:44,318
so all these

73
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,959
for the recreational uses but most

74
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:47,919
importantly for medical users they have

75
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,959
to go

76
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:52,238
to the black market or this collapse

77
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,360
which is

78
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,439
illegal and so they are subjected to a

79
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,159
possible fine or whatever

80
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:02,560
so what it took place and actually it

81
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:05,840
was june 27th

82
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,959
it was finally approved in the health

83
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,080
commission

84
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,080
within the spanish parliament

85
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,959
uh a text

86
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,760
that

87
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,158
uh

88
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:18,479
integrates the the the summary of the

89
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:20,719
com the main conclusions of a

90
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:23,039
sub-commission that was taking place for

91
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:26,400
the last the past months

92
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:29,759
and so this subcommission gather

93
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:33,280
experts physicians people from

94
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:35,919
associations and many different voices

95
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,479
and to evaluate to study the possibility

96
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:41,039
of cannabis medical cannabis regulation

97
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:44,158
in spain so

98
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:47,598
yes this was finally approved for with

99
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:49,039
20 votes in favor 14 against and two

100
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:50,878
abstentions

101
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:51,919
and this text

102
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:54,878
kind of

103
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:58,079
set uh

104
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:59,199
not rules but uh suggestions on the

105
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,879
process

106
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,199
and so

107
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:04,479
yeah there are many

108
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:08,399
questions

109
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:11,199
for for instance a what so we we can get

110
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,200
the flowers sadly are not included in

111
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:16,639
this text so

112
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:18,079
they are only status for experimental

113
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,199
programs

114
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,759
so what it is included so the what

115
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,720
patients could have access to

116
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,400
are a standardized products or

117
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,560
preparations

118
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:31,359
and also what it is very interesting is

119
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,519
this

120
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,840
called a

121
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,918
master preparation master formulas i

122
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:41,198
believe is called in english and is

123
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:44,799
something that allows for tailor-made a

124
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,478
medicine because the physician

125
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,600
taking care of this patient could

126
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,240
actually

127
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,199
change the

128
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,439
the

129
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,960
in case a patient has troubles to

130
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:59,360
swallow or has any

131
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,399
other medication that could interact

132
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,759
with

133
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,879
cannabis

134
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,240
components

135
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:05,839
or

136
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,439
to actually

137
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:08,638
re adjust

138
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:10,719
the

139
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,079
the rate of cannabinoids

140
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,759
to

141
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:15,680
allow for

142
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,879
individualized or very personalized

143
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:22,079
medicine so this is what is control

144
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:26,159
and who could be prescribing if this is

145
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:29,599
not clear in the text so they say

146
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:32,080
should be done by specialist physicians

147
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,759
and this depending on how

148
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:37,038
eventually the the regulation adopts

149
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,840
this point

150
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:46,240
it could be open to the primary care

151
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:47,839
physicians and private institutions or

152
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,720
only for

153
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:51,839
pain

154
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,280
or a neurologist or this kind of

155
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:55,279
specialist

156
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:58,239
and the patients

157
00:05:55,279 --> 00:06:00,159
could get access to these products in

158
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,360
pharmacies

159
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,479
in

160
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,479
regular

161
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:06,639
let's say common pharmacies in the

162
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:08,159
neighborhood but also within the

163
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,759
hospitals

164
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,120
and the

165
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:16,479
pathologies that are actually

166
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,560
so far included because this is a

167
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:21,839
a prospective

168
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,319
let's say text no but so far the

169
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:27,599
indications accepted are

170
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:30,479
multiple sclerosis that we had already

171
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,400
sativex which was accepted already in

172
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:34,879
spain to treat this spasticity

173
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,159
associated with the disease

174
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:39,519
also

175
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:42,240
we have certain types of epilepsy

176
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:43,839
and nausea and vomiting derived from

177
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,680
chemotherapy

178
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:47,279
endometriosis

179
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,120
and also

180
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:53,198
oncologic and non-oncologic pain

181
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,280
so these are mainly the

182
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,598
the guidelines and then of course in the

183
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:59,119
text there are many other aspects such

184
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:01,120
as the

185
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,519
the

186
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,800
they indicate to their responsible

187
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:07,918
agency

188
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,280
some points in the in the regulation how

189
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:12,399
they should

190
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:14,000
ensure access to these products

191
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:16,959
and how they should

192
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,720
ensure the education of the medical

193
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:22,399
professionals and etc yeah

194
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,720
okay amazing so it's very in-depth

195
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:26,159
analysis of it so from the framework

196
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,000
just to maybe give everybody a rough

197
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,759
little breakdown it says that there's

198
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,759
neuropathic pain and chronic pain

199
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,080
allowed in that

200
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,000
in the dispensing of the product but it

201
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,199
might be only by specialist doctors so

202
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,918
would this be

203
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,919
a specific brain specialist or is it

204
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:44,240
post chemotherapy doctor specialist or

205
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:46,159
is that still open to interpretation yet

206
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,240
in the finalized worlds

207
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,879
it is still open you know to

208
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,199
interpretation because they say that the

209
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,319
what they say is

210
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,879
uh

211
00:07:54,319 --> 00:08:00,879
the professionals allowed

212
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:02,080
are physicians with without conflict of

213
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,720
interests

214
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:06,159
and then they say they say

215
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,800
preferentially should be done by a

216
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,479
specialist in the areas blah blah blah

217
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,840
so

218
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:17,598
this we don't know as uh

219
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:19,839
so this is a um an initial let's say

220
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:20,719
proposal then

221
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:22,079
what

222
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,000
will be

223
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:25,279
eventually uh

224
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,519
implemented

225
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:29,758
this we don't know and another thing

226
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:30,560
that i have forgot to mention is that

227
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,919
the

228
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,038
in this text

229
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:36,559
they

230
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:39,439
they give a frame time work a time frame

231
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:42,478
sorry of six months to implement all

232
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,159
these measures to the responsible agency

233
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,839
which we believe

234
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:50,319
it's really very i mean being

235
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,760
realistic is not going to be in this in

236
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,879
this time but

237
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:53,838
well

238
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:54,720
let's

239
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,120
and

240
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:00,480
so we steal from the activists the

241
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,600
associations the

242
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,920
certain

243
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:07,040
cannabis institutions such as the

244
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:09,439
spanish observatory of medical cannabis

245
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:11,519
so we need to keep

246
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,480
doing some pressure

247
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,200
to

248
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,200
trying to ensure that the final adoption

249
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,640
of this text is as

250
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,000
as more

251
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:23,199
complex and sorry complete as possible

252
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,759
yeah

253
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,360
yeah because the one

254
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,039
nook and the cranny from an outside

255
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,200
perspective looking in that you can see

256
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:33,439
is right well it's not determined who

257
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,879
the doctors are yet but who gets the

258
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,959
license to prescribe the cannabis so

259
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:41,360
what what text is going to be in that

260
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:43,278
license because if it's specific it

261
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,600
specifies a specific type of doctor then

262
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:47,519
i think the market will have a little

263
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,159
bit of a shortfall when it comes to

264
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,679
patient access i think of course general

265
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:53,439
practitioner if it's going to be

266
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:55,120
neuropathic pain and chronic pain a

267
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,080
general practitioner should be able to

268
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,320
prescribe it but as you said

269
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,320
getting a licensing system built in six

270
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,320
months

271
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,039
for sure

272
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:09,278
of course and that makes a big big

273
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:12,159
difference because i mean

274
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:14,559
just talking about pain no chronic pain

275
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:15,919
so the the numbers uh

276
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:19,518
[Applause]

277
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:21,759
estimated are one in six patients in

278
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,639
spain are suffering from from chronic

279
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:25,278
pain

280
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:26,159
this is about eight million people in

281
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:29,278
spain

282
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:32,480
and let's let's be cautious and assume

283
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:34,639
that only one third of the patients are

284
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,200
really sensitive to cannabinoid

285
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:39,039
treatment which is i mean really low

286
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,200
number because we could assume more but

287
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,559
let's say one third this is more than

288
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,320
2.5

289
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:47,278
million people

290
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:50,079
that could already benefit and change

291
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:51,039
their lives with this treatment so of

292
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:53,439
course

293
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:55,199
this is not going to take place if only

294
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,720
a specialist and

295
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,440
and you know we need to

296
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,000
we need to change the the

297
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,360
healthcare professionals mind

298
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,078
because

299
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,320
uh

300
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:09,759
most of them have no

301
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,519
clue about the physiopathological basis

302
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:14,078
of the

303
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,839
actual potential of medical cannabis so

304
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:17,679
they barely heard about the

305
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,000
endocannabinoid system

306
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:22,078
and the control in physiology so and

307
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,320
even less they they have no clue about

308
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:28,399
the actual clinical data with of

309
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,480
the potential of medical cannabis

310
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,759
and of course they don't have a specific

311
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,759
training

312
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:35,600
which is something

313
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:38,240
fundamental because

314
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:42,079
cannabinoids are very

315
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,200
uh particular type compounds so you

316
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:45,439
cannot

317
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,320
establish that those

318
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,720
effect relationships that you usually do

319
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,440
with another other drugs

320
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,680
so this is a challenge this is another

321
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,959
challenge in this process yeah yeah well

322
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:58,319
that kind of leads me right on to the

323
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:01,679
next thing i want to talk about was

324
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,680
training the doctors and nurses because

325
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,199
as as we'd know that this is going to

326
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:07,278
get to a stage where as he said it's

327
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,639
blends and formulations of different

328
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:10,639
cannabinoids that are going to be

329
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,799
relative to each individual patient it's

330
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,600
not going to be there's a prescription

331
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:17,039
everybody one size fits all so where is

332
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,639
the training for the doctors and the

333
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:19,759
nurses going to come from is it going to

334
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,519
come from

335
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:23,039
governmental programs where they have

336
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,120
experts like yourself and professor

337
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:28,799
guzman or is it going to be investment

338
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,799
outside capital that comes in

339
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:35,680
this is a huge question mark so we don't

340
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:38,479
know and there's no specific mention in

341
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:40,078
the text so what they say is they

342
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,200
encourage

343
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:44,239
the spanish agent responsible agency

344
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,720
which is

345
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,278
well it doesn't matter the name

346
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:52,959
they encourage to

347
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:55,200
to ensure the medical educations of the

348
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:57,119
of the healthcare profession

349
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,800
so

350
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,200
to my opinion

351
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:02,719
there are perhaps four

352
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,839
ways no

353
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,560
one would be private

354
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:09,360
initiatives like private uh

355
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:11,599
yeah

356
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,278
platforms which are already

357
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,839
offering uh

358
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:18,000
courses of medical cannabis

359
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:21,360
then of course we could have

360
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,399
university linked programs

361
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,519
either

362
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:28,000
master degrees either

363
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:30,959
post-graduate programs

364
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,278
something which is called

365
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:34,958
continuous training or continuous

366
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:36,799
education which is

367
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:38,078
somehow related to university but it's

368
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:39,838
another type of

369
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:40,799
education

370
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,160
and

371
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:44,000
then of course

372
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:46,719
the government could

373
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,839
implement some programs associated

374
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,519
either to hospitals universities or

375
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,360
other type of

376
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,399
institutions

377
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,839
and

378
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:59,759
but then there is another and last a

379
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,600
way of training these healthcare

380
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:03,679
professionals which

381
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,920
is taking a actually place in other

382
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:08,559
countries as as well as this that i

383
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:12,479
already mentioned and is that the

384
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:13,759
the main companies that got these um

385
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,839
licenses

386
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:18,078
and of course they got the interest

387
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,880
because you know they have a

388
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:22,319
big niche of market and they

389
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:24,958
they want these

390
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,920
physicians to to be as

391
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:28,000
uh

392
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:30,879
as educated as possible so they could

393
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,159
actually prescribe their

394
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:33,600
products

395
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:37,278
and so

396
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:40,320
brands are actually investing a lot of

397
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:42,320
money into these

398
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,199
training programs

399
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,440
so yeah to my opinion these are the main

400
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:50,240
four ways that we could but there's

401
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,680
nothing clear we don't know which

402
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,360
yeah

403
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:55,198
yeah no it's going to be an interest in

404
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,959
six months over

405
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:58,559
to see how everything falls into the

406
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:00,000
place for you guys over in spain and

407
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,159
we'll have our fingers crossed over here

408
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,839
in ireland that you get a an industry up

409
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:06,078
and running that leads the way for

410
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,880
compliance and regulation

411
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:11,278
it's been an amazing subject

412
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:13,039
and helps a lot of patients i mean this

413
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:15,439
is something we are

414
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:17,759
pain cannot wait so yes this is

415
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,160
something we need to act now

416
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,919
yeah there as you said there's at least

417
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,480
a couple of million people in spain who

418
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:26,000
could be uh benefiting from access to

419
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,920
medical cannabis

420
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,120
products at the moment so i hope

421
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:30,479
everything goes amazing for you over the

422
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,159
next six months and hopefully we can

423
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,240
touch base at the end of the year or

424
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:36,319
start of 2023 and we'll get an update

425
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,519
and see where spain is at but for now

426
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,800
thank you very much for dan and have a

427
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:43,639
