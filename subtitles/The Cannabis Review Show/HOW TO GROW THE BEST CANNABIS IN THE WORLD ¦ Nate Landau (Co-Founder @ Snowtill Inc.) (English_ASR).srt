1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:03,718
foreign

2
00:00:07,378 --> 00:00:11,160
welcome everybody to the next episode of

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,320
the Cannabis review we're going to be

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,719
talking all things the world's best weed

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,940
on this episode and I'm delighted to be

6
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:20,480
joined in this episode by Nate Lando

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,920
who's a co-founder at snow till Inc

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,600
snotil uh that developed a unique

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,400
cultivation method that we're going to

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,320
discuss here in the show so Nate thank

11
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,358
you very much for joining us thank you

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,880
for having me delighted to have you on

13
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,559
mate I was doing my research and as I

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,200
kept coming across more in photos and

15
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:39,179
videos of your products I was salivating

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,399
at the mouth looking at how beautiful

17
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:43,439
and amazing they look so I said I had to

18
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,000
get you guys on to discuss exactly what

19
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,519
the key to the secrets are and maybe

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,079
help educate the audience can you maybe

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,539
give everybody a quick in under 60

22
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,219
seconds how you guys came to to create

23
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,800
snow till and what are the main

24
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:59,039
objectives of the company uh absolutely

25
00:00:55,799 --> 00:01:01,919
so no tell in general was created by

26
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,558
mesos for Coco uh Japanese scientist in

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,840
the 50s and it's the next generation of

28
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:09,780
Organics it's called natural farming so

29
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,478
we build our our own soil once it lasts

30
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,519
for 13 or 14 Cycles it's a whole

31
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:18,179
ecosystem where everything's alive and

32
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:19,739
this has three main benefits it allows

33
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,060
the plants to maximize the genetic

34
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:23,459
potential because they take what it

35
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,560
wants when it wants it the second one is

36
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:27,118
it's very sustainable it's close to zero

37
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,579
waste so all our leaves stems everything

38
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,840
goes right back on the soil and the

39
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:32,640
third thing is

40
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,618
it cuts out a lot of the production

41
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,599
startup costs and production costs and

42
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:39,420
really simplifies it you pretty much

43
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:40,798
give our plants plain water okay amazing

44
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,478
that's great so I'm going to move

45
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,520
straight on to the first topic and it's

46
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,500
a unique cultivation methods can you

47
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:48,599
explain to everybody maybe what what is

48
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,780
no till farming and the method that you

49
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:53,759
guys use so most modern agriculture

50
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,579
people till their soil in between each

51
00:01:53,759 --> 00:02:00,599
cycle and that breaks up the soil food

52
00:01:56,578 --> 00:02:02,758
web in the soil so what we do is we

53
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:05,158
Harvest our plants and all the plant

54
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:09,118
material gets put back on top of it and

55
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:10,979
then the roots get to decompose in the

56
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:13,739
soil and it's already created the

57
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:16,080
mycelium Pathways so when we put in the

58
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:18,420
next plants they get to follow the plant

59
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,459
where the root system that was already

60
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:22,559
there and as you know most of the

61
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:25,378
nutrients are in The Roots itself

62
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,840
so you know what we do uniquely is most

63
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:29,459
of it's done Outdoors or greenhouses and

64
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,979
we do it indoors

65
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:34,400
because within because quality is really

66
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:36,659
really important and the control you get

67
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,420
indoors you just can't get we've grown

68
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:42,900
in every single methodology possible and

69
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:45,179
doing uh no-till living soil indoors is

70
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,860
the way that we found this produces the

71
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,680
highest quality product

72
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,900
okay amazing so in terms of cover crops

73
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,939
sterility required let's say for outdoor

74
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,159
cultivation that indoor cultivation it's

75
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:57,180
more about the essence of the soil is

76
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:58,378
what's going to give you the best

77
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:02,400
product

78
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:04,620
yeah and we do have a rice hay as our

79
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,300
mulch that is kind that's the main

80
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,920
source of nutrients for the soil so

81
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,959
we're not feeding the plants directly

82
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:12,238
we're feeding the microbial life that's

83
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:15,239
in the soil and the microbial life has a

84
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,759
symbiotic relationship with the plant

85
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:20,459
okay amazing and next topic I want to

86
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:22,679
jump on to is cultivating with aesthetic

87
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:24,840
now for anybody who hasn't seen any of

88
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,519
the snow till products the website is

89
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,800
just down below there I highly recommend

90
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:30,719
you go and watch the videos and the

91
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,540
products that they've got what are let's

92
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:35,039
say the top two

93
00:03:32,539 --> 00:03:36,719
parameters that you guys set when it

94
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:38,039
comes to the end the static of the

95
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:39,120
flower that you're going to sell to the

96
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:41,818
consumer

97
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:45,480
so as you know the devil's in the detail

98
00:03:41,818 --> 00:03:48,000
uh high-end handbags are still sewn by

99
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:51,658
hand and not by machine and we treat

100
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,539
every single bud with love and it is

101
00:03:51,658 --> 00:03:56,280
important the reason why it looks we

102
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:59,280
call snow too because it looks like our

103
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,199
buds are snowy is again that's to do

104
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,598
with the cultivation method and we make

105
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,339
sure we do the property leafing and the

106
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:07,979
right training and pruning to the plant

107
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,780
so every single bite gets the right

108
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:12,658
amount to light so every single one

109
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:14,340
looks amazing we have grading systems

110
00:04:12,658 --> 00:04:18,060
under flowers so everything that leaves

111
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:21,060
our facility has to be grade A

112
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,978
okay interesting so when it comes to the

113
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:26,459
aesthetic of the plant you obviously are

114
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:29,099
using land race uh previous strains who

115
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:31,918
finds your let's say your genetics that

116
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,900
you mix together and uh what is the main

117
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:36,299
uh objective that you look for when

118
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:38,939
you're searching for a land race

119
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:41,579
so there's Trends come and go and by the

120
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:43,199
time you chase a trend it's already on

121
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:46,079
the new one so we

122
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,720
stick to Classics like our motor SOG

123
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:51,060
there's a certain stuff that might drop

124
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,580
in popularity temporarily but always

125
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:56,220
comes back because there's this certain

126
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:57,839
uh effects that people are looking for

127
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,759
at the end of the day with all the names

128
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:01,619
and the hives and the brand

129
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,060
when people consume cannabis that are

130
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,879
looking for a certain effect whatever

131
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:09,418
that is we work with a handful of

132
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:11,040
breeders and for us there it has to

133
00:05:09,418 --> 00:05:15,060
obviously have a unique theraping

134
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:16,620
profile it has to look a certain way and

135
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,180
of course we're a for-profit business so

136
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,918
it has to have a certain yield so I

137
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,079
would say that would be the three things

138
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:24,560
we're looking for when we test out new

139
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:24,560
genetics

140
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,580
okay very interesting so you mentioned

141
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,919
that you guys are cultivating with an

142
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:33,959
indoor facility which is basically the

143
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:36,478
model that can be clarified as medical

144
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:38,339
grade cannabis over in Europe we're

145
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:40,258
starting to see the industry mature and

146
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:43,918
Germany are going to legalize hopefully

147
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:46,620
2023 2024 timeline what would be the

148
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:49,079
number one tip that you'd give to indoor

149
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:51,418
cultivars in Europe that are looking at

150
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:53,099
getting into this industry and maybe uh

151
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:57,120
potential cultivars down the line

152
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:58,759
themselves so first of all the way you

153
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,879
design your facility

154
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:05,160
is crucial and you got to make sure you

155
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:07,259
can't cut Corners especially on your

156
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,720
HVAC it is very expensive especially

157
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:12,060
today with the supply chain issues but

158
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,800
that can make or break your facility if

159
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,620
you don't have the proper HVAC and you

160
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,300
can have full control over your

161
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,579
environment then there's no point of

162
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:23,280
doing indoors

163
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:26,339
okay so for everybody HVAC is humidity

164
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:29,459
ventilation and air conditioning so is

165
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:31,138
that basically a a pest deterrent is

166
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:32,758
that the best way of doing it or is it

167
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:35,939
giving more life to the plan to your

168
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:39,360
HVAC system is that on a parsed ECS

169
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:40,560
system then a a closed second behind in

170
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,919
terms of things people need to keep

171
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:47,699
their eye on yeah it has a bunch of

172
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:50,879
things uh and you want to maximize its

173
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:52,740
health so nature is cruel you know at

174
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,418
the end of the season most puns die and

175
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,879
everything here we're doing the opposite

176
00:06:54,418 --> 00:06:59,038
we're like vaping them like what is the

177
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:01,259
perfect optimal you know point of a

178
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:03,719
percent of uh humidity and temperature

179
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:06,180
you want at different stages of it and

180
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,880
that would really actually fight uh

181
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:10,620
exemplifies the plant as well

182
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:13,199
yes you're right it definitely helps

183
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:16,860
with bugs if stuff if the humidity gets

184
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:21,000
too high you're inviting a whole host of

185
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:22,319
pathogens and different past thrive in

186
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,019
different climates so if you don't have

187
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,340
control over that then you have just

188
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:28,500
created a perfect thing let's say for

189
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:30,119
spider mites and that's the last thing

190
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,399
you want the problem with indoors is

191
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,019
it's a zero-sum game there's nowhere for

192
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:36,239
them to go once you do get a pest in

193
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:38,159
your facility they don't really want to

194
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,500
go there and if you provided the

195
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,120
environment they thrive in then they are

196
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,120
going to win

197
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,340
okay very interesting tell me this do

198
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,538
California grow the best cannabis in the

199
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:51,418
world

200
00:07:48,538 --> 00:07:53,459
at the moment yes we this is the

201
00:07:51,418 --> 00:07:55,799
birthplace of all almost all modern

202
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:58,379
genetics have come from the Emerald

203
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:02,060
Triangle I would say also Southern

204
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:03,899
Oregon is definitely up there they

205
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:06,720
decriminalized all the way back in the

206
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:09,138
70s so it was a lot easier for them to

207
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,940
get around the law then and I would say

208
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:13,978
Southern Oregon and Northern California

209
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:16,560
through all the genetics

210
00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:18,478
there's definitely up and coming uh

211
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,160
Rivals but right now the best cannabis

212
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:22,500
in the world is still in California

213
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,660
okay amazing then the last topic I

214
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,759
wanted to touch on is the future of

215
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:29,039
cannabis flower it gonna be in craft

216
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:32,519
budgets

217
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:34,620
so yeah there's this like you can go to

218
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:36,478
a store and buy a three dollar bottle of

219
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:39,000
wine and buy a hundred dollar bottle of

220
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,219
wine and they both sell really well it's

221
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,320
different clientele

222
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:45,120
you're gonna have to have a very huge

223
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,220
budget if you want to compete on a

224
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,620
quantity level and it's like Bud Light

225
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:52,200
is the most popular beer in in the U.S

226
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:54,240
but craft breweries are cutting into

227
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,278
their profits into the market share

228
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,899
every year the same thing is going to

229
00:08:56,278 --> 00:09:00,179
happen here and you have to decide

230
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:02,458
there's not going to be a lot of room

231
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:04,799
for mid grade there's going to either be

232
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:07,018
mass produced are there's going to be

233
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:10,079
crafting and you cannot compromise or

234
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:11,459
cut any corners and don't grow too fast

235
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,160
that's one of the problems a lot of

236
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:16,018
people that produced a really amazing

237
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:19,439
product when they were small scale and

238
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:21,659
then they jump from 5 000 square feet to

239
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,220
a hundred thousand square feet and it's

240
00:09:21,659 --> 00:09:25,019
their quality we've seen unfortunately

241
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,778
even here in California with amazing

242
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:30,060
brands that they lose their quality so

243
00:09:27,778 --> 00:09:32,220
you'll still you'll always be able like

244
00:09:30,059 --> 00:09:36,778
in Colorado the most mature Market in

245
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:39,420
the world they still go for 50 60 Ace

246
00:09:36,778 --> 00:09:41,700
which is three and a half grams and that

247
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:44,159
price point has never changed all the

248
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,899
other price points have gone down so you

249
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:48,059
have to stay true to your principles if

250
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:50,519
you're a craft grower and never expand

251
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:53,219
too fast no matter what Market pressures

252
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:55,019
or investor pressures you're getting

253
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,940
yeah I think cannabis is one of the few

254
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:58,679
Industries worldwide where there doesn't

255
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,480
seem to be really a budget Market

256
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:02,639
everybody if they've got an opportunity

257
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,860
to play the best weed will sooner have

258
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:08,220
less of the best weed that a lot of the

259
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:10,919
shittersweed and when it comes to the

260
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,839
the craft patches and basically you guys

261
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:15,179
being in California do you see the

262
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:17,519
Eastern Seaboard of the United States

263
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:19,679
being an attractive Market to open up a

264
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,480
facility or do you think that there's

265
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:24,419
still a number of years away before it's

266
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:29,039
on a par with the West Coast

267
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:30,659
so because uh the U.S is unique where we

268
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:33,059
have every state is completely different

269
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:35,458
and there's a hodgepodge rules

270
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:38,518
New York is definitely showing some

271
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:40,439
promise of being a good Market at the

272
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:42,060
end of the day most of the TVs produce

273
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,740
their the financial markets there

274
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:46,379
there's a lot of reasons why New York

275
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:49,500
will be good uh just like everything

276
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:51,240
rollout is really slow and the

277
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:54,059
regulations change constantly and

278
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,399
confusing so I would say we will see a

279
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:58,500
fully open developed Market in New York

280
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,778
which is Epic Center for the east coast

281
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,159
in two years from now so there are there

282
00:11:00,778 --> 00:11:05,278
is still a little bit of time but yes

283
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:07,439
absolutely I'm from New York

284
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:09,480
and we are definitely going to have a

285
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,180
branch there sooner or later

286
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,820
incredible stuff and I look forward to

287
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:16,679
seeing the battle for uh the best flower

288
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,000
in America he healed over the next

289
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:19,739
couple of years because I think

290
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,519
somewhere like New York has so much

291
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:25,500
small little potential uh small grow

292
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,240
Farmers that can work on genetics over a

293
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,339
couple of years and perfect a plan to

294
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,440
the specific way and it's going to be

295
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:33,300
very interesting to see what happens and

296
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,800
not to mine then Europe with the history

297
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:37,139
of farming that we've already got over

298
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:39,179
here when regulations allow people to

299
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:41,159
advance and do some research and

300
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:43,500
development about cultivation it's going

301
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:45,299
to be an exciting Global industry over

302
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,759
the next five to ten years

303
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:52,139
yeah I'm really looking forward to it

304
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:54,419
where we countries legalize the country

305
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:55,679
so there can be cross-border like right

306
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:58,500
now we still don't have interstate

307
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:00,479
commerce so even though the border is

308
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,519
really tiny in the between states and

309
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,820
there really isn't the Border you can't

310
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:07,320
do it because that borders Federal

311
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,640
jurisdiction so can't wait till we have

312
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,560
interstate commerce and international

313
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,360
where we can just be treated like any

314
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:15,119
other industry where you have to compete

315
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,919
on quality price and service

316
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,299
I'd love to hear it it's we've reached

317
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:19,799
up our time now but thank you very much

318
00:12:18,299 --> 00:12:21,120
Nate for coming on the show it's very

319
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:22,379
much appreciated for anybody who wants

320
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,940

hotel I highly recommend go visit their

322
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,420
website and if you're over the west

323
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:29,338
coast of America I highly recommend

324
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:30,838

326
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:34,680
first customers so I look forward to

327
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:36,419
keeping an eye on everything with snow

328
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:38,578
till and hopefully getting to chat with

329
00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:40,078
you guys over the next year and see your

330
00:12:38,578 --> 00:12:42,000
expansion plans and how everything's

331
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:43,919
