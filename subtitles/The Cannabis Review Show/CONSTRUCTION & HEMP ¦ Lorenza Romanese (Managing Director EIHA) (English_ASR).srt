is a sector that certainly as i said is

32
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:20,400
growing uh is a sector that

33
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:21,438
is perfectly matching the society needs

34
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,359

00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:27,438
so it's a real it's a real pleasure to

37
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,280
to work for the association just to

38
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:31,359
remember to all the audience that the

39
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,640
association is mainly representing

40
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:34,319
companies

41
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,040
three

42
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:39,679
types of companies let's say three major

43
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,079
operators the producers of hemp the

44
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,840
processing companies and the traders of

45
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:47,839
hemp and its private products

46
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,079
okay brilliant can we maybe jump into

47
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,600
the first topic then straight away is

48
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:53,438
the overview of the hemp industry in

49
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,919
europe now i know we had a little bit of

50
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:58,000
a snails pace in terms of legislation

51
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,439
and movement over the last 12 months can

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,040
you give everybody a quick overview of

53
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:03,839
why everybody in the hemp industry in

54
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,680
europe is happy as of late and what the

55
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,920
future spells

56
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,159
yeah sure a quick overview it's

57
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:14,400
complicated because

58
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:18,000
europe is made of 27 member state and

59
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,879
for the moment when it comes to europe

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,199
the operator experience a fragmented

61
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:25,598
market there are member states that are

62
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:27,359
a little bit more

63
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:29,519
hemp friendly

64
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,680
when it comes i'm only referring sorry

65
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,400
to the upper part of the plants mainly

66
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,040
the

67
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,480
the hemp extract and the hemp derived

68
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:41,840
products and food products

69
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:44,399
in this case indeed we see a patchwork

70
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,640
of 27 different national legislation

71
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,000
this is why the european industrial hemp

72
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:52,399
association is is advocating for an

73
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,039
european framework where all the

74
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,000
operators can work with clear rules that

75
00:02:55,039 --> 00:03:00,318
are the same from lisbon to warsaw

76
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,639
while today the operators are facing

77
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:04,318
different values different approaches

78
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:06,318
which complicate

79
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:07,839
which complicate the business

80
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:11,199
um

81
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,280
but hemp is more than only the upper

82
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:15,518
part of the plant so i'm very glad that

83
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,039
after what we might exchange some words

84
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,039
on other

85
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,878
sector than only food and food

86
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:23,840
supplement

87
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:23,840
nevertheless

88
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:27,439
why we are happy in this moment is

89
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,399
simply because

90
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:32,318
finally um one

91
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,760
country that is uh

92
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:36,560
great britain

93
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:39,759
uh has decided to move forward and to

94
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,680
regulate these products namely this hemp

95
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:44,840
derived product from the upper part of

96
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:50,319
the plants hemp extract containing cbd

97
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:53,199
and it's very complex so to sum it up um

98
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:55,679
they were fsa so the standards

99
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:58,479
authorities was looking at this product

100
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:02,159
and try to find a way how to regulate so

101
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:03,598
fsa encourage the sector to move into

102
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:05,359
the direction of

103
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:07,839
sending application and submitting

104
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,840
application novel food application to

105
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,878
measure uh the

106
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,200
tdi so the the the tolerable daily

107
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:17,680
intake for this product and the company

108
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:20,159
that were submitting a

109
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,240
toxicological studies package and they

110
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,960
were doing a novel food application and

111
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,960
they were on the market in february 2020

112
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:30,719
if they have completed all these

113
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:32,799
requirements from fsa they can trade

114
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,960
they can trade and they can stay on the

115
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,759
market with their product so

116
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:37,839
um

117
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,960
finally what we were asking and

118
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:43,439
advocating for that was legal certainty

119
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:46,560
it happened and it arrives even if only

120
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:48,639
in one country now the idea is that we

121
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,639
will apply

122
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,120
the same novel food application in

123
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,840
europe and submit this application as

124
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,000
well to fsa we have already submitted

125
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:00,319
some application uh based on the

126
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,360
preliminary results of the talk studies

127
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:07,038
that we are conducting but the studies

128
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:10,479
are not over yet um very briefly we

129
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:13,519
invested uh the member of a invested 3.5

130
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:16,159
million of euros into a toxicological

131
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:19,120
studies for both products

132
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,039
isolate cbd naturally derived and full

133
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,319
spectrum extract

134
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:28,240
on top of that we among these 3.5

135
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:32,079
million of euros 1.6 is dedicated to thc

136
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,800
toxicological studies on human beings

137
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:37,359
with the scope of increasing the levels

138
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,478
of th c

139
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,120
only in the final products

140
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:44,959
okay so just a quick overview that novel

141
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,720
feud applications are available in the

142
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:49,038
uk at the moment i think i saw the list

143
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,000
just like 3 500 companies got you to the

144
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:54,159
very last round but maybe 10 of them are

145
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,720
actually going to get approved i think

146
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,560
one of the irish companies chanel mccoy

147
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,240
was one of the first to get approval

148
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,560
over there as well so what we're looking

149
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,560
to do is take the model of the uk build

150
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,439
replicate it into the european food

151
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,120
safety authority model and how long do

152
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:11,519
you think it's going to take the

153
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,000
european model to enact what the uk

154
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:17,198
brought to fruition

155
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,680
oh well let's clarify because

156
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,280
when the novel food application process

157
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,680
started in uk

158
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:24,719
i mean the uk was still part of europe

159
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,120
so

160
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,600
it's not that uk has a special

161
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,680
methodology they just applied it faster

162
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,520
because they added a deadline well while

163
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:37,280
in europe there is no deadline but the

164
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:40,478
application is the same okay so

165
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:42,000
there were minor uh differences with

166
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:44,399
fsa

167
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,038
sorry but then the process is the same

168
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:49,359
so what we have been doing in uk in this

169
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:51,598
moment we did it because of the time

170
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,759
constraints that we had

171
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:55,360
now we simply do the rest

172
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,240
towards efsa

173
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,240
for instance efsa is different because

174
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,160
what we liked and what we

175
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,918
we are very happy that our member can

176
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,880
enjoy is the fact that they can stay on

177
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:09,198
the market because fsa the only slightly

178
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:12,159
difference is that they created an

179
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,639
intermediate step that is so clear today

180
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,240
in uk while is not in europe meaning the

181
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,639
companies that have done the three

182
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,598
requirements that i've stated before can

183
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,598
stay are waiting for evidences

184
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:25,519
while in europe if you do not have

185
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:27,759
completed your toxicological studies

186
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:29,359
this product should not be marketed

187
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,240
because the provision called the

188
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,800
temporary period has been deleted from

189
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,240
the novel food regulation european novel

190
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,720
food regulation in january 19.

191
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,000
this is why today we have 27 different

192
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,919
approaches

193
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,439
yeah well i think the clear science and

194
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:46,878
regulation i think is what we're all

195
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:48,079
screaming out for in the industry and i

196
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,000
think it's gonna

197
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:51,439
did you can see the top brands are

198
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,879
already kind of coming to the fore at

199
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:54,639
the moment and i think it's gonna get

200
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,879
rid of the cowboys and have a couple of

201
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,918
i think the m a action over the course

202
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,280
of 2023 and 2024 with the emergency

203
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:04,318
acquisitions that are going to happen in

204
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,318
the european industry

205
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,680
yes um

206
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,680
as i said let's wait for the

207
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,000
toxicological studies and the final

208
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,800
submission that will dramatically

209
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,399
clarify the status of these products in

210
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,160
europe every uh

211
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:22,638
when it comes to the association the

212
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,840
talk studies are nearly over for full

213
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:28,400
spectrum then sorry for the isolate cbd

214
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:30,318
while the food spectrum is still ongoing

215
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:33,759
then it comes the risk assessment from

216
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:36,158
fsa and fsa both they last nine months

217
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:39,918
and then the first results according to

218
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:42,158
my to our opinion might arrive in 2023

219
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:44,000
the full risk assessment

220
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:45,759
yeah well i think a lot of our fingers

221
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,600
crossed for that the next topic i wanted

222
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,600
to talk to you about was hemp and

223
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,879
construction now we hear a lot of food

224
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,800
and noise about the novel food

225
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:53,919
application but if you have your eye in

226
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,719
the industry you understand that the

227
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:59,199
real capital and the real

228
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,360
markets are going to move towards ipable

229
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,360
constructable products used from hemp

230
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,440
fiber can you maybe give everybody a

231
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,039
little overview of hemp and construction

232
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,800
and who you see with some of the leaders

233
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:09,679
and what's happening in that territory

234
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,958
yeah

235
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:13,599
um

236
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:16,239
let's start from an assumption the hemp

237
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,278
sector will be a big sector and a major

238
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,399
sector

239
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:22,720
only if the operators will have access

240
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,879
to all parts of the plant so now we are

241
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,720
simply focusing on the upper part of the

242
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:29,120
plants because we need to clarify to

243
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,080
legally clarify

244
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,000
the extract and the cbd

245
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,800
products

246
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,600
while hemp is much more hemp is composed

247
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:41,838
by fibers as well by seeds so

248
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,080
the real the real industrial hemp sector

249
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,680
should be an industrial sector as the

250
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,879
name

251
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:48,319
called us

252
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:49,278
and

253
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,080
that

254
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:54,240
is planted firstly in open air it has

255
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,440
been harvested on the field with

256
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,440
machineries and the best uh the best

257
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,959
model for for hemp according to the

258
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:06,320
association is the so-called tripolis so

259
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:08,958
we process and we collect the stalks

260
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,079
that contains the fibers then we

261
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:14,479
separate the biomass the green materials

262
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:16,879
namely the what is left

263
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:20,240
from fruiting top from flowering top

264
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:23,838
then we collect the seeds to produce dry

265
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:26,240
dry food or seeds oil so this is the

266
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,920
perfect model for hemp now let's focus

267
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,240
on the bottom part of the plant and as i

268
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:32,879
said at the beginning i'm very happy

269
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,959
to to have the chance to speak uh

270
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:36,320
to discuss with you about something else

271
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:39,518
than cbd

272
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,399
so indeed the construction sector has a

273
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,799
huge potential it's quite uh

274
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,039
well established or is yeah it's quite

275
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:49,599
well established in europe but

276
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:52,240
especially the interest is growing the

277
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,440
fact that the demands are higher than

278
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,839
what the sector can supply is a good

279
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,600
is a good signal and the good reply from

280
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,480
the sector is that the construction

281
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,399
sector

282
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:07,278
can be scaled up quite quite easily

283
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,958
compared to other uh to other sectors so

284
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:10,559
first of all let's clarify what we are

285
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:14,399
talking about when we are talking about

286
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:16,559
hemping construction it can be used in

287
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,799
the following application can be used as

288
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:21,199
an insulation material

289
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:23,599
from the corticated technical fibers it

290
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,399
can be used as a hemp grit made of

291
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,759
sheaves and lime

292
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,078
it looks like

293
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:32,799
blocks or bricks

294
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:34,559
or prefab walls as well we have members

295
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:38,559
that are doing these technologies as

296
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:42,639
well and as well with in restoration of

297
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:44,719
architecture architectural heritage and

298
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:47,919
the most developed country when it comes

299
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,519
to hemp construction is uk and france

300
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:52,559
this country are more

301
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,679
our most advanced market for for these

302
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:54,879
products

303
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:57,278
um

304
00:11:54,879 --> 00:12:00,720
the potential of the of the hemp in

305
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:03,278
construction is is very is very high uh

306
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,440
as a conversion to natural material is

307
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:07,759
expected in a construction sector we

308
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,480
know that the european union

309
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:13,039
in when thinking about the future of the

310
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,839
of the construction they are integrating

311
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:19,519
uh natural and bio-based products so is

312
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,959
the good moment for for for hemp um

313
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,120
there are some

314
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:26,479
bottleneck today uh

315
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:29,120
these bottlenecks are in the

316
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,920
in the supply chain basically

317
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,000
europe is

318
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:37,199
dramatically lacking of at the

319
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,240
cortication lines uh there are we count

320
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:43,360
in europe less than 10 decortication

321
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:46,560
lines which is not enough to uh to

322
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:49,360
supply all the demands of these products

323
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:50,319
but nevertheless as i said before these

324
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,278
in

325
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,720
the investment needed are

326
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:57,919
not

327
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,560
not so important compared to fibers on

328
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:03,679
compared to to the processing of fiber

329
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:05,199
to produce long fiber so again a lot of

330
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:07,199
potential

331
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,519
it's good for the sector it's good for

332
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,000
the operator and especially we should

333
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,560
not forget it is extremely good for the

334
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,440
environment because the time is running

335
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:19,439
out but we should as well discuss about

336
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,160
all the good quality

337
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,000
of the of the hemp construction material

338
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:26,000
when it comes to

339
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,200
fire resistant when it comes to

340
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,120
antibacteric resistance so um these are

341
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,920
pro these are all aspects that should be

342
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,720
taken into account when we discuss about

343
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:38,319
the construction in help

344
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,160
amazing that's a great overview now for

345
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,839
most people i think if you if you have a

346
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:44,078
look at the industry really it's

347
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,600
insulation it's hem crete there are a

348
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:47,519
couple of different territories where

349
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,399
this fiber in this material just works

350
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,879
as a perfect ingredient for these end

351
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,198
products and i think that or d over the

352
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:56,720
next 12 months or 18 to 24 months should

353
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:58,319
be pretty exciting for the building

354
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,600
industry in in europe because i think

355
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,920
you're only starting to see some of the

356
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,159
big big players start to maybe have an

357
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:05,838
or a deep facility where they're working

358
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:07,600
on it or outsourcing it to other

359
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,040
companies and i think yeah that's the

360
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,120
one if you could if you're if you've got

361

capital to expand in the european market

362
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,720
