well thank you for that wonderful

40
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:20,239
introduction yeah we had to build

41
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,680
when we first started our dispensary in

42
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:23,199
06

43
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,240
none of those things had been done

44
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,040
before inventory tracking lab testing

45
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:31,359
senior outreach cannabis medicine for

46
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,280
children all that was

47
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:35,359
never been done before so we had to

48
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,960
invent it

49
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:38,319
excellent well as i said it's great when

50
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:39,519
you when you look at something that you

51
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:41,279
consider so

52
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:42,879
basic and some and simple to the

53
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,079
industry you kind of forget the people

54
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:44,879
who've led the way and creating the

55
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:46,959
things so

56
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:49,438
i'm going to jump into the first topic

57
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:51,438
and it's the harbourside model when you

58
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:52,879
guys created harbourside i know there's

59
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:54,639
going to be an influx of

60
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,000
dispensaries created in europe over the

61
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,159
next five to ten years

62
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,399
what are the one or two pillars that you

63
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,960
would highlight of the harbourside model

64
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,799
that

65
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,559
are paramount to the company that you

66
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,079
couldn't do without

67
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,000
well there are three things i want

68
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:10,159
everybody to focus on when they're

69
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,159
talking about creating their

70
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:13,280
dispensaries in europe or anywhere in

71
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:15,680
the world

72
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,000
number one pay attention to the plant

73
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,760
the plant itself and the products itself

74
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,159
you want to make sure you have an

75
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:23,519
excellent selection of the finest

76
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:25,120
products available

77
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,200
and you also want to make sure that

78
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,599
there's products available

79
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:32,238
that are affordable for people who are

80
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:34,000
poor or working class and don't have

81
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,599
a lot of money this is a medicine that's

82
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,080
been the working class and the poor

83
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:38,639
medicine

84
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,200
for many thousands of years and in fact

85
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,399
even

86
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,919
aristocratic medicine for many thousands

87
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,599
of years and we're bringing this out of

88
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:47,039
the shadows and into the light so pay

89
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:48,639
attention to the plant

90
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,719
the other thing i want you to pay

91
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,639
attention to that we did at harbor side

92
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,800
was the customer

93
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,559
so the consumer is kind of being left

94
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,719
behind right now if you take a

95
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,400
close look at what's happening in canada

96
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:02,318
and america

97
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,239
the consumers being left behind because

98
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:06,479
we're over regulating and over

99
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,319
taxing cannabis and you're probably

100
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:10,000
going to have that problem in europe at

101
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:11,518
least in the beginning there'll be too

102
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,039
much regulation

103
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,039
and what happens if the price of

104
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:17,919
cannabis goes up

105
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:19,519
so it's hard on the consumer so it's

106
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:20,238
very important that we're nice to the

107
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,560
consumer

108
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,959
that we educate the consumer about

109
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,039
cannabis products that we create a space

110
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,920
that is welcoming

111
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:30,719
for all walks of life and then the third

112
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,878
thing i think

113
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,719
is important to pay attention to is your

114
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:37,518
staff and your team

115
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,400
we worked very hard to create to create

116
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,680
an inclusive

117
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,760
diverse culture we started off in

118
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,760
oakland california which is right across

119
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:47,759
the bay from san francisco this is one

120
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,560
of the most diverse communities in the

121
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:50,318
world

122
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,719
so we had to make sure our staff was

123
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:54,798
diverse and we had to make sure that we

124
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:57,919
were paying attention to

125
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,360
how people work together and we had to

126
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:02,719
create a culture

127
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,640
company culture that focused on those

128
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:06,239
two things i just talked about the plant

129
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:10,559
itself

130
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:12,719
and uh the the the um

131
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,799
the plant itself and of course um the

132
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:18,000
team and of course the customer

133
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,798
so um our culture was about respecting

134
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,399
the plant

135
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:24,079
respecting uh the customer and being

136
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:27,198
good to each other

137
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:29,439
because it's hard work in

138
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,478
selling cannabis in a dispensary there's

139
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:33,918
it's new

140
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:36,478
society has a lot of fear with that

141
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:37,279
and so it's important that when we work

142
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:39,199
together

143
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:40,559
we're treating each other with kindness

144
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,919
and compassion

145
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,079
and we're trying to set a culture in the

146
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:48,478
cannabis industry that's not

147
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:49,279
as brutally transactional as we're

148
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:52,399
seeing in

149
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:54,239
corporate culture and other industries

150
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:56,159
yeah now what i totally agree i think

151
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,360
that separation from corporate grade

152
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,639
into one plan for all people is

153
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,840
something that everybody should be

154
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,038
looking at

155
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:04,799
the next thing that moves kind of

156
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:07,120
swiftly into the next topic first is

157
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,400
enacting social change

158
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,918
what are the tips that you'd give to

159
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:11,599
some of the activists and some of the

160
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:14,799
people trying to uh

161
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,439
attempt this process well i'm thrilled

162
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,319
to see

163
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:20,079
so much activism sort of rising in

164
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,159
europe now

165
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:24,079
for a long time there just wasn't enough

166
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,280
activism happening in europe

167
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:28,000
street grassroots activism i'm talking

168
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:29,758
about

169
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,038
and you know here in america our

170
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,520
tradition with that is

171
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:35,519
maybe a little bit different than it is

172
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:39,519
in europe but i know europe has a

173
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:40,959
very long maybe much longer tradition of

174
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:43,359
course than america

175
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:46,079
in terms of resisting dominant culture

176
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,560
resisting authority and making sure

177
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,918
that justice is served when it comes to

178
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,918
the cannabis plant

179
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:54,240
the most effective thing we did in the

180
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:57,359
united states for activism

181
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,800
was we stopped pointing the camera at

182
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,120
the activist

183
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,560
and we started pointing the camera at

184
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,879
the patients

185
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,639
and once we started pointing the camera

186
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:07,519
at the patients and the kids with

187
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,079
epilepsy

188
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:11,519
and people suffering which i think

189
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:14,159
you're beginning to do

190
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:15,279
that tactic in your but i really

191
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,479
encourage that

192
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:21,599
the stars of cannabis are our patients

193
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:24,159
they are the people that are suffering

194
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,520
and that is the fastest way to enact

195
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,479
change because

196
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:30,159
people don't change through the head you

197
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:32,000
can make all the rational arguments

198
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,520
about cannabis you want to of course

199
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
they're right

200
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:36,560
but it doesn't move people what moves

201
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,079
people

202
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:42,079
is the heart and so when we

203
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:43,599
tell stories that move people in the

204
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:47,038
heart about how

205
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:50,479
good this plant is that's when we change

206
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:51,279
minds and that's when even the political

207
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:54,639
class

208
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:56,399
and the elites that make those decisions

209
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,800
they believe it or not they actually

210
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:01,519
have hearts too

211
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,160
and we can move them as well and and

212
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:03,839
once

213
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,520
you know enough people are moved

214
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:08,239
emotionally

215
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:10,079
that's when we can start getting the

216
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,960
politicians to listen and enact

217
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,879
laws for us yeah i couldn't agree with

218
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:16,239
you more there we had a guest on from

219
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:18,079
new zealand who owns one of the big

220
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,038
companies over there listed on the stock

221
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:22,159
exchange

222
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:24,560
and they recently hadn't uh passed their

223
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,319
legislation for uh legalizing cannabis

224
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,839
and he told me there was because

225
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,560
religious money had come into new

226
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:30,560
zealand

227
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,199
and they had been doing their car crash

228
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,839
and this one guy killed five people 10

229
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,400
years ago

230
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:37,758
and it did that kind of blunt trauma

231
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:38,719
promotion whereas these guys just

232
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,400
focused on

233
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,000
education and the plant is good whereas

234
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:43,038
i think europe needs to stand up and

235
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,639
realize that

236
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:46,560
the other side are going to promote the

237
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,400
most negative possible side of cannabis

238
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,160
they can so we want to promote the

239
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:52,318
positive side what you get is helping

240
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,840
patients changing people's lives

241
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,439
allowing them not to suffer through

242
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:56,399
seizures and whatnot and i think that

243
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:58,240
needs to be the

244
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:00,000
marketing and advertising campaign that

245
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,079
goes across europe

246
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,560
i couldn't agree with you more look the

247
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:06,560
the our the prohibitionists are going to

248
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,680
tell their stories too

249
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,399
and they're going to try to hit people

250
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,360
in the heart

251
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:15,198
just like we are and so when you hear a

252
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,598
story about people dying in a car

253
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,759
accident and they blame it on weed or

254
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:22,000
whatever it might be like that

255
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,759
those are stories too and we're gonna

256
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,959
have to tell our stories

257
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,479
and let the people decide who's telling

258
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:31,839
the truth and who's not

259
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:34,240
okay brilliant um what i'm gonna do is

260
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:35,278
move on to our third topic and again

261
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,719
it's something that

262
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:38,719
i know there's a huge amount of people

263
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,120
in ireland alone trying to get through

264
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,800
to

265
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,479
the various ministers and they're being

266
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,639
completely ignored

267
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,879
the twitter is pretty funny with the

268
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:48,639
poor politicians timelines are getting

269
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:51,200
bombarded by hundreds of people

270
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,080
and the irish population in itself is a

271
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,480
rebellious

272
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,080
country so i i feel sorry for the

273
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,360
politicians over the next coming years

274
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,440
what's going to come at them if they

275
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,800
don't legalize this plan pretty quickly

276
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,320
what are a couple of tips that you'd

277
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:03,039
give to some of the leading activists

278
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,480
that uh

279
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:06,399
how they get political engagement

280
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,120
because it's one thing this being a

281
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,320
business show

282
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,759
you can get pretty good access to

283
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,278
politicians when you're coming at them

284
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:13,679
from a business perspective and

285
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:14,639
a jobs creation perspective so what

286
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,879
would be the other

287
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:18,319
avenues that you pursue or you'd advise

288
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:19,919
people to pursue in terms of getting

289
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,519
political engagement

290
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:23,199
no that's a very good point i probably

291
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,000
shouldn't mention that when we were

292
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,399
talking about

293
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,399
activism a moment ago yes it is

294
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,440
important that we tell the stories of

295
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,039
of patients and we put people through uh

296
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,640
we hit people in the heart but the other

297
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,240
thing that we have to talk about is just

298
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:39,199
the tremendous economic

299
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,360
potential of cannabis and if that is

300
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,920
what is going to move decision makers

301
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,480
and people

302
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:45,278
in power perhaps more than than sick

303
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,680
people

304
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:49,039
well then use that and you know in

305
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:51,838
ireland you have a

306
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:53,278
wonderful tradition of raising hell and

307
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,640
being rebellious

308
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:56,480
you're going to have to keep raising

309
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:58,958
hell and being rebellious

310
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,639
uh with this issue until you hit a

311
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,559
tipping point that's what

312
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:04,399
that's what we had to do in the united

313
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:06,399
states but

314
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,000
here in the united states with

315
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,078
legalization

316
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,839
more jobs are being created in the

317
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:14,239
cannabis industry

318
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,040
than any under any other industry right

319
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,879
now

320
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:19,120
we have more people employed than the

321
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:21,759
coal industry has employed

322
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,360
we have more people in the cannabis more

323
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:26,000
workers in cannabis than we do

324
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,519
electrical engineers

325
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,278
and there are i think

326
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,879
something like a quarter million people

327
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:35,120
employed in cannabis

328
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:36,000
and these are good jobs folks these are

329
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,078
jobs that pay

330
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,159
more than the minimum wage these are

331
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:41,759
jobs that have full health care benefits

332
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:42,559
in america you have to buy your own

333
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:46,078
health care

334
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:47,919
crazy but the employers in the cannabis

335
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:51,519
industry help with that

336
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:54,159
and retirement benefits also um come

337
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,278
with employment in the cannabis industry

338
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:57,679
if you want good

339
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:59,278
paying jobs in ireland you've got to

340
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:02,958
legalize this plan

341
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:07,120
not just for medicine but you farm

342
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:10,239
beautiful in ireland you have a

343
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:13,039
micro climate that is excellent for

344
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,240
industrial hemp and anything that's made

345
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:16,399
out of cotton

346
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,959
anything that's made out of timber

347
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:22,078
anything that's made out of petroleum

348
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:25,359
basically can be made out of hemp

349
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:26,719
and other plants and that's what i would

350
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,600
encourage people to

351
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,240
argue in ireland if the if the

352
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,600
compassionate argument's not working so

353
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:38,799
good the economic uh

354
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,320
um argument can work very well and maybe

355
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:42,078
you need to put some poor people in

356
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,680
front of the camera that

357
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:48,639
or maybe you need to um come to america

358
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:48,958
and film all the economic activity here

359
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:51,360
and

360
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:53,199
interview some of the people whose lives

361
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,000
have been changed who used to work at

362
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,040
amazon in a terrible warehouse now they

363
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,958
work in a

364
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:00,480
job that has meaning for them where they

365
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,078
help people that are sick and they

366
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,200
spread this medicine and they spread

367
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:05,679
this goodness

368
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,759
and they feel really good about their

369
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:09,759
jobs well when people feel good about

370
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:12,799
their jobs what do they do

371
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:13,838
they go out to eat they take better care

372
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:16,639
of their families

373
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,160
they buy nicer clothes they buy nicer

374
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,879
automobiles

375
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:22,480
they build up their life and they create

376
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:25,919
even more economic

377
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,759
activity so the economics of cannabis

378
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:31,199
this is not a new billion dollar

379
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:34,559
industry folks this is a trillion dollar

380
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:37,680
industry and to make it illegal

381
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:41,039
and to turn your back on that is

382
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:43,120
is beyond irresponsible you're robbing

383
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:46,319
the people of their birthright

384
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,759
and it's simply unacceptable for any

385
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,720
politician to do that

386
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:51,600
anywhere the wind is at our backs

387
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,600
ireland

388
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,759
the wind is at your backs even if it

389
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,480
doesn't feel like it you have a whole

390
00:12:55,759 --> 00:13:00,240
global community of people like me that

391
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,519
are cheering you on

392
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,759
and ready to help it any moment's notice

393
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,560
the day will come for ireland and it

394
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:10,240
will be a good day

395
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:11,599
well there you go now everybody it's not

396
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,039
a positive note

397
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,800
we actually couldn't agree with you more

398
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:16,319
we see ireland being the base for europe

399
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:17,439
for a lot of north american companies

400
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,278
we've got a

401
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,360
a good tax rate corporate tax rate we've

402
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:22,559
got a highly skilled young workforce

403
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,480
as you mentioned some of the best

404
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,958
farmers in the world already over here

405
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,039
so

406
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,319
for us to be able to flip in to make it

407
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,919
the the

408
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,760
premium cannabis brand we're never going

409
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:33,120
to be the mass producer like colombia

410
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:34,240
but we can make the guinness and we can

411
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,919
make the kerrygold

412
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,680
and we can make that global product that

413
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:38,159
everybody wants to buy while at the same

414
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:40,159
time

415
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:41,439
selling services to the larger companies

416
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:43,600
who are trying to position in

417
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,120
in europe so it's been an absolute

418
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,040
pleasure talking made i can literally

419
