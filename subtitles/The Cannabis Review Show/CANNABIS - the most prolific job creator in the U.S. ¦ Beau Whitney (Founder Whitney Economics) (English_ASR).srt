12
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:30,239
chance to give an overview of the jobs

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,880
report you recently did there with

14
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,558
legally at the start of the year can you

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,399
basically maybe give everybody a quick

16
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:38,558
little overview of how long the report

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,359
took and the partnership that you guys

18
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:43,280
have had legally since 2019

19
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:46,479
yeah so um

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,439
so previously to 2019

21
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:51,119
um i had been doing job reports um

22
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:53,039
mainly on the oregon market and then a

23
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:54,959
little bit on the u.s market

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,039
um leafly was

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,399
being asked to

26
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,879
opine on the

27
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,759
job potential in the job market

28
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:05,118
um and there wasn't really any data out

29
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:07,759
there so

30
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:10,239
um at one point uh bruce barcott from

31
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,520
leafly reached out to me and we

32
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:15,199
um we started collaborating and so we've

33
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:16,399
uh for the last three years now we've

34
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,520
published

35
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,439
a report in the february time frame and

36
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:22,640
it um covers the previous year's

37
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:25,438
employment

38
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,960
so um yeah it's it's been a great

39
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:28,719
partnership they've got a great team

40
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:31,679
there leafly and

41
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:33,200
and i provided some insights and

42
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,920
now we meet

43
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,079
monthly and talk about what what's going

44
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,400
on in the united states market and

45
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:42,879
and keeps all the data fresh and and

46
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,200
like of my team's really strong as well

47
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:47,438
so it's been a great partnership

48
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,759
yeah i think the key to any industry is

49
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:52,839
the collection of data and the the

50
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:55,599
explanation of that data and the

51
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,520
uh outsourcing of that data to different

52
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:00,078
companies to be able to utilize

53
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:01,840
can you uh tell me one of some of the

54
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:04,158
stats i hear from the report are pretty

55
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,719
crazy that i have to admit so

56
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,759
cannabis in 2021 was the most prolific

57
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:11,680
job creator in the u.s is this correct

58
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:15,039
yeah there was a job created in the

59
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,520
cannabis space once every two minutes

60
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:19,840
and so and you know you asked about how

61
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,120
long this takes it it takes quite a

62
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,280
while so we begin production of this and

63
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,719
and writing and research and we do it

64
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,560
throughout the year but we really

65
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:29,598
concentrate it in the fourth quarter of

66
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,239
each year

67
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,518
and then we do the final analysis at the

68
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,680
end of the year

69
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,000
and then we publish it like i said in

70
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,080
february but some of the numbers were

71
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,560
stunning like there's more

72
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,920
there's more cannabis related jobs in

73
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,120
the united states than there are

74
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:47,598
plumbers

75
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,800
or bank tellers

76
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:52,799
and um in the job creation um like i

77
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,280
said once every two minutes you know

78
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,840
that's 280 a day

79
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,840
um that's pretty significant and it's

80
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,920
one of the fastest growing sectors in

81
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,598
the united states um from an employment

82
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,359
perspective

83
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:08,799
yeah no it is incredible to say as he

84
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:12,319
said 280 jobs a day a 33 increase from

85
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,640
the year previous um do you expect

86
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:16,238
the gains to be in double digits like

87
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:17,839
that for the industry over the coming

88
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,680
years i'm actually over to new york

89
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,759
myself on thursday to go to new jersey

90
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,599
to visit a couple of nearly open

91
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:25,359
facilities so i can only imagine what

92
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:27,119
the eastern seaboard opened up is going

93
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,360
to do to the industry

94
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,480
yeah a lot of the growth um that's very

95
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,080
insightful

96
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,878
a lot of the growth comes from the new

97
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,879
emerging states that are just deploying

98
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:38,959
their cannabis programs

99
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:40,318
and it takes a while for each one of

100
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,759
these programs

101
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:43,919
to capture

102
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:45,679
the illicit consumer and convert them

103
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:46,559
into the legal market

104
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,080
and

105
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,560
once and it takes several years almost

106
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,719
half a decade in order to get

107
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,560
full maximum potential now some of the

108
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:59,039
west coast states in the united states

109
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,039
have already captured a majority of the

110
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:03,840
demand and converted that over into

111
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:06,318
legal space but then where the action is

112
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,640
now is in these new newly deploying

113
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:10,158
states like new york new jersey and

114
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:11,839
elsewhere

115
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:14,318
yeah well i'm a firm believer that new

116
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,680
york has a pretty close relationship to

117
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:17,918
europe just for the amount of people who

118
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,160
travel there just on tourism that i can

119
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:22,399
guarantee your report is going to cover

120
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,560
cannabis tourism when it comes to new

121
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:27,039
york much more prevalently than woodlawn

122
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,959
the let's say the eastern seaboard or

123
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,960
the western seaboard because generally a

124
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:33,039
lot of european people aren't going to

125
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:35,439
go visit the western seaboard for for

126
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,439
tourism whereas new york for a weekend

127
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:40,319
is a huge thing with irish people with

128
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:42,079
uk people so i i think that's going to

129
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,680
drive the industry the fact that i'm

130
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:45,839
going over and thursday i think is an

131
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,040
example that uh there's going to be a

132
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:48,719
number of different other people like

133
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,199
that are curious about the industry and

134
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,400
see what's going to pop up over there

135
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,360
yeah um

136
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:56,799
um and there's not just the advantage of

137
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,879
creating jobs there's all sorts of

138
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,560
economic development and economic

139
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:04,800
potential that is derived from this so

140
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,439
states are now starting to understand

141
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,120
the economic potential of cannabis

142
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:11,680
they're embracing it

143
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,280
and they're deploying it and

144
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,560
now the question is

145
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:16,879
uh will they

146
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,399
mess it up when they deploy it

147
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:20,879
and then have to take years and years

148
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:23,038
and years to fix it or will they

149
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,719
deploy the program successfully out of

150
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:26,079
the gate that's the big question and

151
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,919
there hasn't been

152
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:29,359
any one state quite yet that's got it

153
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:31,439
right

154
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,038
okay i was reading reports so new york

155
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:34,560
we know don't open up really to the

156
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:36,560
autumn it's just kind of all the

157
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,639
planning and acquisitions going on at

158
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,600
the moment but new jersey opened up and

159
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,199
i see that there was a no supply chain

160
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,120
issue that didn't seem to have gone off

161
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,478
for a hitch is there more information

162
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,478
that we are being able to read in the

163
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:50,240
media

164
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:52,879
well yeah

165
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,439
um so i've i've taken a different

166
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:57,199
approach to analyzing these new market

167
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:59,360
deployments and i look at it from a

168
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,520
supply perspective because it seems

169
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,000
every state that deploys a new program

170
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:05,279
runs into a supply chain hiccup be it

171
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,639
from testing

172
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:09,679
from growing

173
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,280
from retail access and like and so i've

174
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,478
been really looking at it from a supply

175
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:15,519
perspective

176
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:17,839
and i've got a an assessment of the

177
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:21,439
entire production of the united states

178
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:23,279
i've done it by i've done it by

179
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,918
um

180
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:28,239
by state and by illicit and legal and

181
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:30,478
indoor and outdoor and greenhouse

182
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,918
and it doesn't surprise me that new

183
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:33,680
jersey

184
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:34,560
was running into some supply chain

185
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,560
issues

186
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,879
they just don't have enough

187
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,160
growing capacity to meet the growing

188
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,639
demand

189
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,720
and this will only be

190
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,160
this will continue for

191
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,400
you know up until the point that they

192
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,439
actually add more growers to the system

193
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:53,038
same thing is going on in new york

194
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:55,199
in new york they don't have enough

195
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:58,560
growers and so they're reaching out to

196
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,800
the hemp growers in the state in order

197
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,879
to backfill some of the

198
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,639
some of the supply gaps um there's

199
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:07,759
another opportunity to

200
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,960
invoke um and implement interstate

201
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,199
commerce

202
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:13,359
um because there's a excess of supply in

203
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,560
california and oregon on the west coast

204
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,720
they could easily handle the demand

205
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,800
on the east coast but

206
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,919
and there's potential agreements in

207
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,919
place

208
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:26,478
um but there hasn't been anything

209
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:28,639
consummated quite yet

210
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:30,719
okay very interesting one of the stats

211
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,759
i've been looking over recently and i'm

212
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,080
sure you're a man who loves this

213
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,720
statistic as much as i do the european

214
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:38,318
versus north american market so we see

215
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,720
that basically there's a lot of money

216
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,240
being made from california new york

217
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,639
looks like it's going to be a big market

218
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,400
so the general size of the north

219
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,038
american market it says at the moment

220
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:52,079
statistic-wise is 368 million covers

221
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:53,839
canada yeah the us and a couple of other

222
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:55,839
smaller territories

223
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:58,399
do you see the

224
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:59,918
the north american companies already

225
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:03,279
starting to pivot towards europe because

226
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:06,159
from statistics it's 747 million in

227
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,918
europe versus the the stats that we have

228
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,000
over in north america

229
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:12,079
do you end up seeing

230
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,680
europe as being the kind of holy grail

231
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:15,598
for a lot of these companies in north

232
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,639
america anyway or is the north american

233
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:18,560
market always going to be able to

234
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,240
dominate just in terms of retail

235
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,399
salesmen

236
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,720
yeah you know i just started well i've

237
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:27,918
got a forecast the total addressable

238
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,000
forecast for every country in the world

239
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:33,278
and europe is

240
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,120
um the fourth largest market

241
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:40,399
by consumer um asia and africa

242
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,240
outpaced north america and europe

243
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,440
but they just haven't deployed any legal

244
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,519
programs um but for a

245
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,680
from a dollar perspective

246
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,159
um europe is the second largest market

247
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:54,958
because they've deployed medical

248
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:56,240
programs throughout now you've got the

249
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:59,359
emergence of

250
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,959
adult use in germany and switzerland and

251
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,839
now they're talking about it in france

252
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:05,759
and italy and elsewhere so yeah there

253
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,560
are some pivots going on

254
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:09,439
the canadians for example

255
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:10,559
um

256
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,680
they

257
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:13,919
uh

258
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:16,079
are looking for new markets because they

259
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:19,120
have excess supply as well

260
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,519
and so they're they're looking into um

261
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,278
forming agreements in into the european

262
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,839
market and elsewhere

263
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:27,200
but it seems like everybody

264
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,720
and their cousin

265
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,120
is looking at the

266
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,120
european market for their salvation

267
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,320
because the u.s market hasn't opened up

268
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:39,120
quite yet and so everybody is pointing

269
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,600
their supply the canadians the asians

270
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,799
africans south americans they're all

271
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,560
gearing up

272
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:49,120
getting eu gmp certified for example gap

273
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:51,359
certified and they're all targeting

274
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,879
their supply towards europe and

275
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,278
i think that

276
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:58,240
if i were to give advice which i have to

277
00:09:55,278 --> 00:10:00,559
suppliers in other on other continents i

278
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,680
would say be very careful about entering

279
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,518
into the

280
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:04,719
into the european market from a business

281
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,480
perspective

282
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,600
because you may see a collapse in

283
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,240
pricing

284
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,800
once all that supply hits the market

285
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,799
and so it's up to the regulators in each

286
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:17,359
individual country

287
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:19,679
to modulate the supply that comes in

288
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,759
otherwise it could really impact the

289
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:23,599
domestic producers and operators in

290
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:25,679
those countries

291
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,360
yeah and i think a lot of the companies

292
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:28,879
seem to misunderstand the amount of

293
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,079
people who are over in europe who are

294
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:32,559
ready to kind of be able to be

295
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:34,639
cultivating and will have operations

296
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:36,159
grow operations themselves and i think

297
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:39,120
europe of all the territories will have

298
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:40,719
that premium flower price i think set in

299
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,519
europe and it won't be a better race to

300
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,680
the bottom in terms of what i can buy x

301
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,839
amount of ounces for a y amount of euros

302
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:50,159
it's going to be have you tasted this

303
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,920
it'll be like a wine category or like a

304
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:53,360
food category people are willing to pay

305
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:54,719
that little bit more for a premium

306
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,839
product

307
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,600
yeah you know that's um you know once

308
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,680
again just like in the united states

309
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,278
there hasn't been a successful

310
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:05,199
deployment out of the gate it's going to

311
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:07,838
take a while for the european countries

312
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,079
to get their legs but i do know that the

313
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,480
policies that i've seen

314
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:14,559
are protectionist policies which is

315
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:18,240
appropriate to protect the domestic

316
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:21,119
market so they favor the local domestic

317
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:24,159
suppliers and operators and cultivators

318
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,320
and then they'll use the foreign

319
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:28,480
suppliers as burst capacity in case

320
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,360
there's more demand that comes in than

321
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:34,720
supply available from the domestic basis

322
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:37,039
so yeah i agree that there's going to be

323
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,240
there's going to be a a good market in

324
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:40,000
europe

325
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,399
and i'm actually going to be speaking in

326
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,639
germany about this in july

327
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,919
i'm at a conference in berlin

328
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:46,958
and we're going to be attending that

329
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:49,360
we're going to be actually interviewing

330
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:50,879
a couple of people alex says

331
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,560
we're going to be talking to alex when

332
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:54,078
we're over there as well so

333
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:55,278
we might be able to do a little quick

334
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:57,519
interview during the summer when we're

335
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:59,759
over there oh i'd love that it'd be i'd

336
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,759
be delighted to see you in person um

337
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:03,519
