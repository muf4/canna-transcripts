00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,118
couple of weeks and has been granting

7
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:18,719
great momentum in the irish cannabis

8
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:19,600
industry and getting some good backing

9
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:21,599
after some

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,439
horrendous actions by the guards in some

talk to you over the last couple of

18
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,280
weeks with all the stuff that's kind of

19
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,440
happened here in ireland

20
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,719
um before we get into all of that kind

21
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,159
of stuff do you want to basically give

22
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,280
everybody just a little overview of the

23
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:44,959
story of little collins

24
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,480
how you guys started and how you got to

25
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,960
where you are now

26
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,319
yes certainly um so basically little

27
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,160
collins is a

28
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,600
it's a family company formed by myself

29
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:56,959
and my wife eda

30
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,280
um we're both health-driven people

31
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,079
we're non-drinkers we're sort of vegans

32
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,399
we

33
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,478
we really um ultimately our store is

34
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,960
pretty simple we we moved from australia

35
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:07,519
to

36
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,959
ireland to start up this business um you

37
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:10,079
know that's 17 and a half thousand

38
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:13,519
kilometers and

39
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:15,118
my wife's irish i'm australian and um

40
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:16,959
we just believe in providing people a

41
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,560
choice so a choice between

42
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:20,158
you know a pharmaceutical product which

43
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,960
is great that everyone can get from the

44
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,520
chemist and

45
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:25,039
and and that's perfect um or a natural

46
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,079
product a natural alternative and that's

47
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,400
what we're here for

48
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:29,519
that wraps in nicely to our overall sort

49
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,240
of life ethos

50
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:33,280
and um here we are we've been open since

51
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:36,478
november 22

52
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,159
2018 and we're into the start of 21

53
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:38,879
we've got the two stores in the online

54
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,079
business so

55
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:43,438
it's great to be here excellent so

56
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:45,359
that's kind of gets everybody up to

57
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:48,158
speed to where we are at the moment

58
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,680
um can you kind of give what has it been

59
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,520
like for you guys over the last couple

60
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,920
of weeks dealing with all this nonsense

61
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:55,679
for those who don't understand the

62
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,799
situation that's happening at the moment

63
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,960
it's because of

64
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,159
legislation difference between ireland

65
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:02,399
and the eu

66
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,840
little collins are selling cbd flair

67
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,478
which is completely

68
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,118
legal under eu law that was passed last

69
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:09,280
december

70
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:10,639
irish law just hasn't caught up with it

71
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,919
what's it been like dealing with this

72
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,279
kind of nonsense now when you're in the

73
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:15,598
right

74
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,640
yeah well owen it's um excuse me one

75
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:19,519
second

76
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:22,318
that's fine it's frustrating um it's

77
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,480
simply frustrating because we

78
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:26,399
we wouldn't have you know we did do our

79
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:26,878
research and we did touch bases with all

80
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,719
the

81
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:30,079
the relevant authorities before opening

82
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:31,759
the business and

83
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,599
i think our solicitor actually summed it

84
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:35,199
up quite well when i first met him after

85
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:36,159
the first raids i said sean you know

86
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:38,238
what's going on

87
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:39,680
it seems like the goal posts have shift

88
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,959
shifted i should say

89
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,760
um and now just to catch people up

90
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,800
the product that we sell is herbal

91
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:48,959
cannabis okay

92
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,959
now excuse my dodgy hand um i injured it

93
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,759
last week it's herbal cannabis

94
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,759
now it has 0.2 or less thc the

95
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:58,479
psychotropic

96
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:00,079
molecule compound in the plant to make

97
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:03,119
it legal in europe

98
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,239
now we provide that as a you know a

99
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,719
natural supplement

100
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,920
um we believe in the natural products it

101
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,239
is legal throughout

102
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:10,958
europe irish ireland is the only member

103
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,439
state

104
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,519
continuing with their kind of aggressive

105
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:18,959
action towards the hemp industry

106
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,480
but the the frustrating thing is that

107
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,920
two and a half years ago for all intents

108
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:23,199
and purposes this stuff was legal in

109
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:25,039
ireland as well because i had

110
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:26,479
conversations and emails with a number

111
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:29,280
of authorities and

112
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:29,919
as the solicitor said you'd hardly be a

113
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,878
criminal

114
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:34,559
if a you moved 17 and a half thousand

115
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:35,359
kilometers off across the wheel to start

116
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,439
your criminal

117
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,680
organization but then b you decided to

118
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,598
tell the police before you did it

119
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,040
because you know that just doesn't make

120
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:44,639
sense and you know after verbal

121
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:46,400
conversations and

122
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,238
and this you know we were assured at the

123
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,158
beginning that that it was legal in

124
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,360
ireland but there is still legislation

125
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,719
to be amended to get

126
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,040
ireland in tune with the european law

127
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,479
european law does sit above irish law in

128
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:59,438
this case there's no doubt in the world

129
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:01,438
so

130
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:03,359
um the fact of that matter is yeah

131
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:05,359
there's a bit to work out but

132
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,720
um yeah that's kind of where it sits at

133
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,920
the moment and it's unfortunate because

134
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:08,560
there's so much potential in the

135
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:10,719
industry

136
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,840
but the irish government does is just

137
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:14,080
lagging behind a little bit in terms of

138
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,798
legislation

139
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,639
yeah it seems a whole ah a whole lot of

140
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,238
pointless exercise for something

141
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,840
that uh everybody knows you're in the

142
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,519
right any lawyer who looks at this

143
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,039
legislation property would be able to in

144
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:26,959
a second or judge

145
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,240
on your side it's just about these guys

146
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:30,000
catching up with

147
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,079
what they're doing and in some ways you

148
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
can understand to a degree if this is a

149
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:34,879
one solve whereas a police just saw a

150
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,918
flower

151
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:38,879
and they don't know the difference

152
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,198
between 0.2 but consistently for it to

153
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:41,918
be

154
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,680
done when they know they're being proved

155
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:45,279
to be wrong seems to be just a fool's

156
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,680
errand at this stage

157
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:49,359
and oh and um i'll just actually go on

158
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,400
there because the the flower itself a

159
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,680
lot of people don't know

160
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:55,198
it's it's hemp but um and in the first

161
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,639
six twelve months we still explain this

162
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,800
to a lot of people and it was very

163
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,160
confusing for us to begin with but

164
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,240
let's just remember that hemp and

165
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,080
cannabis are the same thing

166
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,360
they they really are but it's the

167
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:07,279
difference between

168
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,120
a non-alcoholic beer and an alcoholic

169
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:12,319
beer if you want to really generalize

170
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,759
simple analogy there and hemp the hemp

171
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,918
that is legal in europe is cannabis

172
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,520
sativa l and the whole plant is legal

173
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:19,599
and that's that's what we sell we have a

174
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:22,000
whole plant philosophy and

175
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,600
we would to be honest mate if it was a

176
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,959
situation where over the last two years

177
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,919
we were receiving public health

178
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:27,519
complaints

179
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:30,159
and you know we weren't busy as a

180
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:32,719
company we weren't growing exponentially

181
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,199
the irish public wasn't accepting hemp

182
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,759
cannabis into their lives with

183
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,520
with glee quite frankly if if that

184
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,080
wasn't the situation we'd probably walk

185
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:42,319
away

186
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:44,319
because we'd be like look the products

187
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,079
are you know a bit iffy and uh the

188
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,000
people don't want it and the law's a bit

189
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,399
iffy anyway so we'll just leave it alone

190
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,399
but quite the opposite is true the irish

191
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:53,198
public are screening out for natural

192
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:55,120
alternatives

193
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,240
the the product market fit of cannabis

194
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,280
to ireland is

195
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:02,079
100 symbiotic and um

196
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,679
yeah we just feel like the government

197
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:05,599
aren't being quite

198
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,720
transparent let's say in their

199
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,240
communications

200
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,160
and it's unfortunate that smaller

201
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,439
retailers like ourselves and a bunch of

202
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,400
other retailers who i'm sure you're

203
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:13,918
about to

204
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:16,879
you've mentioned before you might even

205
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:18,478
mention here have been targeted to

206
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:20,240
essentially try and crush the the

207
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,680
grassroots industry that sprung up in

208
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,840
the last two and a half years

209
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,918
that's not fair because the grassroots

210
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:27,439
industry has only one thing in mind

211
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:28,639
and that is to create a cannabis

212
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:29,279
industry in ireland that's good for

213
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,720
everyone

214
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:32,159
we're not trying to send this stuff

215
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,000
overseas we're not trying to siphon

216
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,160
profits overseas we're not doing a b

217
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,279
and c we just want hemp and cannabis to

218
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,120
grow in ireland we want

219
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:40,799
local retailers selling the stuff we

220
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,478
want local farmers growing it

221
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,079
it's as simple as that and we want adult

222
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:46,240
conversations not

223
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:48,159
opaque government that does raids and

224
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,160
then won't even comment it's

225
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,360
absolutely ridiculous it's not a

226
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,680
democracy and

227
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,800
quite frankly they don't even say

228
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,120
anything i mean

229
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,038
where's stephen donnelly does steven

230
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,879
donald talk

231
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:03,439
accepted a few tweets every now and

232
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:06,800
again like where is the guy

233
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:07,120
we sent in 100 copies of the proposal

234
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,199
for

235
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,959
how an industry would look in ireland

236
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,240
and we received replies of pretty much

237
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:14,000
everybody was entered into

238
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,680
and every single one of them directed it

239
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,360
back to stephen donnelly and he's the

240
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,038
only person that we haven't received a

241
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,240
reply from yet so

242
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:23,279
i don't know whether it's lack of

243
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,560
education on his behalf or

244
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:26,559
what it is putting against me

245
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,000
it's yeah like whatever it's a lack of

246
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,840
it's certainly

247
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,038
um it's certainly a lack of speech

248
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,638
that's for sure

249
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:36,159
yeah come here tell me there's a

250
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,280
question on the delta

251
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,199
8 and delta 9. have you seen the huge

252
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:43,038
increase in sales of delta 8 over in the

253
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,319
states where the territories where hemp

254
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:45,279
is legal because they're getting around

255
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,879
the laws

256
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:49,038
i haven't i haven't actually looked into

257
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,240
that mate okay have a look at that so

258
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:52,159
they're basically

259
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,478
delta 8 is basically a synthetic version

260
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,720
of delta 9 thc which is illegal

261
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:58,240
so delta h has now been copied and

262
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,919
they're selling it in any territory

263
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,720
where hemp is legal they're allowed cell

264
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:02,560
delta eight

265
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,039
and it's psychoactive because it's

266
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,120
synthetic yeah

267
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:09,038
so yeah it was just one of those ones i

268
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,478
thought you might have come across just

269
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:12,318
tell me this and tell me tomorrow the

270
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:14,079
industry in 10 years in ireland

271
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,840
how do you see it do you see in 10 years

272
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,120
time full dispensaries on the corners

273
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:19,198
like in california

274
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,759
or do you see it always staying as a

275
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,000
medical and pharmaceutical grade

276
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,598
industry i'll tell you one thing i'll

277
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,759
tell you one thing that will happen

278
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:29,279
and it'll happen to a degree i don't

279
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,639
know what degree but it'll happen to a

280
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:32,158
degree ireland will follow other

281
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,519
countries

282
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:35,439
right ireland will follow other

283
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,679
countries but we are here and the

284
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,440
cannabis community is here in ireland to

285
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,000
make sure that we set our own path to a

286
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,440
degree as well

287
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,759
because there's no point just following

288
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,360
in other countries because let's face it

289
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:47,120
the world's not perfect so let's do our

290
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,720
own thing

291
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,240
how do i see it in 10 years is a very

292
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,600
good question and i told you before the

293
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,039
show that i think of an answer and i

294
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,680
still haven't thought of an answer but

295
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:56,480
um

296
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:57,838
mates it's really hard to say in a

297
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,519
decade from now but

298
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,800
but i will tell you how i'd hope to see

299
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:06,720
it in 10 years we would hope to see

300
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:10,719
a let's say a flourishing and growing

301
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:13,200
irish cannabis industry that is

302
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,000
fully regulated retail for adult use

303
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,000
cannabis so

304
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
over 18s can purchase thc products

305
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,519
there is no reason why in 10 years we

306
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,080
can't have

307
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,679
a large manufacture manufacturing sector

308
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,440
sector in terms of hemp cannabis and

309
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:29,039
cannabis in this country both large

310
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,839
growers and small growers

311
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:33,120
we'd like to see micro markets in

312
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,200
ireland in terms of

313
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,200
not sure if you've seen with the the

314
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,680
breweries you have the large breweries

315
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,278
that

316
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:40,479
you know that pump out a lot of beer

317
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:42,320
like guinness for example and then

318
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,039
you've got a micro brewery scene where

319
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,240
they use

320
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:47,919
select ingredients and you know uh

321
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,600
sort of high quality practices this sort

322
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:50,000
of thing to create a really high quality

323
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,480
quality

324
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,039
product now in australia where i come

325
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,839
from

326
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:56,399
the micro brewery industry has grown

327
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,560
larger

328
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,639
than the you know the main industry

329
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:01,119
because everyone loves the micro beers

330
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:02,319
right

331
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,200
because they're tasty they're made with

332
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,040
good ingredients and etc

333
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,480
the same thing can happen with cannabis

334
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,919
the same thing can definitely happen

335
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,759
with cannabis there's

336
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:14,319
blue sky horizons with cannabis and

337
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:15,200
ireland there's no reason why island

338
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,519
can't have

339
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,040
the next guinness on its hand in ten on

340
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,759
its hands in ten years time but that

341
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:22,000
guinness

342
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:23,200
is a cannabis bud and it's a strain it's

343
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,278
an irish strain

344
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,959
and this country can stamp its place on

345
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:30,639
the international scene

346
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:34,559
but we need people in charge who are

347
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:36,958
brave enough and clever enough to

348
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:39,518
to to lead this kind of new frontier

349
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:39,759
because any frontier is a new frontier

350
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,320
and

351
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:42,958
it's the wild west and although cannabis

352
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,040
was

353
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:47,199
was very legal on this planet just a few

354
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:48,958
hundred years ago and although cannabis

355
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,440
grows freely on the side of the road in

356
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:52,958
places like bhutan and the pigs eat it

357
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,040
there we do live in a state of

358
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:56,958
prohibition and so there is a lot of

359
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:58,559
um there's a lot of bushes to sort of

360
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:00,000
whack through to get to this sort of

361
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:01,919
10-year goal but we can do

362
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,639
it but we need the right people in

363
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:06,240
charge and we need to all be on the same

364
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,240
page we need to all be

365
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,919
um trying to achieve the same thing if

366
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,799
we're not trying to achieve the same

367
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,759
thing

368
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:14,319
um what what will end up being achieved

369
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:17,519
will be

370
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,200
um just a mix and match of everything

371
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,278
and it won't be any good we all need to

372
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,959
be on the same page page and first of

373
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:24,480
all mate the first thing we need to do

374
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:26,399
is the government

375
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,639
need to start communicating with the

376
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,278
industry on the ground it's as simple as

377
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,240
that

378
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:33,838
we're we are now a large company we have

379
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,360
two stores we're opening a store in the

380
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,760
heart of dublin this year

381
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,639
so that's three cannabis dispensaries in

382
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:41,120
ireland

383
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:43,199
before hopefully before the government

384
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,120
can even get the legislators legislation

385
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,360
sorted out make a simple amendment to

386
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,839
the 1977 misuse of drugs

387
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,278
that's not that hard pick up the pen get

388
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,120
it done

389
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:55,519
and we can move forward but obviously

390
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,720
there's a few roadblocks in the way

391
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,278
we feel like we're at a critical

392
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,399
juncture right now at the start of 2021

393
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:03,759
in terms of ireland

394
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,958
and um and cannabis and we urge everyone

395
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:06,958
to continue pushing

396
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:08,399
and to continue speaking and educating

397
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:11,439
about this plant because

398
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,958
the future is bright if we hold them to

399
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,600
account

400
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:16,399
that's what i'm going to say okay very

401
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,159
nice yeah

402
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,600
i think that's it it's all about keeping

403
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:22,240
up the pressure now for everybody in the

404
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,800
industry and realizing that we're very

405
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,039
close to being able to have somewhat of

406
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:27,439
a

407
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:29,599
an assembled legalized industry over

408
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,600
here without going too overboard with

409
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,040
full high thc products there's no need

410
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,680
to go in no it's not

411
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:36,159
just yeah absolutely not you the thc

412
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:38,319
yeah

413
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:40,000
so thc there would need to be a cap in

414
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,079
our opinion there should be a capture at

415
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,919
the beginning at the very least and um

416
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:45,120
yeah we actually set out a few thoughts

417
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:46,159
there on twitter and it's something we

418
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,759
should get on

419
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:49,439
on paper but we've got great people like

420
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:51,519
yourselves of course working hard on all

421
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,000
that sort of thing and geno so um

422
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,519
yeah 100 if it's done safely and um

423
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,120
correctly there's no reason why everyone

424
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,159
can't win but um

425
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,440
but yeah let's let's see yeah no i

426
