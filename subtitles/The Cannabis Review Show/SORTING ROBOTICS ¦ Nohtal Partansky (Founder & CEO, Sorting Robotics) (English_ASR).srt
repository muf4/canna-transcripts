2
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,439
welcome to the next episode of cannabis

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,359
review I'm delighted to be joined this

4
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:16,719
episode by natal pansy who's the founder

5
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:21,358
and CEO at sorting robotics how you

6
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:21,358
keeping today Nel doing all right

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,320
thanks very uh pleasure to speak to you

8
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:29,399
um can you maybe give everybody a quick

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,320
little overview of your company and the

10
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:33,119
position you're and how you ended up

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,480
focusing on the Cannabis

12
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:40,558
industry yeah so um a little overview of

13
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:42,238
the company uh we're uh robotics company

14
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:43,839
that specifically builds robots for

15
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,959
cannabis

16
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:50,280
manufacturers um super high level we

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,120
started uh back in 2018 uh me and one of

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,039
my co-founders were working at Nasa um I

19
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:57,439
was working on a device that's currently

20
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,600
on the surface of Mars producing

21
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:03,399
oxygen uh from the Martian atmosphere

22
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:07,118
and and that was really great and then

23
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:09,320
we wanted to build a company of our own

24
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:10,959
uh and so we built this company coming

25
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,919
straight out of NASA we actually were in

26
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:16,079
e-commerce doing inventory management

27
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:19,240
for your e-commerce Sellers and then

28
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:22,798
2019 T frame we wanted to Pivot the

29
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:25,199
company into a much bigger Market where

30
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,439
we found cannabis as like a a really

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,159
strong opportunity and we love the plant

32
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:35,599
we loved robots so it made a lot of

33
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:38,759
sense so then uh in 2020 we uh sold off

34
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:40,879
the first part of the company and then

35
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,680
uh kind of solely focused on making

36
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:45,239
robots for cannabis

37
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,560
manufacturers and uh launched our first

38
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:50,239
product in

39
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,759
2021 and the That's All She Wrote and

40
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:55,679
now we've kind of built a bunch of

41
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:57,879
things from then and um we we are here

42
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,200
today a super high

43
00:01:57,879 --> 00:02:02,039
level yeah it's been very interesting in

44
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,118
research in your company I've

45
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:05,920
interviewed over 300 different CEOs and

46
00:02:04,118 --> 00:02:07,519
Founders and the one thing everybody's

47
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,640
kind of agreed with that automation is

48
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:12,039
going to be a

49
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:14,958
ma automation is going to be a massive

50
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:17,400
opportunity within the industry the

51
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,000
technology you guys are implementing can

52
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,599
you maybe give everybody a little run

53
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,719
through or what are the current

54
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:25,919
offerings you guys have in terms of

55
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:28,000
Robotics and how they fit with each

56
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:31,799
individual category and

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,639
segment sure uh we've done quite a few

58
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:37,000
different things uh I would say our main

59
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:41,000
focus these days is working on pre-

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,120
rolls so right now we sell kind of every

61
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,919
step in the proll manufacturing chain so

62
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,000
we sell a machine that manufactures

63
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:50,119
pre-rolls kind of packs them whether

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,680
they're pre-rolls or blunts or straight

65
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,959
tubes uh or half Gams or whatever and

66
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,120
then we have another system uh that we

67
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:02,479
invented back in 2021 called the GCO

68
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,480
robot so the GCO robot will inject

69
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:07,399
concentrate down the center of P roll

70
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:11,158
kind of like a like a Twinkie a little

71
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:14,480
bit and uh that will inject them whether

72
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:17,840
it's distillate or you know batter or

73
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:19,919
whether it's rosin and uh that improves

74
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,000
the THC percentage also you know kind of

75
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:25,479
changes the flavor profile of the proll

76
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,759
and then just recently uh we launched

77
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:29,479
something called Stardust which is a

78
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:31,359
system that kefs the outside of PR

79
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:34,119
rolles so what does that mean it means

80
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,239
you take your pre-roll that you have uh

81
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,519
kind of already finished and ready to

82
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:42,920
sell but then now you spray the outside

83
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:46,239
of it with distill it and then uh you

84
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:49,438
coat the KE or you coat the pural with

85
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:52,000
keth or thca Crush diamonds or bubble

86
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:53,479
hash and then it looks like a a fuzzy

87
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,120
pural on the

88
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:59,518
outside and um and then later this year

89
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,239
we'll be selling a uh system that takes

90
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,438
those PR rolls and then kind of decides

91
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:06,759
whether you want to put it uh you know

92
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:09,759
crutch up or crutch down into a tube

93
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:11,158
seals it puts a label on it and then

94
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:16,199
that way we'll have you know every step

95
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:18,358
in the process um for any p on the

96
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:20,359
market yeah and that's uh that's

97
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:23,079
basically our main things we also have

98
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:26,079
what are the types of quantities that

99
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:29,159
you're able to manufacture on an hourly

100
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:31,279
or daily basis we previously interviewed

101
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:35,240
a guest to it seemed to be that they

102
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:36,559
were churning out 100 million cones um

103
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,800
that seems to be a lot of cones what's

104
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,519
the kind of production capacity of the

105
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:46,360
machines uh so on the cone side we have

106
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:50,439
a machine that can do up to 2500 cones

107
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:52,120
an hour and then uh we also have another

108
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:55,800
system that will be able to

109
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,280
do about 1,00 to 1200 cones an hour

110
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,919
where we'll be doing like blunts or

111
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:01,399
cones it's kind of a highly variable

112
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:03,519
option and then on the infusion pieces

113
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:06,638
of the uh

114
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:08,000
setup uh let's see the injection one

115
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,840
we've had customers go all the up to

116
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,240
like 1500 joints per hour and then on

117
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:16,279
the keing side that's around uh so far

118
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:20,000
our max speed has been 1,200 joints per

119
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:23,279
hour so uh some of them are different

120
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,399
speeds depending on the process um yeah

121
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:28,439
that's kind of the

122
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:28,439
approximate speeds and feeds for

123
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,639
that

124
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,520
um when it comes to the technology that

125
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,720
you guys do use obviously you're you're

126
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:43,918
special specializing in robotics at the

127
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,400
moment but the ls of computer vision and

128
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:47,079
some machine learning models is there

129
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:49,439
any other applications I would imagine

130
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:51,240
computer vision in the cultivation world

131
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,719
is something that could be implemented

132
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,720
across the

133
00:05:53,839 --> 00:06:00,038
board uh yeah I mean we've done a bunch

134
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,360
of computer vision before so especially

135
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:05,879
on the cultivation side so we actually

136
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:08,639
first started in the industry making a

137
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:11,120
computer vision powered biomass sorder

138
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,478
this way we could take hand trim and

139
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,280
then separate out all the constituent

140
00:06:13,478 --> 00:06:19,879
parts of hand trim what does that mean

141
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:21,879
it means uh when we got uh large batches

142
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:24,000
of hand trim we could take out all the

143
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:25,800
small buds and then we could take out

144
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,079
all the stems and then we could take all

145
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,720
the leaves separate them into different

146
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:32,839
piles and then we could send the leaves

147
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,400
to get extracted we could throw the

148
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:37,758
stems away to save on taxes and then we

149
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:41,079
could take the buds and sell them for

150
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,960
pre-rolls and uh that was a pretty

151
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:45,318
interesting project because the computer

152
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:48,439
vision had to operate uh and make

153
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:50,598
decisions you know within like 40

154
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:53,959
milliseconds and um we did some more

155
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:56,759
research on that to uh understand if we

156
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:59,799
could even do a phenotype classification

157
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:02,560
and we uh we did pretty well there and

158
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,800
and uh it kind of noticed that at the

159
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,000
moment when we made that so that was one

160
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,840
of the very first things that we made so

161
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,918
about four years ago the Canabis

162
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:14,799
industry was still too new to absorb a

163
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:17,959
technology like that I think these days

164
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:21,560
that'll be a bit more important um but I

165
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:23,560
have seen some computer vision uh on the

166
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:27,319
grower side to kind of like analyze the

167
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:30,000
plants and I I saw one machine that was

168
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:33,919
trying to do computer vision scanning to

169
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,680
see if any uh of the flowers are herming

170
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:37,639
at a very high level otherwise you'd

171
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,120
have to like walk through you know rows

172
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:42,879
of plants and like check for seeds but

173
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:47,158
um there's some kind of like color

174
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:48,199
markers that you can do and do like a um

175
00:07:47,158 --> 00:07:52,279
highs

176
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:54,720
Spectrum uh kind of analysis for the

177
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:57,439
plants to see like if they're kind going

178
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,720
Ary so yeah there's a few applications

179
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,759
especially in the cultivation side just

180
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:05,440
because otherwise you have to absorb

181
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:08,038
every plant and inspect them one by

182
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:09,478
one and what were some of the initial

183
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:11,878
challenges that you face when you're

184
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:14,439
building the robotics is it the hardware

185
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:17,599
or the software side of things which is

186
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:20,439
the biggest headache or are they equally

187
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:24,000
uh difficult things to

188
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:26,560
overcome uh I mean when you're doing

189
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,959
robotics it's not really just like a

190
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,240
hardware and

191
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:33,278
software individ ual approach right

192
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,599
because they got to play nice together

193
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:37,120
so it's not like twice as hard as either

194
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,839
doing one of those independently it's

195
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,080
like three times as hard because it's

196
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:43,800
got to work together right and that like

197
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:47,399
that that interface is always very

198
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:49,479
dicey um I think it just depends on like

199
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:52,480
what the approach is

200
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:54,278
um yeah like

201
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,120
uh for

202
00:08:54,278 --> 00:08:59,879
example the the first system that we

203
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:04,600
built uh the rocus order which was our

204
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:06,399
kind of top level um very first product

205
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,278
into the market not the Cannabis Market

206
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,519
but the the e-commerce

207
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:12,439
Market that one was really difficult

208
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:15,278
because it was both a very complicated

209
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,600
Material Handling problem and then there

210
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:20,240
is some sophisticated computer vision to

211
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,278
recognize things and to make sure that

212
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,720
that was reliable enough that the system

213
00:09:22,278 --> 00:09:26,439
would even be valuable because if the

214
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,399
computer vision wasn't topnotch then it

215
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,880
didn't even matter you know what you did

216
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,839
on the hard

217
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:34,320
side and and that was one of those

218
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:38,000
problems where they were both equally as

219
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:41,440
hard it was just kind of wild um and

220
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,879
then when it came to the uh let's say

221
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,560
the biomass sorder that we made that one

222
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:49,278
was almost completely software side what

223
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:51,319
made it difficult the hardware side was

224
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:53,439
really just like recreating some expired

225
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,160
patents kind of like a waterfall of

226
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,959
Agriculture where like you have a bunch

227
00:09:55,159 --> 00:10:00,159
of material that falls off a ram and

228
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:02,000
then you shoot it with puffs of air

229
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:03,600
uh and that one was very much software

230
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,879
based because there was a lot of timing

231
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,720
involved the computer vision was really

232
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:11,559
complicated and then I guess if you

233
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:13,720
think about uh about go that one was

234
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:15,599
very much a hardware based problem the

235
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,399
software was more just like Control

236
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,040
software um so it's a bit

237
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,159
simplified

238
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:24,958
uh but the the actual like

239
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:28,120
implementation of the Control software

240
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:30,039
and making sure that the hardware was

241
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,799
extremely uniform

242
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:34,919
um extremely well-refined so that way

243
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,278
you could control the dosage of this

244
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:38,360
concentrate into

245
00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:40,000
joints there's like a lot of little

246
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,560
things that you have to get right on the

247
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,440
hardware to make sure it's a consistent

248
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:48,599
uh product and yeah that one definitely

249
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:51,200
took a while and especially because uh

250
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:54,120
concentrates have a very very wide range

251
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,800
of operation and so if your machine

252
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,320
doesn't have the ability to at least

253
00:10:55,799 --> 00:11:02,479
like accept that wide range it's not

254
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:06,079
incredibly useful so we had to we had to

255
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:09,200
make it like very very variable very

256
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:11,559
variable um and that was very much like

257
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,120
a hardware problem for sure so I guess

258
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:16,838
it depends um which part of the value

259
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,919
chain we're kind of going after because

260
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:20,600
sometimes it's less software and

261
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:23,120
sometimes it's more Hardware it's it

262
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,120
just really

263
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:28,440
depends what's the level of skill

264
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,159
required for somebody to work one of

265
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,279
these machines would imagine the dream

266
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:33,679
scenario for you guys is that these

267
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:35,600
machines are dotted in different

268
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:37,919
factories all across the world and are

269
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,440
able to produce X type of quantity is

270
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:42,479
there a special skill set that's

271
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,480
required to work the robots or is it an

272
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,120
easier barrier to entry to hire staff to

273
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,639
manage these

274
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,679
facilities so we have a saying here

275
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:53,039
whenever we design a machine for the

276
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:56,159
Cannabis industry it's we want to make

277
00:11:53,039 --> 00:12:00,240
sure that the machines are able to be

278
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:03,439
operated by someone who um is not

279
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:06,039
sophisticated at all like they haven't

280
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:09,440
they didn't even graduate high school

281
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:12,919
and they're high and so that's kind of

282
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:16,880
our goal like you can be intoxicated and

283
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:18,919
be like 16 years old uh because in many

284
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:21,120
cases the people that are operating the

285
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:24,360
machines they might be migrant workers

286
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:27,278
they might not even speak English and um

287
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,639
in other states they might be coming

288
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:31,039
back from their break where they just

289
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,240
smoke their joint or took like a dab rip

290
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:34,799
and then went back into their

291
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:38,600
manufacturing company to to continue to

292
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:41,240
work and so because of that uh we make

293
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:43,360
the machines themselves be pretty

294
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:45,320
straightforward to operate and even when

295
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,440
we troubleshoot we make it so that if

296
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,959
you just follow the directions they're

297
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,839
pretty straightforward to

298
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:55,198
operate and we also provide this like

299
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,360
pretty robust uh customer support system

300
00:12:55,198 --> 00:12:59,838
like all of our systems ship with a

301
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,399
dedicated slack Channel which is like a

302
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,320
you know internal Tool uh to communicate

303
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:08,320
between

304
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:11,600
teams and that allows us to be you know

305
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:14,720
very very deeply embedded

306
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,440
in um our customers operations of the

307
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,320
machines and we get to see if anything

308
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,079
goes wrong we also have like remote

309
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,480
support as well to see if anything goes

310
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:24,159
wrong we can actually like log into the

311
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:26,680
machine and see the video operations of

312
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:30,000
the Machines working to to debug what

313
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:33,838
happens and so uh

314
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,240
I I specifically made it such that we

315
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,639
don't have to have like some you know

316
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,360
automation technician running the

317
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:42,879
machines because those don't really

318
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:46,320
exist in the Cannabis industry today and

319
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:50,078
um that quality of workers just really

320
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:52,330
just too expensive to make the operation

321
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:53,838
of the machine uh financially

322
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:56,278
[Music]

323
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,959
viable you guys are one of the Premier

324
00:13:56,278 --> 00:13:59,600
technology companies that's innovating

325
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:01,198
in this space what are you looking

326
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,519
forward to seeing the most over the next

327
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:07,078
12 to 24

328
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:09,000
months so specifically for our company I

329
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:12,319
think I would be really I'm really

330
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,198
excited to see when we finally get our

331
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,000
kind of fully automated line all

332
00:14:14,198 --> 00:14:17,679
stitched together it's something we've

333
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,078
been working on for the past couple

334
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:22,679
years to have um you know modular

335
00:14:21,078 --> 00:14:24,958
segments kind of like what I described

336
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:26,679
right now which is all of our products

337
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:28,559
and what we're really working on now is

338
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:30,758
making it so that each one of these

339
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:33,278
segments can be either used

340
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:35,278
independently or you can kind of snug

341
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:37,559
them all together and have a fully

342
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:39,159
automated line where one machine hands

343
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:40,679
off to another machine which hands off

344
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:44,600
to another machine which hands off to

345
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:46,958
another machine and and have that whole

346
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,720
line be able to be operated by one

347
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:51,919
individual and uh I think that'd be

348
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,399
really cool um especially for the three

349
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:55,639
puts that we'll be getting

350
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:56,679
considering the current market size in

351
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:59,639
the different

352
00:14:56,679 --> 00:15:02,399
states uh what I would also like to to

353
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:05,600
see it just uh to help the whole

354
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,519
industry as well as some form of um you

355
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,639
know Federal changes at least in the

356
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,600
United States I think that would be a

357
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:17,120
pretty significant um Boon to the

358
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:19,839
worldwide uh cannabis industry I know um

359
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,959
Europe now finally has Germany who just

360
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,519
approved which they thought they were

361
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:25,719
going to do it last year but now I guess

362
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:26,679
they're doing it this year and um that

363
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,120
sounds like a good thing for the

364
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:32,000
European Union I think once the United

365
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,600
States kind of I don't know figures out

366
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,480
whatever their plan is then we're going

367
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:40,519
to see a significant change globally as

368
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,839
if the reserve currency finds it legal

369
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:44,480
and safe to bank then everyone else

370
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:46,920
should probably find that as

371
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,839
well yeah it's going to be exciting

372
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:51,799
couple years for sure for anybody who

373
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:54,160
