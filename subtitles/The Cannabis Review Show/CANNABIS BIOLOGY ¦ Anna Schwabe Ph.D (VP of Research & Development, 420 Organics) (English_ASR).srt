1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,780
foreign

2
00:00:07,378 --> 00:00:11,518
welcome everybody to the next episode of

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,500
the Cannabis review I am delighted to

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,920
join of this episode by Anna Schwab

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:19,740
who's the VP of orendy at 420 Organics

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,460
and also known as Dr Anubis how are you

7
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:22,459
keeping today Anna

8
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:27,000
I am absolutely fantastic even the

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,019
better for talking to you and do you

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,759
maybe want to give everybody a quick

11
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:31,759
little 60 second overview of

12
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:39,439
420 Organics and your area of expertise

13
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:39,439
uh so I have a PhD

14
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:47,640
in my research was looking at uh

15
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:50,699
genetics and phenotypic diversity in

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,259
cannabis and when after I graduated I

17
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,179
worked for Mile High labs for a short

18
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:57,599
time but then

19
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:59,939
um I got hired by 420 Organics here in

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,239
New Jersey a couple of years ago I've

21
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:06,840
been here for exactly two years now

22
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:09,359
um and we cultivate cannabis so both

23
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:13,500
hemp and marijuana using aquaponic

24
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:16,859
methods which is using fish to

25
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,239
feed the plants and the plants clean the

26
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:20,400
water for the fish and it kind of all

27
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:22,859
goes in this closed loop system and it's

28
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,920
a very elegant and

29
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:28,319
um green method of farming

30
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,280
okay incredible so is one of the first

31
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,099
questions I was going to actually

32
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,680
display in is aquaponics is the nutrient

33
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:36,298
value and the sustainability model of

34
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,280
this far superior than the current

35
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,860
method

36
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,079
it can be it depends so there's a couple

37
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:45,659
of different ways of doing it um if it's

38
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:51,298
done right it definitely can

39
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:54,600
um uh be comparable or Superior to other

40
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:57,840
modern methods but it is also very uh

41
00:01:54,599 --> 00:02:00,059
finicky and delicate because we have bio

42
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,618
filters like we have the fish and we

43
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,659
have a bacteria culture and we have some

44
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:06,540
other things going on anything that goes

45
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:08,819
wrong in the system can just basically

46
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,899
wink it and everything goes wrong so

47
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:13,560
it's really

48
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:15,719
um it's it's uh nuanced and it can be

49
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,280
difficult because you can't just like if

50
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:18,959
the plants need something you can't just

51
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,598
add a bunch of nutrients into the water

52
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,598
because that'll hurt the fish and do

53
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:26,639
other things so it's um very nuanced

54
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:28,500
yeah it seems to be the more complicated

55
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,598
a process the better it can end up being

56
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,580
but like comparing an orchestra to a

57
00:02:30,598 --> 00:02:34,019
guitar a solo there's a head a lot more

58
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,719
that can go wrong with an orchestra if

59
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,760
one person ends up going off just one

60
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:41,818
individual thing can we touch on

61
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:45,479
cannabis biology initially to first to

62
00:02:41,818 --> 00:02:48,479
uh start what is biology

63
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:50,518
the study of life the study of life so

64
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:52,259
for cannabis biology it's the studio of

65
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,360
the life of all the various genetic

66
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:56,280
types of living plants

67
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,080
uh well if you're talking specifically

68
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,199
cannabis biology you're talking about

69
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,840
the life of the cannabis plant so

70
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:06,479
everything from you know seed to

71
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,420
consumption if you're talking about uh

72
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:10,619
consumable cannabis or you know to to

73
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:12,839
products if you're talking about

74
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,900
Industrial Hemp

75
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,300
okay so basically it allows us to

76
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,700
decipher the laws of cannabis and to be

77
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,939
able to enhance in any way shape or form

78
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:25,738
what is the the best is the is the

79
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:28,859
Emerald Triangle in America the best

80
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:31,739
place for naturally occurring cannabis

81
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:34,980
uh many would argue it is in terms of

82
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:37,980
outdoor cultivation because of

83
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:41,518
um the specific like makeup of the soil

84
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:43,318
there the sunlight the elevation it all

85
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,439
just seems to be a perfect

86
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:47,818
storm for cannabis cultivation not

87
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:49,620
unlike you know there's certain regions

88
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:51,780
of France that are really well known for

89
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,280
great cultivation

90
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,799
um so yeah the Emerald Triangle is

91
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,378
really where cannabis seems to do really

92
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:00,480
well in the United States

93
00:03:58,378 --> 00:04:02,878
in regards to the latest paper that

94
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,439
you've put out about THC testing levels

95
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:06,598
do you want to make give everybody a

96
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:09,120
little overview of that paper and the

97
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:11,699
findings that you had from it yeah super

98
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,519
excited this paper was the last um sort

99
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:17,099
of publishable item from my PhD

100
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:18,540
dissertation and I just kind of stumbled

101
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,100
across it while I was doing another

102
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,860
study and we mentioned this in the paper

103
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:26,100
we were looking at uh genetic variation

104
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:28,740
and can people detect differences in the

105
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:31,439
Aromas of cannabis if there's a genetic

106
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:35,759
you know outlier for a certain strain

107
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:38,040
the answer is yes they can uh but when I

108
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,960
purchased those samples I noticed and

109
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,300
then I did the cannabinoid analysis on

110
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:45,659
those samples I noticed that the THC

111
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:48,478
levels seem to be much lower that we

112
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:50,400
tested than were on the labels like I

113
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:52,800
didn't remember buying anything that was

114
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,899
advertised as 12 and so I went back and

115
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,280
checked all the packaging and I was like

116
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:59,099
yeah these are really different numbers

117
00:04:56,279 --> 00:05:01,679
so we expanded the study we did some

118
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:04,680
more shopping and found pretty much

119
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,500
across the board that the numbers on the

120
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,180
package don't match what's inside the

121
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,319
package

122
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,060
um and they're substantially different

123
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:16,379
like

124
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:19,560
um about 23 to 35 percent different

125
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:20,819
which is a big number like it's the you

126
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,560
know if you were to

127
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:24,899
have a beer and it says you know six

128
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,879
percent on the label but there was

129
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:28,978
really 12 in the bottle like that's a

130
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:30,779
big difference in alcohol and the same

131
00:05:28,978 --> 00:05:33,000
sort of thing with you know that the

132
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:34,918
advertising on on cannabis it's quite a

133
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,978
bit different although it's lower not

134
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:40,139
higher and is it comparing basically the

135
00:05:37,978 --> 00:05:43,560
lab testing art cultivation facility

136
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:44,699
compared to post uh let's say processing

137
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,019
where it's gone through a number of

138
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:48,960
machinery and you might have lost some

139
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:51,779
of the trichomes or is it different uh

140
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:54,000
the water moisture doesn't matter the

141
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:56,839
from the start when we tested I mean we

142
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,839
tested the same way that

143
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:03,240
before they put product on the Shelf

144
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:05,459
they test the finished product dried

145
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,560
um and all that and we tested the exact

146
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:10,379
same methods the exact same way that you

147
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,300
would that a Testing Lab would test

148
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:14,519
um using the same methods dried it out

149
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,960
completely like like a testing facility

150
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:19,799
would do I mean there was no difference

151
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:21,899
in the testing methods from testing labs

152
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,400
is this a case now where we already

153
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:24,839
discussed with the previous guests have

154
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:27,000
we got a number of labs that are

155
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:29,638
basically their client is the person

156
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,139
who's getting the results of them so it

157
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,960
would make sense for them to make their

158
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:36,079
client happy and alter the THC content

159
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:39,959
there's multiple

160
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:42,300
points where where people benefit from

161
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:43,818
having higher results so and it all

162
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,680
comes from

163
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:50,280
pricing is basically test it's basically

164
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:52,620
set on THC content and so yes the

165
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:54,418
cultivator has an incentive to get back

166
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,418
higher prices because then they can get

167
00:06:54,418 --> 00:06:59,579
a better price when they sell it and the

168
00:06:57,418 --> 00:07:01,620
labs are sort of incentivized because if

169
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:03,538
they come back with lower numbers

170
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,160
they're going to lose customers because

171
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:06,719
the customer wants the higher value

172
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,960
right

173
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,720
um and the cultivator you know in in in

174
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:14,519
Colorado I mean every state has their

175
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,800
their testing procedures that you're

176
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:18,478
supposed to follow but if you're the

177
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,400
cultivator and you're collecting the

178
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:22,258
samples to take into the lab you could

179
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:25,519
potentially be picking and choosing

180
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:28,139
which uh flowers you take in to get

181
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:30,060
tested so in that case the lab wouldn't

182
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:31,620
be doing anything wrong it could be the

183
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,800
cultivator it's taking in you know the

184
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:36,240
premium flower for testing or if they're

185
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,460
being genuine and taking in a

186
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,379
representative sample you know it could

187
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:42,839
be the lab that is incentivized to to

188
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:44,939
increase those numbers and it you know

189
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:46,439
ultimately it doesn't matter whose fault

190
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:48,719
it is

191
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:50,339
um the thing that matters is that the

192
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,259
thing on the outside of the box doesn't

193
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:54,179
match the inside of the box and so the

194
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:56,280
consumers need to be aware of that and

195
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,500
also probably should stop purchasing

196
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:59,698
cannabis based on the THC number because

197
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,720
that's not a really good way to buy

198
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:03,000
cannabis

199
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,620
yeah I think anybody who's boxing

200
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,360
consumes cannabis now at this stage

201
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,680
doesn't really pay too much attention to

202
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,060
it I think the terpenes and the

203
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,120
flavonoids are getting more attention

204
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,860
than a number on the side of the uh the

205
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,538
packaging well then we have to remember

206
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,060
that not everybody is at the same place

207
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:19,500
in their cannabis you know Journey so

208
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:22,019
there are still people who are just

209
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:25,019
starting out just trying it and those

210
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:27,299
people don't realize that THC is not a

211
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:29,339
good way to judge quality whereas you

212
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,139
know more seasoned consumers of course

213
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:32,759
they know that THC doesn't mean anything

214
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:34,560
but we have to remember not everybody's

215
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:37,019
not everybody's the same not everybody

216
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:39,119
knows the same stuff

217
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:41,098
next topic I wanted to talk about an

218
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,099
area you're an expert in is genetic and

219
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:46,620
phenotypic variations can you explain

220
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:48,600
what a genetic variation is and what a

221
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:50,399
phenotypic variation is for there for

222
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,639
anybody who doesn't understand either

223
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,919
so your genetic so your your phenotype

224
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:57,539
with your observable characteristics so

225
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:59,778
what you look like and so in the case of

226
00:08:57,539 --> 00:09:03,778
cannabis that would be growth morphology

227
00:08:59,778 --> 00:09:06,720
cannabinoids terpenes uh big uh fluffy

228
00:09:03,778 --> 00:09:09,419
Buds versus dense no

229
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,060
um compact buds anything that you can

230
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:14,879
observe either but visually or or

231
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:18,179
through your senses is considered your

232
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:20,639
phenotype and your phenotype is dictated

233
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:23,278
by your genotype your genetic makeup so

234
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:25,500
your DNA your genes what you inherited

235
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:28,439
from your mom and your dad as well as

236
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:31,259
the environment so we don't really know

237
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,600
the impact how much of the how much the

238
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:35,580
environment impacts cannabis

239
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,259
uh that has yet to be determined but

240
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:40,680
from my research I found that it

241
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:44,580
environment has quite a bit of impact on

242
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:45,899
the final product so if a grower has

243
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:49,080
different methods uses different

244
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:52,440
watering and nutrient regimes

245
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:54,120
um you know indoor versus outdoor

246
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,339
um cultivating the flower at different

247
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,379
times so is it completely mature is it a

248
00:09:56,339 --> 00:10:00,620
little bit immature and then also what

249
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:03,899
happens after cultivation so the drying

250
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:05,820
hearing time to sail all of those things

251
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:07,500
are going to alter what you what you

252
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,440
ultimately consume at the end of the

253
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:12,720
road

254
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,120
okay incredible very interesting in

255
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,980
terms of the the future of cultivation

256
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,659
that you see in New Jersey obviously we

257
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,519
know that in the last year so you guys

258
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:24,480
came online what is it year and a half

259
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:27,419
that New Jersey became uh yeah it was it

260
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,639
well it was last year on four I think it

261
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:31,939
was 21 they sort of I

262
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:31,939
uh

263
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:35,639
they didn't and I don't know if that was

264
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:39,240
like what they didn't want to open on

265
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:41,819
420 but yes it's been a year since uh

266
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,940
adult use cannabis as a you know in

267
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:46,440
addition to Medical has come online

268
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:50,339
however the process of getting people

269
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:52,079
licensed has been relatively slow and at

270
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:54,779
the moment most of the people who have

271
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:57,539
licenses to sell uh recreational to

272
00:10:54,778 --> 00:10:59,220
adult use cannabis is limited to The

273
00:10:57,539 --> 00:11:00,719
multi-state Operators who are already

274
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,180
here operating in the medical space

275
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,100
which is not at all what New Jersey set

276
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:06,958
out to do but it's what has ended up

277
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,579
happening and so there aren't really a

278
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:11,759
lot of mom and pop shops yet that are up

279
00:11:08,578 --> 00:11:13,679
and running but uh we are one of those

280
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:16,620
um that is now building out our facility

281
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:17,399
with our conditional license that we

282
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,639
have

283
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:22,379
so yeah it's slow yeah it seems to be

284
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,059
the east coast of America seems to be

285
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:25,559
the kind of the new darling of the

286
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:26,518
industry at the moment and it's going to

287
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:28,500
be interesting it's probably going to

288
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:30,120
take a number of years before the

289
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,100
certain brands and the certain leaders

290
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,480
come to the fore and you've got a the

291
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,100
ability to tell the difference because

292
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,720
it seems to me it's one of the only

293
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,220
indices that anybody's got a bit of

294
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,740
money can just jump out into straight

295
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:42,600
away and yeah slowly realize that people

296
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,879
like yourself with the area of expertise

297
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,639
that you guys have are what you need to

298
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:50,338
make these businesses successful so it's

299
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:52,559
uh it'd be very interesting to see do

300
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:54,060
you what is your overview of the Eastern

301
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:55,859
Seaboard of America at the moment there

302
00:11:54,059 --> 00:11:57,299
any companies that you think are yet

303
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:00,060
these are going to be long term around

304
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:03,379
or is it dominated by large Capital at

305
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:03,379
the moment you know I really

306
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,339
and I'm not a business person so I

307
00:12:09,419 --> 00:12:13,199
really don't keep a lot of eyes on the

308
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:15,300
business end of the whole cannabis

309
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,300
industry like I'm really science focused

310
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:19,979
and you know uh doing boring things like

311
00:12:18,299 --> 00:12:22,699
writing grants to try and get money and

312
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,700
stuff like that

313
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:29,879
has anybody ever done a trial playing

314
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:32,220
music to cannabis as it grows and seeing

315
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:33,480
the variations that comes out of it

316
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:36,000
you know I don't know that there's

317
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,680
anything published out there I do know

318
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,360
um of one really talented grower and

319
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:43,620
he's actually up in Canada but he

320
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:46,379
consistently has uh music typed into his

321
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:49,200
um plant rooms and it's always some sort

322
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:50,820
of um some form of Reggae so you know

323
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,278
like there's some techno reggae and

324
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:55,200
traditional reggae and he his plants are

325
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:57,360
phenomenal I can't say that it's his

326
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,600
music that's making the plants grow so

327
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,700
well or his particular method of growing

328
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,200
um but there's no but yeah there are

329
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:08,160
some studies that suggest that music

330
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:10,980
helps but if we and I've had I've had

331
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:13,199
discussions about this if we think about

332
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:15,120
you know plants don't have ears but they

333
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,839
can potentially

334
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,000
um

335
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,339
sort of gather information about the

336
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,339
world around them when it when a seed is

337
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:25,200
ready to germinate if there's no nothing

338
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:27,060
going on if there's no water running if

339
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,399
there's no animals scurrying around if

340
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:31,379
there's no trees you know rustling

341
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:33,480
blowing in the wind then it's probably

342
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:35,338
not a great place to germinate and so

343
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,440
maybe that's not a good place for the

344
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:39,959
big to put all its effort into growing

345
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,720
if there's nothing around so I feel like

346
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:46,559
the plants are responding to the

347
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,660
environment to the vibrations and things

348
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:51,419
like that because it indicates a healthy

349
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:54,240
environment for the plants to grow

350
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:55,979
that's my theory interesting I would

351
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,620
imagine that music is vibrations and

352
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:01,500
vibrations would trigger any sort of uh

353
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:03,419
uh activity in something that would be

354
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,740
there to sense vibrations but you'll

355
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:06,719
have to keep your ears to the ground I

356
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,519
mean you can let me know if you hear of

357
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,160
anybody who's doing any such study like

358
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:12,179
this there wasn't a MythBusters about

359
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:13,319
the base setup I think it was five

360
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:15,000
greenhouses

361
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,600
the plants did not

362
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,578
music yeah you'd like heavy metal which

363
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,500
was kind of surprising

364
00:14:20,578 --> 00:14:24,120
um they didn't like nothing so they

365
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,958
didn't like the silent room but the

366
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,339
other kinds of me I think there's

367
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:28,559
classical they did fine with classical

368
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:31,200
music they did fine with heavy metal and

369
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:32,879
like rock and roll was fine too so I do

370
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:36,120
think it kind of matters like what the

371
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:37,740
vibrations are but you know

372
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,100
um don't play country and western for

373
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:42,000
your appointments they don't like it

374
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,560
tell me just a couple of questions

375
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,440
before you go what is your favorite

376
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:49,979
consumption method food inhalation or

377
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,579
have you got a different one I

378
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,560
um

379
00:14:50,578 --> 00:14:54,899
I prefer

380
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,939
and uh but I'm not I'm not a heavy

381
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:59,278
consumer and I don't really enjoy a lot

382
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:03,240
of THC I like to

383
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:05,278
have more CBD with just a segment of TAC

384
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:09,299
or other cannabinoids I'm calling

385
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:10,139
dabbling with a thcv right now

386
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:12,419
um

387
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:15,778
which is um it's supposed to be good for

388
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:18,778
like your metabolism and stuff why not

389
00:15:15,778 --> 00:15:21,539
um and then you know if if I have like I

390
00:15:18,778 --> 00:15:23,820
threw my back out once and I it hurts so

391
00:15:21,539 --> 00:15:26,578
bad that I just I was like I'm gonna

392
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:28,260
smoke some CBD and it kicked it and it

393
00:15:26,578 --> 00:15:29,819
kicked it in the butt like right away

394
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:32,519
within a couple of minutes my back felt

395
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:34,379
fine so it I think it just depends on

396
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:36,419
you know what I'm

397
00:15:34,379 --> 00:15:37,980
what I'm looking to do with my life at

398
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:39,899
that point in time do I want to go to

399
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,459
sleep am I looking to you know alleviate

400
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:44,100
some pain

401
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:47,039
um so but yeah normally I I I'm a I'm an

402
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:49,320
eater yeah yeah I know I love a few

403
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:51,659
Edibles myself is there a favorite place

404
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,339
in America that you like to consume or

405
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:55,198
is New Jersey your home and that's the

406
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:57,660
one that you you like the most

407
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:59,578
well you know I lived in Colorado for

408
00:15:57,659 --> 00:16:02,219
over 30 years and I I Thought I Loved

409
00:15:59,578 --> 00:16:04,500
Colorado but I did live on the plains in

410
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,940
a cow town called Greely you know when

411
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,159
people think of coloradans they think of

412
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:10,199
mountains and Aspen and you know that's

413
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:11,759
not where I lived which is really funny

414
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:13,439
because I moved to New Jersey where

415
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,480
everybody thinks you know New Jersey's

416
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,760
this armpit of America and it's you know

417
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:20,579
you know a lot of industrial like

418
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,899
concrete smoke smelly

419
00:16:20,578 --> 00:16:23,578
um but I live in a really really

420
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:25,799
beautiful part of New Jersey I live

421
00:16:23,578 --> 00:16:28,138
Between the Ocean and the forest and

422
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:31,259
it's just incredible like the wildlife

423
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:33,180

424
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:35,399
really am liking New Jersey I have not

425
00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:37,138

New Jersey which is where I hear the

427
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:41,339

um everything's like an airway New York

431
00:16:45,659 --> 00:16:48,958
City is an hour away Atlantic City is an

432
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:51,379
hour away Philadelphia is an hour away

433
