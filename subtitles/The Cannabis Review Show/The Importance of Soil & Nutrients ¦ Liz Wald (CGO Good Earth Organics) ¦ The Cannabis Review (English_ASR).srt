00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:26,879

00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:28,959
people are going to be

13
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:31,038
focusing on a lot more and more is the

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,558
soil and nutrients part of cannabis

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,800
i think we're going to start things off

16
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,280
you've had a pretty uh stellar career to

17
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:36,959
date

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,719
and haven't worked at a number of global

19
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,079
companies that are an expert in

20
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,759
multitude of fields do you want to give

21
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,439
everybody a little overview quickly of

22
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:45,119
how you got from

23
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,119
the business world to the cannabis world

24
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,599
real quick yeah sure

25
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:52,718
so i was fortunate to go to business

26
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,320
school from 1993 to 1995 and when i got

27
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,480
out the internet was really

28
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,480
just becoming a platform for commerce

29
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:02,000
and i thought hey this is going to be

30
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,399
new and fun and exciting i'm going to

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,280
jump into the e-commerce game and

32
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,280
um i was uh ended up doing some

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,799
consulting to aol and the you've got

34
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,400
mail days when we all got

35
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,240
you know magazines in the mail with

36
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,680
cd-roms that we would put into our

37
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:17,039
computers to get it

38
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,040
and then you know hook up to the

39
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,600
internet with dial-up um

40
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,720
and so i spent about 25 years in that

41
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:26,000
emerging then

42
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:28,319
industry and um was at some amazing

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,118
places you know like etsy and indiegogo

44
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,478
and just

45
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:33,280
really fun opportunities building global

46
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:36,319
businesses

47
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,159
um and then i you know was like hey i'm

48
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:40,959
kind of ready to look at something new

49
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,240
and being in new york cannabis was

50
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:44,319
something that was happening out in

51
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:46,078
california and colorado but it really

52
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:48,000
wasn't happening here

53
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:49,279
on the east coast but people were

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,560
starting to talk about it it was

55
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,239
bubbling up

56
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,680
and i thought you know this is going to

57
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:55,438
be a really fun

58
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,118
industry to be in and it's going to be

59
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:58,959
disruptive the way the internet was

60
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:01,280
disruptive because

61
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:02,478
cannabis touches everything from you

62
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,680
know agriculture

63
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:10,080
to restaurants to product development

64
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,800
branding pharma i mean just so many

65
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,879
different things

66
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,640
and so i thought hey i need to i need to

67
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:16,560
learn about this and

68
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:17,839
through doing that and networking and

69
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,840
meeting some interesting people and

70
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,598
doing a little bit of angel investing i

71
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,598
i found my way to good earth organics

72
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:26,639
well that's an amazing story yeah so

73
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:28,159
you're going to be able to provide a

74
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:29,919
wealth of information for the viewers

75
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:31,519
today on this episode

76
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:32,639
and let's kick off basically with the

77
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,080
great news from yesterday we were

78
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,479
talking just before we went live there

79
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,239
with new york going legal on the wreck

80
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,318
tell us as much as you know about that

81
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,480
to help us get our

82
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:44,238
information on that process well it's

83
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:45,598
it's super exciting i mean

84
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,519
you know people have been pushing for

85
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:50,719
recreational cannabis here in new york

86
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,400
for many years and um it's uh

87
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,479
it's finally gonna happen we're we're

88
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,680
super excited uh it'll probably take a

89
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:56,719
you know a bit of time for it to

90
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,879
actually come to life

91
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,479
but there were a couple of bills that

92
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:03,039
were um

93
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,399
proposed and one of them was called the

94
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:06,400
mrta

95
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,120
um and and that one was really being

96
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,120
proposed by proponents of social equity

97
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,719
and ensuring that a lot of the tax

98
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,080
revenue was going to go back into the

99
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,318
communities that

100
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,319
had really been dis proportionally

101
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:19,518
affected by the war on drugs over the

102
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:21,598
years and the like and then there was

103
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,200
another bill the crta

104
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,119
one with leading with cannabis and one

105
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:26,079
leaving with marijuana but essentially

106
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,120
the same letters

107
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,159
um that was you know really much more of

108
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,080
centralized control and the like and and

109
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:35,359
over the last couple of years one of the

110
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,840
reasons that

111
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,680
cannabis had not become legal despite

112
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,120
lots of popular support and even

113
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,040
legislative support

114
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,719
was this battle between the two bills

115
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:46,400
and it was great to see that they

116
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:47,680
finally worked it out and many of the

117
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,480
social justice

118
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,480
issues are going to be addressed and

119
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:54,959
there's going to be representation

120
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:56,959
um on sort of the committees that make

121
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,319
the decisions and set the laws and the

122
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,878
regulations so

123
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:02,639
i think overall no bill is ever perfect

124
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:04,079
but i think people are pretty excited

125
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:05,279
about what's going to be happening here

126
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,879
in new york

127
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,560
yeah i think one of new york's one of

128
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:10,239
the cities that ireland has close to its

129
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,080
heart so whatever goes on there where i

130
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,680
was very interested and known about it

131
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,319
absolutely and the people who travel

132
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,239
there so

133
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:18,478
i think next christmas or the christmas

134
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,798
after that should be an enjoyable uh

135
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,159
little uh shopping trip there yeah and i

136
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,679
think you know they're estimating

137
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,479
something like a four billion dollar

138
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,160
market and

139
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:30,959
you know i think the the um uh

140
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,759
legacy market as as we might call it uh

141
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:33,599
here

142
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,879
um other people might call it the

143
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,160
illicit market

144
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:38,319
is probably three or four billion

145
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:42,000
dollars already as it is so this is a

146
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:43,839
huge huge opportunity um

147
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,439
and not just in you know the city of new

148
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:47,198
york where you've got your 8 million

149
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,079
people and and all the tourists that

150
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,240
come but

151
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,839
upstate new york where a lot of

152
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,040
agriculture has grown

153
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,918
you know the us is still in this crazy

154
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,400
state-by-state patchwork of laws

155
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:02,000
and uh it could even be that we have 50

156
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:04,000
states legal and still not

157
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,680
federal legalization the way things are

158
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,360
going you know um

159
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,800
we think it's going to provide a lot of

160
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,879
jobs and opportunities

161
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,560
upstate in the more rural parts of new

162
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:15,918
york new york state is a

163
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,918
huge state with lots of open space once

164
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:21,038
you get kind of out of the uh

165
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:22,399
five boroughs of manhattan yeah now a

166
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:24,159
pleasure living in new york for two

167
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:25,839
years so it's most people think it's

168
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,240
just those fibers and then you kind of

169
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:28,239
can

170
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,840
realize the size of whole territory

171
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,800
let's kick on to the start of the show

172
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,359
and the first topic

173
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,960
is the story of good earth organics most

174
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,600
people might not have heard of you guys

175
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,038
yet but

176
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,960
those in the know will have already

177
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,639
known about the surge of business you

178
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:43,439
guys have happened over the last while

179
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,038
can you inform everybody about good good

180
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:46,160
organics and how you get it and your

181
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:48,719
story

182
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,720
sure so good earth organics is a

183
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,360
manufacturer and distributor of

184
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,320
premium organic soils and soil

185
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,240
amendments

186
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,240
uh soil amendments or sort of nutrients

187
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,000
and things you would add to your soil

188
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,360
and what most people don't realize is

189
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,879
that soil isn't

190
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,280
dirt you know it isn't the stuff that's

191
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:08,159
out in your backyard or in a park

192
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:10,959
um it's really made of ingredients like

193
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,919
coco coir and peat and compost and

194
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:15,918
and lots of organic uh nutrients of the

195
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:16,719
type that we add to our soil that might

196
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:19,918
come from

197
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,520
fish meal or bat guano or sea guano or

198
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:25,198
things like that and

199
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:28,639
about 12 or 13 years ago a gentleman

200
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:32,879
named roy leon who was a retired chemist

201
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:34,319
moved to this area in southern oregon

202
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:36,000
that is part of what is called the

203
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,319
emerald triangle and this emerald

204
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,199
triangle area is kind of southern oregon

205
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,840
down to

206
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,759
northern california and it's where i

207
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:45,119
call it sort of the napa valley of weed

208
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,080
because some of the best

209
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,079
outdoor cannabis is grown that the

210
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:52,000
terroir is great you know

211
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:53,439
everything about the air the soil the

212
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,519
humidity the

213
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,360
the rainfall everything in this area is

214
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:59,839
really conducive to growing

215
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,479
tremendous cannabis and this retired

216
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,279
chemist

217
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:05,120
moves to this area and you know he

218
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:07,119
starts talking to local people and

219
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,160
they're really interested in having a

220
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,959
soil

221
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,039
that will be optimized for really

222
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:13,839
terrific cannabis growth but also be

223
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:15,439
very clean

224
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:17,439
not have to use pesticides and

225
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:18,319
herbicides and you know all these

226
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,199
different kind of

227
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,840
chemical uh things that are that are not

228
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,680
natural

229
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:25,198
and that you know can leave residue and

230
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,240
what not in the plant

231
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,520
so over a few years he worked with these

232
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,680
local growers

233
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:32,879
to create what is now good earth

234
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,038
organics and our

235
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:39,918
core soil blends um and we've got now

236
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:41,680
sort of three main soil blends that are

237
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:44,159
can be used whether you're doing indoor

238
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,879
or outdoor or you're starting with a

239
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,840
seed

240
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,280
or you're starting with a clone um and

241
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:52,000
and they're kind of optimized for

242
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:53,359
different stages and styles of growth

243
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,120
and then we've added a bunch of

244
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,400
amendments and things to help those

245
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,360
things grow but

246
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:01,519
being from this you know historically

247
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,520
amazing growing area

248
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:04,878
where you know it's been legal in oregon

249
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:06,560
for several years um

250
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,879
but the people been growing cannabis in

251
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,639
this area for decades right so

252
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,879
there's a there's a lot of history to

253
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,720
learn from and he took his background

254
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,759
and married it up with the growers to

255
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,120
create this

256
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:22,639
really wonderful totally organic product

257
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,918
that's optimized for cannabis amazing i

258
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,598
think you covered the next topic as well

259
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:26,079
the importance of soil and nutrients for

260
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:29,038
everybody

261
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:30,719
as well it's a it's so important uh for

262
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:33,278
the process of

263
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,959
getting a good plant to it is sufficient

264
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:36,639
either cannabinoids or terpenes or

265
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,239
flavonoids whatever it is your objective

266
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:40,879
is with the plant to get

267
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,599
how do you see the growth for um the

268
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:43,838
market

269
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,440
in the us for homegrown i don't think

270
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,959
it's even really touched

271
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,920
a a a major part of that yet would you

272
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:52,079
agree

273
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,079
yeah no i think home grows really i mean

274
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,120
if cannabis it's in its infancy

275
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,519
homegrown grow is still you know in the

276
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,120
womb

277
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,560
so to speak like it's really really

278
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,120
early um

279
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:05,199
but i think you know plants are like

280
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,679
people whatever you put in a person

281
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,640
you know really affects how you perform

282
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:11,039
right you know

283
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,639
this excellent you know amazing athletes

284
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:14,000
don't eat a bunch of junk food they eat

285
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:16,000
high quality food and

286
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,360
plants are the same way you know they're

287
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,879
going to take out of the ground

288
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:23,120
whatever's in the ground

289
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:25,919
so having really rich nutrient-rich soil

290
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,240
is super important and the other thing

291
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:29,679
is

292
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,919
cannabis is highly tested you know home

293
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:32,799
growers are often growing for medical

294
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:36,319
reasons

295
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:39,759
and many cannabis users are growing

296
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,278
or are consuming cannabis for medicinal

297
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:43,120
purposes

298
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:46,240
and it's really important like if you're

299
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,720
a cancer survivor and you don't have

300
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,480
and you're taking cannabis to say help

301
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,519
with the chemotherapy or something like

302
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,560
that

303
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,000
you don't want a whole bunch of

304
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,958
chemicals in there that are going to

305
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,080
interfere with

306
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:58,958
whatever it is that your the medicines

307
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,120
that you're on

308
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,239
and i think home growers also they just

309
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,278
want a really pure

310
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,959
clean plant and so knowing that

311
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:08,399
whatever they're putting their plant in

312
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:11,278
is going to be pure and clean

313
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,480
is really going to help them um feel

314
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:15,120
confident

315
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,240
about their cannabis and the testing at

316
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,120
the state levels

317
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,959
is only getting more and more um extreme

318
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,600
like they're really able to find

319
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:24,958
particulates and contaminants and small

320
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,519
things in the soil

321
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:29,199
so it's becoming you know mandatory in

322
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,440
way for growers

323
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,440
to to just ensure that they're not going

324
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,800
to be not be failing those tests

325
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,959
it's such a huge financial hit

326
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:40,958
if you if your cannabis doesn't pass the

327
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:42,958
test you can't sell it you know that

328
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:45,359
that that's a major problem

329
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,639
so more and more and more growers are

330
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,839
moving to 100

331
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:52,078
organic just to kind of ensure um

332
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,600
consistency of their crops as well as

333
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:55,519
the high yield and all the things that

334
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,600
you mentioned the terpenes and

335
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,440
and the cannabinoids and whatnot but

336
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,120
just not failing the test is a big

337
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:05,040
is a big hurdle as well okay amazing and

338
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,120
do you see in terms of the market growth

339
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:09,278
for you guys do you see people buying

340
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,560
individual pots that just have the soil

341
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:12,240
in them and then they get to put the

342
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:13,759
seeds and what's the process exactly

343
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,159
could you describe to me for

344
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:18,000
a consumer who wants to grow let's say

345
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:20,480
four plants at home we saw new york as

346
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,159
legalized grow at home laws so

347
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,159
if you want to grow four plants at home

348
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:25,278
is there going to be a a range of

349
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:28,159
different sized pots

350
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:29,679
is there going to be individual how are

351
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:31,199
you guys going to target the exact

352
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:32,479
consumer audience so

353
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,000
i think we're going to see a couple

354
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,440
different things i think there's people

355
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,320
who are going to

356
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,800
you know they're not going to

357
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,680
necessarily want to start from

358
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:42,000
one seed they're going to go down to a

359
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:44,479
to

360
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,879
um a legal grow and they're going to buy

361
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,680
a a small plant that's already been

362
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:50,559
started

363
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:52,319
that they already know okay this is the

364
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:53,838
strain that i'm buying that

365
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,000
you know they're they're going to have a

366
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:59,279
little bit of a starting point and

367
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,958
um and those folks are

368
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:03,759
you know they're we're going to be able

369
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:05,278
to provide them both soil and nutrients

370
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:07,278
that they can use

371
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:09,600
throughout different stages of that

372
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:12,799
plant's growth

373
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:16,240
i think sort of the all-in-one kit

374
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:17,039
idea is is you know it's it i think once

375
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,560
you're kind of

376
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:22,319
past the the most novice like i've never

377
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:24,000
grown anything in my life i think people

378
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,160
will do their research and

379
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,159
they'll want to do a quality product and

380
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:30,639
if they're going to grow this cannabis

381
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:32,319
i think people will be willing to invest

382
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,159
in good ingredients and

383
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,519
you know you're there in ireland so i'll

384
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:38,480
make a beer analogy

385
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,399
um that uh you know if you're gonna make

386
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,839
your own beer at home

387
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,519
you're not gonna buy the cheapest

388
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,720
ingredients and make like

389
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,560
uh you know a watered-down lager

390
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,480
you're probably gonna say hey i want to

391
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:53,518
get really great hops and

392
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,959
and i want to have my malt be a premium

393
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,560
malt and i'm going to brew

394
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:58,559
something that's going to be rich and

395
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:00,799
flavorful and unique and all that

396
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:01,599
and i think we'll see the same kind of

397
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:05,039
approach in

398
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:07,278
in the homegrow cannabis also i think

399
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:10,719
people who don't live in a city

400
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:12,480
you know uh home grow for people who

401
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,000
have access to outdoors

402
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,240
i mean these plants are the size of

403
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,399
trees you know they're six feet tall

404
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,360
right and so it's a very different thing

405
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:23,839
than kind of a window box with the

406
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,360
where you grow your you know oregano and

407
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,560
basil and whatnot

408
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,079
yeah yeah no i i couldn't agree tomorrow

409
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:32,319
lastly what are your hopes for the

410
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:33,519
industry over the next 12 to 24 months

411
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,040
have you got any uh

412
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,159
things that you'd love to see happen and

413
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:40,078
get escalated quickly

414
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:41,919
yeah sure i mean short of like hey

415
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:45,039
federal legalization let's

416
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:45,919
you know remove the magic wand and get

417
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:47,360
that done

418
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:49,278
i think there's some steps that would

419
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,759
really help the industry lots of people

420
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:54,078
talk about the safe banking act

421
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:55,120
which um you know in a nutshell would

422
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:57,838
allow

423
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,440
um federally chartered banks you know

424
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,120
the big banks everyone's heard of

425
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,519
citibank wells fargo

426
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,959
chase these kinds of banks to directly

427
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,679
bank the industry

428
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:08,559
um and right now there's a it's very

429
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:11,838
challenging

430
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:13,198
for cannabis companies that actually

431
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,959
touch the plant

432
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:16,799
you know we're a soil company we you

433
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:17,439
know we can bank at wells fargo or

434
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:19,359
wherever

435
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,040
you know without too much challenge

436
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,680
because we're making soil

437
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:25,838
but if you're a dispensary it's much

438
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:28,479
harder for you to get a bank account and

439
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:31,040
so changing some laws around that that

440
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,120
would allow uh people to say if you've

441
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:34,480
got a legal business in the state you

442
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,480
should be able to

443
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,639
to run that business with with a bank

444
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,199
just like you know a hairdresser a nail

445
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,240
salon

446
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:43,120
or a you know a gym or any other small

447
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,159
