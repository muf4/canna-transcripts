1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:04,439
foreign

2
00:00:12,138 --> 00:00:17,519
this episode by Lana Kirsch who's the

3
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:19,739
CEO of the Enigma how are you keeping

4
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:21,719
today Alana I'm great thanks for having

5
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:23,159
me thank you very much for taking your

6
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:24,599
time to do this do you maybe want to

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,420
give everybody a brief little overview

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,279
of it a minute or two of your position

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,480
in the industry and how you came to get

10
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:32,640
to that position

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,700
yeah definitely

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,399
um so as we know my name is Alana uh I'm

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,040
the CEO of the Enigma uh I am based in

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,320
Israel actually uh with a global team so

15
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,878
we have team members here in Israel a

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,878
lot in the United States in North

17
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:50,218
America and also in uh Europe and Latin

18
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:51,299
America uh as we expand our audiences

19
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:53,280
there

20
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:55,019
um so what is the Enigma basically what

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,480
we're doing on the Enigma is we're

22
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,460
providing evidence-based eye level

23
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:01,078
information about cannabis that anyone

24
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,698
can understand

25
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,558
um so basically the problem we've

26
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:07,560
identified is that whilst we do have

27
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:09,118
some understanding of what uh of what

28
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,978
how cannabis interacts with the human

29
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:13,140
body I suppose is the easiest way to say

30
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:14,579
it there's a lot we don't know and

31
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,320
there's also a lot of information which

32
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:18,298
is kind of obscured by scientific

33
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:20,099
language that you know not everyone can

34
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,560
understand and so when we're looking to

35
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:24,419
answer any questions that people have

36
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,299
any practical or theoretical questions

37
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,799
about cannabis um like I said in a way

38
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,020
that anyone can understand and we do

39
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,759
that via our website the Enigma and by

40
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:34,978
creating content

41
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,359
um that's my background by the way is

42
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:38,400
digital content this is what I've been

43
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:41,159
doing for the past kind of 15 years is

44
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,859
working on various different large-scale

45
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,359
websites to create content that answers

46
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:47,280
people's questions that connects with

47
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:48,780
people and that is clear and easy to

48
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,820
understand

49
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,700
um and so I'm got was very excited when

50
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:56,398
I joined the Enigma team uh right at its

51
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,978
Inception four years ago and was able to

52
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,320
combine my love for the plant with

53
00:01:58,978 --> 00:02:03,959
um you know my my love and my experience

54
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:06,118
for for Content creation

55
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:07,978
um so today four years later we've got

56
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:09,479
about half a million users a month from

57
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:11,639
all over the world coming to the website

58
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,660
and the way I see it is that's half a

59
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:14,519
million people that are getting their

60
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:16,560
questions answered and able to kind of

61
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,900
optimize the Academy's Journey that

62
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,939
little bit more so that's my kind of

63
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,280
quick summary on me and what we're doing

64
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:25,500
I'm sure we can delve into a bunch of

65
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,060
different pieces there yeah yeah very

66
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,039
good you guys it's got a such a great

67
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,620
reputation at the Enigma can you maybe

68
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:33,780
give everybody a little brief what what

69
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,360
year it started what were the main

70
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,520
objectives when you started it and how

71
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,379
happy are you guys with the progress and

72
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,959
success that you've had over the years

73
00:02:40,378 --> 00:02:45,239
yeah definitely so we launched uh at the

74
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,219
end of 2019 so you know a few months

75
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,659
before covert we didn't know what was

76
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:50,159
around the corner

77
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:51,840
um and our focus when we started was

78
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:53,639
really purely medical

79
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,378
um we saw that in more and more markets

80
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:58,679
were coming online with medical programs

81
00:02:55,378 --> 00:03:00,239
and that patients were often left either

82
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,319
completely by themselves

83
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,060
um when they were making their decisions

84
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:04,799
because even their health care providers

85
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,019
even the prescribing doctors weren't

86
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,239
able to give them reliable uh

87
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:11,039
information about cannabis

88
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:13,680
um and then also when they got to

89
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,900
wherever they purchase or or procure

90
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,000
their products uh they had all different

91
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,800
uh kind of levels of information about

92
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,300
cannabis so we wanted to provide as much

93
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,400
as we could that could be useful for as

94
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,739
many people as possible

95
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,180
um when we started creating the content

96
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,319
um we discovered that really there were

97
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,760
a lot of questions that we were

98
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:31,679
answering that it kind of didn't matter

99
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,479
whether it was for medical use of a

100
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,120
recreational use or for this you know

101
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:37,318
full spectrum in between of wellness and

102
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,939
health and

103
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:40,259
um and kind of like therapeutic

104
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:43,139
applications

105
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:45,239
um and so we expanded our Focus to speak

106
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:47,818
to all cannabis consumers from this

107
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,140
science indicator databased uh

108
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:50,579
perspective

109
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:52,679
um the first couple of years were really

110
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,480
like building the Content Library itself

111
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,459
and then obviously starting to build an

112
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,619
audience around that because what's the

113
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:00,180
use of having all of this fabulous easy

114
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,378
to understand content if no one's

115
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,640
looking at it

116
00:04:01,378 --> 00:04:04,679
um so that was the first couple of years

117
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:06,298
like getting these I guess we've got

118
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,799
about two thousand three thousand pieces

119
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:10,680
of content on the website at the moment

120
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:12,959
getting that all together both from a

121
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,040
kind of editorial and an expert

122
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,780
perspective

123
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:17,759
um so like what do we think that people

124
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,019
should be asking what information do we

125
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,579
think is important for people to know

126
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,620
about cannabis and then from the other

127
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:24,780
direction why do people actually ask

128
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,040
right because say I think it's important

129
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:28,978
that everyone knows about the

130
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,660
endocannabinoid system which I do but no

131
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:31,978
one's searching for endocannabinoid

132
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,840
systems so I've got to get that

133
00:04:31,978 --> 00:04:35,758
information about the endocannabinoid

134
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:37,079
system to people in a different way so

135
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,580
maybe we're actually going to put that

136
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:41,039
information on a page where people are

137
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:44,099
searching for how do I make my own THC

138
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,900
gummies or what is decarboxylation and

139
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,500
it'll just kind of get in there so we

140
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:50,819
take that kind of data and editorial

141
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,139
approach to choosing the content that we

142
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:54,360
create

143
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:56,280
um and in the last couple of years our

144
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,080
Focus has been as well as still driving

145
00:04:56,279 --> 00:05:00,359
that audience creating the content

146
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:02,519
answering more and more questions has

147
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,020
been finding uh revenue streams and

148
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:05,399
brands that are interested in putting

149
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:07,680
themselves in front of our audience

150
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:09,418
which I guess you can probably surmise

151
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,280
in the Cannabis space there are a bunch

152
00:05:09,418 --> 00:05:13,019
of those that see our audience is a good

153
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:14,698
fit for them so I've been starting to

154
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:16,258
you know try and work out how to turn it

155
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:17,699
into a business as well as an awesome

156
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:19,620
public service

157
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:21,540
incredible you guys have got a great

158
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:25,560
reputation for fact-based information

159
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:27,479
and knowledge is there a specific uh

160
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,639
theory that you guys Implement when

161
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:30,779
you're researching a story is are there

162
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,699
different sectors with different

163
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:35,219
expertise across the different sectors

164
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:37,259
so we know that the person writing and

165
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,120
giving the information this story is

166
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:41,400
actually coming from the top tier their

167
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,079
industry because we do save a lot of

168
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:45,060
cannabis media where

169
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:46,740
somebody who smokes a joint things that

170
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,360
they know about the scientific side of

171
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,280
things and the information can get a

172
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,780
little bit Lost in Translation

173
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:53,519
well I mean yeah but that happens

174
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:55,019
everywhere right like everyone I know

175
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,180
thinks oh yeah I speak well not everyone

176
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:59,099
I know that's not fair many people fall

177
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,600
into the Trap of thinking oh yeah I

178
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:04,080
speak English so I can write an article

179
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,939
in English and it's like no yeah anyway

180
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:07,319
I can give a bunch of other examples

181
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:09,240
there but you're absolutely right there

182
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:11,339
is a lot of misinformation in the

183
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,038
Cannabis space and so putting together

184
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:16,198
our rigorous uh content creation and

185
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:18,478
review process has been crucial

186
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:20,400
um to kind of gaining that reputation

187
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:22,019
that it's really nice to you you know

188
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:24,120
you saying that we have

189
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:25,799
so I think really a special sauce is our

190
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,418
expert Advisory Board

191
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,220
um we started off mainly focusing on

192
00:06:27,418 --> 00:06:31,318
doctors and researchers

193
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,819
um so like patient-facing Physicians and

194
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:34,500
then also researchers who are

195
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:36,660
understanding the plant from a lab

196
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,639
perspective and from a clinical research

197
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,620
perspective and then we started to grow

198
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,360
the audience as we found as you said

199
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,639
that like Oh wait we're writing a piece

200
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,919
now on cannabis extract and that doesn't

201
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,660
really fall into the expertise of anyone

202
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:50,758
on our board so we started adding more

203
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,740
and more experts we've got about 40

204
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:54,538
experts working with us

205
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,860
um you know as is needed on various

206
00:06:54,538 --> 00:06:57,478
different topics

207
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,038
um and they do the review process so

208
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:01,439
they'll generally been

209
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:03,899
um in like we'll speak with them as an

210
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:05,519
editorial team when we first raise a

211
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:06,839
topic and we want to put together a

212
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:08,698
brief and understand what we would want

213
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:12,000
to cover in an article or a video or an

214
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:13,680
infographic then a content creator uh

215
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,600
comes on board so all of our writers

216
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,199
have experience in the Cannabis space

217
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:21,539
and then also as uh journalists or

218
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,759
um content producers in some way shape

219
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:25,860
or form and then they're paired with the

220
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,259
appropriate reviewer um who then reviews

221
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,520
the work there's a lot of red on these

222
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:31,860
articles sometimes when they come

223
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,418
through the expert reviewers also

224
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,280
responsible for making sure that we have

225
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:36,779
the appropriate scientific references on

226
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:38,219
there which we make sure to display on

227
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:40,019
all articles

228
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,699
um but it's not just scientific review

229
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:43,318
we also have some articles that it's

230
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:45,598
simply a fact check that we make sure

231
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:47,759
that we do if it's not a scientifical

232
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:49,978
medical based article and we also have a

233
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,780
culinary advisor a James Beard nominated

234
00:07:49,978 --> 00:07:54,959
Chef who we work with on all of our

235
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:56,638
Edibles content and a regulatory advisor

236
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:58,620
as well based in California who reviews

237
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:02,038
anything that we create on you know

238
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:04,620
legislation on cannabis reform

239
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:06,180
um and most recently and we've actually

240
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,978
just launched it on the site we launched

241
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,660
our cannabis cultivation guide I can

242
00:08:07,978 --> 00:08:12,060
tell you this was like a real blank spot

243
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,380
for me when we started on this and now I

244
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,538
at least believe that I'm able to

245
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:17,279
cultivate cannabis at home my plants are

246
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:19,439
halfway through my first grow so we'll

247
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:20,818
find out soon how good the book was but

248
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,399
we needed to add a few cultivation

249
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:26,098
Specialists um to our team at that point

250
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:28,019
and right now we're kind of starting to

251
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:29,759
dip our toes into psychedelics so we're

252
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:32,519
bringing on a Mycologist and a few

253
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,860
different pharmacologists with expertise

254
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:37,199
and psychedelics to kind of uh flesh out

255
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,700
the team there as well

256
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,919
um so I think it's a combination really

257
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,419
of that expertise and the process which

258
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:44,699
I kind of described there as I was

259
00:08:42,418 --> 00:08:47,759
talking about the board but we really do

260
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,899
like this content is I mean expensive in

261
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:50,399
the truest sense of the world yeah

262
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:52,379
there's a lot of time and a lot of eyes

263
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,059
that go into creating each of these

264
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:57,059
pieces of content

265
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:59,159
um and and we really like we we stick by

266
00:08:57,059 --> 00:09:00,419
that process so that we can uphold our

267
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:02,159
standards

268
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:03,719
um and I should say as well that it's in

269
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:05,278
a lot of times it's never ending because

270
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,959
even though the content is Evergreen

271
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,820
like how cannabis interacts with the

272
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:10,619
human body is not going to change from

273
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,300
last week to next week but there's new

274
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,440
research coming out all the time and

275
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:15,659
sometimes the things that we thought

276
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,279
were sure of five years ago like for

277
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:20,100
example the right vaping temperatures

278
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:22,320
for each cannabinoid and terpene it

279
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,120
changes we learn this is science

280
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,519
um so the content needs to be constantly

281
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,379
updated and reviewed as well even after

282
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:29,220
it's been published and kind of put out

283
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:31,919
there

284
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,420
yeah new techniques it's absorption and

285
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:34,860
a number of different scientific

286
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:37,139
advances can change that information

287
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,899
pretty quickly in this industry as we've

288
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:42,720
all seen yes

289
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:44,879
you must find like myself that it's

290
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,980
actually a great way to gather data and

291
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:48,778
to learn about new topics is to go down

292
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:51,120
this Avenue initially at the start

293
00:09:48,778 --> 00:09:53,639
because I think you get a

294
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,679
uh opens to a huge amount of information

295
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:57,240
that you might not necessarily have got

296
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,579
to introduce if you're just focused on

297
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,860
one element of this industry

298
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:03,540
yeah absolutely and there's you know the

299
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,639
industry is

300
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:07,259
um in some ways it's so developed

301
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:08,939
because cannabis has been part of human

302
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:10,740
history for thousands of years and

303
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,420
otherwise it's really like it's still in

304
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,879
diapers so there's new things coming out

305
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:17,639
all the time whether it's you know novel

306
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:19,559
consumption methods or new brands or new

307
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:20,819
Industries like for example you know

308
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:23,939
Germany is going to be huge for the

309
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:25,440
whole industry when and if uh you know

310
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,260
they finally get themselves over the

311
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,399
line to to pull uh uh recreational use

312
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:31,559
there

313
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:34,200
next topic I wanted to talk about was

314
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:36,119
advancing policy changes I think we both

315
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,740
agree that the media Outlets are kind of

316
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,360
the the tip of the sphere when it comes

317
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,039
to some of these advancements that

318
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,600
happen because whatever the stories

319
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:44,578
being shared and the information and the

320
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,560
knowledge being open source to the

321
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:49,859
public you're not going to have such a

322
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:54,239
wide educated voting base and political

323
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:56,220
base do you see the the need for these

324
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,259
top tier media platforms across

325
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:01,920
territories North Africa middle east

326
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:03,299
Europe North America being essential and

327
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:05,039
do you see over the next coming years

328
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:07,979
that there's going to be an m a activity

329
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:09,778
where you'll see a dominant one or two

330
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,639
brands in each individual territory

331
00:11:09,778 --> 00:11:13,559
because at the moment it's a very easy

332
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:15,899
barrier to entry for anybody can kind of

333
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:18,059
get in to the media space but it looks

334
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:19,379
as if there's going to be a a wave of M

335
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:22,159
A where it becomes even more

336
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:25,799
professional than it already is now

337
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:27,958
yeah very interesting I mean it all

338
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:31,019
remains to be seen right

339
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:33,000
um but I think the more kind of positive

340
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:35,220
media coverage we can get on cannabis

341
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,539
obviously the better I think you touched

342
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,860
on something really important at the

343
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:39,000
beginning about you know the personal

344
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,039
stories

345
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,440
um that are being shared um and I think

346
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:45,719
that's especially in countries which are

347
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,220
like further back when it comes to their

348
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,079
cannabis legalization that they're just

349
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,360
looking at putting through for example a

350
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:53,819
medical program right now it's really

351
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,680
historically been those personal stories

352
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,420
that push each country in each

353
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:59,578
jurisdiction over the edge and very

354
00:11:57,419 --> 00:12:01,379
often it's mothers who are advocating

355
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:02,939
for medicine for their children and that

356
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:05,399
seems to be I mean parents in general

357
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:07,800
but often it is the mothers

358
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:10,440
um that have you know got kids with

359
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:12,958
um epilepsy that has not responded to

360
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,980
the treatment options available is often

361
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:16,799
one of

362
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:18,659
um the most kind of compelling cases

363
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:21,240
when mothers can show you know my child

364
00:12:18,659 --> 00:12:23,278
was having fits 50 times a day and now

365
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,320
they're having a once a day and what

366
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:26,700
that does to their quality of life so I

367
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,379
think these you know having these

368
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,300
stories out there in a way that people

369
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:32,100
can connect to

370
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:33,599
um has you know we've seen in the past

371
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,220
that that's how

372
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,778
um that ends up being what builds the

373
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,240
public pressure and then pushes these

374
00:12:36,778 --> 00:12:41,519
programs across the line

375
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,079
um so I mean without getting too much

376
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,839
into the you know questions of mass

377
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:47,699
media and and uh who says what and why

378
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,920
for political reasons I try and kind of

379
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,480
keep myself back from there I do think

380
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:54,539
the more stories and the more personal

381
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,879
stories we have out there the better

382
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:58,620
um I've seen you know in my personal

383
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:00,120
life and then also uh through my

384
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:02,159
professional experience in the past four

385
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,659
years in the Cannabis industry that

386
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:05,699
there's always this progression when it

387
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:08,519
comes to changing hearts and Minds about

388
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:10,860
cannabis and the first step is like oh

389
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:13,019
okay maybe it's not a dangerous drug

390
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:15,120
that has no medical application maybe it

391
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:16,679
has some medical application and then

392
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,778
people are able to get themselves to the

393
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:20,939
point where oh okay so maybe like people

394
00:13:18,778 --> 00:13:22,439
with terminal illnesses maybe maybe it's

395
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,480
okay that they're getting a little bit

396
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,220
High because it's also helping them and

397
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,539
then like you know it's step step till

398
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,220
the point where people are able to say

399
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:30,419
well you know maybe it's cool if

400
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,399
everyone just does what they want with

401
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:33,899
either glass of wine or a joint you know

402
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,799
on the way you can whatever it is and

403
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:36,539
then

404
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:38,819
um I I assume I don't need to like for

405
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:41,458
you and for your listeners spell out the

406
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:43,800
whole uh the whole process but it starts

407
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:45,239
with that acceptance of the fact that

408
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:46,919
there is a medical application for

409
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,079
cannabis which is of course what means

410
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:52,620
that it shouldn't be a schedule one drug

411
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:54,319
yeah how excited were you about the the

412
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:56,700
Congress yesterday

413
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,620
passing this safe Banking Act I'm moving

414
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:00,778
around to the next level is this going

415
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,899
to be a game changer or is it more smoke

416
00:14:00,778 --> 00:14:07,379
and mirrors do you think

417
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:09,480
uh 50 50. look I think any progress is

418
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:11,220
positive I really believe that and I

419
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,200
think that when we're shooting ourselves

420
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,940
in the foot if we say no no the only

421
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,620
thing to do is full legalization and we

422
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,240
won't take anything less no it's very

423
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,919
difficult to run cannabis businesses

424
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,019
across the world and especially in North

425
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:23,879
America in certain States at the moment

426
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:26,100
and anything that we can do that eases

427
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:27,480
that will will help the whole industry

428
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,860
flourish you know I have plenty of

429
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,060
companies that can't work with us

430
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,620
because we can't work out the payment

431
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:33,719
situation

432
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,759
um so I think in terms of like making

433
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,500
things easier for cannabis businesses so

434
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:39,360
that the best cannabis businesses can

435
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:42,240
actually rise to the top so that we can

436
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,100
have that natural progression of you

437
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,019
know the conglomerates coming in which

438
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:48,659
has to happen in any developing industry

439
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:50,039
uh we need to have you know we need to

440
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:50,698
be able to move money around it's very

441
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:52,439
simple

442
00:14:50,698 --> 00:14:56,458
whether it's going to be you know the

443
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:58,699
game changer no uh I don't think so but

444
00:14:56,458 --> 00:15:01,078
I do think any progress is good

445
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:02,698
okay amazing we're just hitting the time

446
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:03,659
there Atlanta it's been great talking to

447
00:15:02,698 --> 00:15:04,979
you I'd love to continue the

448
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:06,778
conversation hopefully in the next

449
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,639
coming months or the start of next year

450
00:15:06,778 --> 00:15:10,439
we can touch base again and see where we

451
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,839
are and as I said we've got a cannabis

452
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:15,839
someone coming to Tel Aviv next May so

453
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:17,100
we will definitely talk before that yeah

454
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,380
definitely I hope to see you there

455
