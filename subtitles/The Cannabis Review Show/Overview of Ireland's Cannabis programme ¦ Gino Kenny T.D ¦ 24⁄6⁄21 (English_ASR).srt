coming on the show mate i know you've

10
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,719
been a long advocate working in this

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,199
industry and uh you've been a campaigner

12
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:31,278
for

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,200
medical cannabis program in ireland you

14
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:34,960
also introduced legislation to legalize

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,399
medical cannabis and led the successful

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,600
national campaign resulting in the

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,239
change of law

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,600
can we start basically there what's the

19
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:44,238
overview at the moment of ireland's

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,280
cannabis program as you see it

21
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:50,640
um well yeah you're right on

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,239
five years ago almost to the day

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,239
i introduced the bill around medical

24
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:56,558
cannabis and

25
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:57,359
and obviously it you know eventually

26
00:00:56,558 --> 00:00:58,959
pushed

27
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,198
the government into changing the policy

28
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,159
after a very very long campaign

29
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:05,359
and also campaigners families and

30
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,680
individuals

31
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:09,760
had campaigned for access you know for

32
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,920
themselves or their family members so

33
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,359
that was the kind of the cutting edge of

34
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,079
the campaign

35
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:17,200
so at the moment um the medical cannabis

36
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,679
accounts program will be

37
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,240
will commence in the next i think week

38
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,880
um

39
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:25,118
and for the first time uh if you have a

40
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:27,519
qualified condition under the program

41
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:28,478
and you can get metal a medical cannabis

42
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:30,560
product

43
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,239
described for that condition now it's

44
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,079
it's quite restrictive

45
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:35,599
and we were very critical at the time in

46
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:38,639
relation to the omission of

47
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:42,078
chronic pain um but

48
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,399
you know that's it is what it is uh

49
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:46,478
and hopefully we can campaign in the

50
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,118
very very near future in relation to

51
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:50,719
um you know widen the scope of the

52
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:53,118
medical cannabis access program

53
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,640
in relation to other conditions and

54
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:56,399
people getting access

55
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,759
and via the you know the long-term

56
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,519
illness game on the metal card so that's

57
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,920
that's where we're at it was i said it

58
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:07,039
was a very it's a long campaign that is

59
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,840
in some ways only begun um but

60
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,200
you know uh we keep pushing forward in

61
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,159
relation to kind of

62
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:15,919
reforming uh and getting i mean people

63
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,959
getting access to medical cannabis

64
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:20,799
avoid the program and broaden it out in

65
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,759
their very near future

66
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,959
okay and can you tell me who who's he

67
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,199
responsible for

68
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,560
the the choice of ailments that are

69
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:32,799
being able to

70
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,319
receive this program so the hpra

71
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,000
which is the health product regulation

72
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:39,679
authority they commissioned

73
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
the document in 2017 in relation to

74
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,680
uh medical cannabis in ireland and they

75
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,120
recommended a medical cannabis access

76
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,040
program with them tree conditions we

77
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,319
were very critical at the time

78
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:51,039
um they have an expert group and that

79
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:52,399
kind of

80
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:55,280
you know made that kind of

81
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,560
recommendation and

82
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,439
and at the time i said you know why was

83
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,840
chronic pain

84
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:03,598
and other conditions i missed it and

85
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,400
they gave an explanation which i thought

86
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:06,878
was kind of

87
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,000
slightly kind of you know didn't really

88
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:11,919
hold weight

89
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,120
um but they're they're the kind of

90
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:17,679
i suppose they're the group and kind of

91
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,959
authority to have you know put the the

92
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,519
program together

93
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,199
and but at least it's on the positive

94
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,640
side at least it's a start

95
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:28,238
you know and from where we were um

96
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,158
and it's been as i said it's been very

97
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,799
protracted but at least

98
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:34,158
now families and individuals can get

99
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,920
metal cannabis products on the

100
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:36,639
prescription rather than have to go to a

101
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:38,399
licensed

102
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:40,318
system which the license system will

103
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,400
still be in existence

104
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:43,598
but um you know families hopefully can

105
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,480
get it under

106
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,959
on the prescription very very soon um

107
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:48,318
and

108
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,158
don't have to go through all the kind of

109
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:52,158
bureaucracy and the kind of

110
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,560
the the arbitrary nature of the met of

111
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:56,239
the licensing system

112
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,560
okay and it brings down to the next

113
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,920
topic is your bill that you're proposing

114
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,560
you're going to be debating at the dell

115
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:01,598
this summer

116
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,438
do you want to give everybody an

117
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:05,759
overview of exactly what it is that

118
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:08,959
you're going to be debating in the doll

119
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:11,438
yeah so the bill

120
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,280
i'm proposing to put forward uh the

121
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:15,039
cannabis regulation and control bill

122
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,238
obviously this is for recreation use and

123
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:17,279
the the two issues shouldn't be

124
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,439
completed

125
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,958
and related to medical and uh recreation

126
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:24,160
use sometimes you do

127
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,720
no but you know um sometimes

128
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,479
we can't help that but uh so the bill

129
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,880
it's been drafted at the moment

130
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:31,918
um i'm hoping to introduce this time in

131
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:34,879
the autumn

132
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:37,120
probably october um because the doll

133
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:40,319
comes back on the 14th of september

134
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,319
um and we hope to have the bill ready to

135
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:45,360
go in around that time

136
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:47,439
and so

137
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,720
again it hasn't been drafted but it

138
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:52,160
essentially will

139
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,120
uh you know you know supposed to cause a

140
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,560
debate

141
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:59,360
uh in relation to um end of prohibition

142
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,280
and kind of making cannabis legal in a

143
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,080
framework of regulation

144
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:05,279
and the framework of revenue and the

145
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:08,000
framework of

146
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:08,959
where people are you know you know not

147
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,439
criminalized for

148
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:12,079
cannabis use cultivation and possession

149
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:14,800
because

150
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:15,359
it doesn't work um and has been a

151
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,120
failure

152
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,240
essentially so um you know we need to go

153
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,759
beyond

154
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,639
failure and go beyond when you go beyond

155
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,080
failure

156
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,918
you have to look at something very very

157
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:30,719
different and a paradigm

158
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:31,359
shift and that shift is legalization and

159
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,440
so

160
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,960
the bill hopefully will kind of

161
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:37,759
instigate that debate

162
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:38,560
um and kind of create a kind of i

163
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,439
suppose

164
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,639
you know i suppose an atmosphere where

165
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:45,918
you know we have to look

166
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:48,160
beyond the kind of very

167
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:49,359
antiquated laws around cannabis use so

168
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,759
that's what it will do

169
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,038
to find our finer details i you know i

170
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,080
can't really comment at the moment

171
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:55,519
because obviously you know

172
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:57,359
uh we can get you back and we can

173
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:58,000
discuss those yeah i think it's better i

174
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,759
think

175
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,038
can you give me an example let's say for

176
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,800
everybody watching here

177
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:04,159
let's talk as to the procedure if it

178
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,319
does happen so you bring it

179
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,080
a bill to the doll you'll debate it

180
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,400
let's say you convince your opposition

181
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,680
that

182
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:12,159
they're going to be in favor of what

183
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,240
you're proposing everybody says yay the

184
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,160
bill gets proposed trump talk is true

185
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,439
like the next three important steps that

186
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,840
happened that bill then

187
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:21,839
to be able to let's say it progresses to

188
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:23,839
where there is a dispensary

189
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:26,159
that some uh somebody can go in with a

190
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:28,799
medical card who's over the age of 21

191
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,240
and can access that as an adult consumer

192
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,960
without getting

193
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,960
it under a medical program i mean he

194
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,279
wants the duration of time and how many

195
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:39,519
well it's very difficult it's very

196
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:42,799
difficult to put a time

197
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:45,359
um frame on it i mean things in here

198
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,560
work extremely slow especially if you're

199
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,800
in opposition

200
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,160
that the vast majority of opposition

201
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,598
bills never see the light of day they

202
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,840
never get past

203
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:55,680
you know the year they introduce a bill

204
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:57,038
it's debated and then it's voted down

205
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,120
that that's what happens to vast

206
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:01,519
majority of bills and even bills that

207
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,800
kind of go beyond that which would be

208
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:05,198
second stage

209
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,800
then they go into committee stage uh or

210
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,680
pre-legislative scrutiny

211
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,639
um does every chance that it will never

212
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,918
see the light of day

213
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:16,478
you know so you know do you see what

214
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:18,719
if the opposition came in and could they

215
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:22,159
take your idea and your bill

216
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,840
and they can't afford themselves

217
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,199
yeah no they can and if they want to do

218
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:27,918
it i'm i'm fine

219
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,478
you know i i'm fine if the government

220
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:30,318
say

221
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:31,519
you know okay we looked at you bill you

222
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,280
know we

223
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:35,359
well you know and we let it pass the

224
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:37,038
committee stage

225
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,879
in some ways it has happened under

226
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:40,800
opposition bills where

227
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:41,918
like an opposition no idea or a bill has

228
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,079
been basically

229
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:45,439
the guts of it has been taken from by

230
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:46,878
the government in situ

231
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:48,719
and they've legislate for if they want

232
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,280
to do that fair enough that's that's no

233
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,120
problem

234
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:52,799
i don't i don't i'm not sure if that

235
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,478
will happen um

236
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,478
but the main thing is that we introduce

237
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:59,038
a bill there's a debate in the doll

238
00:07:56,478 --> 00:07:59,519
there's a vote very soon after um and

239
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:01,199
then

240
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,038
you know the the doll then gives

241
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,439
direction on where the bill

242
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:06,800
needs to go does it kind of be does it

243
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:08,639
fall completely

244
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,560
uh is there an amendment to the bill you

245
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,360
know the best case scenario that

246
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,759
you know it's it's it's voted on and it

247
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,720
is

248
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,360
it's agreed that it goes to probably

249
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,080
pre-led

250
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,120
scrutiny or committee stage you know

251
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:24,478
that would be

252
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,240
i mean that would be a big kind of step

253
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:28,079
in relation to end of prohibition

254
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,560
ireland if it could get to that stage

255
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:32,158
you know pre-leds of scrutiny so there's

256
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,038
a long long way to go

257
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:36,240
in relation to this uh it's obviously a

258
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:38,158
numbers game as well

259
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,000
like the government have a majority and

260
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:43,120
if they want to vote any opposition

261
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,039
bill down and they can um but we would

262
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,399
be looking for support

263
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:47,838
in the government particularly the green

264
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,039
party the green party have a very good

265
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,080
policy around

266
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:54,480
um cannabis use so we'd be hoping for

267
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,680
for their support whether they're

268
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,800
they're in a kind of

269
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:01,599
pact with the finale of vienna fault um

270
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:02,879
kind of you know coalition so you know

271
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,360
we'd be looking for broad

272
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:07,039
a broad spectrum of support to you know

273
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:11,278
look at the kind of merits of

274
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:13,838
legalization and end on prohibition okay

275
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:15,439
and the last topic that we want to talk

276
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,399
about is the inflection point for

277
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,760
politicians

278
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,080
it leads us on from what we were just

279
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:20,480
talking about is it going to be the case

280
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,080
of

281
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,920
let's say finite fall infinite we know

282
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,480
that green parties you guys are in favor

283
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:26,240
of this

284
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,759
the other parties that have claimed to

285
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,639
not be in favor is it going to be job

286
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:30,799
creation

287
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:31,759
is it going to be revenue earned for the

288
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:35,359
uh the

289
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:37,600
tax and licensing excise people is it

290
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,680
is it is a patient access what are the

291
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,040
the reflection points to uc politicians

292
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,719
actually do you know go what we're going

293
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:45,838
to support this now

294
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,639
yeah that's a good point um and we've

295
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,519
seen over

296
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:50,799
the last couple of decades how social

297
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:54,879
issues

298
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:58,319
um you know i suppose people power

299
00:09:54,879 --> 00:10:02,240
and kind of uh persuasion

300
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:04,560
has changed politicians minds

301
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,079
uh so there's a kind of uh there's a

302
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:08,879
revolution going on around

303
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:10,239
in relation to social issues uh and

304
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:11,679
again we just we just

305
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,079
just look back the last six or seven

306
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:14,719
years of certain issues that were kind

307
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:17,838
of

308
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,600
in some ways slightly taboo uh but

309
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:23,120
they're kind of mainstream

310
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:27,360
in some guys um and you know

311
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:29,759
book reform is probably no different um

312
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,639
there is a lot to do around us what will

313
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,679
kind of change

314
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:34,879
people's minds and i think there's a

315
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:39,039
number of factors

316
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:43,120
um i think you know public opinion

317
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:46,480
is ahead of politicians on this right by

318
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:49,519
uh i think by a good margin uh

319
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:53,120
and when you parallel um

320
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,759
the moving parts of legalization on the

321
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,120
table

322
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:57,120
i think the majority of people in

323
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:01,120
ireland actually majority people

324
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:04,159
most countries will say look at keeping

325
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:07,278
cannabis illegal doesn't hasn't

326
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:08,559
worked right it doesn't work and it's uh

327
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:10,480
counterproductive

328
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,159
so we want to do something very

329
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,200
different and that different

330
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:15,199
is uh

331
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,160
the opposite of what what is happening

332
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,160
now

333
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:23,519
and what's happening now is people are

334
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:25,838
being criminalized people

335
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,799
are um people going through the criminal

336
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,160
justice system

337
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:30,078
and you know being criminalized for

338
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:32,319
cannabis use that doesn't work

339
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:33,439
uh so we want to do something different

340
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,160
and and

341
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,959
if there's enough kind of a public nude

342
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:40,240
out there

343
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:41,518
you know and to push you know they want

344
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,759
change on this

345
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,679
then things can happen very very quickly

346
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:48,720
you know and things can happen

347
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:51,679
you know unexpected unexpectedly um

348
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,120
and other parties that had a kind of an

349
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:56,159
opposition to certain things

350
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,360
you know mines do change you know they

351
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:59,679
do evolve

352
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,440
uh but the cutting edge of kind of that

353
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:03,039
change is always a public opinion you

354
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,480
know it's people on the street

355
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:09,360
uh people kind of contacting their tds

356
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,159
and so forth and saying look in on this

357
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,680
issue

358
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:15,679
we don't we believe that you know

359
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:16,958
it's wrong to criminalize and

360
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:18,799
criminalize people

361
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:20,399
and we need to do something very very

362
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:23,120
different and with a better outcome

363
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,799
with kind of harm reduction so there are

364
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,240
all the factors and the factors there's

365
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:29,278
other factors as well

366
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:32,959
about as i said health land approach

367
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:34,958
how it actually could create revenue and

368
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:36,479
how it could you know where does

369
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:37,278
regulation because there's no regulation

370
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,240
whatsoever

371
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:41,439
around cannabis use uh there's a so once

372
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,480
you have prohibition

373
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,800
that then a vacuum exists and

374
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,079
where does the vacuum people certain

375
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,000
individuals and groupings

376
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:52,638
will fill that vacuum in and at the

377
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
moment that vacuum is being uh filled in

378
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,320
by the black market

379
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,679
s and criminal gangs and they use all

380
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,920
sorts of unscrupulous

381
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:04,719
um uh tactics to you know

382
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:05,599
you know to kind of for distribution and

383
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,759
bringing

384
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,159
minors into kind of the distribution

385
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:13,600
drugs and it's pretty insidious

386
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:16,559
and so why allow that to happen you know

387
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,040
governments are allowing this to happen

388
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:20,319
um

389
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:21,679
and are they're waiving control over the

390
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,040
distribution of cannabis so

391
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:27,599
you know what air bill would do is

392
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:29,519
basically uh cut the black market out

393
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,480
not entirely because i think sometimes

394
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,159
there will be

395
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,240
you know there will be kind of the black

396
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:37,838
market in the background but less

397
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:41,278
so in relation to end of prohibition so

398
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:44,639
all down factors on um you know

399
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:47,439
and you know trying to kind of debate

400
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,560
tds uh that may be an opposition to it

401
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,000
and kind of

402
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:52,879
teasing the kind of things that they may

403
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,320
have concerns about so all that factors

404
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:58,720
i think uh will be a very robust debate

405
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,320
and an interesting debate in the in the

406
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,759
next couple of months

407
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,680
yeah i couldn't agree tomorrow and i

408
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:06,399
think that debate needs to uh

409
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:07,919
maintain the fact that any revenue comes

410
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,600
from the cannabis industry needs to go

411
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:10,799
back into the stakeholders in each

412
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,879
neighborhood where that

413
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:14,958
industry is making money so police

414
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:16,078
reinvestment schools reinvestment health

415
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:17,759
reinvestment so

416
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:19,120
it's not just an industry that's there

417
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:20,559
to make money it's an industry that's

418
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,799
there to generate revenue for the

419
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:25,439
community that those businesses are in

420
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:27,439
and help benefit anybody and i think

421
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,360
you'd want to be a cold-hearted sob

422
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,880
to even not be in favor of that

423
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,159
regardless what your stance on other

424
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:34,159
drugs may be

425
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:36,000
exactly exactly on and i think things

426
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:37,519
are changing like you know you see the

427
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,519
united states you see

428
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,440
mexico you see other countries around

429
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,480
the world they are looking at

430
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:47,120
things differently than than

431
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,519
they've done what they were doing before

432
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,320
and

433
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,278
kind of you know the misuse of drugs the

434
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,480
acts itself

435
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:56,720
is quite antiquated um

436
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,000
and you know it needs to be performed

437
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,000
particularly around cannabis use

438
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,919
and i think there's obviously there's a

439
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
kind of a middle road

440
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:05,519
uh called decriminalization and i'm all

441
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,799
for decriminalization

442
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,240
um but it doesn't decriminalization

443
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,639
particularly on cannabis doesn't go far

444
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,839
enough you you have to be talking about

445
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,039
legalization

446
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,720
and um and regulating this market yeah

447
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:20,319
yeah yeah because if you're talking

448
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,440
about equalization

449
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,800
it kind of fudges the idea um

450
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,320
and some people like i think the

451
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,519
majority of tds would be for you

452
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,680
decriminalization in

453
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,879
some form uh but they need to go before

454
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,000
and they've been talking about this for

455
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:35,198
decades right does it

456
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,799
like this place they can

457
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:38,399
it's a talking shop have you understood

458
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:38,879
there's a lot of talk and not enough

459
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,198
action

460
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:42,000
you know and particularly around issues

461
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:44,799
where

462
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,159
you know where working-class people are

463
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:49,278
really really affected

464
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:52,000
um and it's a it's a class issue as well

465
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:53,198
uh so we need to kind of you know keep

466
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,159
kind of raising the issue

467
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:56,958
around kind of why kind of uh

468
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:00,000
prohibition

469
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:01,838
and kind of criminalizing people for

470
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,600
personal drug use doesn't it's

471
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,959
counter-productive and i think other

472
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,159
countries are saying that and they're

473
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,799
gonna have to do something different

474
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:10,000
because

475
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:13,039
you know it's about kind of um

476
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,159
you know it's it's about kind of

477
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:17,838
it's it's a societal thing as well and

478
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:21,039
it's an issue where you know

479
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,399
uh people can be drawn into that kind of

480
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:25,679
the alternative economy

481
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:27,519
in relation to distribution of drugs and

482
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:29,278
and that can as i said that can be very

483
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,720
insidious relating to communities and

484
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:32,000
individuals and so forth

485
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,240
so we need to do something very

486
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,679
different uh from

487
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:39,519
what has happened and what will you know

488
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:41,758
what will be the future and that future

489
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,919
is uh ending

490
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,120
prohibition and kind of doing something

491
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,159
very very different what we're doing

492
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,000
before

493
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:49,679
yeah couldn't agree with you more and as

494
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,198
the generations move along as i said i

495
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:53,039
think those outdated policies that

496
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:54,000
became and the reagan era is there long

497
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:56,319
since gone

498
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,159
anybody born after 1980 now has a bit of

499
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,600
cup on it about them and understands the

500
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:02,879
world that they live in and

501
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,558
grew up with this as a thing and realize

502
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:06,000
the garbage that's out there in the

503
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:06,959
illegal market and the fact that it's

504
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,720
now considered

505
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,240
like wine over in california with

506
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,759
billion dollar companies so

507
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,120
those companies aren't going to just sit

508
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:14,480
