00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:15,539
the hemp industry in Mexico

30
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:17,399
okay very interesting the reason I had

31
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,840
you on is I've been very interested in

32
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,640
what's going on in Mexico at the moment

33
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,560
and the size of the potential consumer

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,239
Market that you guys have do you want to

35
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,340
maybe give everybody a quick uh run

36
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,679
through what the policy and the legal

37
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,978
framework looks like in expert moment

38
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:37,020
yes yes yes yes so the regulation in

39
00:01:31,978 --> 00:01:40,319
Mexico started uh in 2016 because of an

40
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:42,599
um battle lawsuit this is a trial that

41
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:45,959
we have in Mexico where you can claim

42
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:49,259
against the government asking for new

43
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:52,199
regulations or uh claiming that any

44
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,478
regulation is against your rights so

45
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,600
these start because of an unparalleled

46
00:01:54,478 --> 00:02:00,840
lawsuit in the medicinal area and from

47
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:03,059
that time to now we have a few areas in

48
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,000
Canada is fully regulated as the

49
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:09,239
medicinals so nowadays we have the Allah

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,759
stated in the law that the medicinal

51
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:14,400
cannabis permission we also have a

52
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:16,979
regulations for these purposes it is

53
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:21,000
allowed this the cultivation of cannabis

54
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:23,519
for medicinal and scientific purposes in

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,280
the other hand we have the hemp

56
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:30,480
Industrial Hemp industry so in this

57
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:33,719
industry we are allowed to import and

58
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:37,019
commercialize also to export cannabis

59
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:40,620
products which contain no more than one

60
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:45,019
percent of THC for industrial purposes

61
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:48,060
this means Cosmetics food beverage

62
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:50,459
dietary supplements so all those

63
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,199
products which contain cannabinoids are

64
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:55,439
aimed to come into the Mexican market

65
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:58,439
but also we have other really important

66
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:01,019
part in hemp which are other all the

67
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:03,780
materials you know for construction for

68
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:06,480
paper wood rope all those Industrial

69
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,979
Products and for other Industries are as

70
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:08,939
well allowed to come into the Mexican

71
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:11,399
market

72
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:14,818
and uh well by the side of the

73
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:17,400
recreational Market we have uh nowadays

74
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:21,238
we do not have a federal law for that

75
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:24,539
recreational consumption but we can go

76
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:27,300
as individuals we can go with the health

77
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:29,400
authority and ask a permission for

78
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,980
consumption so this is a funny thing

79
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,620
because you can go and ask for this

80
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:38,939
permission but nowadays we do not have

81
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:41,459
any legal recreational market so uh we

82
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:43,680
are in this moment I think Mexico is

83
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:46,080
waiting for United States to fully

84
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,799
regulate and then we are going to follow

85
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,379
that uh but in even though we do not

86
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:55,439
have these these commercial Market in

87
00:03:52,378 --> 00:03:58,018
Mexico we have those other two really

88
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:00,180
important markets which is now and the

89
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:02,039
industrial hemp market and are really

90
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:06,239
important for the economy of our country

91
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:09,318
and we are we are working on that

92
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,819
very interesting but do you guys have

93
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:14,878
retail dispensaries that are selling

94
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:16,918
let's say hhc flour and CBD flour where

95
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:18,180
is that a not on the cards at the moment

96
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:22,439
in Mexico

97
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:25,500
so uh the products we can fail here yes

98
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:28,199
are CBD products or which contain other

99
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,639
cannabinoids sorry for that

100
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,020
which contain another kind of you know

101
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,759
it's at

102
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:36,539
um

103
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:38,699
c c and CG CBC cgc you know other

104
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:40,740
cannabinoids are allowed to be imported

105
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:43,680
on commercialized but not in a

106
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:47,160
dispensory because those are sold as

107
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:50,100
dietary supplements or

108
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:54,180
if it is not dietary supplements also as

109
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:56,639
food you know like CBD drops uh with

110
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,639
hemp oil so those go to the

111
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,860
classification food uh that is the way

112
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:04,560
but know the answer for dispensaries is

113
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,720
no because we can't sell any

114
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,478
recreational product

115
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,759
and do you see the leading brands in

116
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:14,279
Mexico at the moment are they homegrown

117
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,740
hemp friends or are they imported them

118
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:19,799
products from North America

119
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:23,160
yeah so for him we are importing

120
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:26,340
products uh nowadays it is not about

121
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:29,039
growing or not growing hemp it's about

122
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:30,418
importing these products because you

123
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:33,240
don't want to fight with the government

124
00:05:30,418 --> 00:05:35,819
trying to explain them if your hemp or

125
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,699
not or which are the difference between

126
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:40,680
hemp and marijuana you know uh the

127
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:43,680
problem and the big stigma in Mexico

128
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:46,079
comes from that point the thing is a

129
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:50,459
general health law state that it is

130
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:51,978
forbidden the growing of Cannabis sativa

131
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:55,560
indica

132
00:05:51,978 --> 00:05:58,319
and marijuana those are the ones that

133
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:01,019
are ones that are forbidden so uh we

134
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:03,240
know that marijuana it is not a planned

135
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:05,099
you know marijuana is only a term that

136
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,220
we give to the plan when you're we are

137
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:12,840
going to give it a recreational use but

138
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:16,800
as cannabis as hemp comes from Cannabis

139
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:20,279
sativa the name of him is

140
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:24,180
there is this big fear from the industry

141
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:26,818
to start growing him with any uh

142
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:30,300
establishment about the permission of

143
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:33,419
growing hair so uh what the the the the

144
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:37,079
way in Mexico cannabis industry is

145
00:06:33,418 --> 00:06:39,538
working is through legal uh strategies

146
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:42,478
you know the first thing we achieved

147
00:06:39,538 --> 00:06:44,779
that was a medicinal area we achieve it

148
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:49,680
because a trial against the government

149
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:53,219
so this this moment I think that we do

150
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:56,759
not need to seek for more regulations

151
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:59,520
because finally hemp is a plant you know

152
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:02,280
it's a plant that does not have any uh

153
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:05,818
psychotropic or psychoactic effect so

154
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:09,418
what we need to do is stop asking for

155
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:12,479
more rules and start educating and start

156
00:07:09,418 --> 00:07:15,478
helping Google Vermont's legislators and

157
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:16,740
people who are in important places about

158
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:20,098
this difference you know we need

159
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:23,699
education with information we do not

160
00:07:20,098 --> 00:07:25,740
need any or any other rule

161
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:26,819
okay

162
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,699
so

163
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:32,098
um the likes of rice corn and sugar are

164
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:34,199
Staples of your cultivation process and

165
00:07:32,098 --> 00:07:36,680
you guys are world leaders in farming

166
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:39,780
some of those things it seems to be that

167
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:42,000
more profitable than those three

168
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:43,758
Commodities is not going to be the case

169
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,379
in Mexico

170
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:49,800
than if the president's still not

171
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:53,219
bucking the agricultural sector because

172
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,560
yeah so the agriculture sector is uh

173
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:59,099
nowadays is really comfortable because

174
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:01,918
their answer to us all the time till it

175
00:07:59,098 --> 00:08:04,620
is fully regulated cannabis we can start

176
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:09,659
speaking about the aggro laws in Mexico

177
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:11,879
you know so there for them hemp is the

178
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,160
same of cannabis because we we do not

179
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:15,899
have this difference in the law that is

180
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,840
the problem we do not have these

181
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:22,560
classifications and if if a general

182
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:24,859
health law uh the most important law of

183
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,740
speaking about health in my country

184
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:32,219

185
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:34,799

seeds in Mexico but if we don't have the

198
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:09,778
difference between Cannabis sativa and

199
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:12,958
Canada which is ham we can help you

200
00:09:09,778 --> 00:09:15,539
because for us it's still forbidden so

201
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:19,018
you need to go to a trial and to explain

202
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:21,958
the authorities differences and this

203
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:24,778
company two years ago start with this

204
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:26,879
trial and they want the trial and

205
00:09:24,778 --> 00:09:31,259
nowadays they are seeking for a specific

206
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:34,439
permission for growing hemp for CBD

207
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:37,319
beverage right so uh those guys did it

208
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,959
and was good and these are the kind of

209
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,480
things we need we need to do in Mexico

210
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:44,759
going through these legal processes in

211
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,860
order to achieve regulation and

212
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:49,559
clearance in the lot

213
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,600
incredible stuff great insights I wanted

214
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:53,219
to jump out now on to the next topic

215
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,440
which is hemp in construction and I

216
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,759
wanted to get a your thoughts on

217
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,620
everything that you guys are doing in

218
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:00,600
Tulum and maybe explain to the audience

219
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,459
that the Innovative practices that you

220
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,959
guys have got going on over there

221
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:09,419
yeah so uh this uh I I like to tell it

222
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:12,059
this way this is a story about uh

223
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:14,699
attorney of Mexico City which finished

224
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:17,159
being that director of a ham

225
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:19,320
construction development right and the

226
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:21,539
only reason well I have three reasons

227
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:25,920
for taking this decision quitting the

228
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:27,958
firm in Mexico and moving uh to to marry

229
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,899
that that is three hours far away from

230
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:34,559
Tulum are because this project will

231
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:37,679
number one show the government a legal

232
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:39,778
business of hemp in our country that

233
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:43,019
this is really important because when

234
00:10:39,778 --> 00:10:45,539
you show it uh going through all the

235
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:47,700
legal strategies and everything it is

236
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:49,980
easier for them to understand what you

237
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:54,778
are talking about you know the second

238
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:57,300
one we are educating each time I sell a

239
00:10:54,778 --> 00:10:59,759
lot of land I am giving all this

240
00:10:57,299 --> 00:11:02,399
information about the benefits of the

241
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:05,220
hemp and only the information will feel

242
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:08,700
finish with the stigma in Mexico and

243
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:12,360
number three is uh we are opening the

244
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:15,060
doors to the hemp industry through this

245
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:18,899
project because we are bringing uh you

246
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:23,458
know uh producers of hemp for hand crate

247
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:25,620
hemp group Hamburg Hamburg but also all

248
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:28,139
the concepts in the development it is

249
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:30,600
around the hemp and the Cannabis this is

250
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:33,600
a holistic development where we are

251
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:36,300
going to have this lovely amenities as

252
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,000
meditation Gardens we will have sweat

253
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:42,599
lodge the name of those are temascalas

254
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:46,078
and we will have also amenities like

255
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:49,200
restaurant Lounge Bar a jungle gym roads

256
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:51,958
for the bicycle and for going for a walk

257
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:55,500
or a run and all the developing will be

258
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:58,379
surrounded of the Jungle so we are

259
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:01,200
taking care that our views all the time

260
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:04,399
will be great and what we want to try

261
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:07,500
this these trans isolate this concept

262
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:10,440
Eon it is not only

263
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:12,539
con building with him because that is

264
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:15,000
good for our environment because you you

265
00:12:12,539 --> 00:12:19,199
guys already know that uh when you build

266
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:22,379
with him and natural fibers that uh we

267
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:26,459
we do not damage the environmental and

268
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:31,139
the head that hemp storage CO2 so this

269
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:33,479
helps to create a positive climate

270
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:36,299
um effect when you build with natural

271
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:38,940
fibers and has a lot of benefits for

272
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:40,500
building in the jungle this uh this hand

273
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:42,720
crate has

274
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:45,419
um like this is a product that that is

275
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,519
breadable it's non-toxic it's really

276
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:51,479
easy to do the mixture you only need

277
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:53,399
hemp and lime and water for this and

278
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,339
this product is really good and stable

279
00:12:53,399 --> 00:13:00,000
in the jungle because the resistance of

280
00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:02,700
the ham grit can be 10 times more than

281
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,860
iron so it has a lot of benefits for

282
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:07,320
construction a lot of benefits for in

283
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:10,320
the environment but a lot and a really

284
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:13,139
good the impact in educating you know we

285
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:16,260
will have a museum and in this Museum we

286
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:19,320
will help and we will start working with

287
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:21,179
The Artisans of the community of umai

288
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,420
this community is a community in the

289
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:27,299
jungle and we want to provide them this

290
00:13:24,419 --> 00:13:30,479
community of artisan the hemp in

291
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:33,899
material for them to start working none

292
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:37,259
with cotton none with wood none with all

293
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:40,220
those uh Plastics and ceramic things but

294
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:43,078
with hemp you know and all the Artisans

295
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:46,019
of him so this is a beautiful project

296
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:48,299
when we are helping the community we're

297
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:50,339
helping the the jungle because we're

298
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:54,179
taking care of the rules of construction

299
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:56,220
in the jungle in order to do not go and

300
00:13:54,179 --> 00:14:00,019
destroy the place you know we're going

301
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:04,920
to coexist we we want to disconnect

302
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:07,139
our clients for the daily life the party

303
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:10,139
also in Tulum all those restaurants I

304
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:12,839
know of that area that is so crowd but

305
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:16,259
having your sanctuary in the jungle and

306
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:19,079
being near to the ocean near to the

307
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:22,200
sonatas and stay in the jungle that is a

308
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:24,659
beautiful experience and uh well this is

309
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:27,660
the reason why this attorney Quita firm

310
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:30,240
moved to this project and loves to talk

311
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:31,500
about uh these cannabis industry which

312
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,480

313
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,980
yeah it's amazing talking to you we're

00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:39,180
cultivation of him for fibers in the

316
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,800
building industry I think is one of

317
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:42,599
those sectors to keep your eye on for

318
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:44,578

00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:44,100
thank you very much Mariana people

344
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:45,539
rarely envisioned who built the road

345
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,980
when they're driving along it but

346
00:15:45,539 --> 00:15:49,198
somebody has to build the road to get

347
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,639
everybody there so I think there's a lot

348
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:52,379
of people in the world putting their

349
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,060
piece of effort into building that road

350
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:55,919
and thank you very much for your time

351
00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:57,359
