17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,439
how you got to where you are with sativa

18
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:40,799
learning and your your background and

19
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,640
time in canada

20
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:45,599
yeah sure so i i suppose this is a

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,640
fairly brief introduction to myself so

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,558
after university i worked as a

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,640
toxicology scientist

24
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:55,839
and the company i worked for created

25
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,280
drug testing kits for drugs of abuse and

26
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,840
one of the

27
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,719
panels i was involved with and tested

28
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,519
for synthetic cannabinoids and as well

29
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,400
as cannabis other prescription drugs

30
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,280
and and designer drugs or street drugs

31
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,840
so

32
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,640
that's kind of where i got my

33
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,880
introduction um

34
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,519
to the world of toxicology

35
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:19,679
did that for a few years um

36
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:22,719
and then later went off traveling and

37
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,159
and ended up in vancouver and when i was

38
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:28,079
in vancouver

39
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:30,880
i worked for the government um when just

40
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:33,118
shortly after they legalized um adult

41
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:37,118
use or recreational cannabis

42
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:38,719
in 2018 so i was on the phones taking

43
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:42,078
calls from the public on everything to

44
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:43,840
do with cannabis and educating um around

45
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:47,839
cannabis and eventually moved into a

46
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:50,399
training role where i would travel to

47
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,840
retail stores across british columbia

48
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,359
and educate the cannabis

49
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,280
consultants and

50
00:01:55,359 --> 00:02:00,399
yeah and moved home back to back to

51
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,280
belfast not too far away from you um

52
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,320
i think it was end of 2019 and that's

53
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,280
when i decided to set up sativa learning

54
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:12,159
um as an education platform for the

55
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,159
cannabis industry

56
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,799
okay amazing um so you've

57
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,878
got a fair deal of experience already

58
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,599
before you set up sativa learning and

59
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:23,598
knowing exactly what to teach can we

60
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:25,679
talk about the cannabis education

61
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:27,839
worldwide like we've got amsterdam over

62
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,560
the us legally have their own 101

63
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,759
version everybody seems to have that uh

64
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,439
that little introductory uh module for

65
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:37,120
everybody to get their grips around who

66
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:38,800
do you seen as having the best cannabis

67
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,560
education at the moment is it europe or

68
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,879
is it north america

69
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,959
i would say definitely north america um

70
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:47,199
as you say oaksterdam are probably one

71
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:51,039
of the the biggest leaders in the space

72
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:53,679
and green floor academy and are

73
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:54,959
also doing very well and

74
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,200
there's many others you know there's

75
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,878
cannabis training university tricom

76
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:01,439
institute there's quite a lot of these

77
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:03,280
platforms which are very successful

78
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,759
in north america

79
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,598
and i don't think that a leader is has

80
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:11,199
emerged yet here

81
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:13,119
um in the uk um even europe and beyond

82
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:15,598
you know i think even australia and new

83
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,280
zealand um

84
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:19,759
could do with a leader i know there is

85
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,759
one that started in in south africa

86
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:23,359
the name escapes me at the minute but

87
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:26,318
yes we're seeing a lot of cannabis

88
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,319
education platforms pop up at the minute

89
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:31,280
and i think if you look at what's

90
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:34,238
happening in north america

91
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,640
um colleges and universities are now

92
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,439
starting to offer cannabis education

93
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:41,759
programs and some of them in conjunction

94
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:43,439
with cannabis education platform so if

95
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:45,759
you look at what the future of the

96
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,919
cannabis industry is going to be like

97
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:50,158
it in it's my belief that it's going to

98
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:53,598
be like any other industry where you're

99
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:55,598
going to need some form of um you know

100
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:58,479
formalized credible training and

101
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:00,959
education and to secure

102
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:02,798
a position within the industry

103
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,039
and i think if you're unfamiliar with

104
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,879
the cannabis industry you might you know

105
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:08,318
you might be too sure as to why that is

106
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:11,759
but if you look at the industry as a

107
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:12,839
whole from seed to you know seed banks

108
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:16,639
genetics

109
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,798
cultivation and extraction purification

110
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,519
product formulation

111
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:24,159
and the retail side of things operating

112
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,680
the cannabis business cannabis policy

113
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,520
there's so many avenues and aspects to

114
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,478
the cannabis plant

115
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,079
um

116
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:34,639
you know and

117
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:36,560
whether it's wellness medical

118
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,160
recreational or even if you're looking

119
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,160
at the industrial hemp side which is a

120
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,360
whole other category as well

121
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,280
there is a need for um credible

122
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,240
formalized training in the industry so

123
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:47,359
that's

124
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,960
that's what we're trying to do with

125
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,720
sativa learning that's the reason it's

126
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:52,879
it's been set up

127
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,240
and when i returned home from canada i

128
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:56,639
noticed there was

129
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,600
um a big gap

130
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:02,319
in knowledge especially in the the cbd

131
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,800
industry so that's why we we released a

132
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:07,839
course on the cbd industry to provide a

133
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,160
comprehensive overview and for people

134
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:11,198
trying to get a better understanding

135
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,600
and what we're going to do is just

136
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,759
continue to add different courses where

137
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,840
we're now working on a medical cannabis

138
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,680
course with the medical cannabis

139
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:21,599
clinician society

140
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,240
and in the hopes that we can start

141
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,800
educating more clinicians on prescribing

142
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,560
cannabis based medicines

143
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,160
yeah well actually we'll kind of move

144
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,478
into the next topic now scenes that you

145
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,800
brought it up and it was educating

146
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:37,680
medical professionals this seems to be

147
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,680
the the hardest uh hurdle that a lot of

148
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,038
people are having to overcome is that

149
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,439
there is no doctors who know what

150
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:44,959
they're talking about generally and uh

151
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:45,839
nor they want to prescribe a medicine

152
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:47,680
that they don't know what they're

153
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,839
talking about what's going to be the

154
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,840
magic arrow that gets true to this is it

155
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:54,319
going to be targeting a specific

156
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:56,159
association of doctors and get them all

157
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:57,759
on board in one fell swoop is there

158
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,759
going to be some super celebrity doctor

159
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,199
that gets on board and a lot of them

160
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,120
start to follow what do you see

161
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,680
happening over the next six to 12 months

162
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,478
that'll help get the patients to access

163
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,720
to the products that they need

164
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:12,079
that's a hard one to

165
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,919
to

166
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:16,879
to answer you know what what's going to

167
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:19,439
be the there's so many factors involved

168
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:20,560
in why medical professionals are not

169
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:22,879
educated

170
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,038
on cannabis based medicines so so it's

171
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,879
tricky to say i mean the main reason as

172
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:28,879
you touched on is you know

173
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:30,240
there's just a lack of education for

174
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:32,560
them at the minute

175
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,639
um i think anybody that's familiar with

176
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,959
cannabis we'll we'll know a little bit

177
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,639
about the endocannabinoid system

178
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:41,680
so for anybody that doesn't know it was

179
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:44,240
only discovered in in the 1990s but it

180
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,400
has yet to make its way into

181
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,560
standard medical teaching whether that's

182
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:51,439
your continuing teaching as a medical

183
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,759
professional or when you're a student

184
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:55,759
um in university

185
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,479
um so i mean it's an end it's a

186
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,000
neurotransmitter system and doctors will

187
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:02,560
be familiar with the likes of the

188
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,478
serotonin system the dopamine system the

189
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,120
noradrenaline system

190
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:09,199
and but the vast majority of medical

191
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,598
professionals will have no understanding

192
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:15,199
of the endocannabinoid system

193
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:16,879
and it's vital to our our function and

194
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,240
i'm sure you've heard of dr ethan

195
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:19,598
rousseau

196
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,079
um he's a

197
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:24,000
a world-renowned cannabis researcher

198
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:26,478
and he uses the prime example that there

199
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,560
are more cannabinoid receptors in the

200
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:30,159
brain than there are for all other

201
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,759
neurotransmitters

202
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,720
put together

203
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:38,000
so it has a an overall role in memory

204
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,080
pain control sleep appetite and

205
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,079
temperature control

206
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:45,198
immune response and and that's the

207
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,399
reason why cannabis medicines can

208
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,360
um

209
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:51,120
you know benefit such a wide range of

210
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,240
medical conditions

211
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,879
and

212
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,400
it would be similar to you know a

213
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,960
mechanic knowing nothing about the

214
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:01,038
engine of a car that's that's how

215
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:03,038
important the endocannabinoid system is

216
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:05,279
to to our health

217
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:07,598
and and we have endocannabinoids in the

218
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:09,598
body that regulate that system and but

219
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:12,560
when that system is not functioning

220
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:15,360
optimally we can introduce cannabinoids

221
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,639
from cannabis and to supplement that and

222
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,680
and help

223
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,639
and

224
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,800
help bring about homeostasis in the body

225
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,680
and so so that's one of the i suppose

226
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,280
the main one is the lack of education on

227
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,759
the ecs

228
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:32,000
then there's the issue of

229
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,719
plant medicine and

230
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,240
versus you know single compound

231
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,839
pharmaceuticals

232
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,000
or more broadly i suppose people will

233
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,680
look at it as eastern medicine versus

234
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,599
western medicine

235
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,079
and so western doctors have been

236
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,680
conditioned to think about medicine in a

237
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,320
certain way

238
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:52,879
and usually that's as you know single

239
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,440
compound drugs to combat a certain

240
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:57,919
condition uh but cannabis doesn't really

241
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,440
fall into that that category so there

242
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:04,000
needs to be a a paradigm shift here

243
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,839
and cannabis contains

244
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,240
um hundreds of of active compounds it's

245
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:13,279
a polypharmacy in itself

246
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:16,639
and there are over 140 cannabinoids

247
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:17,600
there are over 100 terpenes and and 20

248
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,480
or more

249
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,399
flavonoids that all interact

250
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,800
and when ingested they interact with

251
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,559
each other synergistically to create an

252
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:29,120
overall effect which

253
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:31,439
is known as the entourage effect

254
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,440
and doctors are just not comfortable

255
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,399
with that at this stage they have no

256
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,920
training on botanical medicines

257
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,000
and um

258
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:42,159
a lot of that as well will be fear of

259
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,639
the unknown for them you know um a

260
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:47,199
doctor that's used to prescribing pills

261
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:48,399
um to a patient will be very

262
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,160
uncomfortable

263
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:54,399
um with a patient vaporizing dried flour

264
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:57,039
to to get relief for you know chronic

265
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,639
pain or whatever it happens to be

266
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:01,519
so those are a couple issues and then

267
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:03,519
when it comes to the um i suppose the

268
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:06,480
research side of things there is a lack

269
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,159
of randomized controlled trials um which

270
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,639
would be considered kind of the gold

271
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,078
standard for single pharmaceutical

272
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:15,679
compounds

273
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:18,000
um and there are some for cannabis and

274
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:19,599
and products like epidiolex have made it

275
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,559
to market through

276
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,360
you know

277
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:26,239
clinical trials and rcts

278
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,159
and but cannabis does not lend itself

279
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,799
very well to randomized controlled

280
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:34,159
trials again because there are

281
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:36,799
hundreds of active compounds which work

282
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:40,319
together to give an overall effect

283
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:43,599
and due to that lack of rcts and then

284
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,760
there are very restrictive guidelines

285
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,759
and so i'll use the example in the uk

286
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:49,120
because i i know a bit more about the uk

287
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:51,200
guidelines than

288
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,679
the ireland ones but

289
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,839
um nice they're the the national

290
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:58,559
institute of health care and excellence

291
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,720
so they provide guidelines to the nhs

292
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:02,559
for prescribing medicines

293
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,440
and their guidelines

294
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:08,319
for cannabis are very restrictive

295
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,480
and because they have not looked at

296
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,399
cannabis medicine as whole plant

297
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,360
medicine rather they've pushed it down

298
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,839
the the single compound route and only

299
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,800
looked at rcts which there are not many

300
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,800
of

301
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:23,439
and when really they should be looking

302
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:25,759
at real world evidence and case studies

303
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,279
and observational data

304
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:28,480
and so

305
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:31,200
because the guidelines are so

306
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,680
restrictive um even if a doctor was

307
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,278
educated and willing to prescribe

308
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:38,078
um

309
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:40,159
it it's not that it's frowned upon it's

310
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:42,879
it's just the the guidelines are very

311
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:44,879
restrictive for them to prescribe so

312
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:46,639
that's another issue there

313
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:48,399
okay and you might know actually there's

314
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:51,199
a couple of private clinics opened up in

315
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:54,000
manchester and london that were

316
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,560
prescribing cannabis to its patients how

317
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,559
have they fared and has that been a case

318
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:00,879
of they've literally just gone and found

319
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:02,799
a doctor and a nurse trained them up on

320
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:04,639
cannabis and then they can open up their

321
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:06,479
own practice to prescribe cannabis is it

322
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,959
as simple as that

323
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,000
i i don't know about how you know i

324
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,919
wouldn't know the ins and outs of

325
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,240
actually setting up a clinic what i do

326
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:16,240
know is that you have to be on the gmc

327
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,440
specialist register to prescribe

328
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,480
cannabis

329
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,120
so

330
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,920
the uk system is actually quite liberal

331
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,679
and that you can prescribe for any

332
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:28,240
condition

333
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:30,000
and it's just not within the guidelines

334
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,799
it's not remember recommended in the

335
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,039
guidelines but there's um

336
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:37,120
they don't recommend against cannabis

337
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:40,399
medicines let's say so at the minute

338
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,959
they have epidiolex nabalone and sativex

339
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,278
would be the approved prescription

340
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:47,599
cannabis based medicines so if you want

341
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:50,958
to prescribe an unlicensed cannabis

342
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,120
medication like dried flour or

343
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,479
a full spectrum oil

344
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,480
and

345
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,320
doctors will will be hesitant to do so

346
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,120
but at the minutes

347
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,879
and the latest figures

348
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,278
sorry to interrupt you there so if a

349
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:07,600
doctor did prescribe and say look i

350
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:09,439
recommend dried flour is that product

351
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,000
available to a consumer in the uk at the

352
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,399
moment yes at the moment it is it's just

353
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,679
considered an unlicensed medication so

354
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,399
that's why you have to be on the on the

355
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:20,239
gmc specialist register to prescribe it

356
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,799
so there are patients currently

357
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,360
receiving cannabis flower or cannabis

358
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:28,639
oil and again they are unlicensed

359
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,759
medications and but there are around six

360
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,799
thousand

361
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:32,720
um

362
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:34,879
private prescriptions so the problem is

363
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,639
you know private prescriptions of course

364
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:39,120
are very expensive

365
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,879
expensive and unaffordable for most

366
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,480
patients and but at the minute those

367
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:44,240
clinics have

368
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:48,240
i believe there's last time i talked to

369
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:50,480
professor barnes around 60 to 70 um

370
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,399
medical cannabis clinicians currently

371
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,600
prescribing in the uk they have

372
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,839
prescribed around six thousand um

373
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,600
unlicensed cannabis medications full

374
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:03,040
spectrum medications

375
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,360
and there are only three nhs

376
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:07,519
prescriptions um

377
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,800
in in the uk which is just shameful

378
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,799
really

379
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:12,078
yeah that's uh it's a bit of a drastic

380
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:14,479
ratio there and i'd love to get the

381
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:15,919
feedback in what negative connotations

382
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,399
have happened to any of the patients of

383
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:20,159
those six thousand i'd be uh willing to

384
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,919
better a large sum of money that it's

385
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,600
pretty much zero

386
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:26,319
yeah yeah absolutely and and the good

387
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,480
thing is um you know there's the likes

388
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,000
of project 2021 that don't know if

389
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,720
you've heard of that before through drug

390
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,679
science so they're aiming to enroll 20

391
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,399
000

392
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:37,838
cannabis patients um in

393
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,440
and create

394
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,880
one of the largest bodies of without

395
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,880
evidence for

396
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:45,039
for medical cannabis and that will be

397
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:46,958
you know real world evidence and that

398
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:48,319
they're providing there so

399
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:50,078
they are starting to release some of

400
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,839
their findings from that so it's it's

401
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:53,838
good to keep an eye on that as well to

402
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,519
see how cannabis

403
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,079
patients are getting on and they've had

404
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,560
some very positive results so far

405
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:02,319
