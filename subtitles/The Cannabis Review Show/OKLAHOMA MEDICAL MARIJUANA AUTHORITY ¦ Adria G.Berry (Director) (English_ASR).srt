in the industry can you maybe give

everybody a quick little overview of how

16
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,200
you ended up at the Oklahoma medical

17
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,000
marijuana and your position there sure I

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,980
was appointed to this position August of

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,899
2021 so it's been almost two years now

20
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:45,599
and I took the job

21
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:48,000
um at the request of uh the the Governor

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,160
of Oklahoma governor Kevin Stitt he

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,439
asked me to come in and see what was

24
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:55,198
going on see what needed to be done at

25
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:56,939
the time our department was under a

26
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,099
larger agency the State Department of

27
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:01,558
Health now we are actually a standalone

28
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,920
agency the legislature moved us over and

29
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:06,658
we are now our own state agency who our

30
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,340
entire job is to regulate and license

31
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:10,260
the medical marijuana industry and

32
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,478
patients in Oklahoma

33
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,920
okay very interesting we talked to one

34
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,560
of your residents there rightly at

35
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,299
business intelligence a businessman who

36
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,159
gave us a quick little overview of the

37
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,380
the industry but I kind of wanted it to

38
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,140
start at the first topic of

39
00:01:21,379 --> 00:01:28,739
implementation versus impact and

40
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,840
has everything that's been that they aim

41
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:32,640
to implement been implemented are there

42
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,618
things that got left off the the

43
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,478
licensing and what's been the impact the

44
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:38,578
biggest impact of the the laws that have

45
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,259
happened in Oklahoma

46
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:42,779
well I think if you're asking about

47
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:45,540
implementation for do you mean the

48
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,540
people who voted to legalize in in

49
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,979
Oklahoma in 2018 yeah and the laws I'm

50
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,540
sure at some stage a set of politicians

51
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:53,039
had to sit down and go okay how are we

52
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,780
going to implement this in the state of

53
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,118
Oklahoma state by state seems to have

54
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,460
been so varied and so different has the

55
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:01,799
impact been what the guy people who are

56
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:03,959
the ladies and men who've implemented

57
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,820
the laws been what they had hoped for or

58
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:08,038
has there been some lag in certain areas

59
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:09,719
yeah there have been well lots of

60
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:12,479
differing opinions and when State

61
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:14,280
question 788 it was a petition written

62
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,659
by citizens of Oklahoma that's what

63
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,520
legalized medical marijuana in Oklahoma

64
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:19,680
as I'm sure you've heard

65
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,659
um and that happened in June of 2018 the

66
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,879
people who wrote that and voted on that

67
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:25,979
voted for a very free market approach to

68
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:28,439
the medical marijuana industry so they

69
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,939
didn't have any there were no caps on

70
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:33,060
the number of plants that could be grown

71
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:35,459
there's no limit on the size of a grow a

72
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,199
cultivation facility there's no limit on

73
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:39,659
the number of commercial licenses that

74
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,759
we can grant no limit on the number of

75
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:43,680
patient licenses no qualifying

76
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:46,439
conditions so as you can tell from what

77
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,019
I'm saying it was a very free market

78
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:51,000
free approach to medical marijuana one

79
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:53,099
that hasn't been done in any other state

80
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,959
so Oklahoma has been the kind of the

81
00:02:53,098 --> 00:02:58,799
test case for how the free market works

82
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,840
and when it comes to medical cannabis so

83
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,700
um the session the legislative session

84
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,680
after that state question passed the

85
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:07,500
legislature did come in and wrote some

86
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:10,379
laws to to put a little bit of a

87
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,479
regulatory framework around the industry

88
00:03:10,378 --> 00:03:14,939
and I think that if you ask how the

89
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:17,939
implementation was intended versus the

90
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:20,459
impact I believe that all of the parties

91
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:23,459
involved would say there were definitely

92
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:23,459
unforeseen

93
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:29,400
um consequences of the way that the free

94
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:33,840
market approach worked uh one of those

95
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:36,360
is that the the very low

96
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,700
there's a very very low barrier to entry

97
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,340
into our industry which is not by itself

98
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:44,459
ever a bad thing right

99
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,860
um but what has happened in Oklahoma is

100
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:49,199
that even the criminal organizations are

101
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:51,659
getting an omma license or we're getting

102
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:53,818
an omma license they found ways to get

103
00:03:51,658 --> 00:03:56,098
around and so they look on the surface

104
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:57,298
like they're legitimate but they are

105
00:03:56,098 --> 00:04:00,000
actually

106
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:03,000
um not legitimate businesses so what's

107
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,419
happened is we are now

108
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,959
forced to to distinguish who is a

109
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:11,579
legitimate business owner versus who is

110
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:13,620
a criminal actor

111
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,959
um and that takes up a lot of our time

112
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,699
here at the regulatory agency so the

113
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:19,199
implementation versus the impact I would

114
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:22,439
say there were definitely some

115
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,478
unforeseen circumstances

116
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:26,579
and when it comes to Oklahoma excuse me

117
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:28,740
is it a blue or red state

118
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:32,159
it's a very red state

119
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:35,100
okay so it's uh it's great to see that

120
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,479
there was such an open uh uh platform to

121
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,860
be able to do these kind of things but

122
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:38,939
like with everything when you opened the

123
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,740
gates there's always going to be a few

124
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:42,959
little things that you need to tidy up

125
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,240
once the gate have been opened when it

126
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:47,159
comes to the regulatory framework the

127
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,900
more permissive license approach that

128
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,460
you guys had as you said there's some

129
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:52,859
nefarious actors getting into the market

130
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:54,839
that you didn't necessarily want is

131
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,639
there software or is there now a

132
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:59,099
separate uh agency within your

133
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,079
department that literally look after due

134
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:04,500
diligence for business owners and ensure

135
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:06,000
that everybody meets the high standards

136
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,860
we are

137
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,839
we're

138
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,360
seeing sale tracking last May so it's

139
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:14,399
been exactly one year that has helped us

140
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,319
tremendously by

141
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:18,299
um helping our inspectors who go out

142
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:20,159
into the field they do their research on

143
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,460
our cdcl tracking system before they go

144
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,720
out and compare the two so uh oftentimes

145
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:26,219
you're going to find that the criminal

146
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,759
actors or people who are trying to get

147
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:31,080
around the the rules are not utilizing

148
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,060
the seed to sell tracking system

149
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:36,719
appropriately that's just one way

150
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:39,360
another way that we are identifying the

151
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,400
uh Bad actors or the criminal actors in

152
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,100
the industry is on the front end on the

153
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:46,319
licensing end we've built up a an

154
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,539
investigative unit within our licensing

155
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:50,519
department that digs deeper into license

156
00:05:48,538 --> 00:05:53,639
applications so we know a little more

157
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:55,019
what to look for now to see if they are

158
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:57,720
trying to if these criminal

159
00:05:55,019 --> 00:06:00,000
organizations are trying to get into the

160
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,520
legitimate industry and we just are

161
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,959
doing our due diligence uh putting

162
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:06,538
astringent

163
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:09,120
read on every single commercial license

164
00:06:06,538 --> 00:06:11,819
application the first couple of years of

165
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,620
the program that was not the case

166
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:15,240
okay very interesting so for a country

167
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,399
let's say like Ireland over here in

168
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,079
Europe who looks like legalization is

169
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:20,819
coming around the corner what would be

170
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:23,219
made the two things that you would

171
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:25,439
recommend politicians and lawmakers

172
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:27,419
ensure that that is a part and a core

173
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:28,680
part of any industry from your previous

174
00:06:27,418 --> 00:06:30,719
experience

175
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,000
I would definitely recommend that you

176
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,919
have a

177
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,120
um Quality seed to sale tracking system

178
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:42,299
before you ever start allowing

179
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,699
cultivation processing and selling of

180
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:47,939
cannabis whether it's medicinal or adult

181
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:50,400
use and the reason there is not because

182
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:52,978
I'm thinking of it as an illegal product

183
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:55,198
termed legal I'm thinking of it as a

184
00:06:52,978 --> 00:06:57,240
product that at the end of the day a

185
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,280
consumer or a patient is going to inhale

186
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,699
into their lungs or apply to their skin

187
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:05,758
or consume we want to know that that is

188
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:08,819
safe and once cannabis becomes regulated

189
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,580
in a country or a state that is exactly

190
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:14,520
the expectation when a patient or a

191
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:16,379
consumer goes into a dispensary I want

192
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:18,180
to be able to say with confidence to

193
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:20,159
them that they can trust the products

194
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,560
they're purchasing and the only way they

195
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,300
can do that is if we are tracking it

196
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,339
making sure that it is tested properly

197
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:29,699
and we are doing our due diligence to

198
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:30,500
ensure that it's not a product that has

199
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:34,080
been

200
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:36,000
sold I on the illicit market and got

201
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,620
into their hands so at the end of the

202
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,139
day CD cell tracking is incredibly

203
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:42,780
important but another thing that I would

204
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:46,079
say is just making sure you have the

205
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:48,418
um correct uh to lawmakers I would say

206
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:50,279
make sure you're talking with people in

207
00:07:48,418 --> 00:07:52,439
the industry and talking with patients

208
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:55,679
so that you're not making laws without

209
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:59,639
their input because this is a very very

210
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,978
complex plant it is not

211
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:04,319
um cut and dry there is so much to know

212
00:08:01,978 --> 00:08:06,060
about cannabis regulation and you've got

213
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:09,300
to find the experts whether they're

214
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:11,819
industry patients scientists Physicians

215
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,918
consult with all of them to make sure

216
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:15,720
that you're ahead of a lot of the

217
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:18,180
technology and The Innovation that's

218
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,919
happening with cannabis

219
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,060
we have a king over here in Ireland

220
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:22,859
Huffman at the moment called the

221
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,598
citizens assembly and they're generally

222
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,639
gathered when there's got to be a new

223
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:29,219
change in laws whether it's gay marriage

224
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,199
or abortion rights we've now got one for

225
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,700
drugs that seems to be going very

226
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,139
positively and they seem to have done a

227
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,539
number of things that you recommended

228
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:37,259
there we're still dealing with some of

229
00:08:36,538 --> 00:08:38,958
the

230
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:41,278
let's say we'll call it misinformation

231
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,838
from specific either medical

232
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:44,700
professionals or outside medical

233
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:46,380
professionals has does that still

234
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,720
continue in Oklahoma as much as your

235
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:51,059
industry has been a success or is it

236
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,480
does it dumb down once the industry gets

237
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:56,039
going because it seems to come from

238
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,120
misinformed and uh completely out of

239
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:59,699
sync information

240
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,139
right no I that is something that I

241
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,000
think is going to take years and years

242
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:06,059
and it's just going to take a cultural

243
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,500
shift and that takes time you know but

244
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:11,699
even though we have such a large

245
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:14,220
industry a lot of the Oklahomans who

246
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,778
voted yes to legalize uh medical

247
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,879
marijuana did so because they thought

248
00:09:15,778 --> 00:09:20,338
okay well this is medicinal it will help

249
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:22,439
someone I'm going to vote Yes what ended

250
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:25,560
up happening in our the more rural parts

251
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,839
of our state uh some of these Bad actors

252
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:29,639
and criminal organizations moved in and

253
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,860
created and built these gigantic

254
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:34,259
cannabis Farms they took all the water

255
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:36,539
we have water is a finite you know

256
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:38,220
precious resource and in Oklahoma it is

257
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:40,079
an emotional

258
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,360
um thing people are very protective of

259
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,980
their water so a lot of these cannabis

260
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,720
farmers were not being good neighbors

261
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,240
and that's put a really bad taste in a

262
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,040
lot of oklahoman's mouths especially in

263
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,320
rural Oklahoma and if you've been

264
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:54,919
following we had a petition on the

265
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:59,519
ballot for adult use recreational

266
00:09:54,919 --> 00:10:03,059
cannabis use back in November no back in

267
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:05,639
March sorry and that failed it failed uh

268
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:07,559
by a pretty big margin and I believe

269
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:09,720
it's from what I'm saying to you that

270
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:11,939
the people who thought that medicinal

271
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,339
marijuana was just was to be helpful

272
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:16,380
have unfortunately

273
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:18,540
seen kind of the bad sides of the

274
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:21,000
industry in Oklahoma and

275
00:10:18,539 --> 00:10:23,159
and don't want any more of it so we have

276
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,600
not we've gone a little bit backwards on

277
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:26,579
that culture War as far as the

278
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,200
misinformation is kind of the bottom

279
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:30,060
line there

280
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,920
yeah it's very interesting as you said

281
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:34,319
that it's such an easy entry point into

282
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:35,879
this Market that anybody can get in you

283
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,680
seem to see that across the world in

284
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:39,600
cannabis that anybody with a bit of

285
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:40,919
money can get into is you then realize

286
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,540
once the industry's up and running to

287
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:44,458
that okay we need real players in here

288
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:46,620
we need to set boundaries and licenses

289
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:49,018
and all the variables that are going to

290
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:51,000
ensure that if it was the cocoa Market

291
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:52,860
or whether it was the vanilla Market

292
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,120
that they're all regulated to the same

293
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,100
standard

294
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,980
absolutely yes

295
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,060
and next last episode I'm going to let

296
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,620
you go in a couple of minutes because I

297
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:03,419
know you're very busy lady

298
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:07,078
um patient care and education when it

299
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:09,000
comes to Oakland is this um widespread

300
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:11,039
across the state are there a specific

301
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,500
private entity companies to take care of

302
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:15,120
patient care and education is it a is it

303
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,980
a capital Mark where anybody can open a

304
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,600
private Clinic have my own doctors and

305
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,860
once we have the patients everything up

306
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,899
and running or are there certain

307
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:24,480
Frameworks that are in place to hinder

308
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:25,980
patient access

309
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,079
pretty free market just like everything

310
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:29,519
else and what we're fine in Oklahoma

311
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:32,159
that goes back to what you were just

312
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:35,578
talking about is that the physicians in

313
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:37,379
Oklahoma have been resistant to learning

314
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:39,359
more about cannabis and recommending

315
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:40,980
cannabis so a lot of times they might

316
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,120
recommend for a patient to get their

317
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:45,659
patient card but then they don't really

318
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:50,339
have the education or the knowledge to

319
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:53,458
recommend dosage or type of consumption

320
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:55,140
so what has happened is uh some groups

321
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:57,539
have popped up that are not Physicians

322
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:58,919
that are more a patient Educators so

323
00:11:57,539 --> 00:12:04,259
they've been able to create their own

324
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:06,778
lane on educating patients and

325
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:09,179
I think that there's a lot of room to

326
00:12:06,778 --> 00:12:11,759
grow and we're working as the regulatory

327
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:14,159
agency to try to put together some

328
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:17,278
materials for patients based on science

329
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:18,179
and medical knowledge and research

330
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,220
um

331
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:21,719
it's still limited here in the U.S I

332
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,180
know I'm sure you know that from

333
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:27,000
everyone you've spoken to but you know

334
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:28,799
people like Dr grinspoon Who are

335
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,220
Physicians who have done the research

336
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:34,259
and do know the efficacy of it are

337
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:36,120
helpful to all of us because we're able

338
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:38,639
to point and say look

339
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,379
there are Physicians that have done this

340
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,379
research in Oklahoma they're a little

341
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:45,958
bit uh resistant still so patient and

342
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:48,240
education patient Education and Care

343
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:50,458
is really something that needs

344
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,680
Improvement here in Oklahoma

345
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:53,939
yeah it seems to be not the same way I

346
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:55,500
think across every state and every

347
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,500
country that I've talked to that the

348
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,000
current doctors are of a specific age

349
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,320
and it doesn't necessarily make sense

350
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
that we hope that the new wave of

351
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,639
doctors Coventry or actually learn about

352
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,578
the ECS and all of the various dosage

353
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:10,799
and ratios and profiles and even terpene

354
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:13,739
benefits that they can start formulating

355
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:16,219
good individual size medicines as

356
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:20,278
opposed to there's a one-size-fits-all

357
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:22,200
model and when it comes to Oklahoma over

358
00:13:20,278 --> 00:13:24,179
the next coming years what is your

359
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,639
biggest your top two things that you

360
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:30,059
want to see get enacted in Oklahoma

361
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:32,700
well for us we just want to do our job

362
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:34,199
and a part of what the past couple of

363
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,820
years have been since I came here was

364
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,320
just building the staff training the

365
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:40,079
staff to make sure that we're actually

366
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:43,019
out and uh checking in with businesses

367
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:44,159
doing compliance inspections uh paying

368
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:46,078
attention on the front end to these

369
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:47,639
licenses I want to see us working like a

370
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:49,259
well-oiled machine we're just not there

371
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:51,120
yet we're still a little clunky because

372
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:53,399
we're still you know a lot of our

373
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,200
departments in training mode learning it

374
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,778
takes time to learn all of our rules and

375
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,040
regulations so that's that's the goal

376
00:13:57,778 --> 00:14:01,439
for a year from now for us to be running

377
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:03,059
like a well-oiled machine with

378
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,380
transparency towards the industry and

379
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:06,539
patients where they know exactly what

380
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:07,799
we're doing and we try to we try to make

381
00:14:06,539 --> 00:14:10,439
sure they always know what we're doing

382
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:12,719
as the government body we are not ever

383
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:16,200
trying to hide the ball we want them to

384
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,920
know what to expect from us but that and

385
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,259
then

386
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:21,000
um

387
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:23,100
we are starting up our own quality

388
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,259
assurance lab and we're going to partner

389
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,480
with our Department of Agriculture to do

390
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:30,539
that and uh part of the reason we're

391
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:33,839
partnering with them is because of the

392
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:35,578
current uh insurgence of the hemp

393
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,139
derived cannabinoids that we're seeing

394
00:14:35,578 --> 00:14:38,638
all across

395
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:40,560
um I'm sure the world but definitely

396
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,778
across the United States that are

397
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:45,359
largely unregulated

398
00:14:42,778 --> 00:14:47,578
yeah hhc and Delta 8 are all over Europe

399
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,320
as well so yeah it seems to be they're

400
00:14:47,578 --> 00:14:51,000
making up a huge chunk of the actual

401
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,339
sales what's the size of the market in

402
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,919
Oklahoma on an annual basis

403
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:57,480
oh that's a great question I don't have

404
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:58,860
that number off the top of my head and

405
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,019
we actually just

406
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:02,399
um we have some data on our NCS

407
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:03,899
dashboard that might be helpful with

408
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,759
that but I don't I don't have it off the

409
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:07,740
top of my head I'm sorry I have to talk

410
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,059

fantastic talking Adrian hopefully when

417
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:20,459
Ireland starts getting some movement and

418
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:22,319
regulations we can touch base which

419
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:23,638
again and see what we can learn in

420
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,800
Europe from all the excellent work you
