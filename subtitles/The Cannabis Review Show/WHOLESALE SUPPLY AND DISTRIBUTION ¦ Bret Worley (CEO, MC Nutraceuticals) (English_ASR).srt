are one of the largest global suppliers

11
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:29,759
of Canada it's a great to talk to you

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,320
about distribution and wholesale supply

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,700
do you maybe want to give everybody a

14
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,859
quick little 30 second 60 second

15
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,960
overview of how you came about being a

16
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:38,700
part of MC neutral nutraceuticals and

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,439
what you guys do

18
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,739
yeah sure I've been I've been in the

19
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:45,539
hemp industry since May of 2019. I first

20
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:47,099
started with a chromatography

21
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,738
remediation company where we just

22
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,480
removed THC from CBD

23
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:53,699
um that business model wasn't all that

24
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:55,198
feasible during the crash of CBD pricing

25
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:58,020
crashes

26
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,939
um and eventually I pivoted into my my

27
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:03,600
own holy identity I called MC

28
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:06,239
nutraceuticals and we now distribute and

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,379
manufacture the 39 cannabinoids that are

30
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:09,539
derived from hemp that are currently

31
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:11,640
available in the market we are one of

32
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,260
the only companies that offers every

33
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,200
Cannon really that is offered on the

34
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,880
market and we've you know in the last

35
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,159
two and a half years we've gained quite

36
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:23,819
the market share in the US and also

37
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,400
abroad where we ship to 19 countries

38
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:27,959
okay incredible so when it comes to I

39
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,540
was looking at the list you guys have 42

40
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:32,519
types of cannabinoids available on your

41
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,860
list when it comes to selecting these

42
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:36,179
cannabinoids is that outside suppliers

43
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:37,859
that you end up going and do

44
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,540
Partnerships for and you're kind of the

45
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:42,239
center point of this industry or are you

46
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,618
cultivating or biosynthesizing your own

47
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:45,539
molecules

48
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:47,159
we do a little bit of everything we are

49
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,259
more of a distribution so we'll contract

50
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,140
manufacture out with other labs that are

51
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,000
in local to Denver Colorado usually

52
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,680
um and then we do our own r d our own

53
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,420
analytics in-house and we also do some

54
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,040
small scale Manufacturing

55
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,140
so a lot of times we'll build it and

56
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,200
then have someone else go scale it

57
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,700
and in terms of the r d process can you

58
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,618
speak to that how long does it take for

59
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,699
you guys to figure out okay this is kind

60
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:11,038
of annoy we're going to bring to Market

61
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:13,378
obviously is it what are these hair long

62
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,818
as a piece of string each one is gonna

63
00:02:13,378 --> 00:02:17,039
be different

64
00:02:14,818 --> 00:02:18,419
yeah so I mean there's there's the uh

65
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:19,919
the chicken in the egg scenario

66
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:21,179
sometimes you know what does the market

67
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,699
need

68
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,900
um versus how long the r d processes and

69
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:27,000
then sometimes things just kind of fall

70
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,620
in your lap or a chemists you know make

71
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,680
something that's that's needed in the

72
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,599
market essentially so r d processes can

73
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,520
happen take up to a year and sometimes

74
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:37,079
they're as short as is three months uh

75
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,239
one of the big hurdles is standard

76
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,260
creation so we have to actually contract

77
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,019
that out

78
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:44,939
uh you know 99.99 reference standard

79
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:46,500
with an outside company and then we take

80
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:47,939
that to a third party who does a you

81
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,159
know third-party review on it make sure

82
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:52,139
it is what it is run an NMR and then

83
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:53,280
they'll they'll essentially start using

84
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:55,259
that for testing in the market so

85
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,000
testing is one of the hurdles obviously

86
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:59,939
just the basic r d all of our products

87
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,039
are essentially 95 pure if not 99 a lot

88
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:03,539
of times they are 99 pure

89
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:05,579
um so also just getting to that point

90
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:07,079
where everything is pure free of toxins

91
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,760
we run everything through a toxicology

92
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,900
lab that's local to us to make sure that

93
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:11,340
there isn't any other products

94
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,560
byproducts essentially made in the

95
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,360
process and then after that process

96
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,739
we're able to fully distribute it once

97
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,420
it's third party tested ran through

98
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:19,739
toxicology

99
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:21,179
um and then there there's a need in the

100
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:22,439
market sometimes you make something and

101
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,459
it's not necessarily needed in the

102
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:25,620
market

103
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:27,360
and when it comes to the need in the

104
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:29,819
market are you highlighting

105
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,099
opportunities and seeing let's say cbga

106
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:33,359
for Cosmetics or whatever it may be and

107
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:35,878
then you're going to Pivot to these

108
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,379
clients or is there smaller let's say

109
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:38,818
Distributors and wholesalers below you

110
00:03:37,378 --> 00:03:40,739
guys that are dealing directly with

111
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:42,298
formulation companies or with Brands who

112
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:43,560
are looking to create a new product

113
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:45,959
range

114
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,299
you know part of part of our or my

115
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,459
company is is the ability to do business

116
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:51,719
development for our clients

117
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:54,420
um so our clients are always looking for

118
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:56,359
the newest best thing that's does X you

119
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:59,039
know for example way back in the day CDN

120
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,980
uh helps with sleep so what happens when

121
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:03,120
you mirror CBN and put THC with it you

122
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:05,039
know you have a you have a hell of a

123
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,420
sleep product so

124
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:08,039
um you know I think part of it's us

125
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:09,539
doing the own formulations for other

126
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,679
people we test it out we send it out

127
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:14,280
that's part of the business development

128
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,659
press product uh product development uh

129
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,459
so we do a lot of that in-house for our

130
00:04:15,658 --> 00:04:19,079
clients you know we see ourselves as you

131
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:20,699
know you buy from us sure and if we just

132
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:22,560
want to keep a transactional that's fine

133
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:23,939
but you know if you want to have a

134
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,379
deeper relationship with us we'll tell

135
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:27,600
you what to do or what we think is

136
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:29,040
working on the market we have over 300

137
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,479
clients internally and then we probably

138
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,360
distribute to another

139
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:35,639
400 500 indirectly through Brokers or

140
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,560
contract manufacturers or people like so

141
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,360
we have we probably have one of the best

142
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,819
understandings of what sells and what

143
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,860
doesn't from the top down View and then

144
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:45,060
we also take feedback down from the

145
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,500
people that are actually Distributing

146
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,180
straight to stores you know smoke shops

147
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,680
gas stations grocery stores wherever it

148
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,240
is

149
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,400
and when it comes to you guys have a

150
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,840
global presence now in 17 18 countries I

151
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:57,120
think you mentioned before we came on

152
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:58,319
air and in terms of the logistics and

153
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,899
the distribution of these kind of

154
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:03,659
products are you so sourcing more at a

155
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:06,179
local area or is the ability to take

156
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:08,040
these across the Atlantic across the

157
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,060
Pacific pretty easy for a company of

158
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,280
your size

159
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:13,199
sure yeah so we have a distribution or

160
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:14,698
fulfillment center in pills and Prague

161
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,160
or I mean pills and Czech Republic's

162
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:18,419
about an hour outside of Prague so we we

163
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,340
said most of our product there for

164
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:22,680
inventory for what's needed in the the

165
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:24,299
EU Market the EU Market's a lot smaller

166
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,819
so there's only five or six cannabinoids

167
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,259
that really do sell so it's not a big uh

168
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:31,199
ask for us we don't have the inventory

169
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:33,360
all 42. uh so we send that over to there

170
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,340
and then then we can distribute it easy

171
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,038
through the EU

172
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:39,779
okay very interesting and when it comes

173
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:42,240
to now sustainability for the industry

174
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:44,638
moving forward as it's these molecules

175
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,319
are going to become more uh more sought

176
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,300
after and more looked after do you see

177
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:49,978
biotechnology companies filling a space

178
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,600
especially in the European Union where

179
00:05:49,978 --> 00:05:52,978
regulations might be a little bit

180
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,800
stricter and they want their replicable

181
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:57,180
molecule over and over again what do you

182
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,220
think the biotechnology companies are

183
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,600
going to play in the the ingredient side

184
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,300
of things for you

185
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,439
yeah I'm I I'm not sure I I guess they

186
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,699
probably would call them biotechnology

187
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:08,879
companies I know there's a few already

188
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:10,259
in Europe but the U.S um and I'll just

189
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:12,719
say this because I'm from the US but the

190
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:15,120
US is years ahead of where Europe is and

191
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,280
we're seeing that on an economic level

192
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,360
um on a sophistication level regulation

193
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:20,579
level we're kind of seeing everything

194
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,259
we're kind of seeing I would say you

195
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:23,879
know once Delta 8 was introduced to the

196
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:26,520
market in the U.S I would say Europe's

197
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:28,199
about a year after that so you know

198
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,639
still in its infancy to a certain degree

199
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:31,020
where people are still kind of wondering

200
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,579
what it is

201
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:34,799
um you know in Europe that's mainly

202
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:37,079
hexahydrocannon which is hhc that's the

203
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,060
big product that we see over there

204
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:41,038
um you know so I think there's still a

205
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,720
lot of growing and evolution done over

206
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:43,978
there I mean we're you know I spend my

207
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,919
time going to Europe and educating

208
00:06:43,978 --> 00:06:48,120
regulators and politicians about similar

209
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:50,519
stuff

210
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,478
um sorry one second lost my screen

211
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:54,299
um

212
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:55,500
so I think they're still fairly early on

213
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,000
so I'm not sure if someone would enter

214
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,038
the market because we haven't seen any

215
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,959
biotech companies for the most part

216
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:01,740
enter the US hemp Drive cannabinoid

217
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,879
Market

218
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,199
um once again I think there is some

219
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,060
which you would consider biotech

220
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:08,340
companies maybe in the water soluble

221
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,978
space specifically so we do see people

222
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:13,198
claiming they're a biotech company but

223
00:07:10,978 --> 00:07:15,240
we haven't seen anyone biotech

224
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,740
large-scale Manufacturing in the US most

225
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,240
people that are manufacturing a large

226
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,098
scale were already in the you know

227
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,360
they're CBD manufacturers typically

228
00:07:20,098 --> 00:07:23,038
because they already had most of the

229
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,538
equipment and the infrastructure to

230
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:26,399
build out from there

231
00:07:24,538 --> 00:07:28,259
so the companies let's say the buyers

232
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:29,879
synthesize their own cell line and are

233
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:32,759
able to use Advanced fermentation

234
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:34,560
techniques they're not so much supplying

235
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:36,180
the recreational industry in the US is

236
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,680
that more pharmaceutical so yeah that's

237
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,060
that's exactly how it put it there

238
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,340
there's I'm sure there's some r d

239
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,418
companies out there there always is uh

240
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:44,638
but as far as the commercial

241
00:07:42,418 --> 00:07:46,079
availability on a scale we're seeing

242
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,918
most of the products still being made

243
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:51,899
from you know original 2018 Farm you

244
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:54,000
know uh hemp Farm manufacturers

245
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:55,500
essentially so typical extraction all

246
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,300
the way to isolate and then isolates

247
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:02,399
then used to be converted to Delta a

248
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:05,460
Delta 10 hhc CBN thcv Etc

249
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:07,318
and moving on to the intoxicating hemp

250
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:10,138
derivatives seems to be the new buzzword

251
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:13,259
that I'm reading from America that seems

252
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:14,400
to Encompass all of the hhc and Delta 8

253
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:16,860
that you've been already speaking about

254
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:19,500
we we see hhc all over Europe you can

255
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,660
buy jellies in the regular kind of old

256
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,399
head store now in Dublin it's gotten so

257
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,780
far over here do you think that they're

258
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:26,839
here to stay I was looking at some of

259
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:29,459
the figures from Bob Holman's article on

260
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:31,978
uh Forbes that basically gave some of

261
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:33,899
the size of the numbers that these uh

262
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:37,439
these products and these are bringing

263
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:39,599
into the industry are they here to stay

264
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,339
as long as I have my way so I'm already

265
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,320
spending time over in Europe as I

266
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:45,120
mentioned and you know educating people

267
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,519
on what these products are why they're

268
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,959
safe why you should allow them

269
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,879
um you know the best way to describe it

270
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:53,338
is you know obviously Bob hoban's

271
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:55,200
article is a good one to reference Beau

272
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:57,480
Whitney's The Economist that's doing a

273
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,800
lot of work on the U.S hemp industry

274
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,959
who's probably going to start working on

275
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:03,059
some of the European hemp industry uh

276
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:05,159
we're seeing you know Florida has now

277
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:07,018
become the largest cannabis Market in

278
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:08,899
the world it's a 6.9 billion dollar

279
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:10,860
retail Market which passes California

280
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:14,039
and that was done in three years

281
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:16,560
essentially so I you know I think it

282
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:19,379
would be wise to at least slow down on

283
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:22,018
any types of bans such as Austria or

284
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:23,700
Switzerland or I think Finland now I

285
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:26,820
think it would be wise and for an

286
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:28,860
economic level to slow down their their

287
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,899
you know the other thing is safety um

288
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,220
with safety needs regulations so we

289
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:35,519
we're going to propose tomorrow actually

290
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:37,500
in our press conference uh in czechia uh

291
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,299
regulations that we would suggest would

292
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,980
be deemed appropriate we've also done

293
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:43,559
the same thing in Alabama Kentucky

294
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,480
Tennessee and now Florida you know the

295
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:46,859
the main ones 21 plus behind the counter

296
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,600
if you're an adult and you want to

297
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,000
consume cannabis I think you should be

298
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,800
allowed to and I use cannabis as the

299
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,139
plant so any cannabinoid in the plant

300
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:55,799
whether it's hht or CBN or thcv it

301
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:57,120
doesn't matter to me if it's

302
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:59,458
psychoactive or not it's all comes from

303
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,100
the cannabis plant at some point

304
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:04,439
um so I I am recommending regulation in

305
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,540
all these countries in Europe and I

306
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,959
believe it to be a huge economic driver

307
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:12,360
whilst we wait for regulation and

308
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:14,759
legalization of marijuana which is still

309
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:17,639
probably you know years out maybe for

310
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:19,259
Germany for full-blown legalization

311
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:21,600
um and then who knows for the rest of

312
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:22,259
the you know the European Union

313
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,120
um

314
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:25,379
we've also seen in the hemp industry

315
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,320
that

316
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:31,019
um moderate regulation is significantly

317
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,760
more powerful for medical patients

318
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:35,459
recreational patients any type of

319
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:37,379
patient or consumer

320
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:39,000
um then medical or recreational Cannabis

321
00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:41,519
the recreation of medical cannabis did

322
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,778
about 33 billion last year we think the

323
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,220
number which we'll have in the next

324
00:10:42,778 --> 00:10:45,958
three to four months so Beau Whitney is

325
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,639
over 40 billion for the U.S hemp

326
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:49,078
industry so keep in mind the hemp

327
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:50,338
industry has been around since 2018 the

328
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:53,338
U.S cannabis Market has been around

329
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:55,019
since 2012 roughly

330
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:57,600
um so what the Cannabis industry did in

331
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:59,879
12 years we were able to do in four or

332
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,159
five so we're about twice as fast as

333
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:04,078
they are from a distribution economics

334
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:06,659
perspective and then on top of that

335
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:08,578
we've expanded the Cannabis science to

336
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:10,620
include 42 cannabinoids where the

337
00:11:08,578 --> 00:11:11,879
marijuana industry only does four or

338
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,019
five and that's not because the

339
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:15,059
marijuana industry doesn't want to

340
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:17,399
that's because they're over regulated

341
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:19,500
the point where they can't adopt and

342
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:24,059
innovate fast whether it's Capital

343
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:25,679
whether it's just regular in general

344
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:27,059
the hip industry is moving at a pace

345
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:28,699
that you just can't keep up with and

346
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:31,319
that's why I think it is here to stay

347
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,940
especially in the U.S the European Union

348
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,620
will see how fast I can get out there

349
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,260
and educate everybody on the on the

350
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:39,839
topic is

351
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:41,338
yeah I think uh it's got to be one of

352
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,300
these sectors where different parts of

353
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:44,820
the world are just going to be

354
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:46,199
completely differently uh legislated and

355
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,278
different range of products I don't

356
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,259
think there's going to be a translate

357
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:52,320
from North America over into Europe at

358
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:54,120
all I think with 2027 countries in the

359
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,440
European Union they're all completely

360
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,078
different than a completely different

361
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,339
needs at once but I think the the

362
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:01,500
advancements that are happening in

363
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:04,500
Germany and Prague and Switzerland are

364
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:07,019
are sign of things to come and hopefully

365
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:09,659
that uh the Czech Republic roll back the

366
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:12,419
laws that they changed and just recently

367
00:12:09,659 --> 00:12:14,399
regarding CBD

368
00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:15,719
yeah I think I I don't understand the

369
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,000
law I don't think there's actually a law

370
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,459
put in place I could be misunderstanding

371
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,078
it but then and Prague you can't or in

372
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:23,879
the Czech Republic you can't and I think

373
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:25,859
this is European Union too you can't

374
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:27,419
advertise CBD at all essentially so I

375
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,639
think that's more of what the Department

376
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:31,078
of Agriculture was saying which is kind

377
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:34,019
of more the same the way I understand

378
00:12:31,078 --> 00:12:35,458
CBD is it's a novelty item you know you

379
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:37,259
want it you buy it there's no

380
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:39,059
information about it whatsoever it's you

381
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:41,519
know it's like a knick-knack essentially

382
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:43,319
that you can eat so I I think that's one

383
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,539
of the part of the the proposed changes

384
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,220
to the regulation is like listen you

385
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:51,000
want the people at the store educating

386
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:53,278
people on CBA CBD CBN hhc whatever it is

387
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,039
so they they can responsibly consume it

388
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:58,139
it doesn't matter what it is so you know

389
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:59,399
I I think that obviously I truly believe

390
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:01,019
there's a misstep by the Department of

391
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:02,639
Agriculture there or the Ministry of

392
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:04,620
Agriculture

393
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,180
um but that's why I'm here to try to

394
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,620
educate you know before before I started

395
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:08,879
talking to some of the advisors of the

396
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,620
Prime Minister and the health Ministry

397
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:12,600
there's there's just no one to do it so

398
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,339
once you start educating people I think

399
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,620
people start to understand the economics

400
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:18,480
the safety understand the product and

401
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:20,278
why it's important

402
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,379
yeah I couldn't agree with you more out

403
00:13:20,278 --> 00:13:24,179
of the 44 kind of a noise that you guys

404
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:25,559
work or what are the top three in the

405
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:27,120
Market at the moment and do you think

406
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:29,159
those top three are going to change over

407
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,860
the next five to ten years

408
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:33,719
yeah I'll preface was probably not

409
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:36,778
um but the top one in the US is to help

410
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,278
eight uh for example we sell about a

411
00:13:36,778 --> 00:13:40,139
thousand kilos a week at Delta so it's

412
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:43,019
about a billion doses

413
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:45,360
um so the scale is quite un pretty

414
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:47,459
unfathomable about how much just our

415
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,459
company does and you know there's 15 20

416
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:52,138
30 alike the US is consuming billions

417
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:53,879
and billions and billions of doses a

418
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:55,919
month which is just

419
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:57,360
it's it's great honestly to see that

420
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:58,679
people actually want this product they

421
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,000
want to consume this product and it

422
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:01,620
helps them

423
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,720
um so the biggest ones Delta in the US

424
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:06,778
the second biggest or the first biggest

425
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,278
in Europe is hhc obviously and that's

426
00:14:06,778 --> 00:14:11,100
about the same you know we said about

427
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:13,439
500 to 800 kilos a month sometimes a

428
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,000
thousand on a good month to Europe so

429
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,220
we're seeing a similar demand there's

430
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,839
obviously less competition as importing

431
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:21,839
hhc there's also less people that make

432
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:24,660
hht in the US so the demand's still not

433
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:27,120
clear it's not quite as much but Delta

434
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:30,120
Eight's the king here in the U.S HCC is

435
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,560
the king in the EU and then

436
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,060
I'm trying to think of the second

437
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:33,778
biggest one

438
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:35,338
um

439
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:36,958
you know I'll tell you my favorite just

440
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:38,399
because at the top of my head you know

441
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,899
there is a there is a huge gap in

442
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,940
between Delta 8 and the next one

443
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:43,860
essentially on a volume basis my

444
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,940
favorite cannabinoids are CVN and thcv I

445
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:47,699
think they have the best known

446
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:49,019
therapeutical benefits thcv is now

447
00:14:47,698 --> 00:14:51,000
coming down to a price where I think

448
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:52,320
people are going to start formulating in

449
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,360
with their Delta eights or whatever

450
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,760
product it is

451
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,440
um you know I can't make claims but CBN

452
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:01,319
let's just say it's good at night time

453
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,820
and THV is good in the morning so

454
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,620
um you know those products are have

455
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:06,959
serious promise and I'm glad that the

456
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,698
hemp industry was able to make those uh

457
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:10,739
at scale

458
00:15:08,698 --> 00:15:12,359
um and I I foresee that those are going

459
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:15,120
to be huge products on the medicinal

460
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,919
side in the next let's call it 12 months

461
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,899
