00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:03,599
foreign

2
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:12,839
welcome everybody to the next episode of

3
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:15,179
the Cannabis review I am delighted to be

4
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:18,240
joined to this episode by Dr Rob O'Brien

5
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:19,920
who's the CEO and CSO at Supra research

6
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:22,079
and development in Canada how are you

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,400
keeping today Rob good it's been a

8
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:26,459
beautiful day here to the morning here

9
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:28,618
it's a little grip but it's nice

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm delighted to have you on I've been

11
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:32,399
reading all your latest publishings

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,500
based on the testing and research that

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,880
you guys have been doing at Supra do you

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,738
maybe want to give everybody just a

15
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,579
quick little overview in 30 seconds or a

16
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:40,919
minute

17
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:42,420
um how super came to be on your work uh

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,760
so far in the industry

19
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,460
yeah for sure I like to say I'm a

20
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:49,259
reformed academic I was a university

21
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,558
press Professor for a number of years

22
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:55,920
and we spun out a company super research

23
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:59,640
and development uh over time uh we ended

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,379
up getting into the um uh lab testing

25
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,319
base and then started getting the proper

26
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:05,759
licenses to test for cannabis uh at

27
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,559
which time there was a lot of companies

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,439
that wanted to that was pretty um

29
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,420
pre-legalization so they thought that by

30
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:14,339
having our license and their portfolio

31
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,560
they'd have a quicker path to uh

32
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,900
legalization so we're eventually

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,540
purchased by Valen's uh grow works

34
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,000
became the valance company uh and after

35
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,360
a year or so there I spun back to my

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,280
main Supra research and development

37
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:30,900
we not only do cannabis products but we

38
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,618
also do other Natural Health Products

39
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:36,600
and contract research work as well

40
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:41,118
okay very interesting so wealth of

41
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:43,739
experience first question is the iso

42
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:45,920
iec17025 accreditation that you guys has

43
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:49,199
is that the licensed

44
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,379
specifically test and work with cannabis

45
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,540
no ISO 17025 is an international

46
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:57,179
standard out of the international

47
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,100
standards Association uh Europe actually

48
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,979
France I think

49
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:04,618
um and it is a standard for any Testing

50
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:06,599
Lab it's basically a guideline to your

51
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:09,060
quality manual how you validate the

52
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:12,060
methods and part of that means that you

53
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:14,159
have periodically people come on site go

54
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,360
through your data with a fine-tooth comb

55
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,359
to make sure that you're collecting

56
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,040
things appropriately it doesn't prevent

57
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,440
Labs from cheating but it there's

58
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:25,019
there's a lot more oversight and for

59
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:27,659
consumers of the lab services they can

60
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:30,719
trust that it allows there's ISO 1705

61
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:32,000
accredited that they are capable of

62
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,859
doing the work

63
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,080
okay very good the first topic I wanted

64
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,780
to jump onto was the latest research on

65
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,519
THC levels there's been a a lot of

66
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,500
conversation as I'm sure you know in the

67
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,080
industry about there's no need for high

68
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,639
THC whereas some manufacturers seem to

69
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,560
think that high THC is the unique

70
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:51,299
selling point for them what is the

71
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,180
latest research that you guys have been

72
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,560
conducting on testing THC levels well

73
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,780
we've got to be careful with this

74
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,420
because my personal opinion is high THC

75
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,759
isn't everything it clearly isn't

76
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:06,299
um but in Canada when they brought the

77
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:07,739
legislation into legalized cannabis the

78
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,319
only thing that they allowed on the

79
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:13,200
label were the THC and CBD values

80
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:14,780
because the last thing they wanted is to

81
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,219
attract uh

82
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:18,780
youth to to that so they didn't want to

83
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:22,080
have appealing marketing that would do

84
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:23,699
that so the consumers then had only one

85
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,819
thing to take a look at and that was the

86
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:29,339
THC content versus the price and then

87
00:03:26,818 --> 00:03:33,179
over time we've seen a steady increase

88
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:35,098
in THC values from the products uh We've

89
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:38,400
even recently tested products that were

90
00:03:35,098 --> 00:03:40,798
legitimately over 30 THC

91
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,519
um so so this as this has happened it's

92
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:47,040
gone up and at the same time uh the our

93
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:50,580
our legal system has provincial

94
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:52,500
purchasing uh uh governments uh buying

95
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,900
the material from the producers and

96
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:58,259
they've set thresholds for THC purpose

97
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:00,180
as quality higher and higher so right

98
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:02,519
now uh you know if you don't have a

99
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,280
product that's 27 you're not considered

100
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:08,939
a prime quality product uh that's

101
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,979
absolutely uh ridiculous however

102
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:13,259
um our focus is not even talking about

103
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:16,139
that is if you put something on a label

104
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:19,019
we expect that you have within let's say

105
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:21,660
20 or 10 percent of that uh the correct

106
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:24,899
uh amount though

107
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:28,080
okay um can you tell me is the testing

108
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:29,879
for the THC levels being done just as uh

109
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,199
drawing and cultivation is finished or

110
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:32,819
is it after it's been put through

111
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,560
certain Machinery that we're losing

112
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:36,240
trichomes along the way

113
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,399
yeah this is part of the part of the

114
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,340
problem here

115
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:43,079
what's happening is that Health Canada

116
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:45,839
is requiring their certificate of

117
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:47,399
analysis or COA in the back from each

118
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:49,679
batch and they need things on

119
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:52,620
contaminants like pesticides Metals Etc

120
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,740
but they're also I need one on on the

121
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:57,899
content of the uh

122
00:04:54,740 --> 00:05:01,079
cannabinoids and the issue with that is

123
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:03,478
that there's a high variance between uh

124
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:06,300
buds within a plant and then we have a

125
00:05:03,478 --> 00:05:08,639
whole lot across the plant and then as

126
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,520
these uh buds are going through the

127
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,978
processing uh and mechanical handling

128
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:17,758
you can lose trichomes which reduces the

129
00:05:13,978 --> 00:05:20,159
THC content uh so if you use a COA from

130
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:23,038
the Harvest that is pristine material

131
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,199
and maybe maybe you're leaning on the

132
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:27,180
scan a little bit by selecting just the

133
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,400
top Buds and maybe de-stemming them or

134
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,500
something like that uh you'll end up

135
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:33,719
with a very high COA which gets you a

136
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:36,120
sale but if you use that on all your

137
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,460
package labels uh particularly the small

138
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:42,060
buds the one gram packages which have

139
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:45,180
typically three or four buds in it these

140
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:47,280
are these buds are 30 or so less than

141
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,740
the the biggest ones and that's kind of

142
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:51,719
what we expect is happening uh but it's

143
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,418
an inappropriate use of a testing

144
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:57,479
protocol so with testing we need to be

145
00:05:54,418 --> 00:06:00,959
fit for purpose uh so testing of one one

146
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:02,699
test and a lot does not really reflect

147
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,258
on what is in the packages and it's in

148
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:06,079
the packages that the consumer needs to

149
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:09,538
be considerable

150
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:11,279
okay so you've got obviously producers

151
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:13,139
and manufacturers looking to test as

152
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:15,599
much as the government are doing their

153
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:17,939
own tests and one wants to test at one

154
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,919
stage where it's at its premium and the

155
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:21,360
actual test that matters is what's in

156
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:22,258
the package when it goes under the

157
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,419
shelves

158
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:26,639
yeah well let's be to be clear the the

159
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:29,219
responsibility for testing is into the

160
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,960
quality assurance person of the producer

161
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,000
they're the ones that are responsible

162
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:35,939
for verifying the lab can do accurate

163
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,860
results and they're responsible for the

164
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:41,038
the numbers that go on to the final

165
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:43,680
label the government has been doing some

166
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:46,560
spot testing as I understand it but they

167
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,918
haven't been publicly disclosing uh uh

168
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,199
things uh so the only way we're getting

169
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:54,959
this out there is when a group like

170
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:56,879
myself is doing this uh type of study

171
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:58,939
and just revealing pulling the the sheet

172
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:02,659
back and seeing what's underneath it

173
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:05,579
okay so you guys at Super basically

174
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:08,220
work on higher quality and safer

175
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:10,198
products for big Brands is there a

176
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,639
specific territory in Canada that do you

177
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:14,340
think has the highest quality and the

178
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:16,620
safest products and if so is is it

179
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:19,379
applicable to America for the same

180
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:21,660
uh let's uh let's sort of step back with

181
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:24,839
that quote then answer this inflation of

182
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:26,280
the THC values is uniquely a North

183
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:29,038
American problem

184
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:31,138
and it's because the higher THC labeled

185
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:34,199
products sell more and sell for more

186
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:36,180
money it is simply that

187
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:38,580
um now when we did our tests we looked

188
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,978
at the BC cannabis source so it's only

189
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:43,620
one part of the each province in Canada

190
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:47,339
has its own purchasing agents and that

191
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:49,680
so we can't speak for unified but 93 of

192
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:53,038
the products we tested were more than 50

193
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,740
15 of the label 87 percent were more

194
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:57,779
than 20 percent and we even had 26

195
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,699
percent that were more than 40 below the

196
00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:03,239
label claim nothing meant the label

197
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:04,919
claim and in a normal uh sort of study

198
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,478
you would expect that a plus or minus

199
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:07,560
should be above and below that's that's

200
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:09,719
what you would expect for normal

201
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,160
statistics but we're not seeing that

202
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,220
here

203
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:17,580
um I think that a lot of them producers

204
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:19,379
and let's let's not be wrong here BC but

205
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:20,939
even before legalization has been

206
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:23,039
regarded as some of the highest quality

207
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:25,620
product in the world

208
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:27,538
um and and I believe that is true but

209
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,098
there's just this pushed that the only

210
00:08:27,538 --> 00:08:31,560
way they can get their products sold is

211
00:08:29,098 --> 00:08:33,479
to have these higher elevated values

212
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,418
that they're leading they're doing what

213
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:37,919
they can to get those numbers and at the

214
00:08:36,418 --> 00:08:40,620
end of the day the consumers are making

215
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:42,000
decisions on the THC value which is not

216
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,399
correct but that's the only information

217
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,259
they have to go from

218
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,720
um and you know they're picking a

219
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:50,939
product a over product B by the number

220
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,580
and it could be maybe product B is a lot

221
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:56,339
higher but they're more honest so that's

222
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:58,500
why we really have to do this uh I think

223
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:00,899
there's a lot of producers in Canada who

224
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,759
are fundamentally honest but they're

225
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:03,600
really they're using the wrong thing

226
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:05,819
here

227
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,740
and when it gets to health Canada and

228
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,200
others they're saying well the testing

229
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:13,379
Labs I guess we can't do it which is all

230
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:18,360
just complete [ __ ] uh because there

231
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:20,458
is uh aoac ASTM nist in the U.S actual

232
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,820
research that have standards methods

233
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:26,278
available for people to use any lab that

234
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:28,860
is wants to do it right can

235
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:30,899
but the problem is that if the lab needs

236
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,659
to buy a sample they have to report that

237
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:36,059
that's not their fault but some labs are

238
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:37,199
also on their part tweaking up the

239
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:38,399
numbers because that's how they get

240
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,379
business

241
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,659
uh and the other thing that's happening

242
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:45,059
in Canada is the cultivators can't sell

243
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:46,860
directly the the the the person that

244
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:49,739
cultivates so they sell the pro

245
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,959
producers producers to collect from a

246
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:54,600
lot of cultivators uh and they're

247
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:56,759
requiring them to use specific labs

248
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,639
so when you do this this gives the

249
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:01,679
processors undue influence over the labs

250
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:03,120
and those labs that get the highest

251
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:06,059
values are the ones that are getting the

252
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,799
most business uh so so that's all part

253
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:09,958
of the problem but this is I'm

254
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:12,179
completely committed to make sure this

255
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:14,939
this stops but right now it's it's

256
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:17,278
primarily a North American problem

257
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:19,860
and the testing protocols that everybody

258
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:21,958
uses are these the exact same set of

259
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,820
rules or as you said are people bending

260
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:26,338
and maneuvering themselves to be able to

261
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:28,440
get around certain rules to have certain

262
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:31,620
levels of THC written down

263
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,240
well let's be clear with ISO 17025 which

264
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,639
is not a requirement for the labs in

265
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:38,820
Canada so some don't even have that but

266
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:40,379
they don't specify a specific method so

267
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,540
this is allowing for if you have a

268
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:43,799
better method then you can you can do

269
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:46,019
that as long as you do a proper

270
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:48,179
validation and then do regular

271
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:51,299
proficiency testing programs or maybe

272
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:53,639
test against a CRM so to make sure that

273
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:57,359
you can get accurate values

274
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:59,338
um so we have a method that is uh six

275
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,139
and a half minutes we separate 17

276
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:03,120
cannabinoids and it's a run to run to

277
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:06,000
eight minutes if we use what's what's

278
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:09,060
published in some of the pharmacopias

279
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,639
the method of there is 25 minutes so it

280
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:13,619
doesn't fit for the practical sense but

281
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:17,519
our method does have us hit the

282
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:19,500
proficiency testing values very well

283
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,620
pretty interesting you had worked before

284
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:25,200
on commercializing biomass extraction so

285
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:27,240
would know a fair bit about this when it

286
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,759
comes to Europe and let's say the the

287
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,320
medical products that created it's a lot

288
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:34,019
more pharmaceutical over here do you

289
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,879
think synthetic biosynthetic or

290
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:37,980
extracted molecules directly from the

291
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:40,679
plant which one is the more suitable

292
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,539
ingredient for a pharmaceutical product

293
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:44,578
well look you know

294
00:11:42,539 --> 00:11:46,919
a premise of chemistry is if the

295
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:48,899
molecule is identical then it's the same

296
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:51,419
irregardless if your aspirin is made

297
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:53,578
synthetically or or even extracted from

298
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:55,500
the little tree the difficulty with

299
00:11:53,578 --> 00:11:57,899
natural products is there's also other

300
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:00,240
things that are co-extracted so if you

301
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:02,220
look at a pure THC product it's very

302
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,899
difficult not to have Trace levels of

303
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,820
CBD in it just because that's the way

304
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:08,039
the world works right

305
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:10,260
um that's not a bad thing for medicinal

306
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:12,719
products but I don't think in the

307
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:14,220
medicinal legalization markets that you

308
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,379
have in Europe that there's the same

309
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:18,778
type of problem because there's a

310
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:21,360
European pharmacopoeia and they require

311
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:23,458
label claims to be within 10 percent of

312
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,039
the of the label and we haven't heard

313
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:29,399
any reports that those products are are

314
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:32,099
a problem ironically a lot of the

315
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:34,799
products worldwide now are exported from

316
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:37,259
Canada imported from Canada because we

317
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:39,000
have a legal base here so ironically

318
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:40,439
when they're when they land in Ireland

319
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,839
and Germany

320
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,959
we can get the labels right but here in

321
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:49,560
North America we have this this issue so

322
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:52,319
that's complete uh Focus right uh so we

323
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:55,018
uh I I suspect that medicinal patients

324
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,540
in in Europe who are brine product maybe

325
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:59,159
even Source from Canada are are getting

326
00:12:57,539 --> 00:13:00,599
good product

327
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:03,360
um and I should add to there's a big

328
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,920
difference between a a product that

329
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,379
includes buds because there's a natural

330
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:10,259
variation between Buds and one that's

331
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:13,860
been extracted and put into a a gummy or

332
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:15,480
another form that's more medicinal than

333
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,639
you would expect even a tighter

334
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,680
Tolerance on that because you know

335
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:21,600
you're home homogenized a material prior

336
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:23,759
to making the product

337
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,100
do you still think there's a lot of room

338
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:28,379
in the Blends and formulations of

339
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,940
cannabinoids and terpenes and flavonoids

340
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:31,620
to create new novel let's say

341
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,760
ingredients shall we call them for a

342
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:36,000
various of different products and

343
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:37,319
ailments yeah well in a bit I think

344
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,259
there's some products we're moving

345
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:42,180
initially we had you know cannabis 1.0

346
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:44,039
then cannabis 2.0 which is more of the

347
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:46,379
finished products but we're going to get

348
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:48,480
to more medicinal products my personal

349
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:51,059
feeling is is things like sublinguals

350
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,100
are much more reasonable than than other

351
00:13:51,059 --> 00:13:56,099
things because we also need to dig into

352
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:58,980
the understanding of the pharmacology of

353
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:01,560
these materials so when you smoke a

354
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:03,120
material or use a vaporizer at low

355
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:05,518
temperature which is what I recommend

356
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,959
the neutrals of the other compounds that

357
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,459
get into your bloodstream and get to

358
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:11,458
your brain quite quickly

359
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:13,739
uh when you ingest it you end up having

360
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:15,539
metabolites that are formed and these

361
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:18,120
can have different much more variable

362
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:20,219
effect on individuals so for instance if

363
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,899
I eat an edible that has THC in it I'm

364
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,879
in a tunnel for four hours and I'm not

365
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:27,740
really that happy about it

366
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:29,939
um the uh the other piece is that if uh

367
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:32,220
sublingual again is more the neutral

368
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:34,079
into the system so we really need more

369
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,940
research on the pharmacology and how

370
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:38,338
that works and then develop the

371
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:39,839
appropriate response to that

372
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:42,540
um so there's things like the Entourage

373
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,399
effect that people talk a lot about uh

374
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:46,559
and then you would need a whole extract

375
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,299
to get those curtains but the other

376
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:50,759
thing people affect like if you smoke

377
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:52,078
that product or if you heat it in a

378
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:54,299
vaporizer at a very high temperature

379
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:57,419
you're not only getting those products

380
00:14:54,299 --> 00:15:00,000
converted you're also getting a lot of

381
00:14:57,419 --> 00:15:03,000
uh degradation products based on

382
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,278
temperatures so for instance if you uh

383
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,720
even vaporize a THC product at a high

384
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:11,759
temperature the THC degrades to CBN

385
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,560
uh and and we need to keep in mind these

386
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:15,299
types of things so with the vaporizers

387
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:18,539
as long as the temperature needs to be

388
00:15:15,299 --> 00:15:21,059
below 200 Celsius we like to to even

389
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:22,980
Target 180. otherwise you get

390
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:25,799
degradation products and that can lead

391
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:27,839
to health impact negative Health impacts

392
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:29,639
and related things

393
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,740
very interesting it's been amazing

394
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:33,419
talking to you Rob I I hope we can get

395
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:35,759
to basically touch base before the end

396
00:15:33,419 --> 00:15:38,159
of this year and get a recap on all the

397
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,659
new testing that you guys have done but

398
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:41,219
