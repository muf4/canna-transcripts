I'm fantastic mate thank you very much

10
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,320
for taking the time to do this I know

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,339
you're a busy man and do you want to

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,199
maybe give a really quick little

13
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:29,698
overview on under 60 seconds of how you

14
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,359
ended up as the executive director of

15
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:36,059
the incba sure yeah um when I came on it

16
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:39,359
was 2017 so uh the association was

17
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:41,939
started in 2015 by a group of lawyers

18
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,619
um in San Francisco that really looked

19
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:45,718
around and saw the need for increased

20
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:48,238
levels of legal services in the industry

21
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,558
so uh I started volunteering with incba

22
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:51,119
I was in a completely different industry

23
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:53,519
so I was in Securities litigation and

24
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:56,759
then I was in uh Finance

25
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,379
um really sort of liked the the industry

26
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:00,839
um had historical connections to it

27
00:00:58,378 --> 00:01:03,839
through family and friends so when I

28
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,700
moved back to California in about 2016 I

29
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,439
started doing pro bono work for a few

30
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,359
family and friends

31
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,158
um you know really sort of got up to

32
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:12,780
speed with where the law was at the time

33
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,600
and sort of what we needed going into

34
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,760
the future and then was lucky enough to

35
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:20,219
apply for the position and be hired as

36
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,560
the executive director so

37
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:24,420
very good very good and the origins of

38
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,859
the agency go back to what year and what

39
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,719
stages for everybody who's not aware

40
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:29,340
sure yeah like I said it was it was San

41
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:31,978
Francisco so California

42
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,740
um in about 2015 legalization happened

43
00:01:31,978 --> 00:01:36,478
in California back in 1996 so so it was

44
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:39,060
legal for quite a while but it was under

45
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,679
uh a not-for-profit model so we had

46
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,500
collectives and cooperatives that would

47
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,180
provide medicine to patients that needed

48
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,920
cannabis in order to treat you know

49
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,900
either for palliative care or for other

50
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,478
pain management issues

51
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,680
um we looked around and really the the

52
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:55,618
group of women that started the

53
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,939
association saw a need for lawyers to

54
00:01:55,618 --> 00:01:58,438
get together and to speak to each other

55
00:01:56,938 --> 00:02:01,199
there really wasn't a set of best

56
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:03,539
practices it was an industry that had

57
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,799
not really from the legal side had not

58
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,359
really matured right since it was

59
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,580
illegal at the federal level it was

60
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:11,038
legal at the state level there was a lot

61
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,020
of discomfort with papering any sort of

62
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:15,238
uh you know Arrangements among

63
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,379
individuals uh there was really sort of

64
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:17,759
everyone was allergic to putting

65
00:02:16,378 --> 00:02:19,859
anything down on paper we were still

66
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,959
afraid that that Federal the federal

67
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,459
government was going to come in bring

68
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:26,400
seizure actions against individual

69
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:28,020
companies things like that and so in

70
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,819
order to create those best practices

71
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,140
three women in San Francisco got

72
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:33,598
together and they really said you know

73
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:35,458
it would benefit not only us and not

74
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:37,259
only our clients to to have everyone

75
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:39,239
sort of be on the same page about how we

76
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:40,439
should do some of these things but it

77
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:42,780
would benefit us to have the people

78
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:44,878
across the table uh from us you know

79
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,378
start from a place of of Education start

80
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,060
from a place where they knew sort of

81
00:02:46,378 --> 00:02:49,318
what the what the rules are and what

82
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,659
they should be and how we should proceed

83
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:53,098
as an industry so it started off as a

84
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:55,019
networking group pretty pretty quickly

85
00:02:53,098 --> 00:02:56,639
after that we got into continuing legal

86
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:58,920
education so

87
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:01,079
um now we put on about 80 hours of

88
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:03,899
continuing legal education each year we

89
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,959
do this year we have five in-person

90
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,640
events lined up uh one in Europe which

91
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,019
would make six um so we're really

92
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:13,919
excited for that one coming up in

93
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:16,620
Ireland on the 25th um so you know we've

94
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:18,299
really expanded we touch on pretty much

95
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:22,080
all facets of the Cannabis industry now

96
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,819
so anything from you know educating

97
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,940
lawyers on how to best serve their

98
00:03:23,818 --> 00:03:28,139
clients to advocacy to Liaison

99
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:29,459
liaisoning with the government

100
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:31,079
um sort of all of those facets are

101
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,340
things that are covered under under our

102
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,780
Banner

103
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,920
it's very good and what was the first

104
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,318
step in towards creating an

105
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:39,059
International Association was the one

106
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:42,238
specific country from outside the states

107
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,080
to cut together what can you tell us on

108
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,819
that

109
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,799
yeah it was it was really interesting it

110
00:03:44,818 --> 00:03:48,359
grew up organically and so there had

111
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,700
always been sort of an eye right it was

112
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,680
this uh this idea from our beginning

113
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:54,658
that we wanted to fill a space that

114
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,280
wasn't currently filled right and in

115
00:03:54,658 --> 00:03:58,079
terms of international transactions it

116
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,479
really didn't exist we understood that

117
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,700
legalization was sort of rolling across

118
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:03,959
across the globe and

119
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:05,818
um there were a lot of lessons to be

120
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:07,080
learned from you know how we're doing

121
00:04:05,818 --> 00:04:09,119
things in the United States what we're

122
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,159
doing right what we're doing wrong

123
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,959
um we saw interest

124
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:16,019
um I think one of our first

125
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,100
International uh uh members someone that

126
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:20,040
came to one of our cannabis law

127
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,959
institutes in Washington DC was a a

128
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,400
gentleman from Lesotho

129
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,379
um and so that really opened our eyes

130
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:27,539
that this was sort of you know traveling

131
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:29,819
across the globe we had a few European

132
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,620
members at that point and so I think we

133
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:34,978
had members from from France from

134
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:37,560
Germany from Spain and from Switzerland

135
00:04:34,978 --> 00:04:38,879
and so we sort of saw the writing on the

136
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,899
wall that this there was going to be a

137
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:41,579
lot of utility from the international

138
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:43,019
perspective

139
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:45,359
um both from from those individual

140
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:47,339
Jewels trying to push a regulated market

141
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,139
on on a domestic level from wherever

142
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:50,219
they were from but then also sort of

143
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:52,199
laying the groundwork for international

144
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,419
transactions so

145
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,040
um really was an organic evolution we're

146
00:04:54,418 --> 00:04:58,740
really excited that now we have our

147
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,360
incba Europe group over the next year or

148
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,040
two we do plan on rolling out those

149
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,639
other sort of large geographical

150
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,979
portions so incba Latin America incba

151
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,240
Africa those sort of like

152
00:05:06,978 --> 00:05:11,219
conglomerations of attorneys surf

153
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,840
clients in those jurisdictions as they

154
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,160
come online and as they create regulated

155
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:17,159
markets

156
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,600
okay amazing the next Topic in

157
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,639
conversational letter to have was

158
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,800
basically as a compliance professional

159
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,600
and a business strategist for people

160
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,340
over in Europe who are looking to try

161
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,860
and write policy and have policy

162
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:31,138
influence what states would you be aware

163
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,000
of that have the best legal framework in

164
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:34,860
place or is there a combination of a

165
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,538
multitude of states where you could

166
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:39,180
Frankenstein a couple of different

167
00:05:36,538 --> 00:05:40,199
policy and create a perfect policy for

168
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,180
Europe

169
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:43,199
see that's really the latter

170
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,699
um I I wouldn't say that any

171
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,500
jurisdiction in the United States has

172
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:48,240
has gotten it exactly right

173
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,680
um you know and it really depends on

174
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,500
what stage of the market you're looking

175
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,478
at as we look at the success of of

176
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,519
individual jurisdictions

177
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,079
um for a place like California right

178
00:05:56,519 --> 00:06:00,180
which is where I sit

179
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,339
um as the markets matured it's really

180
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:03,900
we've run into difficulty because we've

181
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:06,959
really over taxed some of the entities

182
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:08,879
we've made it very very difficult for

183
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:11,459
the legal regulated market which has a

184
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:13,740
lot of benefits you know related to it

185
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:15,180
um we can trace transactions we have

186
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,560
Financial tracking of a lot of the

187
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,780
companies

188
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,399
um we have you know the ability to test

189
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:23,219
product to make sure that public health

190
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:24,959
and safety uh is insured as we roll out

191
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:28,560
these these products and these programs

192
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:30,978
to a wider group of consumers

193
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,660
um but here in California we've really

194
00:06:30,978 --> 00:06:35,758
created a system where the illicit

195
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,620
Market is is really able to compete with

196
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,120
the legal regulated market right and so

197
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,680
although we've done some things right

198
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,139
there are some things that we got sort

199
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,780
of sort of wrong in that capacity

200
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:49,439
um you know it really is about matching

201
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:50,698
your policy goals to uh the drafting

202
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:52,918
that you put down on paper right

203
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:54,900
whenever we create a complex regulatory

204
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:56,579
system and and for most jurisdictions

205
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:59,339
this is coming out of nothing right so

206
00:06:56,579 --> 00:07:02,519
we are it's a really unique situation in

207
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:04,079
which uh we're not evolving a regulatory

208
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:06,180
structure we're coming up with one from

209
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:08,579
scratch and so those always have

210
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,959
unintended consequences and so you know

211
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:12,359
a place like New York has a really

212
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:14,879
robust social Equity program

213
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,680
um that stems from those Regulators

214
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:18,600
having a specific set of policy

215
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,340
objectives in mind and then working

216
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,740
backwards through the regulations and

217
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:24,299
understanding how to draft a set of

218
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,098
regulations that promote those specific

219
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,360
policy objectives

220
00:07:26,098 --> 00:07:29,098
um and it's it's a really difficult

221
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,720
thing to do and so really what you have

222
00:07:29,098 --> 00:07:32,399
to do as a jurisdiction is you have to

223
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,620
understand what you want your ultimate

224
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:37,560
Market to look like right

225
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:39,240
um in Europe you know we don't have uh

226
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,560
the same concerns that we do in the

227
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,259
United States you know using social

228
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,060
Equity as an example there is not this

229
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:48,000
history of animus towards you know

230
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:50,160
certain sets of individuals uh and the

231
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,319
drug war has not been used to really you

232
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,240
know wage a war on on certain

233
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,039
individuals that we now need to include

234
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,478
in the market going forward

235
00:07:56,038 --> 00:07:59,038
um and so you don't have that policy

236
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:01,139
goal so you'd write a set of regulations

237
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:03,000
sort of on a fundamentally different a

238
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:04,500
different basis um and so really it's

239
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,240
about working backward from the market

240
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,038
that you want to see

241
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,960
um you know an efficient market that has

242
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:12,240
predictability in transactions consumer

243
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:13,859
protection uh the ability to track and

244
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,000
Trace some of the products that are

245
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,740
going through to make sure that they're

246
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,418
not being diverted either out of state

247
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,939
in the United States or out of the

248
00:08:18,418 --> 00:08:22,620
country uh in Europe

249
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:24,060
um and and really working back from that

250
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:26,098
to make sure that you're having a

251
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:28,379
cohesive regulatory structure that that

252
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:29,819
you know you can overlay on top of an

253
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:31,439
existing market right because that's the

254
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:33,599
other unique thing about the Cannabis

255
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:35,158
industry is not only do we not have

256
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,658
regulations

257
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:38,338
um and so we're creating this regulatory

258
00:08:36,658 --> 00:08:39,718
structure from scratch but there's an

259
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:41,940
existing set of demand for the product

260
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,080
right and so in virtually every

261
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,660
jurisdiction in which we see

262
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:49,139
legalization occur uh it's not because

263
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:51,059
people want to you know create access

264
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:52,439
where there was no access before it's

265
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:53,759
because we want to formalize the access

266
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,560
we want to ensure that there's product

267
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,659
testing we want to ensure that you know

268
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:59,219
tax revenue accrues to the government

269
00:08:57,659 --> 00:09:00,600
um and so really you're you're you're

270
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,459
trying to

271
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,740
you're trying to place a regulatory

272
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:06,000
regime on top of an existing Market that

273
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,560
you know to this point has been

274
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,659
unregulated so

275
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:11,759
um really it's a piecemeal it's a

276
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:13,799
piecemeal sort of process

277
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:15,419
um for European Regulators that are

278
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:17,219
trying to create these regulatory

279
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:19,199
structures you know it's really about

280
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,899
going through and understanding what

281
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,360
each specific legislature and regulator

282
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:25,679
wanted to see from the end product in

283
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,500
each one of these states right so what

284
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:30,299
is the purported uh focus of the

285
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,860
regulations right what is you know is it

286
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:33,838
to increase your tax revenue through

287
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,039
increasing the tax revenue base

288
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,680
um do you want to do that through

289
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:39,240
specific taxes on uh cannabis related

290
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:41,278
entities you know so do you want to have

291
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,560
a cultivation tax or do you want to

292
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:45,419
ensure that each one of these companies

293
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:46,919
that has been created is paying an

294
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:48,539
income tax that's more sort of more

295
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:50,458
aligned with with traditional taxation

296
00:09:48,539 --> 00:09:51,958
right and so uh one of the problems

297
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:54,179
again here in California that we've seen

298
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:56,518
is that we have all these different

299
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:59,099
stages of Taxation but that takes away

300
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:01,019
from the overall tax base you know for

301
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:03,240
for a company paying into the income tax

302
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:04,560
right and so income tax is reduced

303
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,060
because we've made competition more

304
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:07,919
difficult because we had things like the

305
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:10,199
cultivation tax which was recently

306
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:11,879
recently repealed for for exactly those

307
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,339
reasons

308
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:16,559
amazing very interesting indeed and

309
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:19,019
another question do you think a

310
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:21,179
standardized testing system for the

311
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:23,100
United States when Federal legalization

312
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:25,019
comes is going to be easy to implement

313
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,759
or do you still think it'll always be on

314
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:28,320
a state-by-state basis surely if there's

315
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:30,299
going to be interested Commerce there

316
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,100
needs to be an overarching spectrum of

317
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:33,838
rules that everybody has to apply by

318
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:36,000
sure

319
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,260
um you know the FDA is never going to

320
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,419
give up so our Food and Drug

321
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:41,879
Administration right the dual federalism

322
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:44,039
problem is always going to sort of arise

323
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:45,720
um the Food and Drug Administration its

324
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:46,860
primary directive is to ensure health

325
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,420
and safety

326
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:51,240
um of products that are consumable

327
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:52,740
products for individuals right uh not

328
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,959
only consumables but also Cosmetics

329
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:57,240
they're never going to sort of let go of

330
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:59,039
that jurisdictional you know that

331
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,519
jurisdictional purview so we're going to

332
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:04,980
need some sort of national uh National

333
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:07,200
mechanism whereby you know we can see if

334
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:09,899
products are safe for consumption

335
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,339
um that being said right like what we've

336
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:14,519
seen in the Auto industry in the United

337
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:15,720
States is uh we have state by state

338
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:18,179
regulation

339
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,920
but we have production plans that

340
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:21,778
primarily take place in in certain

341
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:23,338
jurisdictions right and so we may have

342
00:11:21,778 --> 00:11:25,679
all of our cars that are made in Detroit

343
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:27,779
but California has the most stringent

344
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:30,539
emission standards and so what happens

345
00:11:27,778 --> 00:11:31,980
is those Detroit producers they have to

346
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:33,179
adhere to the California Admission

347
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,320
standards because those are the

348
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:36,239
strictests in the country and it's the

349
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,040
largest market in the country and so

350
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,259
really what I think I think naturally

351
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:42,059
before the FDA sort of establishes any

352
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:44,639
of those boundaries

353
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:47,159
um I think that probably we will tend

354
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:49,439
towards uh whatever one of those largest

355
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:50,578
consumer state has implemented for their

356
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,839
their testing policies I think

357
00:11:50,578 --> 00:11:53,759
ultimately it's going to be a race to

358
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,380
the to the top as opposed to a race to

359
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:57,958
the bottom um I don't think that we're

360
00:11:55,379 --> 00:11:59,458
going to see sort of a relaxation of

361
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:01,439
those health and safety standards I

362
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:02,759
think that we're gonna sort of pick the

363
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,200
state that has the most stringent

364
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:06,000
standards which at this point you know

365
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,680
is is sort of a you know there's a

366
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,600
competition but California has very very

367
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:10,559
stringent standards and so I think that

368
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,440
we're going to see sort of everyone

369
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,879
coalesce around what those standards are

370
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,620
in order to be able to have a national

371
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,600
market for cannabis in order to be able

372
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:21,060
to be eligible to you know ship your

373
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,040
product out of a producing state and to

374
00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:25,619
access markets like California or New

375
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:26,819
York we're going to need to sort of you

376
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,459
know rise to the level of whatever

377
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:31,500
testing they establish there yeah I

378
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:33,838
couldn't agree more last question before

379
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:36,059
I let you go which do you think is going

380
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,459
to happen first safe Banking Act is

381
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:40,199
going to be passed or European country

382
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:41,899
is going to develop a recreational

383
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,820
Market

384
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:46,078
that's a great question

385
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,000
um

386
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:49,319
given the dysfunction of our Congress I

387
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,120
think that I think that a European

388
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,680
country is gonna going to establish that

389
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,179
that adult use Market

390
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:56,278
um you know I know that a couple are on

391
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:57,778
the cusp right now so

392
00:12:56,278 --> 00:12:59,419
um you know I know that the laws in

393
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:01,799
Germany are changing very very quickly

394
00:12:59,419 --> 00:13:03,000
uh I look forward to seeing what happens

395
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:04,679
in Europe

396
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,659
um I think that the only way that the

397
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:08,819
save Banking Act potentially beats the

398
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:10,799
implementation of an adult use Market in

399
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,959
Europe is if it gets you know sort of

400
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:14,759
snuck into one of the larger larger

401
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,739
bills that we have passing but our House

402
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:18,419
of Representatives is you know doesn't

403
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,278
doesn't have much of an appetite to pass

404
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:22,679
anything at this point so

405
00:13:20,278 --> 00:13:23,820
um I would say that that's probably a

406
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:26,638
safe bet

407
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:28,200
um yeah yeah for us it's keep an eye in

408
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,700
Germany or Prague our Czech Republic

409
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,680
which one is going to get out of the

410
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,480
Golden's first so hopefully for the rest

411
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:35,159
of Europe and the global industry that

412
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:39,000
uh one of them gets assorted by the end

413
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:40,620
