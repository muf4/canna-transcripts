1
00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:04,139
foreign

2
00:00:15,198 --> 00:00:19,379
professor in the department of

3
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,840
biomedicine at the renowned arahu's

4
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:22,980
University in Denmark and that is

5
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:24,960
originally from Brazil and it's

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,879
interested in understanding mechanisms

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,039
associated with vulnerability to stress

8
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:30,660
related psychiatric disorders how are

9
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,200
you keeping today yum yeah

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,880
I'm fine thank you and so thank you for

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,640
the opportunity of being here and also

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,020
talking about our work

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,399
I'm delighted to have you on you're

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,260
doing lots of exciting work up in

15
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,660
Denmark teams we won the homes of the

16
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:48,299
Cannabis industry globally with so much

17
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:50,099
r d and cultivation going on that I'm

18
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:51,419
delighted to get to talk to you can you

19
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,219
maybe give everybody just a quick

20
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,198
overview and under 60 seconds of how you

21
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:58,980
came from Brazil to our house University

22
00:00:55,198 --> 00:01:02,579
and to work in a cannabis based biology

23
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:05,658
yes I was associate professor in Brazil

24
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:07,579
for uh nearly 10 years I was

25
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:10,560
investigating

26
00:01:07,579 --> 00:01:12,060
cannabinoids in in the brain effects of

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,560
cannabinoids and Nano cannabinoids in

28
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,439
the brain the University of Sao Paulo

29
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,939
and then I started a collaboration here

30
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:19,859
in Denmark in the translational

31
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:22,679
neurosychiatric unit you know University

32
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:24,659
and as part of that I applied for a

33
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,360
position in Oz Institute of advanced

34
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,799
study with this first project

35
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:31,019
investigating the effects of cannabi Dio

36
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,200
in the brain so it moves to Denmark

37
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:37,199
initially temporarily but I could see

38
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,400
all the benefits of or in all the

39
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,219
infrastructure that the university

40
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,320
offering it's a good very good place to

41
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:45,539
really develop the project so I applied

42
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:47,519
for one of the positions here and

43
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,380
luckily I was offered the position so I

44
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,899
moved permanently to Denmark two years

45
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:53,879
ago to develop this project

46
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:55,379
okay very good and it seems to be you

47
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:57,060
guys are doing lots of exciting work

48
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:59,459
over there do you want to give everybody

49
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,618
a quick brief on what work you're doing

50
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:03,599
that Associates is kind of annoyed and

51
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:06,780
the brain and the effects on it

52
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:09,060
yeah we are we have been particularly

53
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,060
interested on the effect of cannabi

54
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:14,878
diode that's one of the components of of

55
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:17,699
cannabis that has been known as known

56
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:19,318
psychostimulant and Men already 10 years

57
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:21,060
ago we showed for the first time that

58
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:23,519
kind of dial has antidepressant-like

59
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:26,039
effect and animal models so we have been

60
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,840
investigating the mechanisms so more

61
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:29,519
recently we saw that cannabi diode

62
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,580
differently from other antidepressants

63
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,459
have a acute effect

64
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:38,819
and we are really interested in trying

65
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:40,500
to understand how the drug is able how

66
00:02:38,818 --> 00:02:43,979
this compound is able to trigger this

67
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:47,219
effect because that can actually lead us

68
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:50,639
to new mechanisms for drugs that would

69
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:53,699
have the same property in uh acting

70
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:56,458
faster than the drugs we have now so

71
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:58,259
that is what we are working on trying to

72
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:03,000
find the molecular mechanisms involved

73
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:05,039
in the fast acting effects of of CBD

74
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,080
and it is basically the effects on the

75
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,539
brain is it to do with CB1 and CB2

76
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,300
receptors or is there a different method

77
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:15,419
for absorption for the carbonyl to the

78
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:17,519
brain uh yeah that is a very good

79
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:19,919
question because it seems that it

80
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,900
depends very much in the of the model

81
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,000
that you are studying the stress model

82
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,920
so I work with animals I cannot really

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,280
say it's depression but stress models

84
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:31,799
that leads to to behaviors that we

85
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,199
relate somehow to depressive symptoms in

86
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:37,980
animals and depending on the stress

87
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:40,979
model cannabidi would act via CB1 or CB2

88
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:43,439
receptors or serotonin receptors in this

89
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:45,419
case 5h20 receptors and in some other

90
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,979
models especially if it's chronic stress

91
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:48,780
then there is also the participation of

92
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:51,959
inflammatory mechanisms or

93
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:53,939
anti-inflammatory properties of CBD so

94
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:55,319
we have been particularly interested in

95
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:58,019
the mechanisms that leads to

96
00:03:55,318 --> 00:04:00,179
neuroplasticity and in that we are

97
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:02,039
investigating the involvement of

98
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,159
neurotrophins and how can abidio

99
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:08,280
controls that so it's not a clear

100
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:10,639
exactly I would say which receptor

101
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:15,000
because it seems that depends very much

102
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:18,060
into which neural circuitry is involved

103
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,620
or recruited in that stress model that

104
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,139
you are studying

105
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,699
okay very interesting we can see a

106
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:25,139
couple of the big Acquisitions that have

107
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:26,819
happened so far yesterday those

108
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:29,280
announcements of a 6.7 billion

109
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:31,379
acquisition by Pfizer for a bowel

110
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:33,478
disease based on cannabinoids we've

111
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:35,399
already had a cardiovascular company

112
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:37,139
creative product but we can see that

113
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:38,279
that's really inflammation and we know

114
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:40,860
that kind of would always work with

115
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:43,079
inflammation specific thing what is the

116
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:44,340
Avenue for anxiety and depression which

117
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:47,219
is something you guys are working on

118
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:49,560
it's obviously not a case of an inflamed

119
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,780
uh brain or membrane it's obviously

120
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,579
another Catalyst how is it that you're

121
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:55,198
basically able to Target anxiety and

122
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:58,379
depression what kind of no it's

123
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,240
well in fact it could be that's not

124
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:02,759
where we are particularly aiming it

125
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,800
could be an inflamed in brain some way

126
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:07,020
we know that for example chronically

127
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,199
stressed animals they have increased of

128
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:12,060
uh if inflammation markers in the brain

129
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:14,400
activation of a microglia and so on and

130
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,899
kind of but I could actually attenuate

131
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:19,258
that there are some papers showing that

132
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:22,258
in our case it's mostly uh because we

133
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:24,300
know that stress impairs neuroplasticity

134
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:26,160
and then increase the vulnerability of

135
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,439
developing these behaviors that are

136
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:32,759
associated with depression so we want to

137
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:36,719
understand uh how cannabidi was able to

138
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:39,900
reverse that we have seen in some of our

139
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,080
previous uh studies that cannabidiol

140
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:44,638
rapidly increases neural

141
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:47,219
bdnf that's brain derived neurotrophic

142
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,500
factor that we know it's required for

143
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,419
the 100 effect others have shown that if

144
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,699
you block the signaling by btnf then you

145
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:56,159
block the antidepressant effect of many

146
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:58,319
drugs and also so we have shown it

147
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:03,660
blocks the effect of CBD so we actually

148
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:09,599
want to understand how CBD can regulate

149
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:12,600
the signaling by a bdnf or its receptor

150
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,879
to lead to rapid neuroplastic changes in

151
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:18,600
the brain so that would that is the main

152
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:19,918
construct that we are investigating in a

153
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,979
moment

154
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:24,959
and the carpet oil that you guys use for

155
00:06:22,978 --> 00:06:27,839
your trial is a synthetic based is it

156
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:29,279
biosynthesized is it plant grown what is

157
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,939
the metrics that you guys use for your

158
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:35,279
cup of oil we have tried different ones

159
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:40,379
but here in Denmark well in Brazil we

160
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:43,379
were using uh initially extracted from

161
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:47,819
the plant and then we also tried a

162
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:52,800
synthetic one and here we are purchasing

163
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:55,139
uh it's extracted so it's natural as we

164
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,439
did not sing the size

165
00:06:55,139 --> 00:07:02,038
we basically experience differences if

166
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:04,800
just if it is in and sometimes in fact

167
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:07,318
is the time of action

168
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,840
when you inject otherwise we don't see

169
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:11,639
major differences as far as it's pure

170
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:14,159
it's not a problem

171
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,900
do you see a scenario where we seem to

172
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,060
be a lot of a lot of talk at the moment

173
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:19,560
about biosynthesis and that kind of

174
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,598
being the future side of the ingredient

175
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,300
of let's say applied pharmaceutical

176
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:26,519
ingredients just for the the clarity the

177
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:29,220
purification and the amount of uh

178
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:31,818
Harvest you could produce per year do

179
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:35,460
you see biosynthesis surpassing uh

180
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:37,800
synthetic and extracted grown or do you

181
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:39,538
think extracted CBD has always got to be

182
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:43,139
the primary source

183
00:07:39,538 --> 00:07:45,360
I actually think that is

184
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:47,460
Avenue because

185
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,038
I think there's a return now I don't

186
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:51,959
know if it's only me who here but in

187
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:54,839
this one I think that's a very

188
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:56,879
interesting Avenue because of uh the

189
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:59,879
other things that are in the plant and

190
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:02,279
many other therapings and so on so that

191
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:04,379
when we have only CBD we don't have and

192
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:06,359
there there has been this claim of of

193
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:09,740
the Entourage effect and also other

194
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:12,000
cannabinoids and but that remains to be

195
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:13,379
systematically tested it's also

196
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,899
something we are interested but it's

197
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:18,180
just in the beginning so it can be that

198
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:21,799
uh in uh some time from now we actually

199
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:24,959
see that it's not pure CBD that would be

200
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:27,060
uh the most beneficial approach but

201
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:30,060
actually uh

202
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:33,719
um an extract that would have let's say

203
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:37,139
CBD and and cannabisiro or some

204
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:40,320
proportion of other uh

205
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:43,259
components of the plant so I I do

206
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,720
believe this is a good way forward in

207
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:48,778
terms of investigating the effects in in

208
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:51,300
our case and animal models and so on

209
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:53,399
yeah it seems to be a case that the

210
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:55,799
Blends and formulations of the potential

211
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:58,379
carnabinoids terpenes flavonoids and

212
00:08:55,799 --> 00:09:00,240
maybe one or two other molecules is

213
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:02,700
going to be you need to cannabis space

214
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,139
medicine and where all the IEP heavy

215
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,040
action is going to be

216
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:12,059
yeah I I I I I I I

217
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:15,299
think so and also uh uh the combination

218
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:18,000
in of of cannabino kind of dial and

219
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:22,859
cannabinoids in general also with other

220
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:26,220
drugs in in new formulations that can uh

221
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:29,100
demonstrate to be beneficial for for

222
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:31,080
treating uh specific conditions we have

223
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:35,159
played a little bit with that regarding

224
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:37,379
antidepressants uh but with cannabinoids

225
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:40,679
in general as a pharmacologist I would

226
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:43,320
say first we understand what each one of

227
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:45,059
them are doing and then we play with the

228
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,640
combinations but that's just the mindset

229
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:49,739
of a pharmacologist so

230
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:51,120
well you seem to be some of the smartest

231
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,860
people in the room so I'll be trusting

232
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,480
the former colleges over a lot of other

233
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:59,879
people and do you see basically a a

234
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,820
scenario where

235
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:04,559
We have basically clip-on Drugs in My

236
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,480
Mind the thing that makes most sense for

237
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:08,278
let's say a manufacturer producer of a

238
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,600
new drug is to create it it drove the

239
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:12,600
clips onto something that's already

240
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,920
there that you're basically giving let's

241
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,720
say it's opiates that you're not giving

242
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:17,639
somebody a highly addictive course of

243
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,399
opiates that it's a blend of cannabinoid

244
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:22,080
space playing formula and opiates and if

245
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,480
that sweet spot is going to be who can

246
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,920
create the clip-on product that already

247
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,120
works with something that's already in

248
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,059
the market

249
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:33,480
yeah I think that's also an interesting

250
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:36,659
approach we we

251
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:39,659
have for example tried the combination

252
00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:41,819
in the animal uh can I die with ketamine

253
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:43,919
for example because we know it's used as

254
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:46,079
antidepressant and it gives dissociative

255
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:48,000
side effects and we wanted to know

256
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:49,620
whether cannabidi with ketamine would

257
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,778
for example favor the antidepressant

258
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:55,139
effect while blocking the dissociative

259
00:10:51,778 --> 00:10:57,838
side effects in our animals right so and

260
00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:59,879
it looked like from the data we obtained

261
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,279
that it could be an interest interesting

262
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:04,980
strategy obviously it's animals we have

263
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:07,500
seen in patients and all that but I do

264
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:09,778
think the next step for example in

265
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:12,078
situations like that resume for opioids

266
00:11:09,778 --> 00:11:15,778
that you could

267
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:18,778
design drugs based on the structure of

268
00:11:15,778 --> 00:11:22,100
both of them and to actually go through

269
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:25,259
uh modulating similar mechanisms

270
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:27,600
the other thing that have been exploited

271
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:29,879
or explored actually sorry in the

272
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,459
industry is actually

273
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:33,899
um

274
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:38,278
chemical modifications that would lead

275
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:41,278
to synthetic kind of benoit-like drugs

276
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:44,159
and this I know for example for Canada

277
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:48,059
has been learned that you have some

278
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:50,338
um new molecules that are uh similar to

279
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:52,139
cannabinois with some small

280
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:56,700
modifications and this has been

281
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:59,539
investigated as an improvement of of the

282
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:02,759
drug based on for example increased

283
00:11:59,539 --> 00:12:04,799
bioavailability and so on so I I do

284
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:07,379
think this is also an interesting

285
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:08,759
strategy to be taken forward by the

286
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:12,419
industry

287
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:15,000
hey in a rough time estimate from two to

288
00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:16,799
four to six years do you think that

289
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,078
there's going to be new kind of annoyeds

290
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:20,578
that end up being found and processed

291
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:22,500
let's say biosynthesize is obviously

292
00:12:20,578 --> 00:12:24,239
going to be one of the main ways to get

293
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,639
small amounts of plant matter and turn

294
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,379
it into large scale patches do you see

295
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,059
more cannabinoids being found in the

296
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:31,139
next two to four or six year period or

297
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:33,799
do you think it's a little bit more

298
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:33,799
longer than that

299
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:38,759
there has been a lot of development in

300
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:42,659
the field I would say in the last 10

301
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:46,100
years so I would expect that we will uh

302
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:48,419
um have new

303
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:50,339
discoveries in this field with network

304
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:52,319
and aminoids from other sources because

305
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:54,899
we know there are similar ones in other

306
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:58,019
planes than cannabis so I wouldn't be

307
00:12:54,899 --> 00:13:02,220
surprised that we would find a

308
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:04,560
similar or cannabinoids similar drugs

309
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:07,560
from other sources that could be of

310
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:09,059
potential interest in Therapeutics and

311
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:11,458
so on

312
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:13,078
very good it seems to be we've nearly

313
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:15,778
hit the time here now but it seems to be

314
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:18,000
Denmark or one of the the center points

315
00:13:15,778 --> 00:13:19,679
and the leading tip of the spear when it

316
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,059
comes to the European cannabis industry

317
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:22,919
from all the cultivation and the

318
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:25,319
ornamental flower industry you guys have

319
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:27,659
and the r d work that you're conducting

320
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,220
do you see Denmark kind of big part in

321
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:31,199
This Global industry over the next 10

322
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:33,420
years

323
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:37,259
yeah I think Denmark has been very

324
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:39,000
active uh in in that sense with have

325
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:41,338
have experienced in the last four years

326
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,578
since I've been here and uh in the

327
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:47,639
normal schools uh in when I came in uh

328
00:13:44,578 --> 00:13:49,799
the first time there was it was too less

329
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:53,519
uh

330
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:56,879
um talked and now I see uh and I have

331
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:59,820
visited some companies here and how how

332
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:02,578
much Denmark has grown also promoting uh

333
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:04,500
meetings and and forums for discussions

334
00:14:02,578 --> 00:14:07,979
and the industry that are exporting

335
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:10,919
really a lot and that Foster the field

336
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:14,220
in general also for new discoveries so I

337
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:15,838
do think that Denmark will

338
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,579
um

339
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,620
um

340
00:14:16,578 --> 00:14:21,838
not only for the production but also for

341
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:24,299
the scientific development of new

342
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,639
knowledge in in this field will will

343
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:29,039
take a very important position in the

344
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,379
years to come yeah I couldn't agree more

345
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:32,639
we really are 15 minutes here now if

346
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:34,860
there's one thing that you're looking

347
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,079
forward to over the next 12 to 24 months

348
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,399
in your sector of the industry what

349
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:39,958
would you be looking forward to seeing

350
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,559
happening

351
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,559
hmm

352
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:49,919
I that's a difficult question

353
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:53,518
um

354
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:55,639
I think it would be nice actually then I

355
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:59,519
think it would be very nice to see more

356
00:14:55,639 --> 00:15:01,680
uh clinical trials on some of the

357
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,919
knowledge that has been put forward from

358
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:06,958
the basic research I know there has been

359
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:08,639
really a lot recently but still for

360
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:11,578
example regarding depression we don't

361
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:14,339
have a randomized clinical trial showing

362
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:17,939
if CBD is actually antidepressant or not

363
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:19,560
so if that would be there and would

364
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,180
confirm some of the things we have seen

365
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:24,958
in pre-clinical model I would be

366
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:27,120
extremely uh happy to see that what we

367
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:30,719
have been doing is really translational

368
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,940
and and and promising so

369
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,920
very good it's been very high loading

370
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,720
and interesting talk into you Sammy I

371
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:38,039
hope we get to chat again before the end

372
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,240
of the year and we can get an updated on

373
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:40,980
all the great work that you guys are

374
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,180
