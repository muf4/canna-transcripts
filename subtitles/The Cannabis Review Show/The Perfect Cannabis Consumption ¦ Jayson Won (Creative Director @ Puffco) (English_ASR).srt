got into the industry from music into

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,320
cannabis and your position at pubco at

19
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:41,200
the moment

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,480
sure

21
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,359
so i started out my life journey as a

22
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:49,679
drummer in a rock band in the 80s uh

23
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:51,840
here in la which was at the time the

24
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:54,479
mecca of music

25
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,600
especially that genre so i spent my teen

26
00:00:54,479 --> 00:01:00,398
and early 20s playing in bands uh going

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,480
on tour doing the whole musician life

28
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:06,000
and um after

29
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:08,478
my 20s i uh got married and realized

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,560
that i couldn't no longer be on the road

31
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:13,200
and live a lifestyle of a musician and

32
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,320
be married so i decided to give up music

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,799
and

34
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:19,438
focus on starting a family and in doing

35
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,759
so i had to find a job and the only job

36
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:24,719
that i could find was as basically a

37
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:27,040
janitor at an industrial design company

38
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:29,759
i had no high school diploma i was a

39
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,000
high school dropout just a musician so

40
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,118
wasn't qualified for anything other than

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,200
a janitorial job so i took the job and

42
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:39,438
just worked my way up the ladder long

43
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,280
story short um got to work at a

44
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,758
broadcast design company

45
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,920
and uh started just learning how to uh

46
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,478
learning my trade and learning how to

47
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,079
design and doing uh graphics for

48
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:52,719
television networks

49
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:55,919
and uh did a couple of high profile

50
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:56,718
projects like the super bowl open i did

51
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,320
uh

52
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:02,640
the olympics 1996 olympics for uh nbc

53
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:04,718
those were two huge profile high profile

54
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,439
jobs and from there just my design

55
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:10,159
career took off and i was able to start

56
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:12,639
my own creative agency um that got

57
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:14,239
acquired by a publicly traded company in

58
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,958
2011

59
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,959
and i was just freelancing around town

60
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,080
and heard about this opportunity at

61
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,640
pufco

62
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,800
uh and decided to see if i could meet

63
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:27,519
with them and speak to them about the

64
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,520
role was to to be the head of creative

65
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,400
and build a creative department at uh

66
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,159
pufco so instead of hiring an ad agency

67
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,560
to do all the all the creative and

68
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:38,239
marketing work uh build a department to

69
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,680
be able to do that in-house and that's

70
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,599
kind of uh how i ended up at puffco

71
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,519

72
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:47,518

75
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:52,878
2013 you guys are on the way to doing

76
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,360
100 billion turnover it's been a pretty

77
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:56,799
impressive story so far and i have to

78
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,560
admit the design of the products are

79
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,120
pretty amazing and beautiful and some of

80
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,800
the new accessories for the line for the

81
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,360
viewers can you tell the two different

82
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,879
product ranges that puffco do have for

83
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,480
consumers

84
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:13,518
so currently we have we last year uh for

85
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:16,079
an april fools kind of a campaign or

86
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,800
uh an idea we released a product called

87
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,040
budsee which is the first non-electronic

88
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,680
uh device that we put out um it's

89
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:26,318
basically a water bottle uh a bong

90
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,400
disguised as a water bottle uh and it

91
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:29,679
was like an april fool's joke people

92
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,280
thought it was a joke they didn't think

93
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:36,560
it was real um so we released it april

94
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,959
1st last year and it was a huge success

95
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,120
um so our products basically

96
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,479
we focus on trying to provide

97
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:48,319
the most uh enjoyable experience with

98
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:51,039
the plant so the plant is to us a

99
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:53,759
medicine or a gift that we have and we

100
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,878
just want to create a technology to

101
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:57,759
provide

102
00:03:54,878 --> 00:04:00,639
the most uh intuitive and enjoyable and

103
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:03,120
flavorful experience uh with the plant

104
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,479
and that's kind of the puffco uh mission

105
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,239
that kind of brings me on to the first

106
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:08,878
topic i want to highlight is puffco

107
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,438
being the most awarded it's uh the

108
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:13,199
flavorful experience is it the the

109
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:15,598
innovation with the technology that's

110
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,439
done in-house what do you think is the

111
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:19,599
number one factor that makes puffco the

112
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:21,600
number one brand at the moment

113
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,919
i think it's um

114
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,639
i think it's a time we spend in the and

115
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,279
the

116
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,280
thoughts we put into every little detail

117
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:31,439
uh previously in my career before

118
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:34,239
joining puffco i did get to work with

119
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:35,040
steve jobs over at apple for about seven

120
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,000
years

121
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,400
uh and um it was about the time when he

122
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,680
got back to apple after he was let go

123
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:46,319
and he came back and it it reminds me a

124
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,840
lot pubco reminds me a lot of the spirit

125
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,759
that apple had

126
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:51,758
when i was working there with uh with

127
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,560
steve and the rest of the apple team

128
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,120
it's

129
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,120
attention to detail making sure that um

130
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,199
everything is there for a reason

131
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,918
everything that all the features all the

132
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,319
things that are on any electronic device

133
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:06,799
is intuitive and it's meaningful and

134
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:09,360
it's it's well thought out and i think

135
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,000
you know puffco has a brand and as a

136
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,038
company yes we're a business yes we want

137
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,478
to make profit but um i think you know

138
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:18,319
our main goal

139
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:20,399
isn't to turn a profit or to make as

140
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,399
much money as possible squeeze every

141
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:24,719
dollar out of our customers our main

142
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:28,159
goal is to provide a

143
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:31,280
very meaningful and enjoyable experience

144
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,280
and put it put all all our energies and

145
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:35,359
thoughts into making that as thoughtful

146
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:38,000
as possible to the consumers and i think

147
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,160
that in return makes up for a successful

148
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,319
brand because the mission is just like

149
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,720
if you have a career goal and your goal

150
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,959
is only to make money um that's all

151
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,160
you're going to do and focus on but if

152
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:50,079
you

153
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,600
learn your craft and do your job really

154
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:53,279
really well and put a lot of thought and

155
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,680
effort into what you're putting your

156
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,679
energy towards the money becomes a side

157
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,918
effect of the great work that you're

158
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,319
doing so i think that's kind of what

159
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:05,279
puffco's mission is is to always chase

160
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,520
innovation and not chase money and uh

161
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:09,439
you know profits and all the other great

162
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:10,879
things that happen by creating a

163
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:14,240
wonderful product and bringing it into

164
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:15,918
the marketplace um is you know uh the

165
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,560
the profits and the success financial

166
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:20,079
success is all a byproduct of that

167
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,839
yeah i would agree i think cannabis

168
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,359
industry is a unique industry when you

169
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,279
look at it from the consumer's point of

170
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,879
view you could have a customer for four

171
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,399
to five decades

172
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:30,079
if you've got a good product and the

173
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:32,000
good products are really the ones that

174
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:34,560
kind of rise their top that it's not a

175
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,160
case of lowest market price sales in

176
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,079
this industry at all whereas let's say

177
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,600
in chocolate or drinks industry or

178
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:42,240
whatever it might be i think cannabis

179
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,919
consumers are well educated they know

180
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,600
what's going into their body they would

181
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:47,038
sooner spend that a little bit extra and

182
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,479
if you can provide the perfect design

183
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:50,560
which you guys have done which i think

184
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,399
it's you've built a perfect by the

185
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,759
perfect

186
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:55,439
products but then you seem to have

187
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,280
stripped them down anything that wasn't

188
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:58,800
required gets taken out immediately it's

189
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,959
not about just building an extended

190
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,800
building and making sure every component

191
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:05,198
in the device has a use

192
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,840
yeah absolutely and even when we do

193
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:11,360
upgrade versions or we do our limited

194
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:12,799
editions um our product lines um there

195
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,319
we don't just put things out for the

196
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,400
sake of putting it out we really put a

197
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,800
lot a lot of thought um we have an

198
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,959
amazing product team we had an amazing

199
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,680
quality control team we have an amazing

200
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:26,959
customer service team it really takes an

201
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,879
entire infrastructure an entire team of

202
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:30,239
people to make a successful brand

203
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:32,240
because there's so many touch points

204
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,240
with it with the consumer and so many

205
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,000
things that need to be carefully thought

206
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,519
out and and really work through and i

207
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,279
think our biggest

208
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:42,959
asset is that we do have a very

209
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:44,478
passionate and loyal consumer base

210
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:46,560
and they

211
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:48,318
give us their feedback and they let us

212
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,000
know what they'd like to see they let us

213
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,639
know what they don't like you know we

214
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,439
listen and i think for

215
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,560
us as a brand or as a company to have a

216
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:58,319
dialogue

217
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,280
with our customers and not just have a

218
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,360
monologue i think is a very huge kind of

219
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:05,038
uh advantage that we have

220
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,800
yeah it's been lovely and interesting

221
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:08,639
looking from ireland at the the north

222
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,879
american scene you can start to see now

223
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,800
the top companies in each sector coming

224
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,879
to the fore puffco and your territory

225
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,639
can in the beverages industry cookies in

226
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,599
the dispensaries industry and i think

227
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,439
that's just going to become more and

228
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:21,279
more prevalent with m as over the next

229
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,439
couple of years so it seems to be an

230
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:25,279
exciting let's say next five ten years

231
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:26,478
ahead for what could be huge potential

232
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:28,399
for puffco

233
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:31,038
absolutely it is very exciting i think

234
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:32,478
yeah technology evolves really quickly i

235
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:34,479
think one of the beautiful things about

236
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,719
puffco and why i enjoy working here so

237
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,879
much is that we're a purpose-driven

238
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,760
brand we're not a brand that's just

239
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:43,838
purposefully uh strictly capitalistic

240
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:45,679
we're a brand that care about social

241
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,959
issues where a brand that care cares

242
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:51,199
about human equality we care about uh

243
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:52,799
all of the people that uh the shoulders

244
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,959
of the giants that we're standing on

245
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:58,079
people that had are served had had to

246
00:08:54,958 --> 00:09:00,000
serve 25 30-year sentences in jail to be

247
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,879
able to you know for us to enjoy the

248
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,278
legalization that we have currently um

249
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:07,919
all of the things that we we do we do it

250
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:11,278
with purpose just like with our devices

251
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:12,559
i think we're very aware of um social

252
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:14,720
causes and things that we feel

253
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:17,759
passionate about and we

254
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,240
feel passionate about along a side along

255
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:22,480
with our community so that uh we're not

256
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,480
just a voice on our own but we're able

257
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,159
to hand our megaphone or share our

258
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,120
platform with those voices that need to

259
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:28,399
be heard

260
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,759
yeah and i think companies like

261
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,600
yourselves need to lead for the front

262
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:34,080
cause it's not just all about capital

263
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,920
gains and returns of this industry where

264
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,680
we're much more vested in the industry

265
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:39,120
work and as a whole and delivering

266
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:40,639
quality products to people than just

267
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,600
having a couple of commas in a bank

268
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:45,278
account at the end of the day 100 100

269
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,519
and i think you know the cannabis

270
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:49,439
industry was born out of activism right

271
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,039
it was a demonized

272
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,880
plant medicine that got a bad pr wrap

273
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:57,360
and uh you know it's starting to be

274
00:09:54,879 --> 00:10:00,480
normalized i think we have to be at the

275
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,480
forefront of normalizing this plant and

276
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,759
really sharing the benefits of this

277
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,639
plant medicine for me personally um i

278
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:10,720
have a huge sleeping disorder um for

279
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:13,600
many many years and the doctors

280
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,639
prescribed me every sleeping pill every

281
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,278
you know

282
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:19,120
a valium and any xanax you name it i've

283
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:21,439
been prescribed to try to put me to

284
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,440
sleep it works it does put you to sleep

285
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,040
but you know your the rest of your day

286
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,000
is ruined after you wake up because it's

287
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:31,039
such a powerful tranquilizer and when i

288
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,519
got introduced to cannabis uh in cbd it

289
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:36,719
changed my world it truly added value to

290
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,720
my life i got off of these poisons um

291
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,680
it's the only thing i used to to go to

292
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:45,120
sleep and relax and it's it's been a

293
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:47,599
huge asset to to my well-being in so

294
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,560
many different ways mentally physically

295
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,159
um i feel so much better um so it's

296
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:53,439
really provided me

297
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:56,480
a a

298
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,640
enjoyable kind of alternative to the

299
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,639
prescription drugs that the doctors were

300
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:02,399
prescribing me yeah that's one of the

301
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:04,480
topics i was going to go which was from

302
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,559
tranquilizers to edibles because i don't

303
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,159
know about your journey going from there

304
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:09,199
so yeah it's great to highlight

305
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,879
everybody that you don't need to be

306
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,240
consuming a lot of tablets to get a good

307
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:13,919
night's sleep there are a number of

308
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,680
different methods out there if you did a

309
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:17,199
little bit of research on it it's going

310
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:19,120
to bring me on to the last topic the

311
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,200
perfect cannabis consumption

312
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,278
what do you think is the perfect way to

313
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,040
consume cannabis and

314
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:29,360
all the little variables that would go

315
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:32,159
with that i think um to me personally i

316
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:35,278
think that there is no wrong way um it's

317
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:38,240
just what you prefer right so um i still

318

works for you and then explore and and

340
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:34,319
