well thank you very much for taking your

12
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:32,700
time to do this you've designed multiple

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,500
manufacturing facilities and you have

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,059
hundreds of formulations and recipes to

15
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,100
your name do you want to give everybody

16
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:39,659

I've actually been in the industry in

20
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:50,159
the industry since 2006 so

21
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:51,899
um quite a little spit not as long as

22
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,839
some of the people that I know and my

23
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,879
mentors that were in as well but I work

24
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,539
currently as a consultant and formulator

25
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:02,280
in the space I design and blueprint and

26
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,799
help other brands and other countries

27
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,439
open all over the world I have designed

28
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,900
over 17 kitchens now I have two more

29
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,879
that's on the way so I'm going to be

30
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,760
getting to 19 here by the end of this

31
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:16,920
year and I design manufacturing and

solvent lists uh whether you need like

35
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:26,459

um you know hydrocarbon as well as the

37
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:30,719
commercial kitchens and then I also

00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:56,519
for more to get in it we need more we

73
00:02:53,818 --> 00:02:58,199
need more people in it yeah a highly

74
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:59,939
accomplished career is today take me

75
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:02,518
back to the first ever balsamic

76
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:04,199
vinaigrettesh that you produced as a

77
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:05,519
young person produced in your first

78
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:07,619
product like that what were some of the

79
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,560
hurdles that you had to overcome

80
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,480
well um I go really in depth in it in my

81
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,000
ex in my first expert cannabis cookbook

82
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:17,039
uh there's lots of details that when it

83
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,439
comes to plant infusion into fats

84
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:21,780
because cannabis is not water soluble I

85
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,158
can make it water soluble with a

86
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,019
extraction method with using

87
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:27,840
maltodextrin but that's a different

88
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:29,400
topic but infusing the fat you have to

89
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,719
work with the different

90
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,158
um you know there's boiling points and

91
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:35,039
there's also flash points or smoke

92
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:37,378
points with the oil uh there's compounds

93
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:40,139
that you can lose in the plant terpenes

94
00:03:37,378 --> 00:03:42,658
mainly but also you you can lose

95
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:45,598
potencies and lose one of the more like

96
00:03:42,658 --> 00:03:47,399
broad spectrum uh capabilities that the

97
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:50,158
plant has when you are in the extraction

98
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,080
process so choosing your fat that you

99
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,479
want to bind it with on beforehand

100
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,659
before you put it into your recipe is

101
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:59,459
that utmost important uh you know we've

102
00:03:57,658 --> 00:04:01,019
I've kind of strayed away from can of

103
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:03,239
butter because they're all healthy

104
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:05,759
healthier options such as you know olive

105
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:09,780
oil avocado oil the main one I like to

106
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:12,060
use is MCT coconut oil mct's uh medium

107
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:14,098
chain triglyceride which allows the

108
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,379
medicine to actually go through your

109
00:04:14,098 --> 00:04:18,180
body faster and you and so that the

110
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:20,219
medicine actually hits you faster

111
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,918
instead of oh I took an edible and it's

112
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,600
an hour later and hasn't hit me yet and

113
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:26,879
then you know everyone makes a mistake

114
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,199
whoops I took it too much and you know

115
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:34,439
we've I think we've all been there

116
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:35,939
I think everybody has a bad edible story

117
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:37,680
yeah well that actually kind of brings

118
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:40,379
me on to the main kind of first topic of

119
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,600
the show on its edible formulations and

120
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:44,339
production methods when it comes to the

121
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,259
formulations type of things obviously

122
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:47,638
what are like the top two three things

123
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:50,040
that people should be looking at is to

124
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:51,840
protect an IEP is it insuring the

125
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,639
absorption rate and the solubility of it

126
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,079
what are the kind of main things when it

127
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:57,060
comes to the formulation side of things

128
00:04:55,079 --> 00:05:00,719
that are a Paramount to be keeping your

129
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:03,000
eye on oh okay well uh obviously you're

130
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,800
you're the chef make it taste good

131
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,860
that's job number one but the most

132
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,360
important job is homogeneity

133
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,160
um the exactly what you said the

134
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,600
delivery method of it getting into the

135
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,880
fat that you're buying it to get it into

136
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:18,419
your system it's very important but

137
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:20,040
being able to have your formula to the

138
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:22,799
quantity of the netway or wetway

139
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:26,280
depending on if you're baking or making

140
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,139
Confections gummies per se

141
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:30,599
um getting the formula right so that

142
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:33,060
each dose is exactly what it's supposed

143
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,740
to be is of utmost importance because

144
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:38,220
that's when Edibles can get dangerous

145
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:40,259
you know we call it edible roulette if

146
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,820
you make a batch and it's not completely

147
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:44,580
homogenized and it doesn't pass your

148
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:46,860
homogeneity test at the lab you know you

149
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:49,500
can eat one and feel nothing and then

150
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:52,020
somebody can get an 800 milligram gummy

151
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,399
and you know then it's night night

152
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:56,779
Grandma she's not going to make it to

153
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:56,779
your soccer practice okay

154
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:02,100
so I would definitely say homogeneity uh

155
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:04,740
quality of your ingredients

156
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:07,439
um and uh you know every everything with

157
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:10,259
infusion is temperature time and and and

158
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:11,519
and love honestly you put you put what

159
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:14,100
you you put your energy into everything

160
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:17,099
that you do so if you love what you do

161
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:19,199
and the recipe is solid the rest is just

162
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,879
formulas and math and you know the you

163
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,560
can Master this

164
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:25,139
yeah it seems to be when you actually

165
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,019
dive deep into this topic that it seems

166
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:31,199
to be the beautiful uh marrying of Art

167
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:33,060
and Science together uh where you have

168
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,560
to kind of have to be a master of both

169
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,538
because it's not just about the tasting

170
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,639
product and the combinations and recipes

171
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:41,159
it's about the minute molecule recipes

172
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,780
and how this is going to be uh playing

173
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,759
across receptors and across different

174
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:46,258
body weight sizes and a number of

175
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:48,960
different metrics that need to be taken

176
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:50,699
into consideration exactly whey body

177
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,978
mass all that makes a difference as well

178
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:54,960
as your extraction process I found that

179
00:06:52,978 --> 00:06:57,000
my favorite form of extractions honestly

180
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:59,519
solventless working with bubble hash

181
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,220
rosin and uh that and that is the more

182
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,839
artisanal so there's like the artisanal

183
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,340
form of extraction and then there's the

184
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:07,079
scientific form of extraction which

185
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:10,318
would be with solvents like hydrocarbon

186
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:12,120
and CO2 and ethanol and whatnot and you

187
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,419
know taking something to distillate form

188
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:17,699
you know you basically just you know you

189
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:19,620
you made it tasteless correct so if

190
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:22,439
you're working at a medical Market

191
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:24,240
that's great because you know it some

192
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:26,399
people like it being tasteless and also

193
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,478
you can take the potency up a lot higher

194
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:29,399
because when you work in the

195
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:31,860
distillation process you take the

196
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:33,719
potency up higher whereas I find it to

197
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,639
be more medically beneficial for the

198
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,580
patient to

199
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:40,620
um to keep it simple and work with work

200
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:42,240
with the you know the Entourage effect

201
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,579
of the plant work with more full

202
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,900
spectrum broad spectrum work with more

203
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:48,598
of the cannabinoids that are available

204
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:51,179
because at the plan in its natural form

205
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:53,038
works like that it you know it has

206
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,740
compounds that protect it from other

207
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:57,418
compounds so which can you know if

208
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,699
you're just working most of the industry

209
00:07:57,418 --> 00:08:03,478
unfortunately is focused on high levels

210
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:05,460
of THC which and you know as there is

211
00:08:03,478 --> 00:08:07,079
great benefits of THC there's also some

212
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:09,060
possible adverse side effects that you

213
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:12,180
can feel such as like the couch locks

214
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:14,519
the paranoia some anxiety

215
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:17,340
um you know the cheeses of the strains

216
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:21,478
they they can get up to the high 20s and

217
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:22,560
low 30s of Delta 9 potency and those are

218
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:24,300
known to give you like a little bit of

219
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,699
arrhythmia they can you know kind of

220
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,918
cause anxiety so having it paired with a

221
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:31,919
full spectrum range of like also

222
00:08:28,918 --> 00:08:34,439
balancing the CBD and CBG and CBN and

223
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:37,439
the terpenes it gives you more of the

224
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,719
effect that like your overall body needs

225
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,399
and I think that's very important and I

226
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,740
think as more education and more science

227
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:44,879
and more research comes out

228
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:48,120
um the industry is only going to grow

229
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:50,759
and get better that's pretty amazing and

230
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:54,000
when it comes then to let's say the

231
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:55,620
future of formulations it is the most

232
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,360
advantageous route so let's say we get

233
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,980
Federal legalization European gets

234
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,019
legalization there's going to need to be

235
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,300
ingredient suppliers to this industry

236
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:05,820
when it comes to the kind of large scale

237
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:06,838
do you see the most advantageous route

238
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,120
the

239
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,339
let's say molecules via fermentation

240
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,659
combined with other Terrapins combined

241
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:14,459
with other molecules and these recipes

242
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:16,139
and formulations being the kind of

243
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:17,639
especially the medical side of things it

244
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:19,740
seems to be that's where the most

245
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:22,799
advantageous route for companies to get

246
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,959
uh patient Pacific medicine right is

247
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:26,639
going to be in those Avenues exactly

248
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,739
personalized medicine is in those

249
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,120
Avenues and that's where that's in you

250
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,500
know the side of the industry that I am

251
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,120
you know I'm blessed that I've worked

252
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,480
with some of the best cultivators in in

253
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,700
the world uh Kenji fujashima is the head

254
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:43,139
Master uh Master cultivator for Dr

255
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:44,940
greenthumbs and uh you know you're you

256
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:47,159
as the formulator are only as great as

257
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,899
your starting product so if you work

258
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:50,639
with a great great grower and your

259
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:53,519
starting project is amazing then you're

260
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:55,199
ending product on if if you know if you

261
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,419
know if you know if you've mastered your

262
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,459
skill in production and extraction is

263
00:09:57,419 --> 00:10:01,139
going to be even better

264
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:03,179
um however you can also manipulate and

265
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:05,399
change things on the manufacturing side

266
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:07,739
and doing custom formulations with

267
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:09,539
isolated cannabinoids and make your own

268
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,940
custom formulation in your own full

269
00:10:09,539 --> 00:10:14,099
spectrum that way so it is very much

270
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:16,380
science but it is as well as you said

271
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:19,560
art because you're working with nature

272
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:21,179
and you're working with how God how how

273
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:24,119
God made the plant you're working with

274
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:25,979
how it naturally came and personalized

275
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,679
medicine is going to be at utmost

276
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:30,659
important for on our side because with

277
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:34,079
us being able to play with those levels

278
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:36,419
is how we can turn it into a medicine

279
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:39,360
that is uh that is like Coca-Cola we

280
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:41,699
turn it into consistency so you know as

281
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,639
you can give a say a Parkinson's patient

282
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:47,100
a an edible and you do it from one

283
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,439
strain one whole Harvest strain batch

284
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:52,259
and you put that that oil into that

285
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,880
batch and that stops his tremors well

286
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:55,740
you know you might have the next Harvest

287
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:58,139
with the same strain same genetics

288
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:00,180
however it doesn't have enough lean a

289
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:01,559
little or is missed a little bit of CBG

290
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:03,419
it's missing a little bit of the

291
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:05,099
compounds that is actually what is

292
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:07,379
stopping those Tremors for that patient

293
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,360
so on our end we are going to be able to

294
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:12,059
manipulate with science

295
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,740
to make that more of a guarantee that

296
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:14,518
this medicine works and it works every

297
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,220
time

298
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:19,560
yeah predictable and reliable products I

299
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:22,019
think is the aim objective for a global

300
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:23,939
sized industry absolutely

301
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:25,919
some form questions now who makes the

302
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,800
best edibles in America

303
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:31,679
in America oh

304
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:33,179
not not just myself oh that's hard to

305
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:35,759
say

306
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:37,559
um uh there there's a few edible chefs

307
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:40,860
that I that I know and work with my

308
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:42,719
friend uh case he's worked with a lot of

309
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:45,060
a lot of great people I think he has

310
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,940
like over 10 companies that he uh works

311
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:50,879
with he's based out of Las Vegas

312
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:53,760
um he his handle on Instagram is call me

313
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:57,600
case he's he's excellent I probably put

314
00:11:53,759 --> 00:12:00,419
him as my favorite uh besides myself

315
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:03,060
um also my my junior consultant who is

316
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:04,919
my Baker that I work with I pull her in

317
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:08,179
on when I have to do a baking consult

318
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:10,979
his Amy Robbins she's excellent as well

319
00:12:08,179 --> 00:12:13,919
but I'd have to say my favorite would be

320
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,480
me would be me yeah you could be making

321
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:16,979
do you maybe want to give everybody an

322
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,480
overview of what you're doing in Puerto

323
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,100
Rico at the moment and who you're

324
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,539
working with down there and kind of what

325
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,639
does the industry look like in Puerto

326
00:12:21,539 --> 00:12:26,939
Rico at the moment oh the industry in

327
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:28,679
Puerto Rico is medical uh and also they

328
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,339
don't have smoking in the regular

329
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:34,979
relation so while you can buy the flower

330
00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:37,680
they you buy it too late so smoking is

331
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:39,680
still considered illegal here so pretty

332
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:43,620
much everything is in the edible topical

333
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:46,199
uh or vaping market and uh the company

334
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:48,179
that I work with right now is rosaretta

335
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,579
this is my latest client and I design

336
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:52,578
their

337
00:12:50,578 --> 00:12:52,578
um

338
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:58,078
so and I I do a lot of regional

339
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,320
marketing whenever I enter a new space

340
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:03,778
so as I said I've built 17 kitchens now

341
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:08,399
one being in Columbia I've done one in

342
00:13:03,778 --> 00:13:12,240
Costa Rica Canada and uh Arizona Las

343
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:14,278
Vegas about five in California and when

344
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,740
when I say regional marketing it's uh

345
00:13:14,278 --> 00:13:19,200
you have to go with that cultures taste

346
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:21,720
buds you know because while I'm in

347
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,700
California and grape and watermelon and

348
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,500
sour apple are the most popular flavors

349
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:28,560
those flavors don't necessarily work

350
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:31,019
down here in the Caribbean so I have to

351
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:33,299
work with you know flavors like uh like

352
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:35,339
like guava you know so I did like a

353
00:13:33,299 --> 00:13:37,740
guava burst this I designed to be like a

354
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:40,139
gusher if you're familiar with that or

355
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:42,180
in Puerto Rico we have like a blue is

356
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:45,299
what it's more like but I have a guava

357
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:48,120
burst um I also have uh let me see

358
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:51,539
parcha which is a passion fruit

359
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,519
and then mangopina which is uh I already

360
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:56,219
ate that one sorry sorry guys it's too

361
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:58,379
good but um and then of course like the

362
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:00,240
sour key lime so I have multiple flavors

363
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,860
there with the biscuits and I have more

364
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,019
flavor launches that I'm that I'm doing

365
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:09,120
for the summer

366
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:10,560
um and as well as uh my books so uh

367
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,139
these are these are doing absolutely

368
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:14,879
well so I actually wrote this book 10

369
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:17,100
years ago it's the Happy Chef expert

370
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:19,320
cannabis cookbook and it's in

371
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:22,079
partnership with uh be real Cypress Hill

372
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:24,000
my partner Dr Green Thumb himself and it

373
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:26,159
includes his album in there as a free

374
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,980
download as well as it has a multitude

375
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:33,059
of recipes uh and as as we were talking

376
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:35,459
about science I do a breakdown in my

377
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:38,759
chapter that's called trichomes Terps

378
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:41,278
and temperatures and I go into heavy

379
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:43,860
detail on which cannabinoids benefit

380
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:45,899
which ailments as well as boiling points

381
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:48,720
and flashy points to kind of help you

382
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:51,000
master your skill of binding with with

383
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,220
your fats and your oils that you need to

384
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,259
make it a better process and this book

385
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:59,278
just celebrated its 10-year anniversary

386
00:14:55,259 --> 00:15:01,259
this past April 20th and so I decided to

387
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:03,539
launch as I live in Puerto Rico and work

388
00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:05,578
down in South America now I decide to

389
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:07,500
launch the whole series in Spanish so

390
00:15:05,578 --> 00:15:11,939
now I have it offered as La Chef police

391
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:14,519
at the cannabis so those are doing well

392
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:16,320
and um and then I have I noticed you had

393
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:18,539
on my the screen my actually this is my

394
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,899
psychedelic cookbook that I actually

395
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:24,299
pair uh cannabis with uh psilocybin in

396
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:26,639
these recipes and it's also this book is

397
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:30,059
a plant-based recipe book and it also

398
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,919
includes formulations and a lot of cfas

399
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:35,879
certificates of analysis and testing on

400
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:37,319
both psilocybin and cannabis so those

401
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:40,379
are my works that are what I'm doing

402
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,940
down in Puerto Rico uh with my books now

403
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:44,820
I want my book series now launching in

404
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:46,440
Spanish and my latest project that I'm

405
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:48,839
very happy to be working on that will be

406
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:51,480
launching next year is my husband and I

407
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:54,600
are launching a the first cannabis

408
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:56,659
textbook that will be uh supplied to

409
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,579
universities so it's called

410
00:15:56,659 --> 00:16:01,078
manufacturing cannabis the art and the

411
00:15:59,578 --> 00:16:04,379
Cannabis Alchemy

412
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:06,778
and we're hoping that this and you know

413
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:08,698
getting it into universities would help

414
00:16:06,778 --> 00:16:11,939
people that have the passion for it to

415
00:16:08,698 --> 00:16:14,219
be able to you know to Matt to to learn

416
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:16,139
and master and to get a job immediately

417
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:19,019
in the industry because that's something

418
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:21,240
I've noticed as a license holder

419
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:23,278
and a consultant that it's very

420
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,379
difficult to find people that have been

421
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:26,820
in the industry as long as I have uh

422
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:30,000
that you know that you're hiring people

423
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:31,980
with it with the skills uh and and also

424
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,480
the the passion to to do it you know

425
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:35,039
most people are coming in because they

426
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,959
just really have a passion for the plant

427
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:39,480
and they're we're kind of having to

428
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:41,698
teach them how I go but um having

429
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,980
somebody that are that is already has

430
00:16:41,698 --> 00:16:45,599
that knowledge in their brain and having

431
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,639
somebody with a different brain that

432
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,860
that we can all kind of you know Talk

433
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:52,039
Nerdy to each other that that always

434
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:54,060
helps when the formulation process so

435
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:55,620
incredible but it's been amazing talking

436
00:16:54,059 --> 00:16:57,359
to you hopefully we get to touch base

437
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,799
again over the next six to 12 months and

438
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,180

439
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:01,620
projects and maybe you'll be coming over
