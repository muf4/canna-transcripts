time to come on do you maybe want to

8
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:29,579
give everybody a little run through

9
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,320
between 30 and 60 seconds of how you

10
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:32,759
ended up becoming into the Cannabis

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,939
industry and your position at wanna

12
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:39,299
Brands yeah so I got involved in the

13
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:42,058
industry in 2013.

14
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:44,939
um I had a roommate in college I I

15
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:47,399
obviously was consuming cannabis for

16
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:48,780
personal use back then and found it

17
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,878
beneficial I never felt like it should

18
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:54,719
be something that was illegal but my

19
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:57,420
roommate had epilepsy and I was able to

20
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,939
realize what medical benefits it had for

21
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:03,359
him and that it was really able to

22
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:06,359
prevent his seizures and it really just

23
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,099
inspired something in me and catalyzed

24
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:10,920
me to want to get involved in the

25
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:13,019
industry so I moved out to Colorado in

26
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,780
2012 got involved in the industry in

27
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:19,618
2013 and then started working with Wana

28
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:22,560
Brands early in 2014.

29
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:25,079
okay incredible and water brands have

30
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,000
become one of the stable uh top tier

31
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:29,340
brands in the in the North American

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,540
cannabis industry then what I wanted to

33
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,280
talk to you about and I'm sure you're

34
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,259
going to have a lot of information for

35
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,820
the audience is innovation and Edibles

36
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:37,200
at the moment there's a couple of

37
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:39,419
different things that I'd like to touch

38
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,579
on and that are under that umbrella of

39
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,680
innovation and Edibles because over in

40
00:01:41,578 --> 00:01:45,059
Europe we see a lot of the only thing

41
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,860
that you'll see in media is going to be

42
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,359
a synthetic edible that comes from a

43
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:50,219
drug dealer that's done some sort of

44
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:52,078
damage so I'd love to be able to explain

45
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:54,658
to the audience how advanced this

46
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:57,478
industry is and uh what exactly are you

47
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:59,579
guys are up to so first and foremost the

48
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:00,959
technology involved in making Edibles

49
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:03,419
for everybody who doesn't understand

50
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:05,938
what is this simplified process without

51
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,459
giving too much away

52
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:11,060
yeah

53
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:11,060
no process

54
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:19,139
the the simple processing Edibles is um

55
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:21,479
taking taking the plant

56
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:25,019
um generally the the flower the buds the

57
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:27,500
influences and extracting it and with

58
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:30,360
cannabinoids and terpenes being

59
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:34,318
lipophilic you're usually using solvents

60
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:37,200
like butane CO2 or ethanol

61
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:38,939
to create an extract and then you can

62
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,339
purify and post-process it with

63
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:43,759
processes like distillation and then

64
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,680
that extract is then infused into

65
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:48,359
products like chocolates gummies other

66
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,620
edible forms

67
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,840
um so it's generally taking the plant

68
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:54,480
using extraction methods cleaning it up

69
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,459
and then introducing it into an edible

70
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:58,139
and the introduction of it into any

71
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:59,939
product per se is through specific

72
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:01,679
technology and equipment that gets used

73
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:03,300
for let's say obviously it's probably

74
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,439
going to be easy to be done by hand but

75
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,360
if they're a large company like

76
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:09,539
yourselves is there certain technology

77
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,099
that is given the exact dosage per exact

78
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:13,560
government every single time or what

79
00:03:11,098 --> 00:03:15,299
does the manufacturing line look like at

80
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,800
a company of your scale

81
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,140
you know the interesting thing with

82
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,719
cannabis in the United States is how

83
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:23,579
state by state specific regulations and

84
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:25,318
Market sizes are

85
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,140
um so at wanna we have multiple

86
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:29,280
different

87
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:31,679
methodologies on how to do the infusion

88
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,620
from something as small as using lab

89
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,680
kits and measuring devices into things

90
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,780
like pots you can literally cook in in

91
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,239
pots at very small scales all the way up

92
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,860
to full automated equipment and with the

93
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,299
full automated equipment side there are

94
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:51,000
API dosing devices that can

95
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:53,099
accurately measure inline dosing for for

96
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,539
the Cannabis products

97
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:56,639
um but it really just depends on the

98
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:58,739
methodology of cooking

99
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,539
okay incredible and the product range

100
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:03,060
you guys got is pretty extensive and

101
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:05,219
some very Advanced uh Innovations in

102
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,259
your plans and form is for example the

103
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:09,000
new quick product you guys brought out

104
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:11,280
can you maybe give an example of the

105
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,658
technology behind uh bringing that

106
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,759
product to Market

107
00:04:12,658 --> 00:04:17,939
yeah you know in the early days cannabis

108
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:20,219
uh Edibles really just were extracts of

109
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:22,139
a specific strain or a specific scheme

110
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,120
of our of canvas

111
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:25,918
um these days we are looking to make

112
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,800
more effect specific products we

113
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:31,019
understand that this plant has a

114
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,699
multitude of benefits and a multitude of

115
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:36,000
different effects it can elicit

116
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:38,580
depending upon that team of our chemical

117
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,459
variety of compounds in there so what is

118
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:44,959
the formulation of cannabinoids and

119
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:48,620
terpenes that elicit different effects

120
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:50,638
we know that people use cannabis for

121
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:54,180
effects like

122
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,100
relieving anxiety calming effects sleep

123
00:04:54,180 --> 00:05:00,240
so our newest formulation called

124
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:02,879
quickcom uses a functional blend of just

125
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,460
one milligram of THC so it's not a very

126
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,978
intoxicating dose very low dose of THC

127
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:11,219
but combines that with 10 milligrams of

128
00:05:07,978 --> 00:05:12,719
CBD 10 milligram CBG and also

129
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,180
Additionally the formulation is 50

130
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,759
milligrams of l-theanine normally found

131
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:20,280
in green tea this is all enhanced with

132
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:23,038
30 other Botanical terpenes for a

133
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:25,379
calming relaxing effect and it's all

134
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:26,939
fast acting so it takes it through five

135
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:28,680
to fifteen minutes

136
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:30,240
I really think the future of a lot of

137
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,579
cannabis products are going to be these

138
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,139
highly formative products

139
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:36,418
um where instead of guessing what the

140
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:38,639
stream might feel or affect we are

141
00:05:36,418 --> 00:05:41,519
formulating them so consumers

142
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,840
can rely on the marketing and say I know

143
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:44,939
this product's going to work for me for

144
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:47,159
the effect I want

145
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:48,959
okay so that kind of leads me perfectly

146
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,060
to the next topic I want to discuss and

147
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:53,159
that's the research and development that

148
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,680
happens in Edibles you just mentioned

149
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,600
there your own unique blend and

150
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,079
formulation of ingredients that created

151
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,000
the quickcom do you see is this one of

152
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:04,918
the most Innovative part or the most

153
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,019
Cutting Edge part of the edible industry

154
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:08,579
is their big money being pumped into r d

155
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:12,538
and the creation of Blends and

156
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:15,060
formulations as a unique iepable a

157
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:17,399
component for any organization

158
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,500
I think there is and there isn't um the

159
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:21,719
industry is a little bifurcated in the

160
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,038
way that it's doing r d I think there

161
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,020
are a lot of brands that are sticking

162
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:27,240
towards

163
00:06:24,019 --> 00:06:28,978
very simplistic r d which is throwing

164
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,319
whatever the new hot cannabinoid is

165
00:06:28,978 --> 00:06:33,839
taking some

166
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:36,660
you know phrasing off of

167
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:39,000
places like Leafly and and spitting that

168
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:41,039
out then there are companies like wanna

169
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,918
and others that are actually doing

170
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:45,839
consumer research on the effects they're

171
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:47,939
doing surveys they're doing clinical

172
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:51,179
trials we're trying to understand how

173
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:53,160
these uh products make people feel how

174
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:55,079
the different formulations work

175
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,479
and then you also have a third piece

176
00:06:55,079 --> 00:07:00,180
which is Pharma is getting into this in

177
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:01,379
actually new synthetic cannabinoids that

178
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,600
they're formulating

179
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:05,579
um Raphael mushroom and his team in

180
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:09,960
Israel have started to formulate a

181
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:11,899
variety of CBD uh like molecules they're

182
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:14,120
not found in the plant but they are

183
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:17,519
cannabinoids they'll do activated

184
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:19,319
cannabinoid receptors and are being

185
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:20,939
formulated for very specific treatments

186
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:22,199
and four effects

187
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:25,259
um so there's there's a bit of a

188
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:28,020
different approaches from very

189
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:31,319
unscientific to very scientific

190
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:33,418
and that do you see the biotechnology

191
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:35,098
companies now that are now able to buy

192
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:37,198
or synthesize these molecules in

193
00:07:35,098 --> 00:07:39,779
large-scale batches completely clean

194
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,939
precise replicable over and over do you

195
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:43,619
see them taking a market share of the

196
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:47,639
ingredient side of things let's say from

197
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:51,120
a plant extraction model

198
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:53,098
it depends on where you're located so

199
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,259
when we're talking about synthesis of

200
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:56,819
cannabinoids there's a few different

201
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:59,220
approaches

202
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:02,220
um one that we've seen growing a lot in

203
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:05,400
Canada has been fermentation you're

204
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:07,319
utilizing bacteria and yeast to produce

205
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:08,459
you actually genetically modify these

206
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:11,460
organisms

207
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:15,359
add ingredients and in their metabolic

208
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:17,279
processes are able to convert raw

209
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,500
ingredients and molecules into

210
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:20,399
cannabinoids because they're genetically

211
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,620
modified

212
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:27,060
so we're seeing that for things like CBG

213
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:29,519
in Canada I've also seen ways to take

214
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:31,918
the actual biomechanical Machinery of

215
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:33,958
trichomes where terpenes and

216
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:37,399
cannabinoids are made in the plant and

217
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:40,619
you can isolate those and put them into

218
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:41,658
reactors and these these reactors are

219
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,278
able to

220
00:08:41,658 --> 00:08:46,259
replicate the environment that tricoms

221
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:48,240
would live in and have them produce

222
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:50,120
cannabinoids

223
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,039
um and then there's always just

224
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,839
synthetic production in Labs where

225
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:57,299
you're taking raw hydrocarbons

226
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:59,160
synthesizing them with reagents and

227
00:08:57,299 --> 00:09:01,620
producing them in labs

228
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:04,259
all of these processes end up producing

229
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:06,980
very pure very isolated forms of

230
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:06,980
cannabinoids

231
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:12,139
it's going to take

232
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:15,059
for that process to work in each market

233
00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:17,879
the working with governments and other

234
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:20,579
institutions to prove that the method is

235
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:21,778
safe reliable and producing very pure

236
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,480
isolates

237
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:28,019
in the long term these will likely be

238
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:32,220
more environmentally friendly less cost

239
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:35,039
and providing purer ingredients so I do

240
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:37,139
see a path forward for them in the

241
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:39,419
United States right now without FDA

242
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:40,740
regulation I don't know that there's

243
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:43,319
going to be a path forward for those

244
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:44,879
soon whereas in other markets

245
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,339
particularly in Europe I think

246
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:49,439
governments are working to

247
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:51,720
start to regulate understand these

248
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,160
processes and provide a supply chain for

249
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,860
them

250
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:57,659
yeah it's got to be an interesting few

251
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,879
years ahead for the Edibles Market both

252
00:09:57,659 --> 00:10:02,159
in Europe and in North America to see

253
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:04,019
how both markets evolve and the

254
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:06,240
different ingredients suppliers whether

255
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:07,799
they're one size fits all or whether we

256
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,360
have one company has to have two

257
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:11,519
different manufacturing outputs to be

258
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,720
able to suit the two different markets

259
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:18,240
you know the the one the one area that

260
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,740
we need to understand better when we're

261
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,200
talking about

262
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:24,000
um these isolated products is what

263
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,519
Raphael mushroom and Ethan Russo and

264
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,200
others have been suggesting is the idea

265
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:31,560
that there's an Entourage effect that

266
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:34,620
canvas plants produce that THC alone or

267
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:37,679
CBD alone are less effective than the

268
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:39,778
two combined or combined with CBG or CBC

269
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:43,379
or other other cannabinoids and terpenes

270
00:10:39,778 --> 00:10:46,200
so while we're looking at isolating and

271
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:46,980
purifying single molecules we need to

272
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,899
understand that there are other

273
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,940
components that likely synergize

274
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:53,458
together so when we strip everything

275
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:55,920
apart and have isolated compounds we

276
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:58,199
need to be looking at how the plants are

277
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:00,740
naturally producing these compounds and

278
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:03,120
seeing if we can mimic and learn from

279
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:06,480
strains that are known for pain relief

280
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,220
or anxiety relief or or benefits for

281
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,278
sleep I'm trying to replicate those

282
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:13,440
Blends when we get to a pure Pharma

283
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:15,838
model where it's one molecule one

284
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,000
receptor we start to lose some of the

285
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,220
benefits of the plant so while I do

286
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,980
think that a lot of the future will be

287
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:25,560
driven by these

288
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:27,180
new synthetic isolated forms of cannabis

289
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:30,239
I think that they also need to be

290
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:31,739
combined in structured ways that are

291
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,200
formulated based off of the plant and

292
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:37,200
also shown in tested and research for

293
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,600
efficacy and validated in that way

294
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,160
yeah I think the Holy Grail is that if

295
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,659
they can isolate the different molecules

296
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:45,419
and as I said create their own recipe

297
00:11:42,659 --> 00:11:47,819
that is almost replicable to an actual

298
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:49,860
plant but they can repeat it a billion

299
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,899
times over in a safe and conductive

300
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,278
manner might be the the opportunity

301
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:55,078
that's out there for the ingredients as

302
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,120
far as one last thing I want to touch on

303
00:11:55,078 --> 00:12:00,419
before you go is the distribution battle

304
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,399
how do you guys see distribution in the

305
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:04,319
states I know it's it's state by state

306
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:07,139
at the moment but compared to Canada

307
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,480
what what is the distribution like for a

308
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:12,480
large-scale brand such as yourself

309
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:15,240
well the distribution paddle is a really

310
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,459
outside of even the industry itself it's

311
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:20,220
in the United States that

312
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:21,899
fact that there's no

313
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,759
really ability to ship across state

314
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:26,578
lines with it being federally illegal

315
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:28,439
still what it is is a patchwork of

316
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:31,078
different markets that are all regulated

317
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,360
differently utilizing different seed to

318
00:12:31,078 --> 00:12:35,278
sale tracking systems using different

319
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,320
distribution models

320
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:38,759
um and you know what you can do in one

321
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,320
state is very different than what you

322
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:42,958
can do in another

323
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,240
um so that means that there is no real

324
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:47,819
model for how this works in the United

325
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,399
States and it has to be

326
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:53,339
figured out within each market some

327
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,440
markets are I think better regulated and

328
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,639
better set up than others

329
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,800
and when we're talking about

330
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,360
distribution I think one of the really

331
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:02,159
big red flags used to be looking at is

332
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,259
what's happening in California

333
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:07,379
where there are distribution centers

334
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:09,720
that are pushing out and diverting

335
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:12,179
product into the black market

336
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,800
um and and it's actually a significant

337
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:15,659
portion of what's being produced in

338
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:18,778
California is going through distribution

339
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:20,879
centers being sent to lesser unregulated

340
00:13:18,778 --> 00:13:23,578
markets like New York

341
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:25,740
um so there's there's a lot of work to

342
00:13:23,578 --> 00:13:26,939
be done on the distribution model in the

343
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,620
US for sure

344
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,060
um unlike Canada that has a more

345
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:32,278
regulated system

346
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:34,138
yeah when we were over New York they're

347
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:36,480
um about 10 months ago there was every

348
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:38,159
California brand Under person was in all

349
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,320
the illegal dispensaries and one would

350
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:42,240
wonder whether uh no cross state

351
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,980
competition or transactions how these

352
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,240
are getting there do you ever see a

353
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,459
scenario where

354
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,019
before Federal legalization let's say

355
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:51,119
two states that cross-border with each

356
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:52,259
other come to an agreement to come to a

357
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,740
deal that they're going to be allowed

358
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:57,720
trying to cross-border Commerce that's a

359
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:59,539
great question you know California's

360
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,820
actually already floated that idea of

361
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:05,759
partnering with States like Oregon uh

362
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:08,480
that is neighboring also has a legal

363
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:11,220
regulated system in setting up their own

364
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,019
state-by-state interstate commerce

365
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,759
um I haven't seen that move forward yet

366
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,620
and it raises really interesting

367
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:18,360
questions on how the federal government

368
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,980
would view that

369
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:24,060
um

370
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:26,278
I do not see a situation where States

371
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:28,018
like California and New York set up a

372
00:14:26,278 --> 00:14:29,458
system for interstate commerce there's

373
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:31,500
too many states in between that haven't

374
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:33,539
legalized yet and I think that's going

375
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:35,458
to be a hard path forward

376
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:37,078
um I I do think that the real Holy Grail

377
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:39,539
that we're aiming for is federal

378
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:42,419
regulations

379
00:14:39,539 --> 00:14:45,419
yes well let's hope fingers crossed that

380
00:14:42,419 --> 00:14:47,519
2023 is the year where we get a little

381
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:49,139
bit of gain on the ground because yeah

382
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,480
if we've all got our fingers crossed and

383
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:53,278
it seems to be the logical thing but

384
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,480
like with things in life the logical

385
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:56,639
thing doesn't normally get the most

386
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,139
