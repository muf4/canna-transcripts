5
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:19,439
activist comedian presenter and mc for

6
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:21,198
the upcoming international cannabis

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,879
business conference in berlin how are

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,880
you keeping today mate

9

i'm feeling pretty good about it man uh

10
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:30,559
every day is a good day i'm free and out

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,399
of jail so that's the two first steps

12
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:34,399
we've come such a long way

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,160
always very good steps and maybe just

14
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,679
jump straight in and a lot of people

15
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:39,439
know you're from different very facets

16
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:41,039
you've got a amount of many talents can

17
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,799
you maybe give everybody an overview of

18
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,960
how you came about with the cooking on

19
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:46,320
high show and i can think that's the

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,759
thing that kind of propelled you into a

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,039
certain amount of fame on a global

22
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:52,000
audience

23
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,520
global audience indeed man um yeah i got

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,280
a call they're like we're looking for

25
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,640
someone who knows a lot about weed is

26
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,079
comfortable on camera and i was like oh

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,399
i know a guy and uh so that was like

28
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,600
four four and a half years ago and it

29
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,439
was originally supposed to be a web

30
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,719
series uh cooking on high was like

31
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:11,039
chopped with weed and um

32
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:12,000
it just you know it sat around for a

33
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,840
year and then all of a sudden they

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,759
called me up and they said yeah hey it's

35
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,118
going to be on netflix uh in a couple

36
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,680
weeks so get ready and i was like all

37
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:22,159
right whatever and then boom it just

38
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,880
blew up and now i got homies from brazil

39
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,200
and ireland and peru and berlin and

40
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:28,560
amsterdam and all over the world like oh

41
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,799
we love you with the weed and the

42
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,200
cooking and the stuff and i think it's

43
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,520
mostly because

44
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,960
it's education and information we gave

45
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:38,399
out a lot of information on that show

46
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:40,879
and that's really the biggest challenge

47
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,200
i think a lot of times in this new

48
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:44,798
cannabis world is people just don't know

49
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,680
enough about it because all the

50
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,320
knowledge has been suppressed

51
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,799
yeah no i think and people misunder

52
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,639
underestimate i think media as a conduit

53
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,640
to get the message of

54
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,239
this industry across that how appealable

55
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,320
it is to so many different disciplines

56
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:01,839
and parts of the world

57
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:04,158
it's true and you know sometimes we

58
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,920
forget about the power of

59
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,439
of netflix like i've been on television

60
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,118
a couple times you know i've been a

61
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,199
comedian for 30 years so we used to do

62
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:13,280
all the comedy shows back in the 90s

63
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:15,519
and and that's definitely a big way you

64
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,039
people notice you people see things but

65
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,040
netflix

66
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:20,719
has a global

67
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:23,039
reach

68
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:25,039
and i was actually kind of blown away by

69
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:27,199
that i went from 4 000 instagram

70
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:29,679
followers to 70 000 instagram followers

71
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:30,560
in like two weeks and that was just that

72
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,719
was

73
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,120
not crazy but it was just wild it was

74
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:37,519
wild to me to see the reach of of the

75
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,280
global platform that netflix has and it

76
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,519
also did a lot of good i think in

77
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,439
helping people overcome a lot of stigmas

78
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,719
and and to learn how to cook with weed

79
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:46,000
because you can make almost anything you

80
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:47,759
want with cannabis now as long as

81
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,439
there's a little fat in it

82
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:52,799
yeah and i think it was the combination

83
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:55,519
of your informed educated nuance with

84
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,760
the the fun and constant smile i think

85
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,000
is a perfect marriage to be able to pass

86
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,518
over information over to the audience

87
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,598
you might as well have fun when you're

88
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,759
teaching people through or people are

89
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:07,919
learning things it's uh i come from a

90
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:10,318
long line of teachers so uh don't tell

91
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:10,318
anybody

92
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,800
you're not supposed to know what did krs

93
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:16,158
one call it edutainment or if you're old

94
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,360
enough to remember the old i don't know

95
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:19,759
if they had them in ireland but we used

96
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,120
to have a show called school house rock

97
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:22,560
where they would sing songs about

98
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,319
education and stuff and that's how you

99
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,878
learn the times or the history of the

100
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:28,238
united states okay no i don't think i

101
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,479
was brought over here not to my

102
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,280
knowledge anyway next epic i wanted to

103
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:35,679
jump on to was the icbc that's happening

104
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,000
in berlin this july we kind of want to

105
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,480
give everybody a quick overview of it's

106
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,560
probably the preeminent uh conference

107
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:43,919
that happens in europe at the moment the

108
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,080
collection of people who are speaking

109
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:48,158
this year ky friedrich nerman jacob

110
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,480
benedict's sons freda solomon daniel

111
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:52,639

112
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:53,840

114
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,080
again in berlin man am i looking forward

115
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,318
to it first of all berlin is great it's

116
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,840
one of my favorite towns in the world uh

117
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:04,318
secondly

118
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,280
the the once again this is a scale thing

119
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:07,119
like

120
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,519
a lot of times we think of cannabis as a

121
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,719
somewhat decentralized industry right

122
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,039
you have your

123
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:14,239
weed person that you buy wheat from if

124
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:15,438
you don't live in a place where it's

125
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,519
legal or maybe you have a couple

126
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:20,399
dispensaries but we don't often think

127
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,918
about the global scale of cannabis right

128
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,758
now right uh

129
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:26,959
israel's selling moved to canada

130
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,759
canada selling weed to berlin um

131
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:30,879
is it it's thailand just decided that

132
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,319
they're going to hand out it's either

133
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:33,759
thailand or singapore thailand thailand

134
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:36,800
just decided they're going to hand out a

135
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,160
million cannabis plants to help farmers

136
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,600
kick-start their medical cannabis

137
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,439
program right where are they going to

138
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,120
get these plants from can they give me 5

139
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:44,478
000 plants this is the question

140
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,240
but

141
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:48,399
so when you look at that when you look

142
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,560
at the global scale of it is truly kind

143
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:53,198
of

144
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:56,560
mind-blowing seeing where the future of

145
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,080
the cannabis industry is going and and

146
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,560
sometimes i have weird feelings about

147
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:02,240
the commodification of cannabis right

148
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,319
because now it's going to be like orange

149
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,240
juice futures or wheat futures or gas

150
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:08,478
futures but that's

151
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,879
that's the nature of the planet right

152
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:13,038
now that's the industry and

153
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:14,959
more weed is always better for me would

154
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:17,759
i look forward to the day when i can go

155
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:19,439
to the weed shop and buy moroccan hash

156
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,639
straight from morocco the same way i can

157
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:24,560
buy irish whiskey or french wine and

158
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,759
that i think that would be a great day

159
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,360
and this is this is where it's going to

160
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,879
start and also the the international

161
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,400
campus business conference people from

162
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,399
all over the world sometimes i just like

163
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,399
to walk around and try to count how many

164
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:36,719
different languages

165
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:39,439
i can hear in the hallways there's

166
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,960
french germany english spanish

167
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:45,279
uh portuguese japanese it's it's it's

168
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,638
it's truly mind-melding and i and and i

169
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:47,918
love it there's people from all over and

170
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,038
all kind of different cultures so many

171
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:50,959
different

172
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:54,478
i always say that uh

173
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:56,239
cannabis is the subculture of every

174
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:57,599
other subculture right so for whatever

175
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,038
it is that people like to do there's a

176
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,800
whole other group of people that like to

177
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:02,560
get high and do it

178
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,840
yeah no i think if you ever see those

179
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,280
graphs that they have on the internet

180
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:07,279
where there's three circles and there's

181
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:09,599
always an intersecting point i think you

182
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:11,519
could put any three topics on the outer

183
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,479
reach and cannabis would fit in the

184
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:14,639
middle

185
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:16,639
we need to do the diagram of just about

186
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,759
everything for sure there's always a

187
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,800
subset

188
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,720
always

189
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,400
always look for a stoner

190
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,120
yeah so for this

191
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:27,519
summer for july it's the 18th or the

192
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,439
19th and 20th to july over in berlin for

193
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:31,120
anybody who wants to get their tickets

194
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:32,719
you can still obviously get some at

195
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,639
international cbc i think a lot of it's

196
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,479
incumbent sections are selled out but

197
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,918
highly recommend anybody who hasn't been

198
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:39,839
yet to get there we're going to be over

199
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:41,439
there interviewing a couple of the top

200
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:45,599
people and hopefully talking to you and

201
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:47,199
guys in person yeah as you see the days

202
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,680
i will be there and i will i will be

203
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,639
friendly and not too stoned it's hard to

204
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,478
find dabs in berlin uh and dabs make me

205
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,720
quiet uh it's not it's not that hard

206
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:59,038
just go on instagram but i'm saying that

207
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,800
uh and and germany is actually i mean

208
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:02,959
our timing is so good on this just like

209
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,240
with the first one when we when uh alex

210
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:06,000
set up the first

211
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,280
berlin international cannabis business

212
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,959
conference people were like why are you

213
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:10,399
going to berlin and then just a few

214
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:12,239
months in front of that

215
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:15,279
uh germany started a medical cannabis

216
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,800
program so our timing was perfect and

217
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:19,439
and for this one

218
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,280
uh just uh maybe a month ago a few weeks

219
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,680
ago germany announced that they're fast

220
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:25,758
tracking their cannabis legalization

221
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,759
program to legalize adult use in

222
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,360
recreational cannabis uh throughout the

223
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,560
whole country so

224
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,840
if you're trying to get on the ground

225
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,839
floor of that if you're trying to learn

226
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,439
about how you can help with that this is

227
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:36,799
the spot to be this is the place to be

228
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:38,478
there's going to be movers and shakers

229
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,960
from all over

230
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:42,639
yeah no i agree i think i'm looking

231
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:44,239
forward to some cannabis tourism when it

232
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,160
all pops up and seeing what the

233
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,759
dispensaries have to offer over in

234
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,319
germany i can no doubt that there's

235
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,240
going to be some slickly designed uh

236
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,000
perfectly wrong places

237
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,280
i'm sure it'll be very straight and

238
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,279
everything will look like a bauhaus

239
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:58,279
video

240
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,318
but yeah so i wanted to move on to the

241
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:05,839
next topic now and it was something

242
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,680
um i've asked a good few couple of

243
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:08,878
people who'd have a nuanced opinion that

244
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,160
miss you know what they're talking about

245
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,080
so the first one i want to know is

246
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,720
where's the best weed in the world from

247
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:16,399
or where do you think it's from

248
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,400
uh well i have to represent northern

249
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:20,560
california because that's where i'm from

250
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:23,839
and i think we still have

251
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,519
the most flavors the best flavors uh and

252
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:28,079
the best varieties

253
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:30,878
and also uh when it's grown right i

254
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:32,000
prefer an outdoor organic sun-grown kind

255
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,000
of weed

256
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,360
indoor wheat is cool too but i think

257
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
california has some of the best weed

258
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,240
farms in the on the planet

259
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,240
um northern or southern oregon is a

260
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,560
close second

261
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,759
and then i will also like to shout out

262
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:47,599
spain

263
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,600
for having

264
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,440
maybe not the most flavorful weed but

265
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,440
for some strange reason

266
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,440
spanish weed gets me

267
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,080
really really high so i'm going to say

268
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,440
spain has the strongest weed and i can't

269
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,920
i don't have any

270
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,160
all my evidence is anecdotal uh based on

271
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:06,639
the study of one person me being way too

272
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:09,439
high in spain more than once more than

273
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:11,039
i've ever been in amsterdam and not way

274
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,800
too high and uncomfortable it's just way

275
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:17,120
too high like and i'm really high um

276
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:18,319
so california oregon

277
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,879
spain

278
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,240
are my choices but i've never

279
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:24,000
traveled to any of the asian countries

280
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,959
so i can't speak on their cannabis and

281
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,278
i'm looking forward to trying to get

282
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:29,439
that uruguay to see what's going on over

283
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:30,958
there very nice actually yeah the south

284
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,800
american climate is meant to be the

285
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:35,679
perfect kind of replication of the

286
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:37,519
californian climate in terms of

287
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:38,958
premium product

288
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,240
i think that they can grow some good

289
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,359
wheat and that's one of the challenges

290
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,799
and that's one of the things you learn

291
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,639
at the international cannabis business

292
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:46,159
conferences you know

293
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:47,679
um

294
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:49,278
it's still farming right so you can't

295
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:53,039
just bring seeds that grow well in

296
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:55,120
canada and take them to uruguay or

297
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:56,879
thailand and expect them to perform in

298
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,080
the same way because the climate is

299
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:59,519
different the air is different the

300
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,959
moisture the humidity is different you

301
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,399
have to take all these factors into

302
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,518
effect and so i'm really looking forward

303
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,720
to seeing

304
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,320
uh localized strains i think

305
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,320
one of the challenges that we're having

306
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,839
in the cannabis industry is that

307
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,399
people want to treat it

308
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,440
like cigarettes right you just walk in

309
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,039
you buy your pack of export a's or i

310
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,440
don't i don't know what you guys smoking

311
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:24,000
in ireland

312
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,279
marlborough smart bros is universal uh

313
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,039
and then you leave the store but it's

314
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:29,759
really more like a beer or a

315
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:31,120
microbrewery so there should really be

316
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,559
super local

317
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,720
iterations

318
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:36,639
of the cannabis plant wherever you go so

319
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,320
you can smoke like jagermeister in

320
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:40,078
southern oregon you can smoke some crazy

321
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,839
haze when you're in barcelona or you can

322
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:44,078
smoke

323
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:47,040
der franzbrachen or whatever they call

324
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:47,039
it when you're in

325
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,078
yeah i think you've got such a huge uh

326
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,600
european farming industry that i think

327
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:57,439
once it becomes legal over here i think

328
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,720
you're gonna see a lot of cultivars and

329
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:03,519
a lot of new genetics pop up that

330
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,000
brand new uh hvac companies that are

331
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,320
basically able to design these fully

332
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,240
operational indoor grows that could be

333
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,160
fully recyclable and carbon neutral and

334
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,560
whatnot and i think that it'll be the

335
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:16,480
battle of the farmers then within time

336
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:18,000
which is a good thing

337
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,360
i like when you say things like carbon

338
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,759
neutral and regenerate farming and

339
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,000
and i think we have to remember and this

340
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:27,519
i stress this all the time because i

341
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,360
mean i love i love the international

342
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,600
campus business conference

343
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,519
it is also uh

344
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,200
full of suits

345
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,039
and capitalists

346
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,040
uh we probably need a few more hippies

347
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:41,360
in the room and so i try to remind

348
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:43,360
everybody that cannabis started as a

349
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,879
social justice and an environmental

350
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,759
protection measure

351
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:47,439
uh

352
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:48,879
when the legalization movement started

353
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,040
and now that is legal we have to keep

354
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:53,039
these things in mind we can't just

355
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:55,439
be in a hurry to

356
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:56,129
to treat it like anything else or to to

357
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,680
rush to

358
00:11:56,129 --> 00:11:59,838
[Music]

359
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:01,919
make the planet worse when we're using a

360
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:05,279
plant that could save this entire plant

361
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:07,838
right not just cannabis but hemp as well

362
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:08,799
which are kind of the same thing but thc

363
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,360
levels

364
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:12,719
yeah no i agree totally on those ones i

365
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,560
think you'll start to see a lot of that

366
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,240
coming to the fore over the next five to

367
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:18,239
ten years especially as i said if europe

368
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,000
starts taking it uh you see a lot of

369
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,240
regenerative farming happening across

370
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,839
europe just because there's a it's such

371
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,440
a massive industry over here it's the

372
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,880
first question i just asked you there is

373
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,440
the best weed is from i want to know

374
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,799
where the best coffee in america is from

375
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,639
because i think coffee and cannabis is

376
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:34,159
one of the greatest combinations and

377
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,919
somebody's got to be able to capitalize

378
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:38,319
on that in the industry will your coffee

379
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:40,000
is the smart man's eight ball i've

380
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,000
always tell that to be true it's my

381
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,600
favorite drug combination

382
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,720
um

383
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,159
that's tough that's tough

384
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:52,000
i really like those little spanish

385
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:54,799
coffees the cafeto or whatever i mean

386
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,159
once again coffee i mean coffee is

387
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:57,759
you you eat coffee from all over the

388
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:00,399
world but the way you drink your coffee

389
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:02,000
is very uh very regional you know when

390
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,440
you're when you're in miami and you're

391
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,360
getting a little

392
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,959
cortado or the cafe con leche like in

393
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,879
barcelona they also drink the cortado's

394
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:11,759
or whatever but i'm in

395
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:14,078
i mean i hate to say starbucks but i

396
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:16,078
feel like seattle in general has good

397
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:18,319
coffee uh

398
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:21,838
california has good coffee but i think

399
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,839
it i think it's the

400
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,278
so far me

401
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,879
coffee is kind of well i can't say

402
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:28,480
coffee's coffee i mean i do like a good

403
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:30,320
sumatran blend

404
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,759
i'm gonna have to do more research

405
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,440
if you want a coffee in cannabis you're

406
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:34,958
going to california to spain by the

407
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,240
sounds of it

408
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:38,078
pretty much that's pretty those are

409
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,759
pretty much my two favorite spaces for

410
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:41,198
coffee in cannabis it's california and

411
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:43,679
spain and southern oregon southern

412
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:45,120
oregon also has good coffee

413
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,439
seattle has a good coffee but their weed

414
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:51,519
is not the best amsterdam which

415
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,199
pioneered the coffee and weed model uh

416
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,639
maybe i feel like they're resting on

417
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:56,399
their laurels a little bit and they're

418
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,919
kind of tired of amateurs and rookies

419
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,278
showing up and getting way too high you

420
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:01,439
know the dutch like to keep everything

421
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:02,958
super mellow and you don't want to they

422
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,040
say if you uh

423
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:06,799
if you stand to the the bush that grows

424
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:08,159
too tall gets chopped down right the

425
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:10,639
dutch people always like to keep

426
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:11,759
everything kind of smooth and so i think

427
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,039
they're they're getting a little tired

428
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:14,159
to the tourists who don't know how to

429
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:15,198
act

430
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:16,399
brilliant

431
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:17,599

432
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,039
