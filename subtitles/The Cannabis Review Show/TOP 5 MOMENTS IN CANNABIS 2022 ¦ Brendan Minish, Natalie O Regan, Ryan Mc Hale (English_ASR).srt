so the best thing to do is just get

27
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,799
started off and we're going to start off

28
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:06,599
with our first topic so we've chosen

29
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,340
five of the most influential moments we

30
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:10,500
think about Irish and international

31
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,960
cannabis and the first one we're going

32
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,640
to start off with is the Justice joint

33
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,399
Justice committee report that came out

34
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,659
in Ireland recently and I'm going to go

35
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,219
around the room and give everybody a

36
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:21,780
chance to talk but Natalie I'm going to

37
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:23,579
start with you can you give everybody a

38
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,259
quick couple of minutes brief of how you

39
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:26,579
saw this report and the influences it

40
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:30,180
may have

41
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:32,759
yep so the report and it's been going

42
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,920
ongoing for about six eight months and

43
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,560
myself Crane and many others were asked

44
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,019
to contribute to it at the time

45
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,299
um and the report was released just

46
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:43,679
before the Christmas break and when it

47
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:45,900
was released that morning I don't think

48
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,840
anybody in the drug policy field or the

49
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:50,340
reform field or any activists seen I

50
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,439
could have predicted what was coming out

51
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,840
of this report so it was a lovely

52
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:57,839
welcome surprise to see for once in

53
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:01,020
Ireland a government report that is

54
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:04,439
Progressive that is sensible that is not

55
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:06,478
just filled with prohibitionist Reefer

56
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:08,639
Madness narrative that we usually tend

57
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:10,618
to see other government documents so

58
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,419
there was 22 recommendations all

59
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:14,759
together it wasn't specifically about

60
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:16,859
cannabis and it was regarding drone

61
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:18,899
policy at home at a whole so I did

62
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,980
include some things regarding like a

63
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:25,500
safe consumption facilities and

64
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:27,959
addiction treatment and a whole a lot of

65
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,939
other things but the couple of things

66
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:31,739
that really stood out for me were the

67
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:33,719
fact that the Justice committee

68
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:36,539
recommended a lot more research into

69
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:38,580
not-for-profit Social Clubs so social

70
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:41,280
clubs are not new to the caliber scene

71
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,780
and they're operating in many countries

72
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,539
across Europe as it is and they have

73
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:48,000
worked well as a not not for profit uh

74
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:51,179
way of providing cannabis to people

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,239
so for a Justice committee to say that

76
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,219
Social Clubs need more uh research and

77
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,439
how would Social Clubs work in Ireland

78
00:02:56,219 --> 00:03:00,000
it was a very very Advanced

79
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:01,500
recommendation for Ireland because

80
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,019
sometimes I do think along with many

81
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,219
others that Ireland can be a bit

82
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:07,500
old-fashioned when it comes to drugs

83
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:09,120
policy and I think they just don't know

84
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,739
what the future holds so they may be a

85
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,080
bit nervous so it was nice to see that

86
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:14,400
they are acknowledging Social Clubs and

87
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,200
the fact that these not-for-profit

88
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,080
Community collectors can work and have

89
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:21,000
worked in other countries and as well on

90
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:24,060
top of that which was highly surprising

91
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,620
was they recommended regulation of

92
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,739
certain drugs they didn't specifically

93
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,480
name certain drugs but you know the

94
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:31,860
power deducement you can kind of guess

95
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,259
they're probably talking about cannabis

96
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:37,200
in that regard so

97
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:39,598
for again for a government report to

98
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:43,139
come out and recommend regulation and

99
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:44,639
recommend it in a way that we've been we

100
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:46,500
know for years and we have been asking

101
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:50,458
for years like it is ham reduction it is

102
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:53,098
about taking the taking drug policy and

103
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:55,140
controlling it because drug policy are

104
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:56,818
drugs at the moment in illegal Market is

105
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:59,759
uncontrolled and that is the most

106
00:03:56,818 --> 00:04:02,219
damaging aspect of them so for a report

107
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,620
to come out and to say that

108
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:06,598
criminalization hasn't worked

109
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:08,640
prohibition has not worked and that we

110
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:10,859
need to do something about it

111
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,598
is highly highly welcome and I think

112
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,519
Craig and Brendan and everybody else in

113
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:16,019
drug policy and Ireland will probably

114
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:17,759
think the exact probably have thought

115
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:21,000
the exact same thing when we were

116
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:23,579
reading the report that day so pass over

117
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,319
to Ryan I suppose

118
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:27,000
perfect thank you very much Natalie Ryan

119
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:28,800
can you give us your little overview and

120
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,720
talk a little bit about what kind of

121
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,939
came from that such as your meeting that

122
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,860
you guys had referring Fame and the

123
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:37,319
future workers are going to be doing

124
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,979
yeah so the report itself

125
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:40,019
um

126
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:42,719
it was kind of seen as great success

127
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:45,000
from everybody and I think it was

128
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,340
um because I think it covered kind of

129
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,079
all areas of drug policy and the

130
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:51,239
consultation process that the justice

131
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:53,459
department had were groups they had

132
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,680
cannabis groups they had a Frontline

133
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:57,959
groups and he had new workers against

134
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,939
prohibition under 22 recommendations

135
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:01,258
there that were extremely welcome by

136
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:03,600
other groups when we were there for the

137
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,800
launch of the report and all the

138
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,900
different advocacy groups so they're

139
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,040
they're all delighted and because there

140
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:10,019
was something there for everybody's

141
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,520
consultation is very well done but in

142
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:13,019
terms of cannabis stories about tree

143
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:15,180
recommendations that really stood out

144
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:17,219
and one of them was expanding the

145
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,840
medical cannabis Access program which is

146
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,639
is definitely needed and it's good that

147
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:23,758
that's represented there and was not

148
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,918
really sad and the Social Clubs and the

149
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,479
the allowance of of currently illicited

150
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:29,579
substances to be ground

151
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:31,560
for non-profit and then the regulatory

152
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,699
system the one of these aren't aren't

153
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,500
law yet

154
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,759
and it's not been unlocked but it will

155
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,139
be interesting to see how the department

156
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,060
responds and that might be something

157
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:40,620
we'll see you know when the um when the

158
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,660
dial comes back in a couple of weeks

159
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,579
time and in terms of The Minister's

160
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,600
response and I think when we met with

161
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:47,339
the minister this report wasn't

162
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,379
published yet so we didn't actually know

163
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:51,000
the recommendations but we are looking

164
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:53,100
to uh to engage forward and with the

165
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,538
Department of Health and they'll discuss

166
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,879
these recommendations that are actually

167
00:05:54,538 --> 00:05:58,680
out there now and so I think it's it's a

168
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:00,300
good four-step I think and it's

169
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,459
extremely Progressive it's extremely

170
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,079
void region and if these recommendations

171
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:05,519
can make it into large and I think we

172
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:07,680
will be seeing a broad future in terms

173
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:08,879
of our true policy Clover yeah going

174
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,100
forward

175
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:13,019
incredible incredible so Brandon you'd

176
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,479
be not this I think longer than most in

177
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:17,279
Ireland what was uh what was the

178
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:19,379
feelings that you got you had from the

179
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:20,939
report that was published

180
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,680
um I was completely blindsided I

181
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:23,879
expected it to be the same as we'd

182
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,319
normally see for these reports where

183
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:26,579
often the body of the document is

184
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:28,500
actually pretty strong and they've

185
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:31,379
encompassed carefully the views of all

186
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:33,720
of the respondents but then um given

187
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:35,159
them all equal weight and in this one it

188
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,440
didn't it actually came out it made

189
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,300
strong clear recommendations for which

190
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:41,038
I'm very thankful and what's more and I

191
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,720
went up to the launch of it was James

192
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:44,279
Lawless who had chaired the thing was

193
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,780
very passionate about it he put the work

194
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:47,339
into this he'd done his diligent work

195
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:48,959
and here he was representing it so I

196
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:50,459
think that was all very very encouraging

197
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,978
this isn't a report that's just going to

198
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:55,439
sit on a shelf and from our perspective

199
00:06:52,978 --> 00:06:57,060
those of us who wish to see change it

200
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:59,100
now takes us to a place where you know

201
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:01,620
2023 is in part going to be about

202
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:03,060
writing to our TDS to ask them what are

203
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,680
they doing to implement the

204
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,600
recommendations of the report and that's

205
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,459
a huge shift in terms of where we are in

206
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,080
lobbying

207
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:12,120
um I think the social club elements

208
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,918
really important and I think another

209
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,079
interesting thing that kind of happened

210
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:19,859
on the day actually that there was some

211
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:21,538
political except acceptance that you

212
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:24,000
can't make black markets go away

213
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:26,159
magically and you have to look at you

214
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,478
know reducing the harms and uh you know

215
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,380
that seems to have been encompassed in

216
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:30,060
this

217
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:31,620
um don't let the perfect be the enemy of

218
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,019
the good

219
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,639
and I suppose

220
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:37,859
um yeah I mean really that's the gist of

221
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:39,780
it the main thing I think about this

222
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:42,479
report as well is that it's looked at

223
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:44,638
the wider harms of drugs and it wasn't

224
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:46,560
open to us to look at just cannabis on

225
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,060
its own nor should we I think if we

226
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,500
address the social harms across the

227
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:51,899
Spectrum here we'll end up with much

228
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,939
more sensible policy across a right a

229
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:56,818
wide range of substances

230
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:58,740
yeah very well said very well said so

231
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:01,680
Point number one was the joint Justice

232
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:03,180
committee Report top story number two

233
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,280
definitely for if you were living in

234
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,740
Ireland was Geno Kenny's bill that he

235
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:09,418
brought to the doyle so Ryan I know you

236
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,918
guys you were doing a lot of work with

237
00:08:09,418 --> 00:08:12,478
this and then Natalie I'm going to give

238
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:14,519
you an opportunity to speak out but Ryan

239
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:17,038
can you maybe tell us the importance of

240
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:18,659
Gino's Bill the chances of the passing

241
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:21,180
and any little pertinent information

242
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:24,060
that you'd have for the audience

243
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:25,139
yeah um so genius bill is kind of a long

244
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,639
time common

245
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:27,840
um I'm sure we're in the canvas space

246
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,759
you've been waiting for for I think

247
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:31,619
about two years and finally came in

248
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,180
quite a simple build that would

249
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,099
decriminal lawyers cannabis possession

250
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:37,259
of up to seven grams of variable

251
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:39,240
cannabis that was quite moderate it's

252
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:41,338
not I don't think it's it's the it's the

253
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,778
system that many of us want in the long

254
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:45,480
term and I think Jane I was aware of

255
00:08:42,778 --> 00:08:47,458
that he he realizes that and this isn't

256
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,980
the end I'll be out I think in terms of

257
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:52,379
passing I'm not sure I'm not sure if

258
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,240
we'll pass and it's going to open the

259
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:56,220
air at the moment I think with the way

260
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,500
things are gone with with this Joseph's

261
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,940
report and kind of the citizens assembly

262
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,039
they might be looking for a more robust

263
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,420
system than just decriminalization so

264
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:06,000
they might actually take it another way

265
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:07,740
and but it is important

266
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,940
um in the sense that it's part of this

267
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,778
conversation that's starting to build

268
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:14,820
and Gino's Bill was introduced and

269
00:09:12,778 --> 00:09:16,500
a little while back the week after labor

270
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,899
party introduced the motion on

271
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,580
decriminalization and this report came

272
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:22,559
out then a couple of weeks after so it's

273
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,720
all kind of building into the into the

274
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:27,299
um the national discussion I don't think

275
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,220
one report or one bill or one event is

276
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:31,079
going to change things I think it's it's

277
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,980
a it's a collective process of all these

278
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,360
different

279
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,159
um these different things happening at

280
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,839
the same time so I think it's positive

281
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:38,458
and what's going to come of it I don't

282
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:41,279
know if it's going to pass it might be

283
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:43,139
amended heavily and include more kind of

284
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:44,820
uh safeguards for regulation and things

285
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:46,620
like that but um it's definitely a

286
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,600
powerful step forward and it increases

287
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,519
the discussion on the kind of the

288
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,740
quality of the discussion in the country

289
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:54,360
yeah for sure it's part of the snowball

290
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,560
that seems to be gaining momentum

291
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,759
Natalie you were working on this

292
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:57,899
equipment if you've got a little brief

293
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:01,019
little overview of any inside

294
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:03,480
information for us yeah so Gino's been

295
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:05,278
working on to try and get something on

296
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,480
the floor of the doyle for over two

297
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:08,278
years I think

298
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,839
um and In fairness for me put a lot of

299
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:11,939
work in he got a lot of doors closed in

300
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,560
his face he got a a lot of feedback back

301
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,240
there he had to change plans about a

302
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:16,739
million times but he eventually got

303
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,299
their true determination and

304
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,879
stubbornness and putting the work in

305
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:23,519
there and what's the chances of it

306
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:24,899
passing is anybody's guess it is a

307
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,200
private member's bill so it is an

308
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:30,600
opposition bill so it would require the

309
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:33,899
current government to side on with the

310
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:36,060
opposition on this point which Tech

311
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:37,860
usually doesn't happen but Sherlock

312
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:39,958
Never Say Never

313
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:42,419
um but even if it doesn't pass

314
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:44,578
that's not the end of it like this the

315
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:46,078
the bill is on the doyle floor it is

316
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:48,059
going to have to be debated on the

317
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:51,719
dollar store for that to be debated

318
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:53,939
we'll also get to hear politicians and

319
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,920
elected TDS what their view is on this

320
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,779
topic they will have to stand up they

321
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:00,958
will have to vote Yes or No Yes or No

322
00:10:57,778 --> 00:11:03,000
against this at one point so if nothing

323
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:04,919
comes out of it if nothing else comes

324
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,019
out of it we will

325
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:08,699
Force the conversation on the issue we

326
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:11,459
will get people's opinions and we'll get

327
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:13,800
our politicians opinions and I think as

328
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:17,039
well as Ryan said Geno's

329
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:18,479
decriminalization Bill uh labor put in a

330
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:20,819
motion the following week for a

331
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,620
decriminalization of all drugs and then

332
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:25,379
the citizens assembly is coming off this

333
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:27,120
Justice Port committee report

334
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:28,679
it's not an issue that can be run away

335
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,000
from anymore it can't it's not an issue

336
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:32,699
that can be just put on the back burner

337
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,379
and hope for and hope and pray that the

338
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,360
politicians will not have to tackle it

339
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:38,100
within their sitting term that they can

340
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:41,339
pass the book to the next

341
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,899
so I think it brings the conversation to

342
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:45,000
the floor and it forces people to have a

343
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:46,799
conversation about it if nothing else so

344
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,100
I do think it's an overall good thing if

345
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:52,199
it passes all the better if not we we

346
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,659
still have a million more avenues that

347
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,100
we can go through yeah as we said it's

348
00:11:54,659 --> 00:11:58,500
all part of this snowball that's getting

349
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,339
your momentum so moving outside of

350
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,078
Ireland

351
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:02,640
our first two topics the first two

352
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:04,620
stories were a joint Justice committee

353
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,659
report Gino Kenny's bill that was

354
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:08,399
proposed there and so we all agreed when

355
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:10,259
it came to the European story that there

356
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,299
was only kind of one or two territories

357
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:14,519
that you choose from one was Germany and

358
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:15,719
and the Czech Republic so I think we're

359
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:18,179
going to lead into the Czech Republic

360
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,980
first how quickly do you think Prague

361
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:21,479
are going to be able to get this

362
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,440
industry open road and do you think

363
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,120
they're going to be able to get it done

364
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,620
quicker than Germany start with you

365
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,360
Brandon

366
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,679
yeah I think the Czechs have been

367
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,639
waiting for to do this for a long time

368
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:30,899
and I think they'll hit the ground

369
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:33,419
running

370
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:34,799
um I think they are more flexible in

371
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:37,319
terms of how they deal with and think

372
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:38,338
about bureaucracy and um yeah I'd say

373
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,660
they'll be able to speed for a while

374
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:42,000
because the Czech Republic's been

375
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:43,559
wanting this for quite a while

376
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,139
um and I think it's going to feed also

377
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:47,759
into into the wider thing both at the

378
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:49,019
European level at the national level a

379
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:50,458
lot of politicians have a lot of

380
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:52,620
catching up to do now with where a

381
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:54,359
popular opinion is both in terms of

382
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,339
whether drug policy in the round is

383
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,620
working and what people want to see out

384
00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:00,000
of you know legal regulated markets

385
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,379
yeah couldn't agree with you more

386
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,458
Natalie what are you thinking is going

387
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:03,778
to happen with Prague do you think

388
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:06,778
you're going to get there before Germany

389
00:13:03,778 --> 00:13:08,820
I tend to agree with Brendan I think you

390
00:13:06,778 --> 00:13:12,059
will be all very surprised and Germany

391
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:13,680
may be the last ones to regulate but I

392
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:15,599
do think that they will get there before

393
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:18,539
Germany I mean their National Drug

394
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,940
coordinator is well clued in he he's up

395
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:23,159
to speed he knows what he's talking

396
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:25,500
about from the outside from my opinion

397
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:27,838
like he knows prohibition hasn't worked

398
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,820
he knows control of cannabis is the

399
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,980
future and is the better approach to it

400
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:35,220
like thereafter getting together a group

401
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:37,980
of representatives from all areas of

402
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:39,778
society from police Customs drug experts

403
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:42,000
the members of

404
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:43,740
um their Parliament so they are getting

405
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,879
all views they're not just listening to

406
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,200
one side they're getting the whole

407
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:48,838
package they're getting the whole views

408
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:51,000
and I do hope after this consolidation I

409
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:53,820
think they said around March I think

410
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,620
that they're they're a plan for a

411
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,060
regulated market would be finalized so

412
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:59,820
it'll be interesting to see what comes

413
00:13:57,059 --> 00:14:01,439
out of this but I am hopeful well I do

414
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,540
think that they they have a good grasp

415
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,220
of what needs to be done and I think

416
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:07,139
they will power ahead with it

417
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:09,060
yeah it could be very interesting to see

418
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:11,579
Ryan do you see them being the European

419
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:13,439
leader to get going first or do you see

420
00:14:11,578 --> 00:14:15,659
uh any hurdles that may potentially

421
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,399
happen for them I think it'd be very

422
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:19,379
interesting to watch and I think Arlo

423
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:22,078
Israel March from this for this

424
00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:24,480
consultation process to kind of be um to

425
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:26,638
be revealed what's going on there

426
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,778
um I think in terms of roadblocks and

427
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,159
stuff like that I've seen there in the

428
00:14:27,778 --> 00:14:30,179
nails recently Germany are kind of

429
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,740
getting a little bit caught up with

430
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:33,719
themselves with international law and

431
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:35,278
things like that and that seems to be a

432
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,959
kind of recording issue in in kind of

433
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:39,000
global through a policy reform that we

434
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:40,799
always find ourselves getting kind of

435
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,839
our hands toyed with international law

436
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:44,219
and I think the approach that the

437
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,600
Canadians and the Americans talk is

438
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:48,120
probably the best approach for us

439
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,339
Europeans to take and just to ignore and

440
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,019
move on from it it's kind of it's

441
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:54,240
notoriously difficult to try and change

442
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:56,159
those International agreements on drugs

443
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,079
or any International agreement just just

444
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:00,899
with the geopolitical nature of things

445
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:02,759
like that so we'll be one to watch and I

446
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:04,620
think we're definitely going to see more

447
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:06,419
of this stuff we're kind of EU or un law

448
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,220
coming up in was but I don't think it's

449
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:10,319
going to stop it fundamentally I think

450
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:12,060
it's just going to be a little

451
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,260
roadblocks along the way but it will be

452
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:15,119
good to watch the more countries that

453
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:17,338
they were the the clouds over here you

454
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,198
know yeah very true I think it's a

455
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:20,880
perfect scenario of it's better to ask

456
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:22,979
for forgiveness than ask for permission

457
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:25,019
when it comes to creating your own

458
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:27,060
policy of your own country when it comes

459
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:29,698
to the Cannabis industry as we've seen

460
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:31,979
with Canada and America right we're

461
00:15:29,698 --> 00:15:33,778
going to move on to topic four so Story

462
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,879
number three was Germany's Advance with

463
00:15:33,778 --> 00:15:37,019
the Czech Republic is advancements the

464
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:40,198
next one we're going to go on an

465
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:42,419
international look and Thailand has been

466
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:44,759
a very interesting story over the last

467
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:46,379
year and could be potentially over the

468
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:48,838
next couple of years with potential for

469
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:50,159
cannabis tourism that far outweighs a

470
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:52,680
lot of other territories around the

471
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:54,299
world Brendan can you talk to us about

472
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:57,059
Thailand and what's been going on over

473
00:15:54,299 --> 00:15:58,679
the past 12 months well not entirely up

474
00:15:57,059 --> 00:16:00,059
to speed fully with Thailand but it

475
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:01,799
seems like they sort of they've created

476
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:03,659
a bit of a vacuum in a way by repealing

477
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:04,679
some laws and leaving it there but I

478
00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:05,939
think some of the pressure International

479
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:07,739
pressure is going to come from where

480
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,120
their tourist Falls from

481
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,799
um I don't see the Australians as being

482
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,839
too but but when the Chinese start

483
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:14,458
returning to Thailand in numbers there

484
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:17,519
might be some pushback there around

485
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:18,899
around drugs policy I I don't know I

486
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,879
suppose really what I'm interested to

487
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:22,320
see is how do markets develop when there

488
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,759
are relatively few rules and what

489
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,680
happens when you try and regulate a

490
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,059
market once it's started I think other

491
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:28,319
markets that are interested that have

492
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:29,638
come like interesting that have come

493
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,800
online recently is countries like

494
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:33,480
Argentina for example we don't hear much

495
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:35,759
about it but Argentina has gone both

496
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,039
recreationally and medically legal and

497
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,838
it's dismantling its Black Market I'm

498
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:41,399
not too clear on how it's dealt with its

499
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,740
International obligations around that

500
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:44,639
but um you know the some countries are

501
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,560
just ignoring the international

502
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,360
obligation at this stage

503
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:51,000
um I think for the US it probably hasn't

504
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,139
come up yet because legalization hasn't

505
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,600
really happened at the federal level

506
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:56,600
it's been more a case of state by state

507
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,320
yeah very very true there's been a lot

508
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,639
of interesting advances Mexico is up

509
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,798
there another one with Argentine

510
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,419
Argentina I think that where they seem

511
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:08,220
to be there well Mexico seems a bit

512
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:09,079
stuck at the moment actually

513
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,519
yeah

514
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:13,918
very high Court decisions that they have

515
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:15,720
to legislate but they haven't legislated

516
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,540
yeah yeah I think they're the closest

517
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,640
and the most influenced by America and I

518
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:22,259
think the the politics is having a lot

519
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,400
to play there whereas I think countries

520
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:25,318
that seem to be a little bit more

521
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,900
distanced away in South America seem to

522
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:29,759
be pushed down or pushing on without a

523
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,980
undue influence

524
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:33,960
yeah so sometimes it's easier to just

525
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:36,120
remove loss than it is to design new

526
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,759
ones but it doesn't necessarily mean the

527
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:40,500
outcomes are substantially better

528
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:42,900
yeah no I couldn't agree with you more

529
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,579
but if we had the greatest and smartest

530
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,960
people as politicians running countries

531
00:17:44,579 --> 00:17:47,460
all over the world would have been their

532
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,038
own age for this conversation to be

533
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:52,500
taken place at this moment in time but

534
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:54,240
we've got to do our best as our citizens

535
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,038
to ensure that we're getting given and

536
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,500
delivered the best potential Solutions

537
00:17:56,038 --> 00:18:01,259
and and products for uh people in each

538
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:03,679
individual countries so we've got four

539
00:18:01,259 --> 00:18:06,058
we've got four uh topics that we've

540
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:08,640
touched after joint Justice committee

541
00:18:06,058 --> 00:18:10,019
report Gino's Bill Germany and checks

542
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,299
advancement and then International

543
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:15,298
communities like Thailand Argentina

544
00:18:12,298 --> 00:18:17,759
Mexico so I wanted to pick the last one

545
00:18:15,298 --> 00:18:19,019
and I thought it was I've gone through a

546
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:21,179
ton of different things like you could

547
00:18:19,019 --> 00:18:23,460
talk about juicy Fields Spain launching

548
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:26,580
their medical program the the check

549
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,900
announcement the acquisition PDD and

550
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:30,058
Columbia care but I think the big one

551
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:32,038
from America was Biden signing the

552
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:33,119
medical marijuana research bill and I

553
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:35,640
think it's going to have huge

554
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:37,918
implications in terms of dementia Moody

555
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,419
that gets pumped in for r d and the

556
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,080
amount of potential that I'd say the

557
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:44,700
rarer cannabinoids that now get

558
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:46,558
available for marketing for products so

559
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,058
what do you guys think of deployed

560
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:49,379
inside of the medical marijuana research

561
00:18:48,058 --> 00:18:52,139
bill as one of the most important

562
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:54,840
stories Ryan I'll start with you

563
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:56,940
I think boyden's been doing a lot now on

564
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:58,259
this on this cannabis front uh This

565
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,000
research bill is going to open the door

566
00:18:58,259 --> 00:19:03,000
now for America to be ahead of the game

567
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,599
in terms of cannabis research and what's

568
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,460
being what's going to be done there and

569
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:09,779
I know the safe the safe Banking Act

570
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,860
didn't go through which is something

571
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:12,720
that American people have been quite

572
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:14,219
upset about in the industry and in the

573
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,620
in the Cannabis space

574
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,819
but um in terms of research and things

575
00:19:16,619 --> 00:19:19,019
like that I think America are going to

576
00:19:17,819 --> 00:19:21,000
be ahead of the game they're going to be

577
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:22,259
the first ones to do it and they're

578
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,759
really invested in the medical Market

579
00:19:22,259 --> 00:19:25,798
it's where it all kind of began for the

580
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:27,240
Americans anyways so they're building on

581
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:29,879
that there I would like to see more

582
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,558
stuff done on the expungement of ProAir

583
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,059
criminal records with with cannabis

584
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:34,980
right now it's not it's not being done

585
00:19:33,058 --> 00:19:37,798
federally I know it's kind of been done

586
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,480
a little bit uh step by stay but I'd

587
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:40,619
love to see more doing on that kind of

588
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,360
going back to toilet and by now when

589
00:19:40,619 --> 00:19:44,099
they decriminalized I think they

590
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:46,079
released four thousand prisoners in one

591
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:47,459
day so it'd be great to see more kind of

592
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:49,079
initiative taken on that globally

593
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:52,019
especially in the United States kind of

594
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:53,759
the notorious uh War on Drugs going on

595
00:19:52,019 --> 00:19:57,000
over there but it seems to be coming to

596
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:59,099
an end thankfully yeah it's very true

597
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,259
have you actually friend what do you

598
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:03,719
think of the last topic Brighton signed

599
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:05,759
in the bill I think it's all progress I

600
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,038
think until the safe banking acts passed

601
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:10,019
the impact of U.S federal law on

602
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:11,819
cannabis is global because it screws up

603
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:13,019
with everybody's ability to use Banks

604
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:15,240
worldwide I mean it's been a huge

605
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:17,160
problem for Uruguayan is is a is a

606
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,558
problem still for legal cannabis

607
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,759
companies all over the world

608
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:22,740
um and I think there's a bit of a land

609
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:24,179
grab on at the moment from the farmer

610
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,620
side to see what's patentable what's

611
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:28,080
what are paint nipple products that can

612
00:20:25,619 --> 00:20:30,000
be developed out of this I think um the

613
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:31,439
piece that the US is doing really badly

614
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,419
on and we need to keep an eye on is

615
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,820
drugs policy overall in terms of overall

616
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:37,740
death rates they're way way worse than

617
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:40,500
even us in Ireland is joint worst in

618
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:41,940
Europe now so you know what's happened

619
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,200
in the US is something that I'd be

620
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,940
afraid of happening here where they've

621
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,500
separated cannabis policy out completely

622
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,298
from the rest of drugs policy and

623
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,980
allowed the rest of drugs policy which

624
00:20:48,298 --> 00:20:52,619
is the less popular bits of it sometimes

625
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:55,200
just sort of drown on the floor it's

626
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:57,599
shocking so you know this is why I think

627
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,460
reform needs to stay locked step it's

628
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:03,178
not about individual substances it's

629
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:04,500
about the the overall overarching the

630
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:06,600
umbrella of things that come under

631
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,519
substance control actually

632
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:10,019
and you know we're talking about legal

633
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:11,339
cannabis markets here but I think in

634
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:13,259
time we'll be talking about legal

635
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:15,119
markets for other products too although

636
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:17,339
perhaps much more regulated than any of

637
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:19,439
us would like to see for cannabis

638
00:21:17,339 --> 00:21:20,579
yeah very well said Natalie I'll give

639
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,620
you the final word what do you think of

640
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:23,759
Joe Biden's recent work in the kind of a

641
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:26,219
sector

642
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:27,359
well I'm glad to see their r d bill and

643
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,159
the research and development the

644
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:31,319
scientific the scientific research being

645
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:33,240
able to go into cannabis

646
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:35,759
like one roadblock we always face when

647
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:37,440
you are arguing for a reform of our

648
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:40,019
cannabis laws in Ireland even or across

649
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,820
Europe is and I'm sure Ryan has heard it

650
00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:43,619
himself from Brendan is oh we need more

651
00:21:41,819 --> 00:21:45,418
research we need more research we need

652
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:47,339
more research if I hear that I hear it

653
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:50,280
in my sleep at this stage

654
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:51,658
and with this bill we will have more

655
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:53,038
research like we

656
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:54,299
I don't know the exact number anymore

657
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:56,038
because I think there's one new one

658
00:21:54,298 --> 00:21:58,319
being found every week but we don't know

659
00:21:56,038 --> 00:22:01,079
half of the cannabinoids that are in the

660
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:03,359
cannabis plant we do not know

661
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:05,460
the full extent of how beneficial this

662
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:07,740
plant can be from for as a valid

663
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:09,419
medicine for people so there are people

664
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,919
out there for years who will say oh I

665
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:12,538
get relief of this and I get relief of

666
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:15,000
that but there is no scientific research

667
00:22:12,538 --> 00:22:16,798
into it so that is a block for expansion

668
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,259
of the mcap expansion of other medical

669
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:20,639
aspects of cannabis so for the research

670
00:22:19,259 --> 00:22:23,460
and development to be able to go into

671
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,980
cannabis as a valid medicine it's a good

672
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:27,419
thing regardless of whether what side of

673
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,798
the what side of the fence you're on

674
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:31,140
regarding pharmaceutical companies

675
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:32,759
interests and in it either way it is

676
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:34,580
going to be a good thing I think and you

677
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:37,140
know it is going to feed into

678
00:22:34,579 --> 00:22:38,879
worldwide cannabis reform and especially

679
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,559
for medicinal cannabis and its medicinal

680
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,720
properties for people

681
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:44,099
yeah evidence-based medicine I think is

682
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,659
what every politician wants to be able

683
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:47,579
to hang their hat on and they can't do

684
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:49,980
that unless you've got r d budgets and

685
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:52,379
allocation of resources to be able to go

686
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:54,900
and look at the potential of the

687
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:56,460
hundreds of Canada's uh terpenes and

688
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:58,860
flavonoids that can all be Blended

689
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:01,558
together for potential whatever it may

690
00:22:58,859 --> 00:23:03,839
be the r d needs to start in the labs

691
00:23:01,558 --> 00:23:05,279
with that but it's been a it's been

692
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:07,199
great running through the year guys does

693
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:09,119
anybody else else have any other topics

694
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,179
outside the top five that we touched on

695
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:14,699
that uh you think is worth a mention

696
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:16,320
I think this year I mean not just in

697
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,058
Ireland but everywhere really this year

698
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:20,038
is the year when we all need to tell our

699
00:23:18,058 --> 00:23:22,678
politicians what we expect them to do

700
00:23:20,038 --> 00:23:24,298
they might not agree with us we that

701
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:25,559
sometimes they won't reply but we

702
00:23:24,298 --> 00:23:27,000
absolutely need to remind them that

703
00:23:25,558 --> 00:23:28,740
we're here we're voting and we care

704
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,259
about these issues

705
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,940
yeah and to that aim you know Crown we

706
00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:34,740
hope to have some templates out for

707
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:37,380
people to do to to follow in the New

708
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:39,900
Year and I hope other organizations will

709
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:42,600
be doing the same because there are a

710
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:44,159
lot of nuanced positions in this reform

711
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:46,319
fight but we're all looking at the kind

712
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:49,140
of the same broad brush Strokes end

713
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:50,700
goals which are you know safer societies

714
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:53,580
and happier people

715
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:56,340
yeah agreed The Economist industry is so

716
00:23:53,579 --> 00:23:58,019
complex and nuanced that uh it takes

717
00:23:56,339 --> 00:24:00,599
years and years of research to be able

718
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:02,220
to get yourself remotely up to speed and

719
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:03,658
yeah well I think that's a very relevant

720
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,279
thing I was reading somewhere recently

721
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:07,200
that when alcohol prohibition ended in

722
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:09,418
the state so it took about 10 years for

723
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,798
even 50 of the supply to move back from

724
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:12,840
the black market to the legal Market

725
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:15,179
we're in a period of transition we can't

726
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:17,339
expect everything to be perfect and Rosy

727
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:19,620
along the way we're going to learn a lot

728
00:24:17,339 --> 00:24:21,418
some fun will be had lots of fun will be

729
00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:22,859
hard money will be made some harms will

730
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:25,620
be done too and we need to be open to

731
00:24:22,859 --> 00:24:27,538
that we need to work out how to remain

732
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:29,099
you know human and compassionate and

733
00:24:27,538 --> 00:24:30,960
honest and fair in this industry going

734
00:24:29,099 --> 00:24:32,639
forward but you know it's all positive I

735
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,038
think you know 2023 and Beyond are going

736
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,299
to be good years in game cannabis yeah I

737
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:37,679
couldn't agree with you more and what's

738
00:24:36,298 --> 00:24:40,200
great is we're starting to see a real

739
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,940
ecosystem in Ireland take place and

740
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,200
everybody's sharing and helping each

741
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:45,120
other in a long way that continue

742
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,500
because I think we're a more powerful

743
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:47,819
force when we're all combining our

744
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:50,419
resources that everybody working

745
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,418
individually

746
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:55,199
yep definitely

747
00:24:53,339 --> 00:24:57,240
right we'll call it an end on that it's
