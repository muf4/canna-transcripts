00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:04,979
foreign

2
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:15,718
by Andre Silva who's a field marketing

3
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,579
specialist in Europe working for Merck

4
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:19,198
how are you keeping today Andre

5
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:20,579
hello I'm doing very well thanks

6
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,260
yourself

7
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:23,639
I'm fantastic thank you very much for

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,199
taking the time to do this it's very

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,580
much appreciated if you maybe want to

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,859
give everybody a quick little overview

11
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:31,098
of your position in the sector and what

12
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:33,719
uh care and specialized in

13
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:36,058
absolutely and first of all thank you

14
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,700
for having me on the podcast it's a huge

15
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:39,899
pleasure to feature an episode on

16
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,940
quoting control from a laboratory

17
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,219
product provider perspective

18
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:48,119
I must say that my journey in this

19
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:50,039
industry has started back in 2019 as I

20
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:51,679
started working for Merck as a technical

21
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,539
sales specialist

22
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:56,399
role in which I initiated collaboration

23
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:59,280
with key customers in the European

24
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,198
market on the Cannabis topic so I'm

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,299
referring to pharmaceutical companies

26
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:05,819
starting production and implementing

27
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:07,920
their own quality control Labs but also

28
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:10,399
General testing Labs looking to initiate

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,618
analysis on the different cannabinoids

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,600
components and contaminants uh at the

31
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:17,938
beginning of last year I've also had the

32
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,739
honor to join the editorial Advisory

33
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:22,500
board for cannabis Science and

34
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:24,679
Technology magazine in the US in which

35
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,079
I've worked to support with scientific

36
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:30,240
articles and content review

37
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:33,359
and I'm currently performing the role of

38
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:38,359
field marketing Specialists for Western

39
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:38,359
Europe covering the the Cannabis Market

40
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,618
okay very interesting so a pretty big

41
00:01:41,938 --> 00:01:45,179
sector that you guys are covering can

42
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:46,859
you tell me what are the main compounds

43
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:50,340
that are being tested by quality control

44
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:53,640
Labs such as yourselves at the moment

45
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:55,978
sure so we don't do the analysis

46
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,560
ourselves we provide products for

47
00:01:55,978 --> 00:02:01,379
Laboratories to perform the analysis and

48
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,840
the tests and and this is a quite broad

49
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:05,879
topic so I'll try to summarize it the

50
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,759
best to my ability and and briefly

51
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:11,340
explain the reasoning behind it so when

52
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:13,559
we think about final products out in the

53
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:16,739
market and and this can be reflected in

54
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,319
pharmaceutical nutraceutical Cosmetics

55
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:22,080
food and beverage items

56
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:23,579
we as consumers expect a rigorous

57
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,400
quality control examination to take

58
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:29,520
place to ensure the safety reliability

59
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,900
but also the quality of the products

60
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,840
that reach us

61
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,939
so in cannabis as a strict regulatory

62
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,459
framework takes place this is of course

63
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:41,039
of extremely high importance

64
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:43,140
so now looking at Cannabis Testing

65
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:45,299
there are two key designations commonly

66
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:47,939
used by the industry depending on the

67
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:50,819
focus of the testing so on one hand we

68
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:53,340
have potency testing which looks at the

69
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:56,339
cannabinoid and terpene profile of the

70
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:58,400
plants essentially the constituents that

71
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,900
attracted attention due to their

72
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,760
therapeutical properties

73
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,980
and on the other hand we have purity

74
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:07,259
testing which looks at the presence of

75
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:09,419
external contaminants that could have

76
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:12,120
been introduced through the cultivation

77
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:16,619
and Manufacturing processes

78
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:19,379
so starting with potency testing

79
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,939
cannabinoids is for sure the loudest

80
00:03:19,378 --> 00:03:23,759
sibling and everyone at this point has

81
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:27,259
heard about CBD and THC so from one

82
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:29,759
angle we have a group of psychoactive

83
00:03:27,259 --> 00:03:33,359
cannabinoids that are heavily regulated

84
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:35,519
with most often clear maximum levels to

85
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,700
be respected therefore extremely

86
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,680
important to test Euro materials and

87
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:42,899
final products should not contain these

88
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,200
compounds above the established levels

89
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,539
so for instance a THC is by far the most

90
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:51,719
known here and the European commission

91
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:54,298
has set a limit of 0.3 percent in

92
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:57,180
industrial hemp crops so this has to

93
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:59,219
mandatorily be respected and and testing

94
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:02,099
is the only way to prove it

95
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:03,900
so DHC is however not alone in this

96
00:04:02,098 --> 00:04:05,699
group so as his research progresses

97
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,039
newer cannabinoids are continuously

98
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:11,039
found some of which have even stronger

99
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:14,938
psychoactive responses than THC such as

100
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:18,358
thcp so in the in-depth studies will

101
00:04:14,938 --> 00:04:20,819
then assess the potential the potency

102
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:23,758
the potential of these compounds

103
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:26,639
which will eventually dictate whether or

104
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,560
not maximum levels should be enforced by

105
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:32,340
the Regulatory Agencies

106
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,839
so it's it's currently a a very Dynamic

107
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:37,019
field of research as you can imagine

108
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:39,959
that requires close observation to

109
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:42,060
ensure for full Regulatory Compliance

110
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:44,698
so from a slightly different angle we

111
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:46,680
have the known psychoactive cannabinoids

112
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:48,780
in in some cases they've been accepted

113
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,720
by the European commission to be legally

114
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:54,899
used as ingredients in food products and

115
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:58,620
cosmetics and and in this area people

116
00:04:54,899 --> 00:05:00,719
have heard about CBD and CBG I'm sure so

117
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,899
nowadays it is not surprising to come

118
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,699
across extracts concentrates and and

119
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:07,918
other products containing cannabinoids

120
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:10,040
and dispensaries and and some other

121
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:12,599
marketplaces so these large

122
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:15,180
non-psychoactive group also requires

123
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,680
testing for the identification and

124
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,000
quantification of the different

125
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,639
compounds

126
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,759
which should be performed by a certified

127
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,879
Lab in order to Showcase overall

128
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:31,740
Integrity good manufacturing practices

129
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:34,319
but also a strict quality assurance

130
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,840
we then have the terpenes which are a

131
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:39,478
class of compounds responsible for the

132
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:42,359
fragrance and Aroma of a wide variety of

133
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:46,019
plants and in this case cannabis strains

134
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:48,360
have terpene profiles that give them a

135
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:49,978
unique characteristic Aroma but the

136
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,319
individual terpenes themselves are found

137
00:05:49,978 --> 00:05:55,319
in many other common plants say for

138
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:59,939
instance limonene which is found in in

139
00:05:55,319 --> 00:06:02,699
citrous fruits or pining and as the name

140
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:04,740
indicates can be found in in pine trees

141
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:07,740
so some of these have also been affirmed

142
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:10,680
to promote certain therapeutic effects

143
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:12,960
both acting in isolation but also as

144
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:16,259
part of the commonly known Entourage

145
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:18,659
effect a synergistic action that is

146
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:20,759
modulated by various terpenes and

147
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:23,400
cannabinoids compounds

148
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:25,860
so hence we have companies here in this

149
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:28,138
spectrum looking at cannabis extracts

150
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:30,600
with a cocktail of cannabinoids

151
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:31,918
interpenes as opposed to isolate

152
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,020
specifically

153
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:36,599
so these mixture means another Target

154
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:38,879
group that requires testing

155
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,879
so we've now covered the two main groups

156
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:44,879
of interest for cannabis potency and

157
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:49,019
considering their varied chemical

158
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:51,779
structure and internal properties

159
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:54,719
we can already tell that they will

160
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:57,538
require different preparation techniques

161
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,539
analytical methods and tools in order

162
00:06:57,538 --> 00:07:03,538
for the testing to be performed with

163
00:07:00,538 --> 00:07:07,620
accuracy and precision

164
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:09,599
so when we dive into purity testing now

165
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,819
a whole new range of external

166
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,740
contaminants comes into place

167
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:16,680
so let's have a view of the let's have

168
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:20,098
an overview of the entire process so

169
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:22,740
during the cultivation phase pesticides

170
00:07:20,098 --> 00:07:25,680
are commonly used to protect the crops

171
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:27,360
so the list here are extensive and in

172
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,759
the US for instance this framework

173
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,699
changes from state to state a few states

174
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,919
have guidelines in place in Europe there

175
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:37,259
still seems to be some uncertainty and

176
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:39,719
unclarity around this topic so in in the

177
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:41,340
end it matters to test not just the

178
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,259
pesticides that have been used during

179
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:46,500
the cultivation process

180
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:48,900
but also the ones that have been one

181
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,120
banned by the regulatory agencies in

182
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:54,239
place but that

183
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,340
could also have been somehow introduced

184
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,900
in the chain

185
00:07:56,339 --> 00:08:00,598
on top of that

186
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:03,799
plans and in this case cannabis plants

187
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:06,839
have the capacity to extract and

188
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:09,060
bioaccumulate heavy metals from soil

189
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:11,939
so we're jumping yet into another

190
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:15,060
complex regulatory landscape here here

191
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:16,139
we have some highly regulated Metals

192
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:21,060
such as

193
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:23,220
cadmium lead arsenic Mercury

194
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,800
but there's an even longer list that

195
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:27,780
requires monitoring and that if it's

196
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,840
otherwise overlooked can possess serious

197
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:32,519
health risks to the consumers

198
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:34,679
now

199
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:37,199
so we sort of covered the interferences

200
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:40,019
that come from the cultivation phase so

201
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,240
the the most significant ones but

202
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:45,838
thinking about the manufacturing process

203
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:49,560
and how it affects the final product

204
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:52,019
and this is again method dependent if

205
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:54,299
it's extraction is performed with the

206
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:55,379
aid of solvents such as butane and

207
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:58,319
methanol

208
00:08:55,379 --> 00:09:01,320
residual solvent testing is required to

209
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,420
guarantee that no dangerous levels of

210
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,339
these compounds are left in the end

211
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:07,439
product

212
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:10,680
additionally

213
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:14,700
um and depending on the The Matrix

214
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:15,739
that's being worked on produced we can

215
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,920
talk about

216
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:22,379
isolates and concentrates

217
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:24,539
extracts leaves flowers seeds on or any

218
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:26,939
other final product all present

219
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:30,360
different challenges and and the testing

220
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:33,899
methods need to be adapted so excessive

221
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,180
moisture in in cannabis plant parts for

222
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:38,039
instance

223
00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:41,759
can lead to mold growth and degradation

224
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:44,480
which can then allow fungi micro fungi

225
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:48,958
to produce toxic component compounds

226
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:52,379
namely microtoxins and therefore this

227
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:55,679
adds additional need to perform testing

228
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:58,559
around microbial activity the presence

229
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:01,679
of mycotoxins and quantification

230
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:04,500
and and even moisture levels so I know

231
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:06,958
that was a lot of information in one go

232
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,820
and there are certainly areas in which I

233
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:11,159
haven't touched but these are admittedly

234
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:13,440
crucial analysis to be performed on raw

235
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:17,399
materials and final products involving

236
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:20,100
cannabis so the the Cannabis Testing

237
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:24,360
Market involves an ample range of

238
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:26,700
techniques and Equipment tools to ensure

239
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,259
the safety potency and quality of the

240
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:31,140
products and this is where product

241
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:34,319
providers come into place so accurate

242
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:37,159
testing is of course crucial essential

243
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,860
here to meet regulatory requirements

244
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:42,740
protect consumer health but also support

245
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:46,680
the development of responsive

246
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:48,899
responsible and regulated cannabis

247
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:51,659
industry

248
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:53,039
very good when it comes to the testing

249
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:54,838
of these products and the specific

250
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:56,699
molecules that are these ingredients

251
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:59,339
we've obviously got three when it comes

252
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:01,500
to cannabinoids but plan extracted

253
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:03,300
matter we've got synthetic and we've got

254
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,578
fermentation engineering and bio

255
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:07,919
processing to create a replical molecule

256
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:09,838
over and over again it seems to me the

257
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:12,299
future of the ingredients out of the

258
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,279
industry is the bioprocessing and

259
00:11:12,299 --> 00:11:16,859
fermentation engineering because of the

260
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:19,320
scalability and the replica replication

261
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,419
that can be had and the Purity level is

262
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:24,778
this okay it comes to testing that there

263
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:26,278
is a discrepancy between the three

264
00:11:24,778 --> 00:11:29,278
different separate molecules from the

265
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:32,278
three different production methods

266
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:34,559
it will of course need to be adapted and

267
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:36,958
and you've mentioned for instance uh

268
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:39,659
synthetic cannabinoids

269
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:42,119
um which product providers have already

270
00:11:39,659 --> 00:11:44,039
a set of tools in place for this testing

271
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,919
to be performed so so testing will

272
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:50,219
overall be present

273
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:52,199
um whatever method is choose to to scale

274
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:55,079
up the production of these different

275
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:58,500
compounds that you've mentioned

276
00:11:55,078 --> 00:12:00,359
okay and what are the main roadblocks in

277
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,778
the development of the testing Market in

278
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,778
EU

279
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,180
[Music]

280
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:09,299
um

281
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:12,719
I would say from my perspective

282
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:15,419
um regulatory restrictions seem to be

283
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:18,540
the current primary obstacle on this

284
00:12:15,419 --> 00:12:21,059
road to develop the European market

285
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:23,059
if cannabis and and its components

286
00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:26,159
specifically can't be handled

287
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:28,679
transported manufactured or even sold to

288
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:31,139
the consumer the need for testing also

289
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:33,958
becomes limited just as a possibility

290
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:35,338
for new research and new end products to

291
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:37,979
be developed

292
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:40,680
we are at a stage where companies have

293
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:42,839
for quite some years invested in a

294
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:45,299
market with some degree of uncertainty

295
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:48,720
and the future of their work essentially

296
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:51,359
depends on when and if any advancements

297
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,040
are to take place so having said that

298
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,680
most countries in Western Europe have

299
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:57,419
given green light to the medicinal

300
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:00,419
cannabis Market

301
00:12:57,419 --> 00:13:04,319
with individual specifications and core

302
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:06,958
pilot programs in place and nowadays

303
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,820
more than before we we do read news

304
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:11,939
about ongoing discussions on the

305
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:14,940
recreational Market New approaches being

306
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:16,800
explored in order to forge a path to

307
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:19,200
safely introduce products to the shelves

308
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:22,019
and and to open them to the consumers

309
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:25,200
but this however in my perspective leads

310
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:27,240
to yet another challenge which is lack

311
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,459
of harmonization

312
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,320
while some European countries have

313
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:33,719
established regulations

314
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,120
there's still a lack of harmonization

315
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,339
across the region across the board which

316
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,620
in turn can lead to discrepancies in the

317
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:44,579
testing requirements and the product

318
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:46,578
standards so I've personally found by

319
00:13:44,578 --> 00:13:49,799
speaking with a lot of

320
00:13:46,578 --> 00:13:51,778
companies that operate in the field

321
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:54,659
that in our European market there seems

322
00:13:51,778 --> 00:13:57,419
to be a certain knowledge Gap a need for

323
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:59,399
Guidance with end users turning to more

324
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:01,319
advanced markets such as the US to

325
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:03,659
answer common questions related to

326
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:07,139
overall manufacturing certification

327
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:08,939
processes and and regulations this will

328
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:11,159
of course support the development of the

329
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:13,860
market itself but at the same time and

330
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:17,879
up to an extent will contribute to the

331
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:20,100
lack of consistency and reliability of

332
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:21,059
the products released in our European

333
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,579
market

334
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:26,518
so for me outside these would be the two

335
00:14:23,578 --> 00:14:27,958
main challenges that need to be tackled

336
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:30,419
in order for the market to grow

337
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:32,578
healthily and steadily in the upcoming

338
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:34,860
years

339
00:14:32,578 --> 00:14:36,659
okay amazing it's been fascinating

340
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,399
talking to Andre and I know it might be

341
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:41,100
the most romantic check for someone

342
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,899
having those viable products that are

343
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,000
consistent and remarkable over and over

344
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:47,339
again is the only way this industry can

345
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,039
be taken as seriously as let's say the

346
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:52,199
chocolate industry or the fizzy drinks

347
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:53,639
industry or whatever it may be it's been

348
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:55,799
a great talking to you and hopefully

349
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:57,720
again we can catch up and have a second

350
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:58,859
part of this conversation because as I

351
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,839
said I think we're going to have some

352
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:02,699
movement in Europe over the next five

353
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:04,620
years that I'm sure like yourself is

354
00:15:02,698 --> 00:15:06,240
going to be very busy when we get some

355
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,198
sort of clear regulation from one of the

356
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,299
countries

357
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:11,159
absolutely looking forward to see where

358
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:13,620
the market is heading and thank you

359
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:15,600
again for having me in your in your show

360
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:18,019
my absolute pleasure until the episode

361
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,019
everybody
