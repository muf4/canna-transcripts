overview of how Zuber Lawler and

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,880
yourself ended up stepping into the

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,659
Cannabis industry and the timeline and

17
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,059
that

18
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:41,099
sure well thanks to God we were in the

19
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:43,320
right place at the right time uh I'm

20
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,359
based in Los Angeles California and

21
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,320
super Lawler has offices across the

22
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:49,378
country

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,058
um but cannabis in one sense was born in

24
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:52,979
America legalized cannabis here in

25
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:55,259
California is the first state to

26
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:58,319
legalize at the medicinal level uh back

27
00:00:55,259 --> 00:01:00,119
in the 1990s so we got into cannabis uh

28
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,878
this is ancient history now way back in

29
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:05,399
2006 that was to our knowledge before

30
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:08,039
any corporate law firms per se had

31
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,080
really entered the space and so there

32
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,479
were defense attorneys that started

33
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,700
doing contracts and Licensing but we

34
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,019
started getting asked to do things like

35
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,740
the the first

36
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:22,739
real external Rays uh the partnership

37
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:25,379
dispute IP issues uh the the heavier

38
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:27,239
regulatory issues they said well uh we'd

39
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:29,579
like a corporate law firm to do this and

40
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:31,679
would you guys help uh so I had a buddy

41
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:34,798
uh my first client was actually uh it

42
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,140
was a buddy uh who uh I had known uh

43
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,360
just uh uh uh about here in Southern

44
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,040
California he started a company I'll

45
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:42,599
give him a shout out my buddy Kenny

46
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,280
Morrison with the Venice Cookie Company

47
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:47,699
still a dear friend of mine and still a

48
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,099
client uh so he he said hey uh Tom can

49
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,079
you guys help out here we're uh about to

50
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:55,140
do this and that uh and that was back in

51
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:57,239
2006 uh we quickly became very popular

52
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,399
um So within five six seven years uh

53
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:01,859
thanks to God we had a long list of

54
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,899
clients it had to be the or one of the

55
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:05,578
longest list of cannabis clients in the

56
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:07,140
country at that point and we hadn't gone

57
00:02:05,578 --> 00:02:09,780
after a single client that's literally

58
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:12,479
true we were just getting phone calls

59
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,860
and emails as a function of being I

60
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,659
guess you could say the corporate law

61
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,879
firm it that was embracing the subject

62
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:19,560
matter at point we realized that

63
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:22,318
cannabis was going to be his biggest

64
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,780
Pharma and we do work in the Pharma

65
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:27,179
industry uh and in other Industries so

66
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,580
we said we're all in uh at this point uh

67
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,920
we do as much cannabis work as any law

68
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,080
firm in the country uh and uh of course

69
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:36,659
we have um I want as you've noted we've

70
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,459
uh we we've really gotten around here uh

71
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:39,659
we represent many of the the bigger

72
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:41,400
players in the industry in respect of

73
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:43,439
our high stakes Acquisitions and finance

74
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,840
and IP and Regulatory and litigation

75
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:48,000
matters the international work which is

76
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,860
increasingly coming up uh and and that

77
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,378
conversation is is something we'll we'll

78
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,000
have on this on the zoom uh and and also

79
00:02:52,378 --> 00:02:55,979
we've gotten involved I could I guess

80
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,659
you could say in the ecosystem we found

81
00:02:55,979 --> 00:02:59,459
a global go which became a premier

82
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:01,378
cannabis consultancy we didn't really

83
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:03,120
see something like that so we decided we

84
00:03:01,378 --> 00:03:05,159
needed a friend like that so we got

85
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,519
involved in starting one up they've now

86
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:10,199
achieved that team uh has achieved over

87
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:12,239
250 cannabis licenses I believe

88
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:14,219
throughout the world uh and and with uh

89
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,620
with an incredible uh success rate we're

90
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:18,539
involved in the launching of okay it was

91
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,759
times which is now a successful magazine

92
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:22,439
I just released their fourth issue uh

93
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:23,818
and and things like that so I guess you

94
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:25,560
could say in addition to serving the

95
00:03:23,818 --> 00:03:27,238
legal industry as lawyers we're also

96
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,039
fans of the subject matter and we

97
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:30,900
believe I really believe in in his

98
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,818
potential um as human beings we believe

99
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,379
in this potential to lift The Human

100
00:03:32,818 --> 00:03:36,479
Condition throughout the world so we're

101
00:03:34,378 --> 00:03:39,479
all in uh both in terms of heart and

102
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:41,039
mind uh and and it's pleasure to be here

103
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:42,658
incredible so you're going to be

104
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:44,400
probably the perfect person who's seen

105
00:03:42,658 --> 00:03:46,318
there and been there and done that and

106
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,640
seen all the different facets of the

107
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:49,139
industry to be able to talk about the

108
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:51,238
couple of topics I want to bring up so

109
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:52,979
the first one is globalization of

110
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:55,319
cannabis and I wanted more ask I want to

111
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:56,579
ask the question is is Europe actually

112
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:59,280
going to end up being the perfect

113
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:01,260
destination via the capital that's

114
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,419
already going to be ready available in

115
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:05,639
North America that'll want new markets

116
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:07,318
to expand to on investors in capital

117
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:09,000
that are already based in Europe who

118
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:11,399
will see this new Emerging Market as

119
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,318
something intriguing with their with

120
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,060
good returns is Europe going to be maybe

121
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:17,279
the center of the Cannabis industry in

122
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,418
10 years time or is that fanciful

123
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,039
thinking

124
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:21,599
well I don't think it's vegetable

125
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,960
thinking I don't know if I think about

126
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,639
it in terms of central I think it's

127
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,620
going to be that things are going to be

128
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,019
disproportionately weighted uh in the

129
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,939
direction of Europe uh and that that

130
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:34,740
notion of things is going to increase as

131
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:37,019
time goes on you've got an awful lot of

132
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:39,960
people there uh on the European content

133
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:41,519
with a similar standard of living and uh

134
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:43,439
so so there's just just that statement

135
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:45,299
alone you've got you've got nearly twice

136
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:46,439
as many people as we have right with the

137
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,840
same standard we're going to go over

138
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:50,399
there so that that that's huge uh but

139
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:52,799
also I think there are some things going

140
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,179
for Europe that we didn't have going for

141
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,160
us here in the United States and Canada

142
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,478
uh one of those things for example is

143
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,919
the example of the United States and

144
00:04:57,478 --> 00:05:01,500
Canada so you get to learn from all our

145
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:02,879
mistakes so there's that um but also I I

146
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,500
think that there's an assuredness that

147
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:05,759
this is going to happen right here in

148
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,879
the United States

149
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,680
um there was sort of disbelief even up

150
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:12,899
until 10 years ago is this really

151
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,280
happening is cannabis I think Europe has

152
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:15,839
seen okay this really is going to happen

153
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:17,339
and you get to look at the United States

154
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,739
to see that that that that that's

155
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:21,239
probably the case for furthermore I

156
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,939
think that Europe is going to have an

157
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:27,000
easier time uh collaborating between

158
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:29,399
jurisdictions right here in the U.S you

159
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,199
can't put THC in in the trunk of your

160
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:33,000
car and drive it across the state line

161
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,360
from California to Nevada right you'll

162
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,379
get arrested uh by federal agents uh but

163
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,479
in Europe

164
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:42,959
um you do have the potential to move

165
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:45,180
cannabis THC across state lines and and

166
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:48,120
that's powerful that is really powerful

167
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,918
so yeah I think that that increasingly

168
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,418
the weight of the conversation is going

169
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:53,219
to move toward Europe and it's a

170
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:55,620
function of the sheer size coupled with

171
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:59,220
the the the purchasing power per per

172
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:00,899
resident uh and also I I think an

173
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,940
ability to move things across borders

174
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:05,698
and then finally the fact that you've

175
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:07,139
got the lesson of the United States the

176
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,060
mistakes we made and some of the things

177
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:11,400
made that we did well uh the United

178
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,439
States and Canada you get to leverage

179
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:15,299
that I think to move quicker than we did

180
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:18,300
so I think things are going to develop I

181
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:21,120
can also tell you uh just as far as it

182
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,860
totally we are talking about Europe over

183
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,360
here in the United States it's an

184
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,759
exceeding exceedingly great place

185
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,100
exciting place to focus on right now and

186
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:30,479
and it it is in terms of investment it's

187
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:33,120
in terms of how do we get product there

188
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:34,258
uh and and that that's a very exciting

189
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,240
conversation

190
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:37,740
yeah I think Europe's got that beautiful

191
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,538
relationship to whether you're going

192
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,160
into the consumer Focus side of things

193
00:06:39,538 --> 00:06:43,139
there's a heavy consumer Pace already

194
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,180
here but if you decide to go to the

195
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:47,819
biosynthesis route and create your own

196
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:49,978
Blends and formulations and apis Europe

197
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:51,479
already has the infrastructure and the

198
00:06:49,978 --> 00:06:53,639
industry know-how here and I think

199
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:55,860
that's a the two-pronged attack will end

200
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:58,319
up coming from Europe from the get-go

201
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:00,600
yes yeah

202
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:04,199
um there are a lot of I think oh and it

203
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:07,259
one we're here from our remote

204
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:08,520
perspective in the United States uh when

205
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:10,020
we look at Europe we're trying to say

206
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:11,698
okay how is this going to play out how

207
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:13,379
is this going to work out what's what's

208
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:14,520
what's the Cannabis industry going to

209
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:16,860
look like that the international

210
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:18,839
candidates Industries exists on the

211
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,580
European continent what's that going to

212
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:22,978
look like in in three years and in five

213
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:24,659
years into 10 years and and that's a fun

214
00:07:22,978 --> 00:07:26,818
thing to think about

215
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:29,479
um one of the the challenges here for

216
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:32,460
instance in Germany is uh it's it's it's

217
00:07:29,478 --> 00:07:34,079
accepted pretty broadly that Germany is

218
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:36,000
not going to be able to produce enough

219
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:38,399
to meet its demand there in Germany

220
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,259
right and so immediately from the get-go

221
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:42,299
you've got an interesting uh situation

222
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,919
there that really you you don't have

223
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,960
here in the United States where you say

224
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:48,240
Okay California doesn't have enough uh

225
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:51,359
one week we've got plenty of of product

226
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,400
now but two even if we didn't there's no

227
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,840
option to drive in that THC from

228
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:57,299
neighboring states you can't do that

229
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:59,698
right but in Europe that is possible so

230
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,960
it just goes to show that while there

231
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:02,579
are going to be a lot of parallels

232
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,918
between how things developed over here

233
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:06,418
on our side of the neighborhood and how

234
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:08,579
they develop over there oh and on your

235
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:11,579
side of the neighborhood I I think that

236
00:08:08,579 --> 00:08:13,620
there's there's a lot of exciting uh

237
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:16,318
differences too uh and one of those

238
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:19,860
differences is that Germany can now plug

239
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:22,020
um its capacity needs by importing THC

240
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:24,060
so that that really is uh that really is

241
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:26,098
I think a phenomenal difference uh and

242
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,598
and it's those sorts of things I think

243
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:28,978
that we're so excited about here in the

244
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:31,319
United States when we look at Europe

245
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:32,759
yeah very much so and even with the

246
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:34,440
movings and happenings happening the

247
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:36,240
Czech Republic at the moment I think

248
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,860
you'll have these connected countries

249
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,560
that end up facilitating commerce

250
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:42,479
between each other and allows for Europe

251
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,119
to grow and a lot smoother and quicker

252
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,139
way than let's say North America because

253
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,240
UConn's kind of broke the barriers we'll

254
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:51,778
get to learn from all of the the

255
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:55,200
examples that have been set before us

256
00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:57,120
very much so yes exactly and and that

257
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,040
that really is the the trick right is to

258
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,600
try and it's great to learn from your

259
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,219
own mistakes but you'd rather learn from

260
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,440
the mistakes of others that's even

261
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,759
better right that's free I guess in a

262
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,500
sense free learning

263
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:08,639
um

264
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,860
by looking at some of the things that

265
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,600
we've done wrong and you know I I will

266
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,800
just as long as I'm here because we do

267
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,480
care about our friends over there in

268
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:16,799
Europe I would take a good hard look at

269
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,019
some of the troubles we're having here

270
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:21,059
you know resist the the temptation just

271
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:23,459
to tax everything as much as possible

272
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:25,500
because it is self-destructive even from

273
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:27,239
the tax Authority standpoints because

274
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,860
you're going to kill you know the the

275
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,379
body that's that that that that that

276
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,060
lifts the hand that feeds it just

277
00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:35,278
doesn't make any sense here you've got

278
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:37,079
to allow the industry to grow and and

279
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:39,000
people are getting crushed and I don't

280
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:41,220
know if this is a well-known fact in

281
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,379
Europe but here in California there are

282
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:46,440
over 250 million dollars and this is

283
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:47,939
tragic over 250 million dollars of taxes

284
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,800
are owed by California cannabis

285
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:52,200
companies I'll say that again over 250

286
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:53,519
million dollars of taxes or over by

287
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,339
cannabis companies here in California

288
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,440
now that that is really that that's

289
00:09:56,339 --> 00:10:00,120
that's a depressing statistic isn't it

290
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,860
because that means that the burden here

291
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,379
that that has been placed on California

292
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,360
cannabis companies is really quite

293
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:08,220
extreme right and and those pressures

294
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,440
come from a number of areas one is is

295
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:13,320
taxation the taxation I think is is

296
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,360
really uh it really is is

297
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,220
counterproductive in many regards in

298
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,339
terms of the size of it in terms of the

299
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:21,778
the flippancy of the of the of the

300
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:23,820
taxation scheme

301
00:10:21,778 --> 00:10:25,860
um but also uh the illicit markets here

302
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,360
it makes it very tough to compete the

303
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,039
illicit markets don't have to pay their

304
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,139
taxes and they don't have to pay for

305
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:34,319
compliance uh in in the same way that

306
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:36,000
that that licensed companies do and so

307
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,100
how do you how do you compete on price

308
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,958
with an illicit shop that's that's down

309
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,940
the street so the lack of enforcement

310
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:43,139
against those illicitors products that's

311
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:45,360
something else that I would look for

312
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:47,578
there you really want to enable your

313
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,800
legalized industry to thrive more than

314
00:10:47,578 --> 00:10:51,479
it can if the illicit industry is

315
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:53,939
thriving at lower price points right so

316
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,560
that that that is a another important

317
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:58,079
thing that I would take away from from

318
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:59,759
the conversation here in the US yeah for

319
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:01,739
sure I think anybody in Europe if you're

320
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,720
not studying the taxation models of the

321
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,940
various States and understanding where

322
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,860
the economic went right and went wrong

323
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,120
and you're doing yourself a disservice

324
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,100
to the country you're working in because

325
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,720
we should be accumulating as much

326
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,519
knowledge and data as we can to be able

327
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,139
to facilitate creating the best

328
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:18,120
Industries within each individual

329
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:20,759
territory that's over here in Ireland in

330
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,200
Europe I wanted to move on to the final

331
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:23,879
topic Before I Let You Go I know you're

332
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,160
a busy man and it's facilitating

333
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:28,439
commerce between territories in a

334
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:31,139
nutshell a safe Banking Act going to

335
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,760
basically be the cure to all ailments or

336
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:33,679
is it going to be more complicated than

337
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:37,139
that

338
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:39,659
oh man I mean that's

339
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:41,278
now you're you know uh

340
00:11:39,659 --> 00:11:43,620
it's

341
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:46,259
we we've had that dangled in front of us

342
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:49,019
for so long here it's

343
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:52,620
um it's just the thing that's coming it

344
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:55,019
never arrives right so like prohibition

345
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:59,039
itself behind that I do have a feeling

346
00:11:55,019 --> 00:12:01,740
and this yeah I I this makes me naive uh

347
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:03,659
I do have I do have a notion that that

348
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:06,060
we'll see safe banking uh sometime

349
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:07,740
within the next the next few years I do

350
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,939
and I think it may happen sooner than

351
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:13,620
that

352
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:15,540
um but um I I don't think we're um I

353
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:18,000
don't think we'll see Prohibition end

354
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:19,919
um uh anytime soon

355
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,899
um but I do think we'll see safe banking

356
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:24,659
why do I think that

357
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:26,399
there are it really is as much as it's

358
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:27,778
seen as a partisan issue here and I

359
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,899
think in some respects you'll find

360
00:12:27,778 --> 00:12:33,000
evidence for that to a degree

361
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:35,220
um but it you'll also find evidence that

362
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,659
that in many ways it's bipartisan there

363
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,519
are folks on both sides of the aisle

364
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:40,078
here that really think that it's not

365
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:41,220
sensible that we have all this Commerce

366
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:43,138
happening and you can't get a bank

367
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,940
account and what that does in terms of

368
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:46,200
the the government's perspective and how

369
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,820
that really is not in the government's

370
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,160
interest to have all this money floating

371
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:52,379
out around out there that that's not in

372
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:53,759
the banking system so um I I do think

373
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:56,338
we'll see something I think there's a

374
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:58,740
enough folks on both sides of the aisle

375
00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:00,959
um it and that does make me naive um

376
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:03,240
because uh that's that's it out there

377
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:04,619
for quite a while but I'm happy to be in

378
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,600
the naive camp on that one I think

379
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,399
something's gonna happen yeah I'll join

380
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,778
you on the Youth Camp as well I think

381
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,940
it's something that hopefully in the

382
00:13:09,778 --> 00:13:14,220
next 12 to 18 months that we see end of

383
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:16,079
coming to fruition but we shall cross

384
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,519
our fingers until then Tom I know you're

385
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:18,659
a very busy man so I'm not going to keep

386
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,278
you any longer it's been an absolute

387
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:21,480
pleasure talking to you and hopefully we

388
00:13:20,278 --> 00:13:23,159
get to touch base over the next 12

389
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,480
months there's any movement on safe

390
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:26,159
banking

391
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,680
oh and it's an absolute pleasure to see

392
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:30,059
you again always and uh it's great to

393
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:32,278
have friends over there in Europe and

394
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:33,299
