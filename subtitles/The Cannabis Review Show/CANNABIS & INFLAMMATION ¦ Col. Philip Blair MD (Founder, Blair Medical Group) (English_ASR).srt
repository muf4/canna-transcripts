1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,960
foreign

2
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:16,859
by Colonel Philip Blair MD who's the

3
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:19,679
founder of Blair Medical Group how you

4
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,660
keep J Phillip I'm doing great

5
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:23,219
it's an absolute pleasure to talk to you

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,539
I know you're a very busy man so thank

7
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:25,739
you very much for taking your time to do

8
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:27,840
this do you mind if we want to give

9
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:29,820
everybody a brief overview on how your

10
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:31,500
career is so extensive and you've

11
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,719
touched on so many things can you maybe

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,700
just brief it down to how you ended to

13
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,439
get into working on CBR and your kind of

14
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,399
a node receptors

15
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:44,039
okay well I um I went to medical school

16
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:47,219
University of Miami I went uh did Family

17
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:51,539
Practice uh a training and I was in the

18
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:53,359
Army for about 30 years uh I in 2014 I

19
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:57,359
was introduced to Canada

20
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:59,460
and I was I did the research on it I was

21
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,378
amazed at the particular benefits I've

22
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,539
treated several thousand people with

23
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:06,298
cannabidiol but in about three years ago

24
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:09,060
I discovered and I learned about uh the

25
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,640
uh the extensive uh interactions with

26
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,040
the endocannabinoid system and with one

27
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,439
specific uh terpene uh that is actually

28
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,200
an endocrine abenoid activator called

29
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:21,419
the beta carry offaline

30
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,978
okay the work you're doing is very

31
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,359
exciting because I think everybody if

32
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:26,579
you if you peel back the Cannabis

33
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:28,759
industry that the big gains and the big

34
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:30,539
revolutions are going to come from The

35
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:32,099
endocannabinoid receptors and those

36
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,200
people who can Target these receptors

37
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:35,759
for a multitude of different ailments do

38
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,640
you maybe want to bring everybody up to

39
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,140
speed is what our

40
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,939
endocannabinoid receptors how many there

41
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,079
are and the health benefits that they

42
00:01:41,938 --> 00:01:46,078
pertain

43
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:47,819
sure I can touch upon that now the um

44
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:49,798
the endocannabinoid system is quite

45
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:52,139
extensive it's really the master

46
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,180
regulator for all the other systems it

47
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,118
maintains the homeostasis within our

48
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,920
body it regulates the other systems of

49
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:02,099
the body so that means the immune system

50
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:06,960
uh the neurotransmitters the digestive

51
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:09,000
system of the uh uh that all sorts of

52
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,400
systems within the body our urinary

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,979
system our cardiovascular all these

54
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,959
systems are regulated uh in part by this

55
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:18,238
endocannabinoid system that is an

56
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:21,000
interactive a bi-directional interaction

57
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,759
so that there's input and output coming

58
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,780
in uh and going out through this system

59
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:30,239
now it's not been recognized until about

60
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:32,640
1994 that it was uh on an entire system

61
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,219
of its own but it has a regulating

62
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:38,878
factor for many of the different major

63
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:42,419
consequences of the body so our mood our

64
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:45,000
our nervous system our immunity our

65
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:47,458
gastrointestinal track are all regulated

66
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,180
in part by this system so that means

67
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:53,280
inflammation is a key factor for uh the

68
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,459
regulation of the endocannabinoid system

69
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,919
so the main receptors are the type one

70
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:01,378
the cannabinoid type receptor and the

71
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:03,419
cannabinoid type 2 receptor but there

72
00:03:01,378 --> 00:03:05,878
are a host of other receptor systems

73
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:07,759
that receptors that are in this system

74
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:10,919
and it's been termed as the

75
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:13,560
endocannabinoid Dome because of the

76
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:16,018
breadth of the receptor systems and

77
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,800
transmitters that work within the system

78
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:23,280
so the their major transmitters are

79
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:25,500
anandamide which is aea and 2ag is are

80
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,719
these the major ligands that connect up

81
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:30,419
to these receptors but there's a host of

82
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:31,378
other receptor systems and agonists that

83
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:35,878
occur

84
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:39,120
um oea which is oleol ethanolamide and

85
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:41,939
palmateal ethanolamide pea R receptor

86
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,400
systems or ligands that connect up to

87
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:46,439
these receptors as well and there are

88
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,140
also receptor systems called the P par

89
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:51,060
receptors that are also linked to the

90
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:52,699
body and have

91
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,219
um amazing

92
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:58,619
immunity uh effects as well as metabolic

93
00:03:56,219 --> 00:04:01,318
effects and so all of these systems are

94
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,239
are integrated so closely that it's hard

95
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:06,378
to separate them out but the major

96
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:09,780
factor is that endocannabinoid

97
00:04:06,378 --> 00:04:12,179
disruption or dysfunction in the

98
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:15,000
endocannabinoid system leads to most of

99
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:18,319
our chronic diseases

100
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
okay very interesting so the the the

101
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:23,040
types of drug Discovery and development

102
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,978
that are happening at the moment those

103
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,580
targeting various CB1 and CB2 receptors

104
00:04:25,978 --> 00:04:33,180
we know for example CBG is an Agonist

105
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:36,180
for the CV2 receptor what is a a perfect

106
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:38,400
Agonist for the CB1 receptor and are the

107
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,439
most advanced Drug Discovery and

108
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:42,719
development processes working on either

109
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:45,180
CB1 or CB2 receptors

110
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,400
well the CB1 receptors are tend to be

111
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,500
our psychoactive receptors also

112
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:51,839
inflammatory receptors and the CB1

113
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,519
receptors unfortunately have a lot of

114
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,579
adverse effects and they can create

115
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:58,319
psychosis and some dysfunction so they

116
00:04:56,579 --> 00:05:00,418
and they're also associated with

117
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,579
inflammatory disorders such as liver

118
00:05:00,418 --> 00:05:06,000
disease so you want to be careful about

119
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:09,198
the the type 1 receptors and so the THC

120
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,879
is the classic of a type 1 receptor

121
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,460
Agonist and which we've been involved

122
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:17,040
with for the last uh 20 years in terms

123
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:20,758
of orchestrating different connections

124
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:23,639
to that and uh it's uh it's regarded as

125
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:26,819
a very negative sign whereas a CB2

126
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:28,560
receptor uh is um the one that it

127
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:31,019
controls the inflammation and it has

128
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,360
neurologic impacts as well

129
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:36,478
um and um so the most of the research

130
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,120
there's 35 products that are in the

131
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:41,579
pipeline the pharmaceutical Pipeline on

132
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,319
cannabinoid type 2 receptor

133
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:45,899
um

134
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:48,779
uh and chemicals that are being produced

135
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:50,758
in this regard now we already have

136
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:53,099
um we got a number of products that are

137
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:56,759
actually available naturally uh

138
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:59,699
palmateal ethanolamide pea and oea uh

139
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:02,699
are uh all y'all ethanolamide are

140
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:05,220
available as a cannabinoid substances

141
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:08,100
that work on the CB2 receptor and other

142
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:11,460
systems as well and one of the terpenes

143
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:13,919
that is found in um in cannabis but it's

144
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:18,299
also found in numerous other vegetables

145
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:21,180
is a karyophilin and carryofilin is a

146
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:25,879
superb terpene which is a simple oil

147
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:30,660
that is found in basil oregano cloves

148
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:33,839
grapefruit guava and avocado and this

149
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:37,259
particular terpene has amazing

150
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:39,899
um a receptor system uh activation of

151
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:42,180
cannabinoid type 2 receptors and a host

152
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:46,258
of other uh agonists within the

153
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:49,620
endocannabidome uh that uh will um uh

154
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:52,860
monitor modulate uh inflammation uh pain

155
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:55,918
uh and neurodegenerative diseases as

156
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:59,460
well now we've um Blair Medical group

157
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:01,918
has developed a product uh on basis on

158
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:04,198
uh the uh carry offline in particular

159
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:06,418
that is showing stunning results in

160
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:08,280
terms of inflammation pain and

161
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:11,339
neuropathy as well as behavioral

162
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:15,059
disorders uh as and and including

163
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:17,459
allergy phenomena so um there's a lot of

164
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,280
pharmaceutical products going on but

165
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:23,219
we've actually produced a number of

166
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:25,559
products uh in using terpenes that have

167
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:28,020
amazing properties for activating the

168
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:31,079
endocannabinoid system and up regulating

169
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:33,659
the system so that it improves uh these

170
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:36,538
dysfunctional endocannabinoid disorders

171
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:39,120
that are very common in our chronic

172
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:41,038
lifestyle situations

173
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,660
we hear a lot about the health benefits

174
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:44,579
of terpenes and how important they are

175
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:47,340
to the overall Entourage effect that we

176
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:50,219
get in cannabis is the future of the

177
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:53,038
most Optimum drugs going to be single

178
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:55,500
molecules blended into formulations that

179
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:58,918
are targeting one specific thing acutely

180
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,418
or is the the full spectrum plant

181
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:02,698
solution always going to be the best

182
00:08:00,418 --> 00:08:05,219
option it's always going to be the full

183
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:07,199
spectrum we what we found in in our

184
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:10,440
history of pharmaceutical development is

185
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:15,180
this single targeting elements uh Miss

186
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:18,360
uh a major modulating features that need

187
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:20,098
to be there so that a single Target is

188
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,580
not good enough what we need are

189
00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:26,339
multiple targets uh and a full spectrum

190
00:08:23,579 --> 00:08:28,560
is going to be the best now

191
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:32,038
um so what we've combined the carry

192
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:35,099
offalin with hemp oil phenola hemp oil

193
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:37,439
which is a high quality omega-3 oil with

194
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:39,719
a blend of different products uh

195
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,560
different polyphenols that add to the

196
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:46,200
benefits so that it's a full spectrum

197
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:49,319
potential and it has an amazing

198
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:52,680
properties uh to regulate all all

199
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:55,200
systems and so the the targeted uh

200
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:58,439
functionality of um pharmaceutical

201
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,360
industry is I think is misaligned and

202
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,940
we're learning more and more about that

203
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,220
for instance uh cannabidiol was

204
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,260
developed as a formulary uh

205
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,600
individualized product and the

206
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:12,659
requirement for controlling epilepsy

207
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,720
really requires on the order of a huge

208
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:18,600
amount of cannabidiol in its pure form

209
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:21,120
in order to benefit and control epilepsy

210
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,459
whereas in a full spectrum you have one

211
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,080
tenth of the amount is required so we're

212
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:26,819
getting a lot better effects from the

213
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,680
full spectrum from the biologically

214
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,480
derived substances

215
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:33,439
um and those tend not to be the

216
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,839
pharmaceutical varieties

217
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:39,600
uh what place do biotechnology companies

218
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:41,880
that use fermentation and biosynthesis

219
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,399
have in the role of producing rare

220
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:46,620
molecules is that an option for the

221
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,659
industry moving forward as a solution to

222
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,240
get better and more advanced products

223
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:54,059
out to patients well if they're combined

224
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,459
with other of these other products these

225
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:58,079
other benevolent substances I think they

226
00:09:56,458 --> 00:10:00,979
could be for instance if you could

227
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,480
combine CBG with some of the other

228
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:07,019
compounds that are available with

229
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:09,000
terpenes or with uh um other

230
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:10,679
cannabinoids then you're going to get a

231
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,620
fuller spectrum and you're going to get

232
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:15,359
a wider breadth of benefits and you're

233
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,399
going to decrease the adverse effects

234
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,039
from it because many people the body

235
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:22,860
system is very complex and we don't have

236
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:24,419
a not everybody is made up the same way

237
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,459
and so that

238
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:29,039
um you're going to have a gift get a

239
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:30,539
different response per individual and if

240
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,699
you have a blend of these products

241
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:34,439
you're going to Target many of the

242
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,940
benefit that's and you're going to miss

243
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,839
and you're going to avoid the the

244
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:41,760
adverse effects from the complications

245
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:43,680
of these individualized targeted

246
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:45,958
substances

247
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:48,719
next topic I wanted to move on to before

248
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:50,518
we end is systematic inflammation as we

249
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,100
know inflammation seems to be the cause

250
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:56,399
of 80 percent or more at different

251
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:58,680
medical conditions how well do the

252
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:02,039
agonists targeting the CB2 receptor for

253
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:04,379
inflammation work and is that the do you

254
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:06,299
see inflammation being more advantageous

255
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:08,458
than let's say pain relief when it comes

256
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:10,979
to Target in these receptors and future

257
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:14,219
medicines for patients out there well

258
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:18,600
for the CB2 receptor is actually a neuro

259
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:22,200
Agonist and it regulates the neural the

260
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:24,600
neuropathic methods and mechanisms as

261
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,040
well as the immune mechanisms that's not

262
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,860
widely recognized generally it's

263
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:30,899
regarded CB2 receptor is regarded as

264
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,519
being minor in the brain it just is the

265
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:34,919
population in the brain in the normal

266
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:37,379
brain is quite low but when we get

267
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:39,719
inflammatory diseases of the brain then

268
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:43,439
that population accelerates and we have

269
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,778
a large population and though and it is

270
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:49,740
very responsive to cannabinoid type 2

271
00:11:45,778 --> 00:11:52,740
receptor systems uh that benefit and

272
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:55,680
reduce the inflammation as well as the

273
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:57,899
neural regulation on those systems so I

274
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:00,479
want to emphasize that CB2 receptor is

275
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:03,120
neurologic as well as immunologic now in

276
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,278
the immunologic area CB2 receptors are

277
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,959
located on every one of our immune cells

278
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:09,778
no matter what system it is whether it's

279
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:12,000
the brain the kidney the liver all the

280
00:12:09,778 --> 00:12:14,159
Indian blood sugar system so every one

281
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,320
of our immune cells has this receptor

282
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:19,679
and when you target that receptor and

283
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:23,600
you create a an Agonist effect then you

284
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:26,219
get a Cascade of immunologic system that

285
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,920
shifts the immunologic system I want I

286
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:31,320
don't want to say disables it because it

287
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:33,599
actually shifts it from the M1 which is

288
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:36,778
the activated inflammator inflammatory

289
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:39,060
stage to the M2 stage which is the

290
00:12:36,778 --> 00:12:41,458
resolution and the healing phase of

291
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:44,458
immunity and because it does that then

292
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:46,018
it doesn't impair immunity but it shifts

293
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:48,419
it to the healing phase and it

294
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:51,060
deactivates many of the cytokines and

295
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:54,719
the inflammatory substances as well as

296
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:57,419
the macrophages that are being invasive

297
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:01,560
it also regulates the invasion of

298
00:12:57,419 --> 00:13:03,299
macrophages into areas that are involved

299
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:06,539
with the inflammation so it's going to

300
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:09,299
regulate the migration of these cells

301
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:11,458
into inflammatory areas that and it's

302
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:13,439
going to decrease the it's going to

303
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:15,479
increase the it's going to decrease the

304
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,579
permeability of these membranes and

305
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,560
these blood vessels to prevent leakage

306
00:13:17,578 --> 00:13:22,859
of these substances and that goes for

307
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:24,599
the gut as well as the immune system and

308
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,820
the blood-brain barrier and the eye

309
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,100
barriers as well one of the particular

310
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:31,260
areas that we found with karyophilin is

311
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,720
that it targets eye disease very

312
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:35,879
specifically and I've seen incredible

313
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:39,120
responses for macular degeneration and

314
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:41,519
diabetic retinopathy which is a a a

315
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,679
horrible problem to deal with and and

316
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,899
we're getting more and more of it and it

317
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,278
Targets this area specifically for

318
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:49,200
regulating

319
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:51,539
um the eye disease and all of

320
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,180
retinopathy

321
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:55,620
it's very intriguing subjects so far and

322
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:56,879
I think they're mental progress that is

323
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,379
going to happen over the next five to

324
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:00,419
ten years is going to be pretty

325
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:02,578
incredible to watch do you think or

326
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:05,399
indeed approved at a governmental level

327
00:14:02,578 --> 00:14:06,539
is crucial to developing these new drugs

328
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:08,159
that are going to benefit patients

329
00:14:06,539 --> 00:14:10,799
across the board or do you think private

330
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:12,838
Enterprise is going to be still able to

331
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:14,819
do these regardless of the legislation

332
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:16,740
that happens in various countries

333
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,480
I think it's going to be private

334
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:21,060
Enterprise I don't think it's going to

335
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,039
be a major marketing that drugs are

336
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:24,958
going to be coming out uh are going to

337
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:27,120
be isolates and they've already been

338
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:29,099
fraught with difficulties in terms of

339
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,519
complications from their single Target

340
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:35,159
measures so I think uh with bio with

341
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:37,679
naturally occurring uh cannabinoids and

342
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:40,019
terpenes I think there's a great market

343
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:41,939
for this and I can think there's a great

344
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:43,919
benefit that's going to occur there

345
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:45,899
isn't any limit to how much people can

346
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:48,059
take of these carry offline than these

347
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:50,578
molecules we just have to get it into

348
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:54,059
the legal framework unfortunately hemp

349
00:14:50,578 --> 00:14:55,919
is uh being uh um hemp products or are

350
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:58,018
being maligned in a number of ways and

351
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:00,120
they're restricted so that we can turn

352
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:03,299
to terpenes what are which are normally

353
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:06,000
available in in other substances that

354
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:08,039
could provide additional benefits

355
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,600
