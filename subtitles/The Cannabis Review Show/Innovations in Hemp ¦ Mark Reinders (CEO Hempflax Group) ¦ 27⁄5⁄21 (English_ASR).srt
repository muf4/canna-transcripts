7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,400
well yeah i'm very well thank you very

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,680
much

9
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:23,118
excellent delighted to have you on the

10
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:25,039
show i know you're a busy man so i'm not

11
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:27,759
going to take up too much of your time

12
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,359
um temflax group seemed to be doing huge

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,320
business as of late last two years

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,800
seemed to be great

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,238
in terms of turnover for you guys what's

16
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,320
the secret to the success that you've

17
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:37,839
had at hempflex is it the diversion of

18
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,878
diversity of products

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,160
or have it been the the timing that you

20
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:45,439
guys have been able to grow

21
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:46,159
grow at such a rate now i think it's

22
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:49,439
both

23
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:52,238
first of all we have 26 years history in

24
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:54,479
the industry so we have a lot of

25
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:55,359
know-how and experience and that's good

26
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,159
of course

27
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:58,558
especially if you look at the newcomers

28
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:00,639
and

29
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,320
it's hemp it's uh you need a lot of

30
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,320
experience to grow it to harvest it to

31
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,079
process it so we have this first mover

32
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,679
advantage over there

33
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:10,319
on the second hand as well our dive

34
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,000
first portfolio of products as we do a

35
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:13,759
total crop valuation

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,040
so actually we're using the crop from

37
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,560
the from the seeds

38
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,000
up to the roots and we bring everything

39
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,719
to market and that makes you

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
less dependent on specific market

41
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:26,158
developments

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,759
especially what's doing quite well now

43
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,960
besides cbd of course

44
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,799
uh also the animal bedding uh with the

45
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:33,519
woody court stalk we use for animal

46
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,439
bedding

47
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:36,798
uh during cove a lot of people took an

48
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:38,959
animal

49
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,880
and took a pet at home and any bedding

50
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:42,239
for the cages they refresh decades a bit

51
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:43,599
more than normally because spend quite a

52
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:46,158
lot of time at home

53
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:47,519
and the product is easy to be sold over

54
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,759
the internet so

55
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:50,560
our diverse portfolio products really

56
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,680
helped us

57
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,920
ramping up the results amazing

58
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,360
it's uh anybody who knows anything about

59
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,640
the industry in europe knows that

60
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:59,840
i've been reading a couple of the

61
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,879
articles and laughing at some of the

62
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,079
titles like hemp baron and whatnot but

63
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:05,759
everybody knows that you're one of the

64
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:06,798
market leaders in europe when it comes

65
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,318
to this industry

66
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,239
can you tell me about some of the

67
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:11,598
innovations that are happening in hemp

68
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,439
what are let's say the two biggest

69
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,039
things that you see coming because

70
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,479
i can only imagine you guys are grown at

71
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:17,519
a certain stage now there's just going

72
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,840
to be new products

73
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,120
created for the same type of ingredient

74
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,319
what would you be uh

75
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,840
most likely to show from the roof about

76
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:27,598
no i see a couple of death elements

77
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,120
going on of course if you look at the

78
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:32,318
neutral circles

79
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,280
i see developments in cbd

80
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:37,280
where everybody first focused in the new

81
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,479
market on getting extracts mixing the

82
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,519
extracts to an oil

83
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:44,159
and sell as a tincture or a capsule um

84
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,640
i think that the the i always call them

85
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:48,239
the first generation cbd products and

86
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:49,518
we are now in the second generation

87
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,159
maybe already starting the third

88
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,959
generation

89
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:55,359
cbd products where cbd is becoming more

90
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,640
an ingredient in functional food or

91
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,120
becoming more

92
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,318
an ingredient with other ingredients uh

93
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,319
like vitamin

94
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:07,679
or or um uh

95
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:09,199
um other additives like herbs or or kirk

96
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,760
mean and that kind of stuff

97
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:12,639
so it it's really getting a development

98
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,479
on the other hand

99
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:19,439
for the fibers we see a massive increase

100
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:23,840
interest for textile

101
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:26,569
where hemp can replace cotton cotton is

102
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,479
from an environmental point of view

103
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:31,519
[Music]

104
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,560
very polluting fiber and what are use

105
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,480
pesticide use

106
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,840
fertilizer use and that's all those

107
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:38,158
kinds hemp

108
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,000
doesn't have we don't use pesticides we

109
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:42,560
don't use artificial fertilizers we

110
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,560
don't use

111
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:47,759
a lot of water to grow the hemp and

112
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:50,479
modifying the hemp fiber into

113
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:52,318
a spinal fiber on cotton lines could

114
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:54,318
change the industry massively

115
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:56,000
the same is valid we see in non-woven

116
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:56,560
industries for disposables where hemp

117
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,479
can

118
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,640
replace micro plastics so textiles

119
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,639
disposables are very interesting trends

120
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:08,000
to follow

121
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:08,798
okay amazing ireland is known as a

122
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,799
construction

123
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,480
uh country we've got a lot of kind of

124
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,360
global companies that play a role in

125
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:14,959
this industry

126
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,040
the prices recently went up for

127
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,120
construction how do you see the prices

128
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,680
comparing for using hemp pre compared to

129
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,000
the

130
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,040
the regular overheads for uh building

131
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,439
structures with regular concrete

132
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,080
yeah it depends a little bit on how well

133
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:29,839
introduced

134
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,839
the product already is in the country in

135
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:32,719
the market um if i think if you're

136
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:35,279
asking a

137
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,720
traditional construction company to use

138
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:38,000
this kind of materials they are not

139
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,919
familiar with they

140
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,160
tend to calculate extra costs for the

141
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:45,599
risk or finding out what works or

142
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:48,160
they're just afraid for it i know there

143
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,160
are now already specialized companies in

144
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,360
europe working quite a long time with

145
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,360
the materials

146
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,840
and they can build houses for very

147
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,199
competitive prices

148
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:59,839
other hand you also have to ask yourself

149
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,680
the question does an hemp house

150
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:03,198
needs to be as cheap as a traditional

151
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,360
house

152
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,879
in the end is the cost of the total cost

153
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,400
of ownership not the cost of

154
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:09,360
construction but the total cost of

155
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,478
ownership so

156
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,960
if you have an improved insulation value

157
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,639
you earn back the higher cost during the

158
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,799
lifetime of the house

159
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,639
because of the insulation or keeping

160
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,038
your house cooler in the summer like

161
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,079
what's ham doing perfectly you save a

162
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:26,719
lot of energy cost

163
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:27,599
on on on the climate control of your

164
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,360
house

165
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,199
uh and in the end at the end of life

166
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,360
cycle and i agree

167
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,639
not so many people are thinking about

168
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,919
the end of life cycle of the house if

169
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,960
you build a house

170
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:40,719
but to dispose all these materials again

171
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:42,560
uh the recyclability of hemp is much

172
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,840
better and and and you will save quite a

173
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,038
lot of money there so

174
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:49,279
the total ownership cost will be much

175
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:51,680
lower

176
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:54,319
um on another one let's say on the food

177
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,038
and novel act that we were talking about

178
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,719
is basically this going to be the next

179
00:05:57,038 --> 00:05:59,680
big gateway you do see all the big

180
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,000
companies sitting

181
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,680
sitting at the side waiting for a couple

182
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,120
of companies to get approved novel food

183
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,319
license and then they will be the main

184
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,240
ingredient supplier

185
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,560
and are you guys in the mix to be one of

186
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,639
those main companies

187
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,560
yeah we are part of the the novel food

188
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,560
consortium of the european international

189
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,519
hemp presentation

190
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,519
where we technically pass the validation

191
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:24,318
it's not published yet

192
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:25,680
but it's uh awaiting the talk studies

193
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,360
the stock studies

194
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,720
have been started they are designed and

195
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,280
they're about to start

196
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,080
you know talk study takes quite a long

197
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:34,159
time to

198
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:35,199
complete and i have to say the fsa took

199
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,520
their very

200
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,478
pragmatic standpoint is okay we will

201
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:40,318
accept a

202
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:41,758
null food application even without a tax

203
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,720
study as long as the tax studies being

204
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,600
initiated

205
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,360
um i i think they've really realized

206
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,160
very well

207
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,960
that that the process of an old food

208
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,680
application

209
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:55,680
takes very long on the other hand it's

210
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,280
also being realized if you're taking the

211
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,000
products from the shelf you can take

212
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,679
away

213
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,038
the supply but you will never take away

214
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,360
the demand

215
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:05,279
so and that means the demand goes

216
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,598
underground and then you lose two

217
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:08,959
complete control so i think the ffa did

218
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:11,680
a very well job there

219
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:14,159
in regulating the market in order to try

220
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,720
to safeguard the consumer safety because

221
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,280
consumer safety is the most important

222
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,560
thing

223
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:21,839
there is and and we have to be sure that

224
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,560
the brands are in the market are

225
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:25,918
produced

226
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,639
in a food safe and correct way

227
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:29,439
okay interesting and do you consider now

228
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,960
to

229
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:32,639
is the hemp industry the same as the

230
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:34,318
cannabis industry to you in europe

231
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,840
are they completely separate in your

232
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,919
eyes

233
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:40,239
uh to my opinion the separate you know

234
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:40,799
if you mentioned with cannabis uh the

235
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,079
medical

236
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,000
uh marijuana and recreational marijuana

237
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:47,758
activities and with hemp you mean

238
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,399
industrial hemp because in the end both

239
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,439
are

240
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:53,120
related in the cannabis family but uh

241
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:55,759
if i speak about hemp i speak about

242
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:59,519
industrial hemp i speak about hand below

243
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,960
0.2 percent tsc

244
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:02,799
there are two different industries

245
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,799
medical and recreational are growing

246
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,598
mostly indoors indoor operation

247
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,319
have other distribution lines and full

248
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:11,199
focus on

249
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,479
on on on the cannabinoids psychoactive

250
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,319
or not

251
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:16,240
industrial hand for me is really the

252
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,680
total crop valuation so you can take the

253
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,360
leaves for for

254
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,879
extracting cannabinoids for the food

255
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,080
supplements

256
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,879
but you also take the seeds for food oil

257
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:28,240
protein powder and and the fiber for

258
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,400
many applications so

259
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,639
for me hemp is is it really different to

260
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:35,120
them than cannabis

261
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:36,559
okay and you guys have three different

262
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,879
uh

263
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,958
facilities for the agriculture of the

264
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:42,320
crop do you guys see yourself expanding

265
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,918
into different territories or do you

266
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,640
prefer the territories that you're in at

267
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:47,360
the moment

268
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:49,519
they facilitate the different processes

269
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,360
that the plant comes through

270
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,200
we have currently indeed three

271
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,440
facilities uh two decades

272
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,200
decortication facilities uh one in the

273
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,880
netherlands and one in romania

274
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,040
that's where the first step takes place

275
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:04,480
growing the hemp and

276
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:06,480
processing it into fiber and chives

277
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,240
that's we always do the growing we

278
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,240
always do 50 kilometers

279
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,519
around the factory in order to reduce

280
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,720
transportation

281
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,560
distances and costs and emissions

282
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,320
and marketing the fiber and the end

283
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:20,079
products we do around six seven hundred

284
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,120
kilometers around the facility so by

285
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,959
doing like that

286
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,200
you get like a telephone network you're

287
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,799
trying to cover the european market

288
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,959
so with having a plant in the

289
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:30,879
netherlands and one in romania currently

290
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:33,039
we have very good

291
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:35,600
coverage of the european market and the

292
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:37,679
part of the turkish market

293
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,879
the third facility is in the southern

294
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:41,679
part of germany

295
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:43,679
where we produce insulation material um

296
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:45,120
so the fiber is being transported to

297
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,120
to that place and they're being

298
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,360
transferred into insulation material but

299
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,480
insulation material is very

300
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:55,360
light it's only 35 kilos

301
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,039
per cubic meter and most of the seals

302
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,320
are in southern germany

303
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:02,480
and austria as being part of the

304
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,800
the the building systems they have there

305
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,200
it's more wood-based building

306
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:07,919
a prefabricated wood-based building

307
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,040
where a

308
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:11,838
natural fiber insulation product like

309
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:13,679
hemp

310
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,640
fits much better than any other

311
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,639
synthetic or mineral

312
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:22,000
insulation but we see

313
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,279
that as soon as factory has reached its

314
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
maximum capacity

315
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:27,278
and transportation distances to our

316
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,159
clients are increasing

317
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:31,679
we always look for opportunities to to

318
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:34,559
set up a facility there

319
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:35,439
as well to serve the market there but uh

320
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:37,439
for us always

321
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,120
important develop the market first

322
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,240
before you start growing and building a

323
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,519
factory smart business strategy

324
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,560
last thing before i let you go i know

325
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,399
you're a very busy man what's the big uh

326
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:50,000
trajectory upwards for hemp industry

327
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,360
over the next two three years what's the

328
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,639
one thing that you think is the most

329
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,039
exciting thing that's going to come

330
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:59,199
happening

331
00:10:55,039 --> 00:11:01,759
uh i think what i see happening is that

332
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,920
the the hype and i also almost sometimes

333
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:06,799
tend to think it's more craziness around

334
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:08,479
cbd will come down a little bit i don't

335
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:12,319
think that

336
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:15,680
that hemp uh growing for cbd only will

337
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,600
will survive or continue to grow

338
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:19,519
i think the switch will be made to the

339
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,879
total crop valuation more and more

340
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,120
and therefore you need the

341
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:25,519
infrastructure so you can't

342
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,959
practice total crop valuation if you do

343
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,879
not have a

344
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:30,399
professional decodecation facility in

345
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:33,600
your area so and

346
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,440
what i i said before but i i see

347
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,120
more and more initiatives coming up uh

348
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,480
trying also to capture the other revenue

349
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,560
streams so

350
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:44,240
um i think uh hemp

351
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:46,399
was a big crop in the past till the

352
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,360
prohibition came after prohibition it

353
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:51,440
was a lot of pioneering but i feel we

354
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,000
we are leaving the pioneering phase and

355
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:57,600
we are really entering into the majority

356
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,958
growing up phase and that in a couple of

357
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,519
years i think the area

358
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,799
of industrial hemp grown in europe and

359
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,240
other countries

360
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:07,039
will only increase more and more

361
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,759
especially as the positive effect hemp

362
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,399
can bring

363
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:11,278
on fighting the climate change and cold

364
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,440
fit

365
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:15,439
caused a lot of trouble for us i i do

366
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,560
realize that but i think also it helped

367
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,560
us

368
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:19,919
the people realizing that we have to

369
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:23,439
change the world and

370
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:27,120
let's say let us pick up this

371
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:29,760
opportunity we have for changing the

372
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,399
the the climate in a positive way and

373
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:34,480
getting a green recovery with hemp

374
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,078
that's a great way to end the show

375
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,680
having a low carbon footprint shall be

376
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:39,679
the main principle for every company i

377
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:41,120
think now in this modern day and age

378
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:42,559
mark you're a busy man i'm going to let

379
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,000
you get out of here thank you very much

380
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:45,359

381
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,120
