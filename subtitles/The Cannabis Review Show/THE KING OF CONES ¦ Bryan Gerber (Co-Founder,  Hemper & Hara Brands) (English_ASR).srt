pre-roll manufacturing arm where we

21
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:53,599

00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,600
million cones a month and combustibles

25
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,800
alike for the Cannabis industry

26
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,478
as

27
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:06,200
well okay very interesting you started

28
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:08,239
your company pretty early do you maybe

29
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,040
want to give us a little backstory of

30
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:12,839
how the company was founded the other

31
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,520
co-founders in the company and your uh

32
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,200
success pretty much from the start at

33
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:21,359
the origins of the company of course so

34
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:24,879
we incorporated in February of 2015 we

35
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:27,280
launched May 1st 2015 originally it was

36
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:30,078
a direct to Consumer subscription box

37
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,000
called the hemper box and then that more

38
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:35,239
into different products and then what we

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,680
did was we leveraged the subscription

40
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:38,839
box as kind of our Trojan Horse

41
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,280
marketing Outlet so we would develop

42
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,240
products put it in the subscription box

43
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,478
get feedback from thousands of consumers

44
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:47,359
overnight take that data and then go to

45
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:49,519
our distribution and Retail Partners

46
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:51,599
show them the feedback and then sell

47
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:55,759
them the products to put on the shelves

48
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:57,559
so uh in terms of the kind of almost

49
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,599
decade I've been on this journey that

50
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,118
was like the first four years of the

51
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:04,280
business business and then uh Midway

52
00:02:02,118 --> 00:02:06,200
through 2017 we got this interesting

53
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,280
opportunity to start producing pre roll

54
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,080
cones and kind of fast forign today

55
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:14,479
we're now at 14 or 15 manufacturing

56
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,160
sites 4,000 employees in India and we

57
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:18,959
produce about 100 million cones a month

58
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:23,159
for the market and so those are the two

59
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:25,360
divisions of hemper uh and Hara in its

60
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:27,439
nutshell yeah it's an incredible success

61
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,920
story even guys have some well-known

62
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:32,079
investors kind of gave you the first

63
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:34,479
investment it seems to be money well

64
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,519
spent on their side of things when it

65
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:39,079
comes to the pre-roll side of the

66
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:42,360
product category within cannabis was

67
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:44,800
this a a segment that you saw the annual

68
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,760
growth rate was going to be significant

69
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,560
did you notice that the technology was

70
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:50,679
either available in North America or in

71
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,800
Asia at a specific price point that made

72
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:56,840
this Market seem like a sensible thing

73
00:02:52,800 --> 00:03:00,959
to go after so I think if we follow uh

74
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:03,878
tobacco Trends right cigarettes are an

75
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,598
enormous Market uh you know billions and

76
00:03:03,878 --> 00:03:08,959
billions and billions if not quite

77
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:11,639
trillions a year in sales uh in terms of

78
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,239
sticks right and so with the pre-roll

79
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:16,958
segment the problem was there was no

80
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:20,280
real infrastructure set up for anyone to

81
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,080
really scale their pre-roll line and as

82
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,400
every company in the Cannabis industry

83
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,000
is trying to figure out what their

84
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,519
Coca-Cola beverage is on the shelf right

85
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,039
they needed real infrastructure so for

86
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:35,280
for example Brands like steezy you know

87
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:37,318
they go from they launch a product in

88
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,759
one market they want to launch in three

89
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:42,280
next month right there's no one who can

90
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:45,519
really help them and so we came in and

91
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:48,318
really designed our business as a

92
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:51,319
Solutions partner for the pre-roll

93
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:54,399
category and what we do is we

94
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:57,318
identify products and Innovation and

95
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,079
what the brands and msos and whoever it

96
00:03:57,318 --> 00:04:02,078
is wants to bring to Market we tell them

97
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:05,040
what's capable in terms of material

98
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:07,360
science glass ceramic paper whatever it

99
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:09,479
is and we guide them in terms of how

100
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,840
many of these can we make what's the

101
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:14,280
scalability of this skew before we even

102
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,358
go to producing things and so I think

103
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,279
that infrastructure was missing or

104
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:19,879
lacking from the industry because you

105
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:22,799
know a lot of things in this market are

106
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:24,399
reused or repurposed or whatnot and

107
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,759
really there wasn't that infrastructure

108
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:28,719
set up to scale any type of product line

109
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:30,879
in the pre-roll category so we've come

110
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,240
in within four or five years have

111
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:36,038
garnered over 30% of the market share

112
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:39,240
just from being a flexible you know

113
00:04:36,038 --> 00:04:41,560
under promise overd deliver partner for

114
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,478
everyone and it seems to be the business

115
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,280
practices that you guys have brought to

116
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:48,199
this sector I think has seemed to me to

117
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:50,079
be one of the differing factors that the

118
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:51,960
Cannabis industry has such a low barrier

119
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:54,240
to entry for an entrepreneur to get in

120
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:56,120
so those with real business Acumen who

121
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,120
spot the opportunity are are obviously

122
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,759
going to incel excel within their

123
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,439
individual sectors totally and you know

124
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:04,720
we started this company when we were 23

125
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:07,719
years old and we raised a few million

126
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,880
bucks when we were 25 years old and now

127
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,880
we're turning 33 in a couple months so

128
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:15,120
it's been a wild Journey trying to

129
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:18,279
navigate this industry and it's funny

130
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,879
none of the co-founders uh RJ Henry and

131
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:23,559
Tai we've never worked for anyone else

132
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:26,399
in our lives straight out of college

133
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:29,959
straight into this never had a boss and

134
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:31,879
just hustled her way through you know no

135
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:33,519
that's the way to do it take each

136
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:35,360
project and move on to the next bigger

137
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:37,879
and better one after each individual is

138
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,919
successfully completed yes no and I

139
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:43,240
think our differentiation of like our

140
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:45,240
capabilities for the partners you know

141
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,478
sometimes you know they always say I

142
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,319
always look at like a lot of startup

143
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:49,839
culture stuff they're like two is the

144
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:51,800
best and then if once you get three

145
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:53,758
founders it's gets a little messy and

146
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,000
then four ah nobody wants a four

147
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,879
co-founder team surprisingly in this

148
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,079
industry with all the different nuances

149
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,199
it worked out

150
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:03,519
yeah well I think good corporate

151
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:05,478
structure and everybody having a

152
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,079
specific discipline that they master I

153
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:09,240
think is how you build these proper

154
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:12,159
companies that have substantial growth

155
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,240
trajectories and and long-term longevity

156
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,439
when it comes to the technology side of

157
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,439
your pre-roll manufacturing do you guys

158
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:19,719
acquire technology and have it inhouse

159
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:21,478
or do you license it out to an

160
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:25,360
outsourced manufacturer who produce

161
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:27,159
based on orders and of those which of

162
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,720
the states in America do you think is

163
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:32,560
the best for pre-roll sales and is

164
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,599
Florida think gonna surpass whoever the

165
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,519
best currently is when it gets

166
00:06:34,598 --> 00:06:40,478
legalization totally so I believe for

167
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:42,879
our Market California is the biggest

168
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:44,399
right the second uh Florida is

169
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:47,839
definitely a great Market I like the way

170
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:50,359
they set it up I think it will be a uh

171
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:52,318
big Hub there for major companies and

172
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,038
Brands to flourish and develop out of

173
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,319
there especially with the MSO is kind of

174
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:58,399
being headquartered there a lot of them

175
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:03,039
uh I think

176
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:06,359
for the brands and products they're

177
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:08,759
still lacking in terms of what is

178
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,120
possible to bring to the market and so

179
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:13,280
we're helping guiding everyone exactly

180
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,399
like what's feasible because a lot of

181
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:17,000
people come to us after multiple

182
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:19,439
conversations and they go wait you can

183
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
put a logo on the paper and it's like

184
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:25,918
we're just printing on paper nothing

185
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,639
crazy there this is not science in terms

186
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:32,680
of Automation and Technology every cone

187
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:35,280
most cones if not 99% of cones in the

188
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:38,038
market are handrolled so you need a

189
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:40,519
labor Arbitrage we've brought in

190
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:43,120
semi-automatic equipment we've have

191
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:45,359
multiple Hedges on automation no one's

192
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,240
really figured it out right there's no

193
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,639
there's no you know kill shot at this

194
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,960
point or poison pill right where it's

195
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,478
what what's happening is a lot of

196
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:57,079
different folks out there are developing

197
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:58,719
technology and it's there the problem is

198
00:07:57,079 --> 00:08:00,000
it it takes a lot of money to develop

199
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,120
this because

200
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,158
The Fragile nature with the paper right

201
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:09,399
if you're working with cigarette paper

202
00:08:05,158 --> 00:08:10,879
18 20 25 GSM the thickness of the paper

203
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:13,839
it's much easier to automate that

204
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:18,280
because of the tensil strengths right

205
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:19,560
with r yo paper it's like 12 13 14 GSM

206
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:22,239
so when you run it through an automated

207
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:25,000
machine it can tear rip very easily it's

208
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,960
sensitive and fragile so no one's really

209
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,639
figured it out yet we obviously have

210
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:31,519
been you know we're at the Forefront of

211
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,519
it but it's still kind of an unknown

212
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:36,399
thing right

213
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,278
now and do you think that automation

214
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,839
technology is going to come along within

215
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:41,479
the next couple of years and somebody

216
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,719
will have proprietary technology who

217
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:45,399
will be the large scale manufacturer on

218
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:48,399
a on a global

219
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:51,399
scale possibly I think there's a

220
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:55,039
strategy to where these machines are

221
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:57,000
placed uh you know I think that with

222
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:59,759
lead times and shipping I think

223
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,720
everyone's moving to Vander managed

224
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:05,039
inventory in this industry they're they

225
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,720
have a lot of difficulty forecasting

226
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:09,120
figuring out how much product to bring

227
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,240
in all those different metrics that are

228
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,278
typical in you know normal cpg we can't

229
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,519
seem to figure it out in this industry

230
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:19,078
right and so everyone's moving to vendor

231
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:20,679
manage inventory just in time inventory

232
00:09:19,078 --> 00:09:22,519
they don't have the space to keep

233
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:24,159
pallets and pallets of cones they don't

234
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:26,720
want to keepy pallets and pallets of

235
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:28,919
cones they just want it to ship to every

236
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,879
state you know State site whatever it is

237
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:33,199
when ever they need it right so I think

238
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:35,679
that it's not going to just be one

239
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,120
company or one machine that becomes the

240
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:40,039
big all B you know 12,000 pound gorilla

241
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:43,480
I think it's going to be a lot of like

242
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:47,039
strategic relationships built along us

243
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:50,600
domestically for North America Europe

244
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:53,360
Asia as well so I think there's a hub

245
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,360
you know multiple hubs logistically

246
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,000
placed manufacturing hubs that allow for

247
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,879
a quicker delivery as opposed to a

248
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,958
larger scale manufacturing operation

249
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:07,200
correct when it comes to the future of

250
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:09,919
the industry are you positive on this

251
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,399
rescheduling to schedule three and if so

252
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:12,919
do you think it's a positive thing or a

253
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:15,399
negative

254
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:19,360
thing I think it's positive for my

255
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:23,200
business because I'm non-plant touching

256
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:25,320
I think that it's could potentially be

257
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,519
threatening or alarming or negative

258
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,760
towards people who have been in the

259
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,919
space who are in the medical side who

260
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:35,600
are in the rec side I think they like

261
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:38,240
the barriers because it's harder to

262
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,440
operate right and so if you make it

263
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,560
easier to operate more people will come

264
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,760
in but who are these people are they

265
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:48,199
good actors are they bad actors who

266
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:50,879
knows right and so I think for the

267
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,120
ancillary people it's great news for the

268
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:55,039
plant touching people yes maybe they get

269
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,799
more leniency on banking laws and all

270
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:58,679
those types of things and they can do

271
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:00,599
something with their cash but in terms

272
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:02,958
of competition coming in it's going to

273
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,278
open up the floodgates for big tobacco

274
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:08,518
big Pharma even though they're already

275
00:11:04,278 --> 00:11:10,159
in it even more so right yeah would seem

276
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:13,000
the most advantageous thing of schedule

277
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:14,759
3 will be the ability to create a

278
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,799
applied pharmaceutical ingredients with

279
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:21,000
these cannaboids and your own Blends and

280
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:23,519
formulations to Target AB c and d and uh

281
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,600
the capital required to play in that

282
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:30,200
field is is pretty small yes for

283
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,560
sure is there anything you guys have

284
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,278
planned when it comes to Europe uh for

285
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:36,239
your operation do you think that the

286
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:39,559
German Market is going to be a

287
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:42,799
player totally uh so we were just at in

288
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:45,879
toac in Germany a few uh months ago back

289
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:49,120
in September we are coming into Europe

290
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:50,720
with the hard brand side uh pretty

291
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,120
strong we're working through a bunch of

292
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,560
strategic relationships right now with

293
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,919
Distributors it's obviously very

294
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:58,000
fragmented because you've got 29

295
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:00,360
countries you've got the UK you've got

296
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,039
29 different languages is you've got 29

297
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:05,800
different personal you know it's every

298
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:09,559
country is different right so we are

299
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:11,479
coming in very humble asking for advice

300
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:13,198
meeting with certain Partners in

301
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:16,039
different regions we've have

302
00:12:13,198 --> 00:12:18,519
conversations going on with um you know

303
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:21,240
Spain Barcelona right uh we've got

304
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:22,839
France uh we've got Italy we've got

305
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,278
Germany we've got the Netherlands which

306
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,440
is obviously massive uh and so what

307
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:29,639
we're really doing is identifying you

308
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:33,560
know who are the right partners because

309
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:35,680
in Europe there's more customer profiles

310
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:39,000
than we have in the states so here in

311
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:41,359
the states we have SE convenience stores

312
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,519
smoke shops and dispensaries that sell

313
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:47,440
these products right in Europe you have

314
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:50,360
souer shops you got coffee shopssocial

315
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,680
clubs you've got tobacconist stores

316
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:55,480
you've got CBD shops you've got grow

317
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:57,479
Seed stores you've got actual smoke

318
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,879
shops and then you've got like smart

319
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,959
product shops so there's more customer

320
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:05,078
profiles in Europe than we have here and

321
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:08,039
each distributor in Europe specializes

322
00:13:05,078 --> 00:13:10,399
in a different channel so unfortunately

323
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:13,439
it's not just a plug and play it's more

324
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,879
of like in understanding the market

325
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,800
understanding who the right partners are

326
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,439
where are they strong which customer

327
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,240
profile because if I bet on one I'm

328
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,920
missing the other six profiles if I bet

329
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,440
on two I'm you know missing on four so

330
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:26,278
we're navigating it I think a little bit

331
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,160
smarter than what normally people would

332
00:13:26,278 --> 00:13:30,480
walk into they'd ship a bunch of product

333
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:32,759
to Europe get a 3pl and say we have

334
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,959
product available buy product that

335
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:37,439
doesn't work in Europe right when you're

336
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:40,039
talking about the euro versus the

337
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:43,240
dollar just as we think we don't even

338
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:45,000
think about 10 20 30 $40 anymore here in

339
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,440
the states right maybe even a 100 we

340
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,000
don't start thinking probably till about

341
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:54,800
50 60 70 $100 in the Europe $10 you're

342
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,159
thinking the same level 10 you're

343
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:59,039
thinking the same level as me at 100

344
00:13:57,159 --> 00:14:00,600
right for me to convince you to buy

345
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:01,958
something for $10 you're going to go

346
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,959
home later and see if you can buy it

347
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:05,638
online for

348
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:07,159
N9 it's just a different mentality so

349
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:08,919
we're coming in trying to be a very

350
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:11,198
humble approach understanding the

351
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:12,679
culture working with the Distributors

352
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:15,838
and the partners and making sure it's a

353
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:18,958
successful launch not just a run and Gun

354
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:22,000
approach and with Germany it's massive

355
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:24,879
the opportunity right and so we're super

356
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,799
excited to be at uh Mary Jane Berlin uh

357
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:28,919
in a few months in June we'll be at

358
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,919
spannabis in Barcelona here in three

359
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:33,639
weeks uh and then we're just going to do

360
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:35,479
the show run there and so yes we will be

361
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:37,799
launching very heavily in

362
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,639
Europe you guys have a very exciting

363
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:41,319
future outlined in front of you and no

364
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:43,799
