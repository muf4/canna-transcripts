long do you want to give everybody an

29
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:52,878
overview of

30
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:54,320
your time in the industry so far and

31
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:55,599
we'll kick out the topic one then after

32
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,079
that

33
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,000
sure yeah i'd say i probably started uh

34
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,719
in the industry here in canada

35
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,478
about 10 years ago now um was a

36
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,118
co-founder of a company called lyft

37
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:08,000
cannabis

38
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:10,400
in 2014 that started as a news and

39
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,239
review site for what was then the new

40
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,320
commercial medical cannabis program in

41
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,839
canada and really have just been

42
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:19,199
covering the cannabis industry

43
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,920
since then i spent two years when i left

44
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,040
lyft in

45
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,960
from 2018 to 2020 as a senior policy

46
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,640
advisor to health canada's

47
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,798
cannabis legalization and regulation

48
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,040
branch and worked with a very large

49
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,960
team there at both the development and

50
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,759
implementation of the new regulatory

51
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,839
regime

52
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,879
in 2018 and so that was a pretty

53
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,640
interesting time

54
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,280
and then when i left health canada in

55
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,079
2020 i got back into the media space

56
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,159
with a website called stratcan covering

57
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:47,839
just a different aspect of the

58
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,520
cannabis industry here in canada really

59
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,880
with a focus on a lot of the new license

60
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:53,920
holders

61
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:56,399
micro cannabis license holders for uh

62
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,719
especially so

63
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,718
okay amazing so as everybody watching be

64
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:02,319
able to understand this man has got a

65
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:03,438
a great experience in the industry and

66
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:04,959
hopefully going to be able to guide us

67
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:05,599
through the three topics for this week's

68
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,519
show so

69
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:09,199
first topic i want to talk about is

70
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:10,959
cannabis 3.0 in canada

71
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,280
is this going to be is there going to be

72
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,640
a cannabis 3.0 or was the release of

73
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,318
edibles and beverages

74
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:18,479
that's the what the market looks like in

75
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:20,839
cannabis or do you see a massive

76
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,399
another pivot coming sometime down the

77
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,479
line no no

78
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,760
in the sense that cannabis 2.0 was the

79
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:27,759
new uh

80
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,280
new products like edibles extracts and

81
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:31,679
topicals we won't really see

82
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,560
any you know cannabis 3.0 in that sense

83
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,599
where we'll see

84
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,439
any new products particularly when

85
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:38,878
people refer to cannabis 3.0 here in

86
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:40,318
canada i think they maybe are referring

87
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:42,079
to a couple different things

88
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:43,679
i think overall we're seeing an

89
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,959
evolution of the industry beyond the

90
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,959
sort of large

91
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,080
publicly traded companies to a lot more

92
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,400
small

93
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,760
private mom-and-pop uh companies so i

94
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,920
think in some sense that could be

95
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:55,120
cannabis 3.0 kind of a changing of the

96
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:56,639
playing field

97
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,640
at the same time we're also running up

98
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,238
on a three-year review of the cannabis

99
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:02,399
act later this year so

100
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,840
the cannabis act in canada was came into

101
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,920
force in october 17

102
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,360
2018 we're coming up on three years here

103
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,759
of october 17

104
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,360
2021 when the federal government will

105
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:13,120
implement a three-year review of the

106
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,920
regulations and we could potentially be

107
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,640
seeing some

108
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,439
some fairly major changes uh in the year

109
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:19,679
year and a half

110
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:21,439
following that review which you know you

111
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,000
could potentially call cannabis 3.0 as

112
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:23,519
well

113
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,680
but in terms of new product categories

114
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,280
we won't really see any anything new

115
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,719
um you know beyond some of the small

116
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,519
evolutions we're seeing now we're seeing

117
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:34,000
some

118
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,000
some new topicals some interesting um

119
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,959
strips uh i'm kind of losing my words

120
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:41,039
here for the

121
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,319
dissolvable strips um some things like

122
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:43,439
that in the medical space but for the

123
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:45,359
most part we're not really seeing too

124
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,039
many product evolutions

125
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,680
yeah well i definitely have noticed the

126
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:52,079
amount of craft

127
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,920
growers and different uh products that

128
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,840
are popping up out of canada then

129
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:57,280
it's great to see that it's happened to

130
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,640
beer already i don't see why it wouldn't

131
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,519
happen in cannabis across the

132
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,399
entire industry moving on to the second

133
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,000
topic which

134
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,840
i know a lot of people in ireland are

135
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,759
going to be uh pretty uh

136
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,280
adamant about being part of a bill

137
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:11,840
that's uh

138
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,158
brought to parliament over here

139
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,639
homegrown laws are these essential for

140
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:18,399
any bill do you see in a newly regulated

141
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,239
territory

142
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,679
personally i think it's very important

143
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,159
especially because you know the first

144
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,720
round

145
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,400
of regulations tend to set the stage and

146
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,199
so it could be very difficult to try to

147
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,679
ease

148
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,879
regulatory changes like that later on

149
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,918
and i really don't think there's any

150
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:33,680
good reason to not

151
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:35,680
allow home production i mean here in

152
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,079
canada we've got a four plant limit

153
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,199
uh in a few of the u.s states we've seen

154
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:41,359
up to i think six

155
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,720
or even eight plants and i think this is

156
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,319
you know a reasonable amount for a

157
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,400
person to produce at home

158
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,240
while at the same time you know creating

159
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:49,279
a clear delineation between personal

160
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,079
production and

161
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:53,359
illicit large-scale uh unregulated

162
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:54,560
production so i think it's very

163
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,280
important and i think it's also very

164
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,120
important

165
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:58,638
in terms of patients rights for

166
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,079
individuals to be able to grow their own

167
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,759
because when you know you're relying on

168
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:03,199
cannabis as a medicine

169
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,038
buying through the commercial system can

170
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,478
often be very costly

171
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:08,639
and so for those individuals who have

172
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:10,319
that ability and have that space to be

173
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,720
able to grow even just a few plants

174
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:13,839
for their own medicine i think it's very

175
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,960
important and i think that it's

176
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:17,918
something that should be

177
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:19,279
part of any piece of of legislation and

178
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:21,279
do you think that there should be a

179
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:21,918
license allocated to somebody who wants

180
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,799
to grow

181
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:26,639
or should it just be open to anybody who

182
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,280
decides they want to put their hand to

183
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,840
uh

184
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:31,279
this part of agriculture you know i

185
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,119
think there's a good argument

186
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,559
perhaps to be made on the medical side

187
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,079
that there need to be you know some sort

188
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,959
of authorization from a medical

189
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:38,800
professional or

190
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:40,079
from your physician but in terms of you

191
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,520
know non-medical

192
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:43,599
cannabis production i don't see any

193
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:44,560
reason for permit um you know i'm not

194
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,320
sure the laws

195
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,600
uh where you are but here in canada you

196
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:48,800
don't need to permit to you know to brew

197
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,720
your own alcohol or

198
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,400
you know to grow sunflowers in my yard

199
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,199
so i don't really think there's a need

200
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:56,560
for you know all of the extra regulatory

201
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,478
hurdles that would come with trying to

202
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,600
implement that kind of

203
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:03,360
permitting system and

204
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,840
how did canada set up their home grow

205
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,639
laws across the board was it strictly

206
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:09,279
illegal

207
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,240
uh or have have some of the different

208
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:12,719
territories

209
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,160
become legal yeah so canada when we

210
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,759
legalize cannabis uh

211
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,520
federally uh the federal government

212
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,560
allowed for up to four plants to be

213
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:20,478
grown uh per

214
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,600
household essentially and there's

215
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:23,038
there's some limits around it but

216
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,240
essentially that's that's the main limit

217
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:26,879
is for plants

218
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,280
um canadian law also allows uh provinces

219
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:30,240
to

220
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:31,839
uh add further restrictions to that and

221
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,519
so we've seen some limitations there's

222
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:36,079
one province i believe new brunswick or

223
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:38,560
nova scotia has some rules around

224
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:40,318
it having to be in a locked room here in

225
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,918
british columbia where i live you can't

226
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,560
have it in public view so you have to

227
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:47,198
have a say inside or in your backyard

228
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,000
we've seen two provinces now quebec and

229
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,800
manitoba have

230
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,240
both banned home production which the

231
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,000
federal government says is not their

232
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,759
right to to limit it to zero they could

233
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,918
limit to one but not zero

234
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,800
that's being fought in court uh the case

235
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:02,079
in quebec

236
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,360
was actually overturned in late 2019 but

237
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:04,719
the government immediately immediately

238
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,680
appealed it and we're waiting on that

239
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,360
appeal now

240
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,519
there's another court case in manitoba

241
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,160
that is challenging manitoba's ban as

242
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:12,240
well

243
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,160
i think the overall expectation is that

244
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,598
they will be successful in overturning

245
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,280
that but it's you know it's

246
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:19,038
it's still unknown and has not made it

247
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:20,879
to the courts yet but essentially

248
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:22,240
uh it's it's legal in canada we have a

249
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:23,680
couple provinces that are

250
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,199
claiming they have the right to ban it

251
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,478
and that's being settled in court at the

252
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,879
moment

253
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:30,000
and is that basically down to political

254
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:31,918
ideology in

255
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,279
terms of the places that are banning

256
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:36,560
versus not banning

257
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:38,959
do you see a more democratic

258
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,079
states or territories that have grow

259
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,318
laws compared to

260
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:44,000
let's say more conservative yeah i think

261
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,240
that's probably a fair perspective

262
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,839
um you know there are conservative-run

263
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,840
provinces that have allowed it

264
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:51,279
but quebec's uh current provincial

265
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:52,878
government tends to be uh fairly

266
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:54,000
conservative and fairly kind of

267
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,360
anti-cannabis they've made

268
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,800
some some of their politicians have made

269
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,520
some fairly anti-cannabis statements in

270
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,240
the past

271
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:02,560
they also raised their age of access to

272
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,680
25 it's the highest age of access

273
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,120
in all of canada um

274
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,639
manitoba the other province who has

275
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,360
banned it also has a very conservative

276
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,800
leadership

277
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,400
and so i think there's some sort of

278
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,560
anti-cannabis sentiment there

279
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:16,159
it also gets into some some issues that

280
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,478
go well beyond cannabis that have to do

281
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,840
with an ongoing push and pull between

282
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:21,279
provincial governments especially

283
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:23,038
conservative provincial governments and

284
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:25,359
the federal government in terms of

285
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:27,199
of their rights uh to to manage their

286
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,400
own affairs and so really i think it has

287
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,240
a lot more to do with that than

288
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:31,918
than even cannabis and like i say we're

289
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,519
seeing that uh courts

290
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:35,038
uh tend to agree that the federal

291
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,839
government has that sort of paramount

292
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:37,759
authority

293
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,399
uh to issue those rules that the

294
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:42,399
provinces can't push back on

295
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,320
okay perfect brings me into the last

296
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,159
territory that our last topic that i

297
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,399
wanted to talk to you about

298
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:50,399
advice to governments looking to allow a

299
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,839
medical or adulthood's market we've got

300
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,799
a couple of politicians lined up with

301
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,920
the show

302
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:57,199
ireland is a a new enough territory that

303
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:58,719
hasn't yet legalized it

304
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,759
we've got a medical cannabis program but

305
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,680
it's for six symptoms that

306
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:05,519
again is not reflective of the

307
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:06,239
population and even those people with

308
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,919
symptoms are

309
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,440
having to pay 10 grand a month to get

310
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:11,278
access to products so

311
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,360
what would be let's say the two biggest

312
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:14,720
tips if a politician was watching this

313
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,480
that you'd say

314
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,000
this is what a government should

315
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,320
implement if they were going to have a

316
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,480
cannabis industry

317
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,399
oh yeah that's a a big question i mean i

318
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,120
think stakeholder involvement really

319
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,120
engaging

320
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,399
all levels of the public um and and i

321
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,159
think it's important for cannabis

322
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,200
activists and advocates to recognize

323
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:33,679
that that you know

324
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,519
trying to get reach that consensus um

325
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:37,359
means engaging with people who maybe do

326
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,879
not agree with you and hearing from you

327
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,360
know

328
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,080
teachers and religious officials and and

329
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,759
public health

330
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,360
experts and law enforcement as well as

331
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:46,799
advocates and patient advocates and

332
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,080
legalization advocates so

333
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:49,759
engaging with the public and really

334
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,000
getting a good understanding i would

335
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:52,319
also

336
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,919
say data collection is very important

337
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,399
beforehand

338
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:58,000
so that you can build that baseline if

339
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,639
you want to be able to measure the the

340
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,480
success

341
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,159
of your program say five or ten years

342
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,759
down the road it's very important to

343
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:04,879
have that baseline data prior to

344
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:06,639
legalization so you have an

345
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:06,958
understanding of the effects of that law

346
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,519
have

347
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:11,278
you know has legalization increased use

348
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,879
uh has a decreased use that's something

349
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:14,399
that we're wrangling with here in canada

350
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:15,679
and it's still you know early days it's

351
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,078
still pretty difficult to

352
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,879
to tease that out but having that data

353
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:20,799
beforehand

354
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:22,320
has allowed us to at least have a bit of

355
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,919
a baseline and understanding what we're

356
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,519
working with

357
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:27,039
okay and tell me this we've talked to

358
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,639
some of the guys in colorado at the

359
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:29,039
marijuana enforcement division and the

360
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:31,439
kind of

361
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,879
bureau over in la did you guys have a

362
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,279
similar division

363
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:36,720
in canada how were license applied to

364
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:37,759
i'm sure everything went under national

365
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,920
license and excise

366
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:42,159
was there a department in canada that

367
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:45,838
delta is the buffer between applications

368
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:47,360
and going to excel license and excess

369
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,880
yeah in fact that's the branch i worked

370
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,039
with um at the time was the

371
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:53,360
uh health canada cannabis legalization

372
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:55,120
and regulation branch um it's now uh

373
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,800
it's changed its iteration a few times

374
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,120
but it's essentially health canada's uh

375
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:00,399
cannabis and drug branch now um they're

376
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,839
the the department they have several

377
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,879
different departments within that branch

378
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,800
that deal with

379
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:05,919
everything from license applications

380
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:07,599
going in and that's both on the

381
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:08,958
commercial as well as the personal and

382
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,519
commercial medical side

383
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:12,879
um you know review of those licenses uh

384
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,320
review of the regulations there's a

385
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:15,759
whole team now there that's working on

386
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,959
the review of those regulations that i

387
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:19,600
referred to earlier

388
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:20,078
uh so including stakeholder engagement

389
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,360
so it's

390
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:23,439
it's a very large department several

391
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,879
hundred people um in the build up to

392
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,240
those regulations they were engaging

393
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:27,759
with those other departments that you

394
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,200
you referenced as well in in different

395
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:31,360
legal states as well as

396
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,800
uh uruguay and countries in europe and

397
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,278
around the world so there's

398
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:36,719
uh constant sort of engagement with

399
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,399
their sister agencies

400
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,920
and that that department continues to

401
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,519
grow and i think will continue to grow

402
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:43,278
at least until

403
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,639
legalization maybe the industry has

404
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:46,240
matured to a place where maybe there

405
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,639
isn't quite a need for that that level

406
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,360
of oversight

407
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:53,039
okay and the last topic i kind of just

408
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,560
want to get a question on do you think

409
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:56,799
the canadian lps

410
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:58,078
are targeting europe as the main

411
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,679
customer base

412
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:00,879
for a lot of their products or do you

413
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:01,838
believe that they're going to be able to

414
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:04,559
crack america

415
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,160
once america legalizes statewide

416
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:07,759
investment will come in

417
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:09,519
mergers and acquisitions will happen

418
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:10,799
galore we'll have the one or two major

419
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,560
players in the country do you think the

420
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:13,838
canadian lps will be able to match the

421
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:16,879
use at us

422
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,480
companies when it's all said and done

423
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:21,200
yeah that's a good question i think up

424
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,600
until now um canadian lps have been

425
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,000
largely targeting um you know different

426
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,920
european countries with uh some level of

427
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,278
medical regulation uh australia is

428
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:30,240
another example of a country where

429
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:32,078
there's been some

430
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,680
some exports if you look at those

431
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:34,879
numbers honestly the export numbers are

432
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:37,120
pretty small and i think there's

433
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:39,919
probably an argument to be made that

434
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,799
you know that's largely uh about

435
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:43,120
stakeholder or

436
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:44,639
uh investor uh relations and trying to

437
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,078
show their footprint in a lot of other

438
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,200
countries even if it's not particularly

439
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:49,759
significant

440
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,040
uh the us is obviously you know the

441
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:52,639
golden goose

442
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:54,879
so to speak everyone would like to be

443
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,839
operating there it really depends on

444
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:59,838
what uh the u.s regulations end up

445
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,800
looking like is still a big unknown

446
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,120
will uh canadian companies be able to to

447
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:04,799
ship

448
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,799
product to us will they be able to set

449
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:07,919
up in the us it's still really unknown

450
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:09,439
and frankly i think we're probably

451
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:11,838
several years away from any kind of

452
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,279
functional federal even a medical system

453
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,000
much less a non-medical system in the

454
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:15,439
u.s but

455
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,200
that's certainly where the big companies

456
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,399
are looking and in terms of

457
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,240
of keeping investor hopes up

458
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,919
uh pointing to a new emerging markets

459
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,759
like that is you know kind of an ongoing

460
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:27,278
uh tactic

461
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:28,879
for the battle of the entrepreneur the

462
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:30,159
sun's up there on the hill i promise the

463
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:32,879
