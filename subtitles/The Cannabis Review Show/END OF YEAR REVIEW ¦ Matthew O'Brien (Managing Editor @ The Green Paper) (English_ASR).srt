in this occasion oh man we did it last

11
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:28,399
year so i think we're going to have to

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,400
make this an annual thing and you've had

13
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:32,399
a pretty great year with 4 p.m being

14
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:34,159
acquired and you're now on your way to

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,399
being one of the media center points of

16
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:38,238
this industry so congratulations on that

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,480
mate i think we've got a lot to cover in

18
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:42,159
the 15 minutes today

19
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:43,679
absolutely and i hope it's the the first

20
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,519
of many irish cannabis companies that

21
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:48,079
succeeded in this industry

22
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,440
yeah i have no doubt at all it'll be uh

23
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,799
there's a lot of good things to come in

24
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:52,238
this industry so

25
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:53,679
let's kick things off i kind of wanted

26
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:54,640
to keep it to 15 minutes so i'm going to

27
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,679
start up pretty simple and

28
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,679
straightforward we're going to do an

29
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,359
ender year review we're going to grade

30
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:02,238
north america and we're going to grade

31
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,000
europe from obviously regular grading so

32
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:05,759
i'm going to let you start if you want

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,760
me to start europe i'll give them a

34
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,680
grade and i'll give you my reasoning why

35
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,560
and then we can have a little discussion

36
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,080
as to see if we're both right

37
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,600
what are you kicking this off on just i

38
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:17,519
can get a sense as to what the format

39
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,839
would look like yeah cool well i'll

40
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,679
start off with europe so basically

41
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,520
we're going to give europe i think it's

42
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,680
a b plus to an a minus is what i'm

43
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,719
looking to achieve there's still a lot

44
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,400
of

45
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,478
muddy waters when it comes to the cb

46
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,240
industry but the leaps and bounds that

47
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:35,118
are happening are significant leaps and

48
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:36,640
bounds they're not just uh it kind of

49
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,719
drips and drabs and stuff germany

50
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,640
obviously legalizing what we'll get is

51
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:42,478
one of the biggest moments luxembourg

52
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,478
talking to doing it but the actual

53
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,560
weather coming in italy the made in

54
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:49,039
denmark products that are getting uh

55
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,560
licensed for sale so the acquisitions

56
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,200
that are happening the listings that

57
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,640
happened in the uk um as much as they're

58
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,240
not part of europe anymore we're going

59
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,040
to consider them part of europe for the

60
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,478
discussion um so yeah i think there's a

61
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,240
lot to be positive about in europe

62
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:03,599
there's been massive strides ahead i

63
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:05,599
think a lot of the

64
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,359
north american brands i saw a lot of the

65
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:09,439
finance calls and shareholder meetings

66
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,280
where they're adding a billion valuation

67
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:12,959
on the german market and kind of adding

68
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,719
this to future earnings of capital which

69
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,319
i think is a bit ahead of themselves

70
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,000
they've got a stiff battle against a

71
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:19,359
couple of the european brands that we

72
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,280
all know that are going to be here

73
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,280
fighting for this territory they're not

74
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,318
just going to walk in and automatically

75
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,120
be able to make market shares so i think

76
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:30,560
there's a a lot of positives ahead maybe

77
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,599
north american companies might be

78
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,519
getting a little bit ahead of it

79
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:35,280
themselves about the potential for

80
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,959
europe because as i said it's not just

81
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,360
an open goal they're going to have some

82
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,199
stiffs of competition by some highly

83
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,120
knowledgeable people that might be very

84
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:45,919
visual at the moment but are in the

85
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,640
background doing the work and putting in

86
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:50,639
the legislation uh framework for

87
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:51,839
everything that works uh

88
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,639
well for them so what do you think do

89
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,479
you agree a minus b plus

90
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:57,518
yeah i think so i i'm with you i think

91
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:59,598
there's there's certainly room for

92
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,120
improvement as there always is but i

93
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:03,518
think it's been a very important year

94
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,280
for the european cannabis industry and

95
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,360
i really get the sense that europe is is

96
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,878
really putting the foot down on the

97
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,760
pedal such that they can they can catch

98
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:13,280
up with our neighbors in north america

99
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,639
yeah no i couldn't agree with you more

100
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,199
as i said there's still a lot to do and

101
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:19,279
there's still a lot of uh

102
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,878
tape to pass and you can see over in

103
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,039
ireland here a lot of the cbd products

104
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:24,479
getting stopped at customs and taken off

105
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:26,079
the shelves so you can see this

106
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:27,280
happening across europe and people that

107
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,200
are talk to so there seems to be

108
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,959
something happening in the background to

109
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:32,479
allow let's say the

110
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,239
companies that have already got approved

111
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,679
let's say some of them got novel food

112
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,959
applications approved they're using

113
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,319
synthetic cannabinoids so with all due

114
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,920
respect to the companies that are

115
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,399
getting their products stopped this is

116
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,679
the way the free markets work the these

117
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,200
companies have spent the money they've

118
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,480
got their their foot in the door now so

119
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:49,759
it's up to you to be able to compete

120
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:51,759
against them

121
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:53,840
if there is a competition to be had

122
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:55,759
there would you agree

123
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,438
absolutely like like it or hate it

124
00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:00,000
that's the conditions which are all

125
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:01,759
subject to and it's a free market anyone

126
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,680
and everyone can apply for those those

127
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:05,120
certifications and

128
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,280
this right this industry is going to be

129
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,120
regulated to death for many many more

130
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,878
years to come so if anyone is deterred

131
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,000
by the current sort of regulatory

132
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:13,438
environment i think it's a good

133
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,280
opportunity just to

134
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:16,159
perhaps take notice that potentially

135
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,358
there's another industry you want to

136
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,120
participate in because this is the

137
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,238
future of cannabis for better or worse

138
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,240
it's going to be regulated and

139
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:25,359
over-regulated for many many years to

140
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,960
come so all in all progress but a good a

141
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,400
good uh

142
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:30,159
a good insight for any entrepreneurs who

143
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:31,679
are potentially seeking to seeking to

144
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,120
get a piece of this pie that this is

145
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,959
just the environment you have to grow

146
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,720
accustomed to operating within

147
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,239
yeah creating the brand is going to be

148
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,960
secondary in europe it'll be about

149
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,280
regulatory framework industry nuances

150
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:45,519
how different territories uh operate

151
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:47,279
within the rules and framework so it's

152
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,198
not like north america where brands came

153
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,879
first and foremost so let's move on to

154
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,040
north american let's give us give me

155
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:53,839
your grade on how uh

156
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,360
will

157
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:56,560
do you want to do canada and america

158
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,840
separately or do you want to bunch them

159
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,120
in together

160
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,478
yeah certainly i'll i'll see if i can do

161
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,800
a bit of a separation because i think

162
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:05,120
they are quite different markets

163
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,360
in in the case of canada on i give

164
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,120
canada a b plus and i think it's

165
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,879
important to separate what's happening

166
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,079
in the cannabis stock market versus

167
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:14,719
what's actually happening in the

168
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:16,079
canadian cannabis market because

169
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,199
ultimately

170
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:20,800
a lot of the attention is diverted to

171
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,400
the larger canadian cannabis companies

172
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,400
whether that's a company like tilray or

173
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:25,918
aurora or canopy growth and

174
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:27,599
ultimately they've failed to meet

175
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:29,680
expectations for the last two years in

176
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,600
the industry they made

177
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,199
wildly ambitious promises to their

178
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,439
investors as the percentage of market

179
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,560
share that they could capture and a lot

180
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:38,079
of these companies are coming to the

181
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,918
realization that the products they're

182
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:42,399
producing are simply inferior in

183
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:44,879
comparison to craft cannabis however

184
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,719
ultimately if you look at the the mark

185
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:48,879
as i said as opposed to the stock market

186
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,479
we have seen a huge increase this year

187
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:51,519
in total sales of craft cannabis

188
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:54,079
products my understanding is that it's

189
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,599
nearly up 10x year-to-date now granted

190
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:57,199
that did start at a pretty low point

191
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,199
because craft cannabis producers were

192
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,919
only eligible to bring their products to

193
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,840
market within the last 24 months so

194
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:05,918
granted it did start at a small base

195
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:07,359
however that's been a huge success story

196
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:08,959
in the last year

197
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,240
that's not brought us to a point whereby

198
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:11,918
a lot of these larger companies are

199
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,439
really having to evaluate which

200
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:14,879
particular categories of cannabis

201
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:17,199
they're focusing on and ultimately we're

202
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:18,800
starting to see a much more

203
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,800
mature cannabis industry in canada

204
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,639
whereby producers are starting to

205
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,160
really focus on particular form factors

206
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,639
as opposed to trying to be all things to

207
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,160
all people so generally i'd say canada a

208
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,240
b plus i think they've done a great job

209
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,720
of the role of you know 2.0 products

210
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,079
whether that's beverages edibles etc i

211
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,520
still think there's a lot of room for

212
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:37,120
improvement in canada in certain

213
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,560
provinces cannabis retailers still

214
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,240
aren't actually able to perform

215
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,160
e-commerce sales in the world we live in

216
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,000
that is just a necessity for for any

217
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,319
business so that's definitely a

218
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
potential sort of room for improvement

219
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,680
for for canadian regulators and

220
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,120
hopefully in the upcoming review of the

221
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,439
the cannabis act that will be somewhere

222
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,879
on the top of their priority list

223
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,879
in the case of the united states i think

224
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:58,800
it's very much a mixed bag i would

225
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,240
generally say like maybe a c plus is

226
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,120
probably a fair grade for the

227
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,360
performance of that market this year we

228
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,800
have seen three bills that are currently

229
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,199
in place which would effectively

230
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,319
legalize cannabis at a federal level

231
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,240
and

232
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,919
albeit we could consider that progress

233
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,519
we are seeing a certain fragmentation of

234
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:17,038
the democratic party whereby you have

235
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:18,799
the majority leader of the senate chuck

236
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:20,800
schumacher who is saying that he will

237
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,800
literally oppose any bill which is not

238
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,079
his bill such that he can potentially

239
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,919
capture the political points of

240
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:27,918
legalizing canada so i think

241
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:30,159
right now in the states cannabis has

242
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:32,799
very much become front and center of

243
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,560
politics and that is that is definitely

244
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,079
a good sign and i think inevitably it

245
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,680
will result in the federal legalization

246
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:38,959
of cannabis however

247
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,879
and i'd like to get your perspective on

248
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,318
this i don't think it's a good thing

249
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:43,918
whereby

250
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,160
there are too many politicians in a

251
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:47,758
single party who are actively competing

252
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,599
against one another to sort of get the

253
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,520
political points associated with passing

254
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:52,959
this legislation

255
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:55,359
yeah well i think the way i look at

256
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:58,159
america is there's been sizable gains in

257
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,759
the the state level in terms of the

258
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,520
growth of the market share obviously

259
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,919
federal legalization is still the big

260
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:05,120
domino effect to happen but i think what

261
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:06,719
you've got happening now is the

262
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,399
posturing between the democrats and the

263
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,000
republicans they can see the capital and

264
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:12,000
the finance and the markets are moving

265
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,079
in this way and it's now going to be

266
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,918
like we want the pat on the back coming

267
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,519
into election you can seize and who's

268
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:19,439
going to be able to hold this cherry and

269
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:22,079
say that they got the young voter they

270
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,279
got the the new millennial vote out with

271
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:25,519
this uh

272
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,119
move so as i said i think it's a great

273
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:30,000
sign the fact that both parties are put

274
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,759
in in papers for an industry is an

275
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,200
amazing thing one of them are going to

276
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,120
be the other you've now got them

277
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,519
absolutely actively competing with each

278
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,200
other for the industry's benefits so

279
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,038
yeah i think i'd agree with you in

280
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,440
america it's still a lot to be done in

281
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:45,120
in that territory but uh big gains had

282
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,320
this year as well

283
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,600
uh a few other points i'll highlight in

284
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,600
that one so

285
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,440
a few really interesting statistics so

286
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,440
cannabis is now the fifth

287
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,959
largest cash crop in the united states

288
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,000
so of all the crops in their

289
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:59,759
agricultural uh industry cannabis is now

290
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,440
that the fifth most valuable crop and

291
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:03,679
that's just like determining the the

292
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,880
wholesale revenue like the the revenue

293
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:06,879
being generated from farmers selling it

294
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:09,039
to retailers additionally sales are

295
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:10,958
going to surpass 22 billion dollars this

296
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:12,799
year in legal cannabis sales like how

297
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:14,559
outrageous is it that you know 22

298
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:15,838
billion dollars in legal cannabis sales

299
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:17,838
despite the fact that it's federally

300
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,360
legal and to your point we now have two

301
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,120
political parties who are competing

302
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,399
against one another so i can only

303
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,080
believe that this is going to act as a

304
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,600
further catalyst to decrease the

305
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,720
timeline for which federal legalization

306
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,639
will occur

307
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,519
and ultimately when that does occur i

308
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:31,199
think we're just going to see the

309
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,399
floodgates truly open like what we've

310
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,040
seen up until this point has been

311
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,639
fantastic but once you have interstate

312
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:38,079
commerce and cannabis brands in

313
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:39,759
california are able to start shipping

314
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,639
their products you know from west coast

315
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:44,480
to east coast i think we're going to see

316
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:45,838
an enormous amount of cash flow into

317
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,519
this industry and i think all that we've

318
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,959
seen to date will really be sort of i

319
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,399
don't want to say insignificant but i

320
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,838
think it will seem a little bit

321
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,519
insignificant as to what will likely

322
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,040
follow in the the four years that will

323
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,639
come after that

324
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:58,079
yeah now i couldn't agree with you more

325
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,319
i think the biggest one of them all is

326
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,480
the new york legalization it's going to

327
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,440
jump into the second their third biggest

328
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,720
industry in america if not tying with

329
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,959
california but i think the most

330
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,879
significant thing is that it's so close

331
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:13,679
to europe in terms of perception by

332
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:15,759
europeans in terms of irish people and

333
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:17,439
in terms of business people in new york

334
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:19,039
a lot of them have bases over here in

335
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,519
europe whereas california companies and

336
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:24,078
colorado companies necessarily don't so

337
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,919
i think just that close proximity to a

338
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:27,519
market that's going to explode and it's

339
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,360
going to prove that the capital gains

340
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,278
and the job creations are there is

341
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,839
another positive for europe to be able

342
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:35,600
to watch and see and uh have the

343
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,120
influence come over the politicians and

344
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,360
decision makers over here because

345
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,600
whatever you can be naive as you want

346
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,039
capital moves everything and the capital

347
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,959
hasn't been able to get into these

348
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:47,679
markets yet and a lot of the capital is

349
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:49,679
situated in new york so i think it's

350
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,199
going to be an interesting year to say

351
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:52,879
the least from march next year when

352
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,640
everything kicks off kicks off over

353
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:56,879
there

354
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:58,199
absolutely and to really tie a boat on

355
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:01,120
that like right now

356
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,399
321 000 people have paid full-time

357
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,320
employment in the legal cannabis

358
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,839
industry in the united states like that

359
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,000
is the outrageous amount of employment

360
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,519
that industry is now providing and again

361
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,440
despite the fact that cannabis remains

362
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,039
federally illegal so very excited about

363
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,000
what's happening on the state level and

364
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,360
hopefully when we're having this

365
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,720
conversation next year there might be a

366
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,320
little bit more progress made on the

367
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,079
federal legislation

368
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,440
yeah fingers crossed now fingers crossed

369
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:22,639
so we're going to move on to the next

370
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,440
section we're going to pick two of the

371
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:26,639
biggest moments of 2021 each we've only

372
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,040
got like four or five minutes we can

373
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:30,799
stretch over maybe a minute past it um

374
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:32,078
but yeah i'm going to keep it to that

375
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:34,719
there's the kind of way gonna put there

376
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:36,879
behind me so um yeah i'll take kick

377
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,160
things off so two of the ones that i'm

378
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:39,519
gonna go we had a little discussion

379
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:41,199
before and i think we agreed and

380
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,679
everything for but the big one for me is

381
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,240
the jazz acquisition of gw pharma for

382
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:47,919
seven point four billion dollars it

383
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,519
started the hawk of it was back in

384
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:51,360
february but it was confirmed in may

385
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,519
when it went through the listing so i

386
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,079
think that's such a significant play

387
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,839
especially coming from a uk company that

388
00:11:56,078 --> 00:11:59,359
supposedly wear a territory where it's

389
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,680
completely illegal they're the second

390
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,839
biggest manufacturer or exporter of

391
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,599
medic cannabis in the world and it's

392
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,360
just one of those funny scenarios that

393
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,600
you really got capital in the markets

394
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,600
now over this side of the water not just

395
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,120
in the u.s so that's going to be the big

396
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,560
moment for me number one what about you

397
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,320
for my cell phone i'd have to highlight

398
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:21,199
the fact that germany is now on course

399
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,200
to legalize cannabis like

400
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,040
having having lived in ireland for the

401
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,160
better part of my life and having a

402
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:29,679
decent understanding as to how how

403
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:32,559
certain legislation is crafted by

404
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:34,399
politicians in in the eu

405
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:36,638
i have to

406
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,879
i have to the sense that there is going

407
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,399
to be significant ramifications of a

408
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:42,240
nation state like germany legalizing

409
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,000
cannabis ultimately leap frog in the

410
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,200
united states were by you know colorado

411
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,919
first aid to legalize cannabis for

412
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,399
allergies purposes back in 2012 so they

413
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:52,240
had a 10-year head start despite that

414
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,440
the germans have caught up it looks like

415
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,600
they're going to be

416
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,079
the first sort of major european nation

417
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,600
to effectively embrace the adult use or

418
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:01,838
the outlet whose cannabis market so for

419
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,480
me that that's the top moment of 2021

420
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,680
and

421
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,360
i get the sense that that is going to

422
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:07,278
have huge ramifications for for the

423
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,519
european market and hopefully hopefully

424
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:11,200
our our politicians in ireland are uh

425
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,200
are taking note as to what our german

426
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,879
counterparts are putting in place

427
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,399
yeah well i think you agree once you've

428
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,759
got germany going in

429
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,120
everything goes according to plan there

430
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:21,039
and i've interviewed the top of the top

431
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,200
companies in germany some of the top

432
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:25,360
lawyers the people in that industry are

433
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,440
razor sharp i think that's going to be a

434
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,560
big big big success in germany there's

435
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,920
no

436
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:31,119
flesh on the bone on any of the

437
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:32,719
companies i've talked over there

438
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,919
everybody's very precise to know what

439
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,759
they're doing they're as up to date as

440
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:37,838
any territory in the world and i think

441
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:39,679
that triggers and france to happen when

442
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,120
you get france and germany doing

443
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:42,879
anything in europe it's pretty much a

444
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,480
landslide across the board everywhere

445
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:46,399
else like what we're saying in the

446
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,560
previous conversation the markets will

447
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,559
then be alive where the m a's happen

448
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:53,198
where the new territories for growth so

449
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:56,159
i think yeah a great one so my second

450
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:57,278
one then i i'm i'm chosen between two of

451
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:58,879
them and i don't know what you're going

452
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:01,519
to pick the other one so it's either

453
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:04,639
between amazon changing their cannabis

454
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:07,360
employee policy or the ufc change in

455
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,440
their cannabis employee policy either

456
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,039
way a massive sporting firm which kind

457
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,040
of opened the floodgates to the nfl and

458
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:16,799
a couple of orders to stop cannabis

459
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:19,599
testing for thc and not ban athletes and

460
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:22,159
also amazon uh triggering then what

461
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,920
allowed apple to stop banning their apps

462
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:26,879
on their app store and it was kind of

463
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:29,198
big tech and sport both aligned with uh

464
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:30,879
lifting the ban on cannabis so what are

465
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:32,958
you gonna go for your second one just

466
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:34,799
out of curiosity

467
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:36,958
i'm gonna i'm gonna piggyback on your

468
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:38,159
your suggestion regarding amazon and

469
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,759
apple

470
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:41,360
the fact that the two most valuable

471
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:42,559
companies in the world like literally

472
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,600
the two most valuable companies in the

473
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:46,000
world

474
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,159
both updated their policies in favor of

475
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,519
cannabis this year to me just speaks

476
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:50,319
volume to the progress which is being

477
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,480
made

478
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,160
as to the fact that

479
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,519
previously the misconceptions associated

480
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:57,439
with cannabis was i think we're now

481
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,519
reaching a point thankfully whereby

482
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,040
people are aware that cannabis is not

483
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,078
the the dangerous drug it was once made

484
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:04,319
out to be

485
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:05,679
and consequently you have companies like

486
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,240
apple and amazon who are starting to

487
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:09,439
take note of that in america there's 68

488
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,079
of the population are in favor of

489
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,839
legalization and with labor shortages

490
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:15,679
they're identifying that in order for

491
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,839
them to retain and attract the highest

492
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:19,838
quality people to their companies they

493
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,519
have to update their policies such that

494
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,959
they are taking a more sort of

495
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,320
progressive

496
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:26,559
position when it comes to cannabis so

497
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,160
for me that is a huge milestone for the

498
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:29,919
cannabis industry we don't have

499
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:32,000
companies that are able to actually list

500
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:33,278
apps on the app store that's a little

501
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,320
bit important but to me it's just the

502
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:35,519
fact that the two most valuable

503
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,120
companies in the world have both

504
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,480
simultaneously started embracing

505
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,240
cannabis just tells a very sort of very

506
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,839
interesting tale as to the progress this

507
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,959
industry has made in the the last number

508
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,320
of years

509
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:48,479
yeah i don't know if you remember from

510
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,560
last year one of our top five things was

511
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,440
jay-z getting into it so is the

512
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:55,039
celebrity world embracing cannabis so 12

513
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,040
months later we've got the biggest tech

514
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:59,278
companies in the world

515
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,799
so it's a pretty good it's a pretty good

516
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:03,600
year as much as there's been a lot of

517
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:05,120
shows and uh garbage being spewed

518
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,199
by a lot of people who aren't as

519
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,720
informed as they should be

520
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:11,039
absolutely

521
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,278
i think that's definitely coming to an

522
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:14,319
end thankfully i i think the the sort of

523
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:16,240
the

524
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,560
fear-mongering we've seen a lot less of

525
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,079
it this year

526
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:21,518
that's going to continue to decline as

527
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:23,278
more people have access to the

528
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,560
information which ultimately informs us

529
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:25,679
the fact that this is a very safe

530
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:27,518
substance

531
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:29,198
yeah well we've had some of the biggest

532
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,440
review and episodes on this show now

533
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:34,639

head of uh neurology in toronto medical

537
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,639
you know what i mean so you can you can

538
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:46,078
only refuse and have these arguments so

539
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,000
long before you start looking like a

540
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:51,278
crazy person in the world i think we're

541
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,278
really going to the other inflection

542
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,800
