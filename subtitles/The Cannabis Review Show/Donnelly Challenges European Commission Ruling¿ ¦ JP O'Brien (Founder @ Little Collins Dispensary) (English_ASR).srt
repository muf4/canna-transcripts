00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:11,919
welcome everybody to the cannabis review

00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,320
i'm delighted to be joined by this

4
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:15,839
episode jp o'brien is the co-founder of

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,359

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,719
locations around ireland how are you

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,800
keeping jp

8
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,719
g'day owen how are you very well thanks

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,080
i'm very well mate so basically we had

10
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:25,919
this episode just to kind of go over

11
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:27,518
stephen donnelly's recent backtracking

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,840
on the legislation the european

13
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:31,439
commission have brought forward so can

14
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:34,320
you give us your overview so far what

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,439
you know jp of the situation

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,878
yeah so owen what's happened here is the

17
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:42,000
the article that came out during the

18
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:44,238
week um although really poorly worded

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,280
was essentially highlighting the fact

20
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:49,679
that the current government is indeed

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,079
challenging i guess the um the european

22
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:54,238
court of justice cannavape decision

23
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,280
and this is to do with hemp cannabis

24
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:59,119
with 0.2 or less cbd

25
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,558
um and it's to do with the ongoing high

26
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:01,759
court proceedings here in ireland so

27
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:03,038
that would be our company and there

28
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:04,478
would be a number of other companies

29
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,879
that are going through

30
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:08,959
their own legal proceedings in order to

31
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:10,798
have the legislation sorted out

32
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:13,039
but mate what this means

33
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,479
sort of you know in normal language is

34
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,118
that

35
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:20,400
the governments believe that hemp

36
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:22,719
cannabis with 0.2 or less

37
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,880
i.e what our company and many other

38
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:26,959
companies have been providing the irish

39
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:29,118
people for the last three years

40
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:32,319
they believe that it is against the

41
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:33,680
public health for this product to be

42
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:35,919
supplied to

43
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,159
supply to people and they would like to

44
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,400
medicalize or pharmaceuticalize this

45
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,200
product um and

46
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,359
that's where it stands

47
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,600
okay so basically we've had a couple of

48
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:50,478
articles whether steven donnelly a year

49
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:53,280
or so ago said that he was open to some

50
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:55,759
sort of legislation happening now i

51
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,599
found some information that basically we

52
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,959
had um

53
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:02,959
luke flanagan asked questions in the

54
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:05,919
european council about this in april

55
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:07,438
2021 basically saying that can anybody

56
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,360
give an answer why the european

57
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,919
government are going against the

58
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,520
european commission ruling boy bannon's

59
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:16,799
sale of cbd goods so we found this reply

60
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,599
so this is from the european

61
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,160
commission's database themselves and it

62
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,439
basically is from a lady by the name of

63
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:24,878
miss stella

64
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:27,280
kiriakide so i don't want to be

65
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,878
butchering her name but she's basically

66
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,840
the commissioner for health and food and

67
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:32,159
safety

68
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,560
so this basically says from what we can

69
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:36,639
make all sense of that

70
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,640
they did say this but it's only each

71
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:39,839
individual state can then come to their

72
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:41,598
own ruling

73
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,280
and decide on this do you think this is

74
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:45,439
a case of lobbying from the

75
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,519
pharmaceutical industry have now finally

76
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:49,359
gotten to the politicians and they've

77
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,480
slowly started to change their mind on

78
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,080
the topic

79
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:54,560
well it's interesting you say that owen

80
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,080
because we're literally we're about four

81
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,759
weeks away from little collins

82
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,920
three-year anniversary right of actually

83
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:02,959
opening our doors three years ago this

84
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:04,719
time um in 2018 we were already selling

85
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,719
online and

86
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,080
look it's been said many times before

87
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,759
but um

88
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,000
every single arm of the government at

89
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:14,799
that at that point every single arm of

90
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,039
the state was totally fine with it so

91
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,719
what what actually happened is

92
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:22,878
in 2000 and 2018 a grassroots hemp

93
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:23,840
cannabis industry sprung up in ireland

94
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:26,318
right

95
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,439
via a lot of existing operators

96
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:31,039
um and some new operators like ourselves

97
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:33,840
and what the government was asleep at

98
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:36,479
the wheel this product is legal in

99
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,479
europe but they didn't have their act

100
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:40,560
together and suddenly then a year or two

101
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:43,119
later they've gone hang on a minute

102
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,878
we'd really like a piece of that

103
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,480
we'd really like to get that product and

104
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:48,158
take it and give it to our partners over

105
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:50,479
here how are we going to do that

106
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:53,919
no no this is against the public health

107
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:56,238
0.2 percent any thc is dangerous we need

108
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:58,238
to take this and we need to give it to

109
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,200
the pharmaceutical companies and start

110
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,200
again that's what's happening

111
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,598
against the public health is kind of i

112
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:07,839
mean anyone knows that this this product

113
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:10,238
is not dangerous so so what's happening

114
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,200
is an exercise in control it's an

115
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:16,079
exercise in um you know policy on the

116
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,519
run and quite frankly mate as you say

117
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,280
there is lobbying happening there's

118
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,600
lobbying happening from huge overseas

119
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:24,719
companies and um it's an exercise in

120
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,479
private interest dictating public policy

121
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,080
yeah well i think i've been doing a

122
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:29,519
number of interviews and mapping around

123
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,039
europe the different industries

124
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,079
different territories who's big and

125
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,000
who's not

126
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:36,240
excuse me and what i can seem to notice

127
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,439
is that the major players in europe at

128
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,439
the moment are the biggest

129
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:43,040
pharmaceutical hubs so denmark malta

130
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:44,879
these are all places with a big

131
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,199
pharmaceutical uh manufacturing

132
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,120
facilities already in place so it might

133
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,639
be just coming to the stage where the

134
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,918
pharma guys are ready to now get into

135
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,240
the market and they'll just start to

136
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:55,918
flex their muscles

137
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,240
but i mean i guess i guess what's missed

138
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:00,240
throughout all of this is um

139
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,160
this industry needs to be harmonized

140
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,600
from you know crop to shop and what's mr

141
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,759
at all of this is the farmers and the

142
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,479
ecological debate but you can't get to

143
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,479
that unless you can just get rid of um

144
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:12,560
the kind of confusion

145
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:14,800
and and really nonsense um that's

146
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,800
happening right now i mean

147
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,478
i've without going into the high court

148
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,800
proceedings i've had a a good look at um

149
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:24,399
at their argument and in my opinion it's

150
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,240
a house of straw you know it's a house

151
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:27,679
of cards i should say and it doesn't

152
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,519
stand up so

153
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,160
really we need to take it one step at a

154
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:34,959
time um why this issue has come up

155
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,520
recently is because of paul murphy td

156
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:39,359
obviously asking donnelly there in in

157
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:41,918
the door but really it's just

158
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,000
highlighting the duplicitous nature of

159
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:45,120
these tds i think it was martin's world

160
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,759
that came out during the week and

161
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,478
reminded everyone that donnelly himself

162
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,240
when he wasn't a td was he was all for

163
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:54,240
cannabis let's have a little bit of

164
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,400
cannabis it's all safe it's all cool i'm

165
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,918
cool i'm this cool guy and that was the

166
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:58,959
that was the full strength cannabis so

167
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:01,120
to speak

168
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:03,758
now that it comes to cannabis light oh

169
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:07,120
no no oh no no we can't do that we need

170
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,800
to uh get that off the table so look it

171
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,240
i mean it's at the stage for for me

172
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,439
where it's it that's you know i don't

173
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,639
want to treat it lightly but it is a bit

174
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:15,038
of a joke

175
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,240
um and it's a it's a it's a strategic

176
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:20,000
war at the moment it's a war of

177
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,160
attrition um the the daily battle to run

178
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,959
this business i cannot even

179
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,639
and

180
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:26,638
any operator would be the same running a

181
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,478
hemp cannabis business in this country

182
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,199
right now is a battle it's not a

183
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:33,918
business it's a battle

184
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,520
yeah and i think it might become sterner

185
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:37,198
before it gets easier let me ask you

186
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,599
this question if it does become let's

187
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,919
say medical grade regulated would you

188
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,000
still use this product in

189
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:45,359
your uh your own stores and your

190
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,120
products or do you feel that it would be

191
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,199
an inferior product

192
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,120
well we wouldn't be able to because we

193
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,919
we wouldn't be able to get use the royal

194
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,800
product the raw product would be off off

195
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:58,959
limits for anyone but you know uh you

196
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,120
know a licensed sort of medical

197
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,399
pharmaceutical operation um that's

198
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,560
that's the point

199
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,719
they want to wipe out the existing

200
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,399
industry and supplant it

201
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,400
with um a gentrified pharmaceutical

202
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:14,638
version of it

203
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:16,959
so so we we make our products from raw

204
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,800
hemp cannabis we import the cannabis but

205
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:20,799
we'd much prefer to be getting it from a

206
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,560
farm up the road but the farm up the

207
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,079
road the government telling to destroy

208
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,560
is destroy his crops but this is the

209
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:28,879
point if they win

210
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,199
little collins all of these businesses

211
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:33,519
they're all gone they will all be gone

212
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,360
and and the only businesses that will be

213
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:37,120
there selling the cbd products that you

214
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,000
know today will be businesses selling

215
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,199
these

216
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,519
you know

217
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:45,038
kind of generic label um products and

218
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:46,959
whether they're 0.0 or 0.2 you know it

219
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:49,199
doesn't matter

220
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:51,519
yeah and do you see uh let's say state

221
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,160
regulate federalization over america

222
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:56,318
being a big swing and conductor for

223
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,680
the the our side of the argument over

224
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,280
here i think with that happens you're

225
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,319
going to have a recreational market to

226
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,918
come to

227
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,479
come to europe whether they like it or

228
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:07,839
not and i think yeah yeah yeah i mean

229
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:09,519
absolutely and and that's sort of um

230
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:12,318
you know that's a few steps down the

231
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:13,839
line really i think that in our in our

232
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,598
mind mate the first battle just has to

233
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,279
be won here and we just have to get over

234
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:20,159
this hurdle and work out what is

235
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:22,559
happening with cbd right and

236
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,720
we can't we can't move on to anything

237
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,560
sort of bigger until we work out how the

238
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,120
cbd thing's gonna play and here's the

239
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,519
truth that that needs to be acknowledged

240
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,639
um not only is the defense of public

241
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:36,958
health irrelevant really and farcical

242
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,479
the you know the fact is they why

243
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,799
they're delaying it so much is they

244
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,200
don't have a plan for how to implement a

245
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,519
fair industry the only plan they have is

246
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,600
how to hand the industry over to their

247
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,600
business partners they don't have a plan

248
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,000
to implement

249
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,320
legislation around the current thriving

250
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
cbd industry they just want to wipe it

251
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,720
out and start again

252
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,159
so

253
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,000
they need to get a plan and they need to

254
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:03,278
get their heads out of the sand and they

255
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,360
need to go with the actual word of law

256
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:07,838
because the word of law in europe from

257
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,919
the european court of justice they are

258
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,600
willfully running against that and not

259
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:12,879
not just in one department in many

260
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,040
departments department of health

261
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:16,559
department agriculture revenue customs

262
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:18,719
the garda they're all running against

263
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:18,719
them

264
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:23,039
yeah so it's it's gonna battle going to

265
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,120
continue when is your court case exactly

266
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:26,958
so the viewers can uh keep supporting

267
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,919
tells me we're up next week we're up for

268
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:31,439
a mention next week mate and um look he

269
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:34,079
seems to think we're going to hear some

270
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,360
things by december i'm going to say q1

271
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,879
next year

272
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,639
but look it can't come fast enough

273
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:40,958
because customs just love taking

274
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:42,799
everyone's product on the way in and as

275
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:44,719
i say it's a it's a battle to do

276
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:46,079
business but everyone is still going

277
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,000
well and you know everyone's kind of

278
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,759
coming together in the industry but look

279
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,039

280
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:52,720
