00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:35,960
industry on your area of

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:38,920
expertise yeah absolutely so I right now

14
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:41,960
um and am employed by a cultivator leny

15
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:44,200
in New York State uh to run and operate

16
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,439
a cannabis grower showcase which is a

17
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:51,440
temporary popup Farmers Farmers Market

18
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:53,198
style event that um occurs uh in in

19
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:55,320
either indoor or outdoor venues

20
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:58,000
throughout Upstate New York and in the

21
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,960
city um the state state government of

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,439
New York put out this program in in

23
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:06,359
order to um basically address the

24
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:09,519
problem that was created by the lack of

25
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:11,118
Rapid opening of stores because the uh

26
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:14,599
dispensaries were supposed to be open a

27
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:17,118
lot more soon um and unfortunately that

28
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:19,719
did not occur so they created the

29
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:22,879
Cannabis grower showcase U model and I

30
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:24,519
was able to under the license of my

31
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:27,798
employer and the farm that I work for

32
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:30,319
Green Leaf Farm um organize uh one of

33
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:33,159
those uh grower showcases actually the

34
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:36,118
first in Manhattan New York City um so

35
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:37,719
we're um up and operational um I'm

36
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:40,560
general manager running day-to-day

37
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:43,519
operations there my background in the

38
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,799
industry is approaching it from more of

39
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:49,039
a nonprofit advocacy side but being

40
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,040
interested in in how sort of the equity

41
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,759
side of the industry unfolds and how the

42
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:59,118
policy that uh our Regulators write um

43
00:01:54,759 --> 00:02:01,799
sort of helps accelerate or or you know

44
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:04,159
make an obstruction C for those kind of

45
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:07,000
uh you know Equity questions and and

46
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,239
scenarios so um you know come I came

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,959
from Michigan where it there was

48
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,280
legalization a few years earlier than

49
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,878
New York and it was not a very equitable

50
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,318
distribution of wealth among people who

51
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:21,318
had been growing before legalization and

52
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:23,919
among people who had um you know really

53
00:02:21,318 --> 00:02:25,719
sacrificed or anything to get to the

54
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:28,759
point of legalization it was really a

55
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:30,239
concentration of profits in the hands of

56
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:32,639
sort of large business business is

57
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:36,000
Corporate Consolidated um modeled

58
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:38,238
businesses so I I moved to New York with

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,239
the intention to advocate for more

60
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,200
Equity equity in the industry and and

61
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,200
sort of more tradition and and respect

62
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:47,199
to the people who had been sort of

63
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:49,280
Paving the way for this um uh this

64
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:52,839
process to to be so easy and for us to

65
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,680
have all of this cannabis genetic um

66
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,479
resources to access now that it's legal

67
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,879
and those genetics are worth very much

68
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:03,199
money so um I I op at them the Hell's

69
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:04,840
Kitchen cannabis Collective okay

70
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:06,759
excellent and when it comes to the

71
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,000
Hell's Kitchen cannabis Collective how

72
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:11,199
many members are involved is there a

73
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,080
limit of the amount of plants that they

74
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:16,598
all each cultivate is all of the flower

75
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,560
then all gathered and generated together

76
00:03:16,598 --> 00:03:21,318
what are the the basic principles of the

77
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,280
the collective and how many people are

78
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:27,000
involved absolutely so um the the C Hell

79
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,959
Kitchen cannabis Collective operates a

80
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,799
little bit differently from what I think

81
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,920
people what comes to people's mind when

82
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:36,400
they hear Collective um it's a

83
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:39,798
collective of of truly uh businesses

84
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,438
it's it's a collective of licensed Farms

85
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:45,438
um for cannabis in New York state so um

86
00:03:42,438 --> 00:03:47,280
there have been about 200 or so cannabis

87
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:50,479
cultivators who are licensed through the

88
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,919
state process um and and those those can

89
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:57,878
be a single person or those can be a

90
00:03:52,919 --> 00:04:01,759
business entity um and basically we have

91
00:03:57,878 --> 00:04:05,120
we started with nine uh cultivators and

92
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:08,560
we had three processors all of whom

93
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:11,640
basically are members in that they have

94
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,319
their wees at our location on

95
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:18,319
consignment um they're invited to come

96
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:21,358
operate their own uh booth in any time

97
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:24,719
they want um but we recommend Saturdays

98
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:27,198
so it's it's a kind of a their their

99
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,960
opportunity to participate in a retail

100
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,280
experience that's a lot closer to a

101
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:34,038
farmer market Market than it would be to

102
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:38,279
like Walmart or you know any type of

103
00:04:34,038 --> 00:04:40,719
sort of corporate grocery store type

104
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:43,638
environment it seems to me that New York

105
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,880
is primed for an explosion in genetics

106
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:48,560
and some of these low or lowkey

107
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:50,639
cultivator shall we say uh like almost

108
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,959
what happened with beer to a degree in

109
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,038
New York that you had all these

110
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:56,120
individual distilleries open up with

111
00:04:54,038 --> 00:04:58,159
their own unique profiles and

112
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,840
formulations I think New York is well

113
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,320
positioned with the different ethnicity

114
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:03,198
in that country to come up with some of

115
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:04,360
the most unique genetics that we're

116
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,800
probably going to see in the American

117
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,560
Market over the coming years that's what

118
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,639
I hope certainly I mean that is that is

119
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:15,280
absolutely a good observation I would

120
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:18,360
say what happened with craft beer though

121
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:21,359
is that you know there was decades and

122
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:24,800
Decades of of corporate consolidation

123
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:28,360
and and building massive you know multi-

124
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:31,600
uh brand uh companies before there was

125
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,120
kind of the the the upshoot of of craft

126
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,600
and the movement of craft has been kind

127
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,038
of a boom in the last couple years um

128
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,120
we're hoping to accelerate that with

129
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:43,680
cannabis so that it's not a situation

130
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:46,840
where we have to wait 20 30 40 50 years

131
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,918
for all of the big companies to really

132
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:51,239
be done fighting with each other and and

133
00:05:48,918 --> 00:05:53,399
the last one left standing starts um

134
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,160
making room for small craft operations

135
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:57,638
we're hoping that that can all grow

136
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:00,120
alongside each other um at the start of

137
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:02,840
the industry in New York I do think that

138
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,439
New York is a special place with special

139
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:08,038
cannabis history and

140
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:10,240
culture um it's got specific genetics

141
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:12,199
that it's really focused on and and

142
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,079
enjoyed and liked for a long time as

143
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:16,879
well as the potential to to breed a

144
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:20,318
bunch more

145
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:22,000
so and when it comes to the offering at

146
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,319
the Health's kitchen cannabus Collective

147
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,959
is it Edibles or is it just flour is

148
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,520
there a range of products or is it

149
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:30,038
people just coming with the best bu that

150
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:32,279
they can cultivate themselves well yeah

151
00:06:30,038 --> 00:06:35,959
it is a range of product um it is going

152
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:39,638
to be uh flow

153
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:42,198
pre-rolls gummies Vapes infused

154
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:46,280
beverages concentrates including resin

155
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:48,080
and rosin and uh Rick Simpson Oil or RSO

156
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:50,439
so which is a full spectrum cannabis

157
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:52,800
extract so we have kind of the full

158
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:55,038
Gambit of products available um on the

159
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,918
New York Legal market and when it comes

160
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:58,918
to the beverage side of things are these

161
00:06:56,918 --> 00:07:01,120
people that are creating and developing

162
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,799
their own products while Outsourcing

163
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,038
let's say the Emulsion technology from

164
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,360
an established business or do you what

165
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:10,120
way do you see the beverages going

166
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,720
because the water solubility and the

167
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,720
aluminium and cannaboids being attracted

168
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,120
to each other do you see that being an

169
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,639
issue for a lot of these

170
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:21,598
Growers um you know I haven't uh delved

171
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:23,360
that deep into it I know that the first

172
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:25,759
kind of beverages on the market are

173
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,240
mainly collaborations between like a

174
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,280
laboratory like a processing licy and

175
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,038
between someone else who's got the idea

176
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:35,000
or it's just kind of done inhouse by the

177
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:36,360
processor so I'm pretty sure that

178
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,800
they're kind of a breast of these

179
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,960
situations cuz the cans look a little

180
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,280
bit different sometimes or you know

181
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:43,839
sometimes they seem like just aluminum

182
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:45,719
cans but I know that they have to do

183
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:48,318
that like Emulsion technology to get the

184
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:51,000
oil uh small enough to kind of mix with

185
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,598
the water so yeah that seems to be one

186
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,519
of the sweet spots of the industry that

187
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:56,120
it looks as if and I think New York

188
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:58,198
could potentially be well positioned for

189
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,038
this that if there is a dominant couple

190
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:01,879
of white label suppliers of Beverages

191
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:03,839
and Edibles it's going to be the brands

192
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:06,000
and the entrepreneurs who can create

193
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,318
these Brands who can connect with a

194
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,199
specific demographic or audience that

195
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,720
will uh I think grow any specific

196
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,919
business so you don't necessarily need

197
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,639
to have the most chemistry expertise or

198
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:18,959
production expertise once you can come

199
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:20,038
up with the right brand and the Right

200
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:21,560
audience I think that's where the

201
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:23,439
winners in cannabis are going to be

202
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,240
especially in New York in the coming

203
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:29,399
years yeah absolutely I think that those

204
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,800
uh this this the processors we were I've

205
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:33,439
been speaking to people in the industry

206
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,038
right now the processors are in a excit

207
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,560
I mean it's a comfortable position for

208
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:40,278
them because they control the suppli

209
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:43,239
they they have sort of extra leverage on

210
00:08:40,278 --> 00:08:46,000
the supply side and the retail side so

211
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,440
whereas we have a lot of cultivators and

212
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,679
they're having difficulty getting their

213
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,040
product on the shelves we have a lot of

214
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:54,559
or we have very few open retail

215
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:57,399
storefronts um so they have no problem

216
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:59,759
kind of deciding what product they want

217
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:01,919
the cultivators we have the like almost

218
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:06,399
the fewest of even even the ones who are

219
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:09,479
licensed so um and by that I mean they

220
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:11,839
licensed about 250 cultivators they

221
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,278
licensed about 40 processors and then

222
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,800
they licensed about 250 stores but there

223
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:19,958
was a lawsuit preventing the stores from

224
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:23,479
opening so we're only looking at about

225
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:25,679
28 stores in the whole state um so the

226
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:28,120
processors they get to

227
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:30,559
control what kind of price they buy

228
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,759
their their their products at their

229
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:34,679
their raw flow for processing at and

230
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:36,200
then they also kind of get to control a

231
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:38,078
little bit about what they sell at

232
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,560
because their process goods are so

233
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:42,039
valuable and there's only 40 of them um

234
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:44,078
and they're in such high demand that

235
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:46,360
they they actually are in a lot less of

236
00:09:44,078 --> 00:09:48,199
a dire State than a lot of the other uh

237
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,680
players in our industry right

238
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,600
now yeah hopefully with Federal

239
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:54,639
legalization we kind of get the scenario

240
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,519
where the processors are plentyful

241
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:59,278
because it's now an opportune uh thing

242
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,919
that you could go as a large company

243
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:02,838
who's not necessarily touching it right

244
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:06,078
now because if we look across the board

245
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,920
in every consumer package good Mars and

246
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:10,039
cabri don't grow their own Coco

247
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:11,879
McDonald's don't have their own Farms

248
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:13,719
they've managed to create a brand that

249
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:16,600
they've been able to translate this into

250
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,320
a large market share yeah absolutely

251
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,000
absolutely so yeah I think these

252
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,800
processors are only it's only going to

253
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,480
get better for them we'll see that's yes

254
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:29,120
so for now where is the best weed in New

255
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,959
York is it in one of the burs is it in

256
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,039
Manhattan in a specific territory in

257
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,759
Manhattan if you were recommending

258
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:38,278
somebody to go get their hands on the

259
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:40,240
best blaze in the city oh well you know

260
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:42,078
I'd probably tell you to come right down

261
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,200
to see us at Hell's Kitchen cannabis

262
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:47,078
Collective um we have some exceptional

263
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,720
Farms that we're working with who are

264
00:10:47,078 --> 00:10:52,000
from all over the state of New York um

265
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,879
they grow between you know some of them

266
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,039
are full-term outdoor some of them are

267
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:58,278
mixed like Greenhouse some of them are

268
00:10:56,039 --> 00:11:00,278
mixed like Greenhouse but converting to

269
00:10:58,278 --> 00:11:03,000
do an indoor operation for the next

270
00:11:00,278 --> 00:11:05,759
season um so there's kind of every type

271
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,839
of preference uh available and then also

272
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:11,439
I would say that you know there's

273
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:13,880
there's definitely some absolute um some

274
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,639
fire as we call it uh that you can be

275
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:17,320
found in Hell Kitchen cannabis

276
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:20,000
Collective especially I would recommend

277
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:22,720
the Hayes because Hayes is kind of a

278
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,919
unique um when in Rome situation with

279
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,560
New York I know that it's had sort of

280
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:29,919
lives outside of New York City but it's

281
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:32,159
uh found its home here and and and

282
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:34,278
become you know a favorite of many for

283
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:37,000
Generations so I would recommend trying

284
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:38,320
some hay and hopefully we get some of

285
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,039
the cultivators that have been working

286
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,920
in the shadows over the last couple of

287
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:45,240
decades now coming to award-winning

288
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:47,319
ceremonies and being praised for the

289
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,240
skill set that they currently have

290
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,720
that's why I got in this industry so

291
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,278
that's that's if I have anything to do

292
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,040
with it hopefully they will be sooner

293
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:56,679
than later excellent for everybody who's

294
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:58,039
going to New York or anybody who's from

295
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:59,879

coming 12 to 18 months in New York do

301
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,240
you want an expansion of the card

302
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:13,198
licenses and the court cases to work

303
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,440
themselves out do you want a multitude

304
00:12:13,198 --> 00:12:18,879
of new retail licenses regardless of

305
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:21,639
what the applicant's backstory is or do

306
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:23,600
you want to see some unique cannabis

branding come to the market where you

308
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,720
see these homegrown billion dollar

309
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:30,919
companies coming out of New York h um I

310
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,360
mean know any any of the above would be

311
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:34,559
exciting and more exciting than what

312
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,879
we've seen in the last you know 12 to 18

313
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:39,479
months with the the kind of the all the

314
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:42,759
roadblocks and obstacles and constant

315
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:45,480
you know um doubt and and questioning

316
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:47,399
that a lot of figures have had uh with

317
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:51,240
with just the lack of clarity about

318
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:52,958
where we're headed I think that um I I

319
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,079
mean first and foremost I'd like the

320
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:57,159
grower showcase program to get extended

321
00:12:55,078 --> 00:12:59,958
I think it's one of the most unique and

322
00:12:57,159 --> 00:13:02,719
special um Creations that New York state

323
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:05,159
has um come up with in this cannabis

324
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,759
realm and I think that they aren't even

325
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:10,838
really realizing how special it is and

326
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:13,159
how Global of an impact it could have if

327
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:15,760
they put it in the right context and and

328
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:18,679
Amplified it a little more because it's

329
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:21,120
one of the main and only direct to

330
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:24,319
Consumer retail models for cannabis

331
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,278
among any legal State and it's um

332
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,360
frankly I believe the way cannabis

333
00:13:26,278 --> 00:13:31,039
should be bought and um 's no more

334
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,839
fulfilling experience than you know

335
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:35,159
standing across the table from a

336
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:38,120
cultivator and actually learning from

337
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:41,838
The Source about what you're going to be

338
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:44,919
um you know enjoying later um you know

339
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:47,920
in in your flower product or your edible

340
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:50,198
or whatever it is um there's someone who

341
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:52,159
put a lot of thought and care and craft

342
00:13:50,198 --> 00:13:54,159
behind that and and is excited to share

343
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:57,078
that with you so that's probably the

344
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:58,719
first uh major I hope I have for the

345
00:13:57,078 --> 00:14:00,439
grow uh for New York The Grow Show

346
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,959
showcase program right now is slated to

347
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,600
end just at the end of the year but we

348
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:07,439
really think that the Market's not going

349
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,079
to be ready for the program to go away

350
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,000
and and there's no really good reason to

351
00:14:09,078 --> 00:14:14,319
send it away anyways um we also would

352
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,039
say I mean I would say my other

353
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,920
preference I think that what I want to

354
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:20,278
see happen is the cards who already got

355
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:23,759
licensed I want to see them get open I

356
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:25,519
want to see um the the the law as

357
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:27,759
written helping the people that was set

358
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:30,240
out to help so those are distressed

359
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:32,480
Farmers disabled veterans people

360
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,079
convicted from Cannabis in New York

361
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,759
people from communities

362
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:38,919
disproportionately impacted by the War

363
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:41,360
on Drugs um and then and then the last

364
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:43,479
thing is is really I just want to see um

365
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,399
I want to see the the like just like you

366
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:49,000
said the the true kind of pioneers of

367
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,480
this um culture and this plant and the

368
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,278
people who are stewards of the plant

369
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,800
throughout the time when it was illegal

370
00:14:52,278 --> 00:14:57,360
and still pushing along you know

371
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:59,479
breeding and genetics and and holding

372
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,360
these valuable clones and keeping the

373
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,600
lights on and paying the massive power

374
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,320
bill and forfeiting friendships and

375
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,278
family relationships and you know just

376
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,480
praying that they don't get incarcerated

377
00:15:08,278 --> 00:15:12,559
and um taking all those risks on for so

378
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,879
many years I want to see them put in a

379
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:16,000
position to succeed and succeed in the

380
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:18,078
highest

381
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,958
degree incredible you're definitely on

382
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:21,758
