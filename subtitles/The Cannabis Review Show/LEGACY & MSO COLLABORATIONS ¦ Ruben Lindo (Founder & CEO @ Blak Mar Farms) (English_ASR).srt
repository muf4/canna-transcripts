23
00:00:52,738 --> 00:00:58,558
company that was our first baby and our

24
00:00:55,259 --> 00:01:00,960
first foray into the space and blackmar

25
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:03,000

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,420

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:13,019
event hosting operation

29
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:15,059
okay brilliant amazing so I was doing my

30
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:16,500
research and you would uh you seem to

31
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,060
come across as a man who's got a wealth

32
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,680
of experience and knowledge to do with

33
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,240
the industry so I'm going to jump

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,799
straight into the first topic and I

35
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:24,298
think it's something that it seems

36
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,618
pretty obvious from the outside looking

37
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:26,880
in but doesn't seem to be something

38
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:29,099
that's been enacted and that's

39
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,679
collaboration and not competition

40
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:34,199
between the msos and the Legacy Market

41
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,939
do you agree with the statement that the

42
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,500
msos in the Legacy Market should be

43
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:39,599
collaborating because it seems to be a

44
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,859
perfect marriage or is all the

45
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,019
competition that's happening at the

46
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:45,659
moment what should be happening no I

47
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:48,719
absolutely I I think that to take it a

48
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:51,479
step further I think that the the onus

49
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:55,140
is on the msos to collaborate not only

50
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:57,658
with the Legacy Market but also the

51
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,299
small business and the smaller operators

52
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:03,200
because you know I think if you really

53
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:07,439
think about this from a collaborative

54
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:10,020
standpoint you know eight years ago none

55
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,759
of us would be collaborating or even

56
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,860
compete meeting we would be

57
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:16,739
co-conspirators right because it's still

58
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,599
federally illegal and it's illegal

59
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:20,340
um you know would have been illegal in

60
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:22,318
most of the states in which we operate

61
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,939
so I think in the spirit of of

62
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:25,979
collaboration

63
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:28,439
there's some Innovation there and and

64
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:30,719
there's some ability for these larger

65
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:33,060
companies who are very well capitalized

66
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:36,239
to work with smaller companies like

67
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,580
myself or or even folks coming out of

68
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,620
the Legacy Market who have established

69
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,200
Brands because there are things that we

70
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:46,759
can do that that the big msos just can't

71
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:49,919
we can grow craft cannabis to our scale

72
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:52,318
financially where they can't when they

73
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:54,659
have these huge facilities it's hard to

74
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,639
to grow the type of cannabis that would

75
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:58,560
be considered craft cannabis not saying

76
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,299
that they can't it just doesn't fit

77
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,340
their business model and then the other

78
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,260
thing is the wealth of products that are

79
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,300
currently exists either in the Legacy

80
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:09,000
Market or in the craft small to

81
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:12,360
medium-sized Market we're able to put

82
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,658
products out at a s at a rate that is

83
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,640
much faster than some of these larger

84
00:03:15,658 --> 00:03:19,500
companies because again they have to

85
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:21,598
check a lot of the boxes in their bottom

86
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,039
line drives them just like our bottom

87
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,738
line but if your bottom line is

88
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:28,378
significantly small dollar or or shorter

89
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:29,939
to the Target then it's easier for us to

90
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:32,039
get out and we you know I think that

91
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:34,079
speed to Commerce

92
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:35,699
um through collaboration is is really

93
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,040
key

94
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:39,839
yeah no I agree with you totally I think

95
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:42,239
it's uh

96
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,280
it's it's going to be a case now where

97
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,080
the msos are the ones that have to come

98
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,340
to the industry and it baffles me that

99
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,739
some of these episodes have haven't

100
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,658
created funds and gone out and done

101
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:53,819
mergers and Acquisitions with the top

102
00:03:51,658 --> 00:03:55,378
tiered talent that may not have let's

103
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:56,878
say the business Acumen to bring their

104
00:03:55,378 --> 00:03:59,219
business to be a large-scale national

105
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:01,500
company but have all the industry know

106
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:03,539
how an expertise to be able to work to

107
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,759
budgets and ensure uh everybody's

108
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:09,239
working as a cohesive unit

109
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:12,719
you know I I mentioned that last week

110
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:15,360
um at MJ bizcon on stage with with

111
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:17,879
um you know acreage Holdings and wanna

112
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,660
Brands and and the parent company I said

113
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:24,180
to them there are definite advantages in

114
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:27,120
collaborating and bringing top talent in

115
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:29,759
I think part of the issue though is

116
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,280
there's there's a trust Factor right and

117
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,280
there Still Remains a huge divide

118
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:37,799
between the large companies the big msos

119
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:39,539
and and companies like myself or The

120
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,180
Operators coming out of Legacy space

121
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:44,340
where they're still just not sure where

122
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:46,319
they can trust who they can trust

123
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:48,239
um and it goes both ways right but I

124
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,918
think that in the next couple years

125
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,259
we're gonna see that type of

126
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:55,379
collaboration in the spirit of

127
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:57,600
of less of competition because really if

128
00:04:55,379 --> 00:05:00,659
you think about it if we're all

129
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,060
operating on the adult use legal side

130
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,520
here in the United States and in Most

131
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:08,160
states we're competing for 17 to 20

132
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:10,639
percent of the market right we're really

133
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,439
we have to figure out how to dominate

134
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,300
that segment so that we can strengthen

135
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:17,579
this and make it more attractive for

136
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,978
legacy operators to come over I was a

137
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:22,800
legacy operator right and I transitioned

138
00:05:19,978 --> 00:05:25,680
over into the adult use legal side of

139
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,538
this business at the corporate level

140
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,459
um because two things that made sense

141
00:05:27,538 --> 00:05:32,699
and

142
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:34,439
um I saw the bigger play right and and

143
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:37,500
being able to even speak to you in

144
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:39,959
Ireland and and folks in the UK and and

145
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:42,839
all over the world my vision for

146
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:45,239
cannabis has always been Global from day

147
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:48,119
one when I came into this industry so I

148
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:50,400
think that as we start seeing the global

149
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,519
reach of cannabis we're going to see the

150
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:55,500
need for more collaboration unless

151
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:57,779
collapsing of the industry with

152
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:00,418
Acquisitions and mergers and more

153
00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:02,698
keeping independently subsidiaries or

154
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:04,500
wholly owned subsidiaries working in

155
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:06,240
conjunction with the big capitalized

156
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,100
companies to put out some great

157
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,478
tremendous products and reach a lot of

158
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,340
people because at the end of the day

159
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:13,740
it's about getting the plant in the

160
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:15,599
patient's hands and in folks hands

161
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,519
no matter how we look at this this is

162
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,160
still plant medicine

163
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,839
yeah couldn't agree with you more I'm

164
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,860
going to jump on to the next topic and

165
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:24,839
it's something that I've been getting

166
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,879
lots of mixed information about it's the

167
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:29,219
New York Autumn crop of cannabis that

168
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:31,560
was grown and apparently is sitting

169
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,660
around in a with a very high valuation

170
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,819
tell me exactly what happened with the

171
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,380
New York Autumn crop this year and if

172
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:40,259
one of the news we're hearing is true or

173
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:41,939
false well I I don't know exactly what

174
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:44,879
you're hearing but I can only speculate

175
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:48,360
to what you're hearing and I believe

176
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:49,680
that there's a mix of Truth to what

177
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,900
we've all heard

178
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,319
um that there's there was a tremendous

179
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:58,258
uh amount of cannabis harvested I think

180
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:02,400
something north of 700 000 pounds of

181
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:06,300
cannabis harvested I I believe that

182
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:09,060
probably about 20 to 25 percent of that

183
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:12,240
may be viable to go into a smokable

184
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:14,699
Market the rest of it is biomass

185
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,379
um I haven't personally tested but I've

186
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:17,819
spoken to some of the farms and some of

187
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:21,120
them have turned out pretty pretty

188
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:24,840
decent product but you know there's an

189
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,519
alarming issue when The Regulators drop

190
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:28,818
the

191
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:30,538
testing parameters

192
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:34,139
in the

193
00:07:30,538 --> 00:07:35,939
in the first harvest always you'll see

194
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:38,160
them play with the numbers but when they

195
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:41,180
dropped it significantly so that the

196
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:44,400
mold count could could pass

197
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:47,098
into the market I think that that was

198
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,779
really a telling sign that it's going to

199
00:07:47,098 --> 00:07:51,659
be a lot more difficult than people

200
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:53,879
think it is to grow outdoor cannabis in

201
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:58,439
New York right think about this we had

202
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:59,159
probably the wettest August September

203
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:02,639
um

204
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:05,240
probably in in the last 30 years and

205
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:08,400
then we had very high humidity

206
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:10,620
exorbitantly high humidity and high hot

207
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:13,620
temperatures all the way until November

208
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:15,478
right so that doesn't make for a very

209
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,478
good

210
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:21,659
um environment to grow outdoor cannabis

211
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:24,598
as your primary cash crop right so I

212
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:26,639
think that we saw and what we and I I

213
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:29,219
believe this what what we're going to

214
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:32,940
see is a shift to more indoor and

215
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:36,000
Greenhouse cannabis with one or two one

216
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:37,979
real Harvest of outdoor cannabis and a

217
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,958
lot of that product may go to biomass

218
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:41,639
and go into your oils and your Edibles

219
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:43,500
which is great right it's still

220
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:45,240
sun-kissed cannabis is sun-kissed

221
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:48,000
cannabis but I don't think sun-kissed

222
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,220
cannabis in New York is a sustainable

223
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,179
um way to launch an industry

224
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:55,560
yeah no I agree I think um Ireland is

225
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:57,059
almost the exact same if you're lucky

226
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:59,399
you'll get a couple of good weeks during

227
00:08:57,059 --> 00:09:01,139
the summer I don't think it's a you can

228
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:03,539
plan around having real cultivation

229
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:05,639
unless you've got the climate that has

230
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:07,860
proven for it so it would negate that

231
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:09,299
indoor cannabis is going to be the the

232
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,800
premium cannabis that you're going to be

233
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:12,120
able to buy on the shelves over the next

234
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:14,458
five years

235
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,879
yeah that that's absolutely true and

236
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:21,199
having spent time in Ireland I I pretty

237
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:23,939
much I think of I think of like

238
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,700
Northeast New York Northeast United

239
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,720
States very similar to the climate in

240
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,700
Ireland

241
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,820
um minus we get the snow I think you

242
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:36,240
guys get the rain and ice right

243
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:38,459
um but but at the same time I think that

244
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,100
there are some serious lessons learned

245
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:43,679
and and look the state did a great thing

246
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:46,980
by launching this program and getting

247
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:49,439
product out there and getting some folks

248
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:53,159
who have some some real

249
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,600
um Bona fides or or skill set to grow

250
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:57,360
cannabis

251
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:00,360
but again it takes a very special strain

252
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:03,959
breed and and cultivator to understand

253
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,459
and navigate this industry this isn't

254
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:07,679
Jack and the Beanstalk where you're

255
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:10,259
gonna throw some seeds in the ground and

256
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:12,659
then you're gonna be magically uh

257
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:15,659
wealthy right it's a it's a very fickle

258
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:17,278
plant and it's it's tough to grow and I

259
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:20,039
think that some of the farmers in New

260
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:22,200
York learned that lesson this year

261
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:23,458
yeah no very much so it's going to be

262
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,740
interesting do you think that they'll

263
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:28,018
have this the the retail stores open by

264
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:30,120
the end of this year I think we're on

265
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:32,100
track I think we'll have a few just so

266
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,320
they can check the box

267
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:36,778
um I know that they have awarded the

268
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,760
life the card licenses they gave out 36

269
00:10:36,778 --> 00:10:40,559
licenses for the Justice impacted

270
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:42,778
individuals

271
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:44,458
um and we just coming fresh off the

272
00:10:42,778 --> 00:10:47,039
press we had a meeting last night with

273
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:49,979
Damien Fagan and the ocm

274
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:51,778
um and yeah I think that they're going

275
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:54,959
to have by the end of the year we'll

276
00:10:51,778 --> 00:10:57,240
have two maybe three stores open in

277
00:10:54,958 --> 00:11:00,000
various regions and they'll be the pilot

278
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,700
Flagship first to Market stores

279
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,860
and do you think the caliber of well

280
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:08,459
being grown in New York is going to be

281
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:10,919
able to meet that top tier Echelon or is

282
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:14,399
it just uh now

283
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:16,319
and not to cut you off I I

284
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,139
um no I I think that we're gonna

285
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:22,339
struggle a little bit uh oh and to be

286
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:25,139
honest with you with um getting

287
00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:26,519
the top tier and and that's what happens

288
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:28,199
right

289
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:30,360
I always tell people it's not about

290
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,480
speed to Market it's about the quality

291
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,220
of the product and

292
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,320
we started this whole conversation by

293
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,660
talking about the the spirit of

294
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:42,480
collaboration with Legacy and I think

295
00:11:39,659 --> 00:11:43,980
when we've left Legacy behind on this

296
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,420
first round

297
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,159
um it's going to be tough to compete

298
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:49,620
with the product that currently exists

299
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:51,838
in 80 of the market space that currently

300
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:54,620
is dominated in the Legacy market right

301
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,279
it's something like you know

302
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,060
400

303
00:11:56,278 --> 00:12:02,458
000

304
00:11:57,059 --> 00:12:04,619
um 400 400 000 metric tons of cannabis

305
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:07,078
or some ridiculous four metric tons of

306
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:09,539
cannabis is consumed in the New York

307
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:12,120
metropolitan area none of it is sold on

308
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:15,000
this and in stores so that just tells

309
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,320
you it's a ridiculous number do you

310
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,820
think there's going to be like

311
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,440
Interstate Partnerships that happen

312
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,120
because a lot of the East Coast we were

313
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,279
looking now through the ballots recently

314
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,519
in votes that happened you've got

315
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:28,320
um a couple of close neighboring uh

316
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:29,940
states that have all gone legalized now

317
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,920
do you see them doing Interstate deals

318
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:34,140
where look we're allowed to ship across

319
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:37,078
a and b and c and d without breaking the

320
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:40,319
federal rules so we have the framework

321
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:43,559
for it and I'm a big I'm a big proponent

322
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,778
of interstate commerce amongst

323
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:48,359
contiguous states I think that that's

324
00:12:45,778 --> 00:12:51,539
the only way that we can compete and

325
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:54,720
really open up the marketplace in a way

326
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:57,360
that gives unique distinction like you

327
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,639
buy Vermont maple syrup and you buy New

328
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:03,120
York Ave couples right I think that

329
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:05,879
that's the same concept and what we

330
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,679
learned coming through the pandemic is

331
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:09,240
that the states can do interstate

332
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:11,159
commerce

333
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:14,399
um on emergency supplies medical

334
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:16,740
supplies and even labor right labor

335
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:19,379
could work across state lines we have

336
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:21,959
the framework for it in the in the New

337
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:25,200
York New Jersey Pennsylvania pact for

338
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:27,179
the the Port Authority where we share in

339
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,980
revenue and Taxation for highways

340
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:30,659
Bridges and tunnels

341
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:33,060
um and I think that it's the same model

342
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:35,759
we also have the same model when it

343
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:38,399
comes to tomatoes apples oranges and

344
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:40,679
produce right so if cannabis is truly an

345
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,480
agricultural commodity then let's just

346
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:45,299
designate it as such and allow for

347
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:48,120
contiguous states to to trade cannabis

348
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:50,240
and think about the revenue pool when

349
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:54,539
you ex when you expand the marketplace

350
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:57,120
by you know five million users just in

351
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:58,799
the tri-state area we can expand that

352
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,200
and then they they can do a revenue

353
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:03,299
share on the taxation you know it won't

354
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:06,360
be long before the governments get that

355
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:09,539
get that message but the other thing is

356
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:12,360
it will increase safety Consumer

357
00:14:09,539 --> 00:14:14,278
Protection right product safety we can

358
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,959
have standardized tests so what works in

359
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:17,600
New York will have to be the standard

360
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:21,239
for New Jersey Pennsylvania Connecticut

361
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:23,278
Massachusetts Vermont uh you know and

362
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,700
and look we're going further south now

363
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:29,519
right so now we have legalization in in

364
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:33,060
Maryland and you know Virginia's coming

365
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:35,940
on board D.C is is is hot a hot button

366
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:38,338
with a being a federal territory but you

367
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:40,380
know as as we see this thing expand on

368
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:41,880
the Eastern Seaboard we're going to have

369
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,259
a need for some of that right and we're

370
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:45,720
going to have a need for for

371
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:49,439
standardized testing and and secure

372
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:52,800
banking you know this that model opens

373
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,139
up so many doors to answer and check off

374
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:58,500
so many boxes that create areas of

375
00:14:55,139 --> 00:15:01,079
opportunity or problem for our industry

376
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,339
