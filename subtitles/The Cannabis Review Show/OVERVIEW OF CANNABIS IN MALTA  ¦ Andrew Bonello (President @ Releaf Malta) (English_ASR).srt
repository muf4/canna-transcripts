who is the president of relief Malta and

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,580
he's worked since 2019 tirelessly to

7
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,679
represent the voice of cannabis

8
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:27,000
consumers in Malta and I'm delighted to

9
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:29,099
have you on the show today Andrew thanks

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,259
for joining us thanks for watching me

11
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:32,759
Ellen glad to be here great to have you

12
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,260
on so we're going to touch on all things

13
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,640
Malta and try and explain to the

14
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:38,219
patients and the consumers out there

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,259
what's going on in your exact territory

16
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:41,579
so do you want to maybe give everyone a

17
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:43,259
quick overview of how you ended up

18
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,239
becoming the president of really vulture

19
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:47,640
and we do that in under a minute

20
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:49,979
well yeah sure and basically um I've

21
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,719
been an activist for at least the past

22
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:54,538
10 years

23
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,460
um basically due to the the Draconian

24
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:58,679
approach we've had

25
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,719
um locally towards cannabis consumption

26
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:03,359
and possession and things were getting

27
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,760
out of hand the arrests were happening

28
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,460
on a daily basis and we saw some um

29
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,978
crazy prison sentences as well so it was

30
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:12,539
it was time to set up step up and

31
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:15,079
actually get out and do something about

32
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:18,420
it so we had a changing government in

33
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:20,459
2013 where they seemed to be um pretty

34
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,320
interested in listening which was um

35
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:24,839
great and and once they kind of opened

36
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:28,679
the door we barged in

37
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,780
okay amazing so it seems to be a story

38
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,400
that's replicating itself around the

39
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,200
world that everybody thinks they've got

40
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,478
their own isolated case whereas the laws

41
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,740
were very Draconian very severe people

42
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:38,879
have stepped up to the plate like

43
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:40,379
yourselves and there's a number of

44
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:43,259
activists in Ireland doing the same

45
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:45,359
thing to help kind of uh uh smooth out

46
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,759
the edges of the laws and if not get a

47
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:50,159
full adult use Market gone can you maybe

48
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,899
give everybody a quick overview of what

49
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,659
are the kind of cannabis consumers that

50
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:58,439
malted in terms of demographic and is it

51
00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:00,899
70 male 30 female is it mostly under 35

52
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:03,059
year olds is it over 60 year olds what

53
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:05,460
does the consumer look like in Walton

54
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:09,479
well look I mean obviously it's hard to

55
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:10,159
be precise because when you have such a

56
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,099
um

57
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:16,859
a Draconian Zero Tolerance type setup

58
00:02:14,098 --> 00:02:18,419
and there's no way to know exactly you

59
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,720
know what the good demographics are

60
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:23,280
because it's so underground but

61
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:24,180
um I will say this that your your

62
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,000
typical

63
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:29,099
um uh cannabis consumer and mortar is is

64
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,479
just a responsible person

65
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:32,098
um who usually has a job and a family

66
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,378
like everybody else

67
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:36,780
um it's just that they they choose to

68
00:02:34,378 --> 00:02:38,759
use cannabis over maybe some other legal

69
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:42,659
types of substances

70
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:45,299
okay and is there any uh any uh figures

71
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:47,519
calculated so far what is the size of

72
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,200
the population that use cannabis in malt

73
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,019
over in Ireland it looks like it's in

74
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:53,579
around 10 percent of the population of

75
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:56,219
Ireland will consume cannabis as

76
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:58,860
recreational uh activity

77
00:02:56,219 --> 00:03:01,098
yes well our our past parliamentary

78
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:04,500
secretary had come out and said that um

79
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:05,878
we were around the 40 000 Mark and

80
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,180
that's cannabis consumers don't forget

81
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:13,739
that we are a population of 450 000

82
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:16,800
maybe close pushing to 500 000 now so

83
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:18,959
yeah I'd say it's around 40 000 but

84
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,000
that's being very conservative

85
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,680
um now that things have moved forward

86
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,939
obviously we'll be able to collect more

87
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,920
data which is something we've been

88
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:27,840
pushing for to be able to obviously

89
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,539
Implement

90
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,060
um sort of better

91
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:35,280
policies to update our policies as well

92
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,739
um regard together with what the data we

93
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,658
managed to collect

94
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:41,400
okay and next topic I wanted to jump

95
00:03:39,658 --> 00:03:43,378
onto was basically just an overview of

96
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,658
Malta and cannabis so

97
00:03:43,378 --> 00:03:48,239
we saw that you had very Draconian laws

98
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:50,340
then we you had an election they had a

99
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,739
different viewpoint on medical cannabis

100
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,479
then that would they basically had laws

101
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:57,480
where companies could set up facilities

102
00:03:54,479 --> 00:04:00,060
to be able to import product rebranded

103
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:02,039
repackage it and ship it out into the

104
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,799
the likes of Germany's medical cannabis

105
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:06,900
Market is that currently exactly where

106
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,120
the industry's out of Malta or is there

107
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,340
any talk about an adult use recreational

108
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,560
market and the potential for cannabis

109
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,060
tourism to take place in Malta

110
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,819
well

111
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:20,459
um medical cannabis entered the scene in

112
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:22,500
around 2018.

113
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:25,259
um and and unfortunately so the

114
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,879
companies that were attracted were were

115
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:29,759
sort of the bigger well-established

116
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:31,740
well-known companies that um came here

117
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,240
to set up

118
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,879
um to set like you said to import

119
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,040
basically Rebrand and Export and this

120
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:40,500
started to happen before actually local

121
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,780
patients were able to access a medical

122
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,478
cannabis so there was a bit of a

123
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:47,758
um an overlap over there so we had to be

124
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:49,860
quite um vocal about that

125
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,960
um so the medicines Authority then had

126
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,120
to start letting

127
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:57,060
um some some pharmaceutical companies

128
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:59,759
here Imports to be able to satisfy the

129
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,959
the local medical cannabis patient

130
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,639
Market

131
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:05,698
um so that that that sort of came in

132
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,639
after the the cannabis companies were

133
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:11,819
established locally but um at the moment

134
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,639
yes there are over I think between 50

135
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:16,319
and 20 companies here which like you

136
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,819
said Imports

137
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:20,699
um from from other countries and

138
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:23,159
repackage and and Outsource but we do

139
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:24,660
finally have some some cannabis on the

140
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,300
market which is from The Local Company

141
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,259
so the price is obviously and did drop a

142
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,360
little

143
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:31,919
um but and then with the new law which

144
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,538
came out at the end of last year which

145
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:37,319
was an amendment to our sort of

146
00:05:33,538 --> 00:05:39,860
Narcotics act where it's entitled

147
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:42,000
um sort of cannabis to be grown at home

148
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:44,100
for plants are allowed to be grown at

149
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,139
home without fear of persecution

150
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,660
or arrest

151
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:50,819
um so once once that sort of came into

152
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:54,180
effect then the the medical cannabis

153
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:56,159
prices started to drop even further so

154
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:59,100
um they've gone down to sort of quite

155
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,580
affordable at the moment and we have a

156
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:04,500
system where your your local GP can

157
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:05,758
prescribe cannabis

158
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,220
um but of course you have to get a

159
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,840
control card first and that has to be

160
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,220
signed off by the superintendent of

161
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:13,379
Public Health

162
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,880
um but the onus does then fall on the

163
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:19,139
doctor so the doctor has to take full

164
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:20,459
responsibility for what he's prescribing

165
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:22,259
um and so so that's kind of the

166
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:25,439
situation we are at at the moment

167
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:28,080
regarding recreational Cannabis um yes

168
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:29,819
we had in in the last amendments which I

169
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:32,159
mentioned and which came out in December

170
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:35,699
2019 we

171
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,259
um we're going to be having well a an

172
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:39,240
authority for the responsibilities of

173
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:41,340
cannabis has been set up with the

174
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,740
chairperson and the board

175
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:46,198
this um Authority is still sort of being

176
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,699
still being finalized and and they're

177
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:49,978
still trying to put sort of their team

178
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:53,160
together hasn't been concluded yet so

179
00:06:49,978 --> 00:06:55,639
that's taken about a year

180
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,259
um but when when all this happens

181
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:01,139
according to law basically we'll be

182
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:03,660
allowed to have associations which will

183
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:05,519
be allowed to have up to 500 members and

184
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:08,220
dispense to each member up to seven

185
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:10,079
grams of cannabis a day up to 50 grams

186
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:12,479
of cannabis a month

187
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,279
um unfortunately there won't be any um

188
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:16,860
on-site consumption so there won't

189
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:18,538
really be social clubs there will be so

190
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,400
they're called associations where you

191
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:23,159
will go in as a member be able to

192
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:25,679
acquire cannabis and and leave and so

193
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,479
the only the only legal Place one can

194
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,519
consume is in their own Hub in their own

195
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:31,379
house at the moment but of course we can

196
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:32,698
we can walk around in public with seven

197
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:34,019
grams on us

198
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:36,538
um the police can't do anything about

199
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:39,598
that or take it which was quite a big

200
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:41,639
win for us and also um the inclusion of

201
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:44,639
the expungement of criminal records

202
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:46,139
which came into effect as well which is

203
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,460
um something very positive but we still

204
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:49,379
have to see you know how many people

205
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:51,598
have applied uh how many people have

206
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:54,538
been actually given

207
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:56,879
um how many have had the the conduct

208
00:07:54,538 --> 00:07:59,699
expunged

209
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:02,159
okay very interesting so the the home

210
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:03,780
grow rules seem to be in the Catalyst

211
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,220
snow for these well obviously not Social

212
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:06,899
Clubs because they can't consume on

213
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:10,319
there but let's say membership clubs

214
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:12,839
where uh a consumer can purchase their

215
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,780
own cannabis grown by a much larger

216
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:17,939
facility is that expected to be

217
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:21,359
announced very soon or is that a the

218
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:26,300
ability to do that available right now

219
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,300
um to the ability is not available

220
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:57,600
yeah which is what they want to do

221
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:59,458
everywhere and when it comes to the

222
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,139
control cards for medical cannabis as

223
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:02,579
you said the doctor is responsible for

224
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:04,919
whatever they prescribe and the amount

225
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:06,899
they prescribe but how hard is it to get

226
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:09,120
a control card is there a specific model

227
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:13,879
that uh everybody has to follow the

228
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:16,679
exact same rules or is there uh yeah yes

229
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:18,838
sort of Department of Health or what

230
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:20,458
what governmental body is it is it don't

231
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:22,500
run through a remote

232
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:24,299
it's the superintendent of Public Health

233
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,919
is is basically

234
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:27,599
um the person that would sign off your

235
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:29,699
control card at the end of the day but

236
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,320
you know you have to first of all see

237
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,820
your doctor and you have to prove to

238
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,300
your doctor as well that you have been

239
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:38,339
on at least two medications

240
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:41,039
um that that have not worked for you

241
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:43,800
basically uh for for your ailments so

242
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:46,980
once you can prove that to the doctor

243
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:49,679
um then the doctor will apply for you

244
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:51,899
um to get your your control card through

245
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:53,639
the superintendent of Public Health I

246
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:55,919
don't know how many have been rejected

247
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:58,019
unfortunately I do know that people that

248
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:59,639
have had the past

249
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:02,580
um substance abuse problem who have

250
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:04,379
entered the rehabilitation center

251
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,820
um any time in their lives will be

252
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:08,939
rejected

253
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:13,019
um also people that that drive vehicles

254
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:15,839
for a living will be rejected so there

255
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:18,299
are some rejections that um could take

256
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,000
place but I think on the whole

257
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:22,859
um when we look at the way medical

258
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,500
cannabis is dispensed throughout Europe

259
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:28,019
I think Malta is is is probably one of

260
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,580
the according to to the doctors anyways

261
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:32,159
one of the the best

262
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,959
um the best in in Europe

263
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:35,699
yeah you definitely seen to be one of

264
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:37,919
the model countries so far in the

265
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,600
European industry I wanted to touch now

266
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:42,899
about basically the letters you guys

267
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,060
sent to Ursula Von derlain about the CBD

268
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:46,320
fluores seizure so this is a big thing

269
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:47,699
in Ireland at the moment there's a

270
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,120
number of court cases going to happen

271
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:52,200
and it seems to be that uh one thing

272
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,639
that seems to be happening all around

273
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,860
Europe and more so you can understand

274
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:57,659
police and the guards they don't

275
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,339
understand what CBD flare and what's

276
00:10:57,659 --> 00:11:01,019
regular Flair so for them it looks like

277
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:02,519
a duck and it smells like a dog cracks

278
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:05,159
like a dog but then it must be a dog so

279
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:07,019
and how did those letters go that you

280
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:08,939
sent in and was there any reply back

281
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:11,039
from her office

282
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,540
um now we we've got a reply and an

283
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:16,019
acknowledgment

284
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:17,338
um but the situation is this look um I

285
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:18,480
know you have the same situation in

286
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:20,880
Ireland

287
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,579
um but we actually had a law

288
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:26,700
um our law was amended in 2019 like I

289
00:11:23,578 --> 00:11:29,399
said and in that law it says that

290
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:33,600
um cannabis is now going to be

291
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:38,039
considered anything with 0.2 percent THC

292
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:42,540
upwards anything below uh 0.2 percent is

293
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:46,199
not considered cannabis in the law so uh

294
00:11:42,539 --> 00:11:48,719
unfortunately it's being interpreted by

295
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,000
the prosecution in in a different way

296
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,160
you know because they're saying that um

297
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,100
it's cannabis products a sort of CBD

298
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:58,799
sort of products are one thing but CBD

299
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:01,680
flower is another thing so our letter

300
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:03,419
basically to to Wonderland was trying to

301
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:06,179
get some sort of harmonization going

302
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:08,099
where uh we you know just 100 kilometers

303
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:10,919
away from where I am sitting right now

304
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,778
uh in Sicily for example you can you can

305
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:15,599
buy CBD flower from a vending machine

306
00:12:12,778 --> 00:12:17,939
and you can probably cross borders with

307
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,800
it without any problem but in then in

308
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,420
another European country like ours then

309
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:24,059
you will get arrested

310
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:25,620
um your house will be searched your you

311
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:28,439
know they can they can block your

312
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:31,078
finances freezing your finances and and

313
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,420
lock you up for up to 48 hours and this

314
00:12:31,078 --> 00:12:35,699
is actually still happening you know um

315
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:38,519
we're having places rated

316
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:41,220
shops are being raided individuals I'm

317
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:43,919
just buying CBD flour online up to three

318
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:45,778
or four grams are getting arrested and

319
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:48,299
raided as well so there's a lot of

320
00:12:45,778 --> 00:12:50,939
ongoing court cases at the moment so it

321
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:53,458
seems to be a bit messy when it comes to

322
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:55,680
CBD flower so we really would like to

323
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:58,319
see some sort of harmonization and

324
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,399
something to be sorted out as quickly as

325
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,440
possible

326
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:03,778
yeah I think a lot of European entities

327
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,220
are hoping for the exact same thing last

328
00:13:03,778 --> 00:13:07,320
thing I wanted to touch on was basically

329
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:10,019
the 7th of September meeting in Prague

330
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,940
that recently happened we also see that

331
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:13,620
there's a politician from Malta that's

332
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:15,420
part of a European Coalition of

333
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,159
different coalitions sorry of different

334
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:19,259
politicians looking to change the law

335
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:21,179
what can you tell us about the the

336
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:22,559
action that they're they're enacting at

337
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:23,879
the moment and is it going to be of much

338
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,879
use to the industry

339
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:28,500
well I mean at the what what happened

340
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:30,059
over there was obviously a very positive

341
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,399
move it was something we had suggested

342
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:33,778
as well before or just after the law had

343
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,299
come in that we need to get together

344
00:13:33,778 --> 00:13:37,740
with other like-minded countries and try

345
00:13:36,299 --> 00:13:39,599
and move forward together

346
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,980
um especially us being such a small sort

347
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,560
of nation

348
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:45,120
um so it was what they did release a

349
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:46,859
letter obviously they released a

350
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,139
statement after that meeting which which

351
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:51,240
was very positive as well but I do feel

352
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:53,820
that we need other countries to to to

353
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:56,519
join to make it stronger so we can

354
00:13:53,820 --> 00:14:00,180
actually take it to the European Union

355
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:03,240
and discuss it so as a whole

356
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:04,679
um so so that way hopefully things can

357
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,539
move forward obviously let's not forget

358
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:09,179
the the international conventions as

359
00:14:06,539 --> 00:14:11,099
well to deal with so it it is more

360
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:12,359
complex than one might sort of think you

361
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,680
know it's not just something that can be

362
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,300
done overnight

363
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:17,039
um there are a lot of countries that

364
00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:19,078
have to agree if one country wants to

365
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:22,620
legalize uh you know the other countries

366
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:24,838
seem to have to agree as well so it is a

367
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:26,278
bit convoluted so so having these

368
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:27,959
countries getting together even if it

369
00:14:26,278 --> 00:14:31,759
was just a few like you said in in

370
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:34,078
Luxembourg was was a major first step

371
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:36,419
yeah and hopefully there's many more

372
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:38,578
positive steps to come and we have a

373
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:40,259
European wide industry within the next

374
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:43,019
number of years where we can all travel

375
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:44,939
freely and Sample the best cultivars

376
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:46,560
that Europe will have to offer

377
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,120
let's hope and let's hope that Malta

378
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:49,619
will have its own cultivar too and

379
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,419
people will be coming here to taste

380
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:53,100
hours well that's I think that's

381
00:14:51,419 --> 00:14:54,899
everybody's game is that they have their

382
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,339
own identity their own cultivars and

383
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:58,320
their own products that there's no need

384
00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:00,360
for international msos from North

385
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,980
America to come over and set up here

386
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,079
when there's already the talent and the

387
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:06,420
new one stability already here

388
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:07,799
totally agree I think but if we're going

389
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:09,299
to build something it's got to be built

390
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:10,979
from the Grassroots

391
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:12,179
um you know it's the consumers that know

392
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:14,220
what they want

393
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:16,439
um they they might not want the sort of

394
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,180
McDonald's type of cannabis just to to

395
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,220
be the first thing to hit the market so

396
00:15:18,179 --> 00:15:23,278
uh that's why we're kind of really

397
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:25,259
interested and like the the the setup of

398
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:27,120
kind of a social clubs where you can

399
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:28,919
really get to socialize you can get to

400
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,679
meet your peers

401
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:33,299
um and and obviously if anyone ever does

402
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:34,799
develop a problem you know you've got

403
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:36,719
help there then

404
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,639
um you can get educated there's so many

405
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,079
things you can do within a can of a

406
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,778
social club

407
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:44,338
um with the consumers so I look forward

408
00:15:42,778 --> 00:15:46,019
to see this spreading around Europe

409
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:48,300
faster than any sort of big business

410
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:50,220
taking over yeah I couldn't agree with

411
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:51,359

next 12 months and we can get an update

415
