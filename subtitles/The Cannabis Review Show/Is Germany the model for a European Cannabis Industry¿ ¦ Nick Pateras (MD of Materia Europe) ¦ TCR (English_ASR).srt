00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,359
things happen in europe over the next

11
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,039
couple of years so

12
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,240
get to here good to hear some inside

13
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,920
information from one of the leading

14
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:29,358
companies out there so

15
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,800
do you basically want to give everybody

16
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,079
a little quick overview of how you got

17
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,439
into the cannabis into yourself and how

18
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,000
you found yourself material and we'll

19
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:38,079
move into our first topic then

20
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,600
yeah sure so so my personal background

21
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,719
is actually in the more traditional

22
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,640
pharma space

23
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,079
um and healthcare space so i spent most

24
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,480
of my career actually working for

25
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,439
johnston johnson when i was based in

26
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,558
toronto

27
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:51,198
so um i helped with helped run some of

28
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:53,599
their

29
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:54,479
otc businesses and some of their rx

30
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,840
businesses as well

31
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:59,439
it's more on the commercial strategy

32
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,520
side and then um after a few years there

33
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:03,439
was looking for something more um

34
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,799
something probably

35
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:06,798
something smaller where i could make

36
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,479
more of an impact the cannabis space

37
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,200
wasn't something that i thought about

38
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:11,519
uh too early but around 2016 it started

39
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,359
to

40
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:14,959
attract my attention and i joined a

41
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:17,040
small tech company called lift

42
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:19,199
co which was well known in the canadian

43
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,280
industry for the expos that it put on

44
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,640
every year attracted thousands tens of

45
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,439
thousands of consumers

46
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,879
um every year to its two shows um and i

47
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:27,199
joined as an early stage employee i

48
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:29,839
think

49
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,719
employee number seven and uh we had a

50
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,280
great uh

51
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,879
we had a great series of three years

52
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,320
together uh where we scaled the company

53
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:37,839
up to 70 employees

54
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:40,000
there was a go public in the middle

55
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,960
there and added a few businesses to

56
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,680
it by way of a retail training program a

57
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:47,199
data analytics business as well

58
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,040
and then coming to the end of that time

59
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,799
i i felt as though i wanted to be closer

60
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,079
to the plant and i was also really keen

61
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,118
on what was happening in the european

62
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,000
market

63
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:57,438
that timed well with when the material

64
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,680
project was being put together

65
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:00,639
by deepak and michael garba the other

66
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,920
co-founder

67
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,840
and so they asked me to join the

68
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,040
management team and in doing so i

69
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,280
relocated

70
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,280
back to london which is my my place of

71
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,959
birth and so i'm now based in london

72
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,199
overseeing our european operations here

73
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,479
amazing brilliant and well get straight

74
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:17,919
into the topics because there's a lot of

75
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,519
things that i'd love to have a

76
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:20,799
more than 15 minutes with you because i

77
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,159
think there's a lot of exciting things

78
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,599
happen in europe and you guys seem to be

79
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:25,199
at one of the forefronts of it

80
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:27,598
can you tell me the strategy that

81
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:29,519
material have for the cannabis industry

82
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:31,119
in europe what exactly is your position

83
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,920
here in this

84
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,759
yeah so we've got two two business units

85
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:37,039
and the primary one is really focused on

86
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:39,199
medical cannabis

87
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:40,560
so on the medical cannabis side we do

88
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,039
processing and distribution

89
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,360
so our cornerstone asset is a facility

90
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:47,199
that we have been building out in malta

91
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,959
just to be clear we don't do cultivation

92
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:50,318
we never will we think it's a very

93
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,120
technical um

94
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:54,479
skill set to actually get agriculture of

95
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,719
agricultural operations

96
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,598
of a plant like cannabis right

97
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,239
especially

98
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:00,639
in an eugmp environment and of course

99
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,158
that

100
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:04,719
vertical we think is going to become

101
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:06,799
increasingly more competitive as all the

102
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,080
uh the sunnier more tropical climates

103
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,920
actually come online too

104
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,599
so right from the get-go right from the

105
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:12,799
initial architecture of the company we

106
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:13,840
decided that we didn't want to do

107
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,439
cultivation

108
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,959
so in malta what we're actually doing is

109
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:20,719
processing a flower into

110
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:23,759
eugmp and extraction as well

111
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:26,878
so that allows us to actually develop

112
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:28,000
and release qp release products into the

113
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,639
european market

114
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,360
from outside of europe that's where the

115
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:33,119
cornerstone

116
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,720
asset uh we've been working on it for

117
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,280
about two years now

118
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:39,439
and it's quite close to um it's quite

119
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,120
close to finalization and licensure so

120
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:43,199
we're excited about that

121
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,959
and then we stitched that processing

122
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,079
ability together with our distribution

123
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,759
asset in germany

124
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,200
so about a year ago we acquired a

125
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:50,719
company that

126
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,399
was almost fully licensed for

127
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:53,680
distribution we got it to the final

128
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,158
stage of licensing

129
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,438
and then actually um have been trading

130
00:03:56,158 --> 00:03:59,759
in third party products

131
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:00,799
since then and so uh those are the two

132
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,199
pieces that we actually stitched

133
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,760
together on the medical cannabis site

134
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:07,438
yeah i was doing upon my research i saw

135
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,598
that acquisition last year that you guys

136
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:10,719
had in the eu gmp certification coming

137
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:12,560
through in january

138
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:13,598
so it seems to be things are moving in

139
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,959
the right direction with the right

140
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:17,680
amount of energy behind them

141
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,199
the next topic i want to talk about is

142
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,600
the mergers and acquisitions that we're

143
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,720
having so far this year do you see 2021

144
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,560
being the year that

145
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,840
the consolidation happens in europe or

146
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,280
do you still think we're way off from

147
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:30,079
that we're just kind of having our

148
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:31,679
first initial tease of these big deals

149
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,159
um i definitely think it's going to be

150
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,478
the first

151
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,680
wave of m a for sure i think you'll see

152
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:37,599
like like we've

153
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,280
seen in the canadian market and to an

154
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,120
extent in the u.s market these things

155
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,239
don't concentrate in a single 12-month

156
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,800
period

157
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,400
but i think the first semblance of

158
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,280
consolidation will definitely happen in

159
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:49,918
europe now

160
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,319
partly because the european market is

161
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:52,240
i'm

162
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:53,360
starting to become more understood

163
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,280
globally

164
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,360
the opportunity size is being

165
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:58,719
appreciated and i think now

166
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,720
when the first few players actually

167
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,720
start to engage in m a activity

168
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,479
um that really queues a lot more energy

169
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,160
and interest in other types of m a so

170
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:08,000
when we saw the cura leaf

171
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,439
mac deal recently i think that spawned a

172
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,680
whole bunch of energy and excitement

173
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,759
about what europe represents

174
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,120
yeah i think it's whether you're missing

175
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,400
your friends going to the club or

176
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,840
whether it's the investors missing out

177
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:20,000
in the big opportunities that fear are

178
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:22,079
missing out gently drives a lot of

179
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,079
footfall towards big deals

180
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:26,159
yeah i think it also reflects um you

181
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:26,800
know the general investment thesis on

182
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,400
just

183
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,319
broadening an addressable market

184
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:31,120
broadening a market that is going to at

185
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:33,519
some point

186
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,199
in the future not positing as to when

187
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:37,519
but eventually have recreational

188
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,120
access open up as we we know a couple of

189
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:41,198
countries are already working on either

190
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,319
recreational bills or recreational uh

191
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,560
pilot programs

192
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:45,680
so for a big company like cure leave uh

193
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,319
which has you know

194
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,879
us opening up in in terms of whether

195
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:50,959
it's

196
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:53,038
banking access or whatever in the us and

197
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:54,959
they're actually looking beyond the us

198
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:56,639
i think it's a strong signal for what

199
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:59,918
europe actually represents as a

200
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,120
whole other market to tap into yeah no i

201
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:04,240
couldn't agree with you more

202
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,680
and do you see basically the amount of

203
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,360
people i've talked and like from the

204
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,120
bureau of cannabis in california or the

205
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,038
department of marijuana enforcement to

206
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,000
colorado everybody says that medical is

207
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,079
just a

208
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,600
conduit for recreational and that seems

209
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:17,519
to be where the money is and where

210
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,639
the best regulation can happen when it

211
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:20,560
gets to that level

212
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,360
because in in essence a lot of consumers

213
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,639
could be paying a specific price for a

214
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,639
product that they could have a multitude

215
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,439
range from when it becomes recreational

216
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,000
do you see the the model of pharmacies

217
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:32,478
and

218
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,240
the sales true pharmacies being the

219
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:36,639
model for the next few years or do you

220
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,639
see that turning into dispensaries and

221
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,879
let's say independent independent craft

222
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,639
growers like with wine let's say

223
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:44,319
you're going to have a specific strain

224
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,240
for each country your master grows in

225
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,759
each country and then it's who owns

226
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,598
the distribution rights to these

227
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,199
genetics will be the model

228
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:52,639
yeah it's an interesting question i

229
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,160
definitely think anytime

230
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,918
adult uses legalize where there's a

231
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,360
pre-existing medical framework there's

232
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:00,639
always a clash between the two

233
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,000
we saw it in canada um where prices and

234
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,680
certain products

235
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,160
might not be available or might not be

236
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,400
at eq at equal levels

237
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,080
between the two frameworks in europe you

238
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:11,679
have an interesting uh position because

239
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,519
everything is sold through pharmacies

240
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,038
which is not the case in north america

241
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:16,399
the canadian lps who

242
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:18,399
sell medically sell directly to

243
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,560
consumers or patients sorry

244
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:22,159
um on the medical side in the us

245
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,639
obviously there are medical cannabis

246
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,840
specific dispensaries and we're in where

247
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,720
europe everything is dispensed through a

248
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:29,519
pharmacy

249
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,599
so i think what the potential is as

250
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:32,478
europe tiptoes towards recreational

251
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:35,120
access

252
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:36,800
is actually governments will probably

253
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,879
have adult use cannabis dispensed

254
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,240
through pharmacies as well to begin with

255
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:42,800
which is the model that they actually

256
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,519
employ in uruguay

257
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,840
that allows them to kind of uh

258
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:49,598
grandfather in a legacy framework it's

259
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:51,598
probably a system that

260
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:52,959
raises less eyebrows and raises less

261
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:55,439
concern over

262
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:56,638
diversion of products the other thing

263
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:59,120
too of course to remember

264
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,759
is recreational cannabis unless there's

265
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,240
a change

266
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,759
uh at the un treaty level then there's

267
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,918
never going to be able to have

268
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,038
um cannabis that actually flows across

269
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:08,799
national borders

270
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:10,159
so any adult use cannabis was going to

271
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,960
have to be grown and produced

272
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,520
in country whereas medical cannabis can

273
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,719
cross national borders so you also have

274
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:18,799
what's probably going to be a bit of a

275
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,280
patchwork of mini markets established

276
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,960
once europe is fully recreational just

277
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:24,399
like you have in the u.s right now

278
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:25,918
where it's basically a system of

279
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:27,519
different states with slightly different

280
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:29,120
frameworks

281
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:31,120
and tell me this one of the things that

282
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,840
i'm kind of predicting that being an

283
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,799
irish man

284
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:36,240
it's i i like to think that the industry

285
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,319
is going to be the exact same as we have

286
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,959
the heads of ibm here heads of facebook

287
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,399
google

288
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,000
everybody has their global headquarters

289
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,200
here i understand you guys are a malted

290
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,120
the two corporate tax rates are

291
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,440
obviously a big influence in the company

292
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,120
taking a position somewhere so i think

293
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,120
ireland could end up being the country

294
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,919
that services the european cannabis

295
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,240
industry through

296
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:56,240
the service companies we might not have

297
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,240
the hugest grow operations or

298
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,519
the best extraction facilities but we

299
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,320
have a highly intelligent young

300
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,919
workforce

301
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,600
we're the only english-speaking country

302
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:05,278
left in the eu now

303
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,200
i think there's going to be a lot of

304
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,480
advantages to the positions of companies

305
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,879
taken over here

306
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,720
what was the decision making between

307
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:13,439
malta and any other country was it just

308
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,278
a corporate

309
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,640
tax rate which is a completely uh uh

310
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:20,240
perfect reason to choose that it's

311
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:21,600
something that i'd probably do myself if

312
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,879
i was setting up in europe and not from

313
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,399
europe

314
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:26,320
yeah i mean the corporate tax rate was

315
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,320
obviously uh a part of our decision for

316
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,879
sure as a so for viewers who aren't

317
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,160
familiar

318
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:31,679
as a foreign health entity you can

319
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:33,039
actually reduce your your effective

320
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:34,958
corporate tax rate down to

321
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,879
five percent which is a massive decline

322
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:39,199
from the usual 30-35

323
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:40,080
um so that's there's massive tax savings

324
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,320
there but

325
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,839
uh outside of that we were also really

326
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,800
attracted to the way the maltese

327
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,600
government has been approaching the

328
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:48,479
cannabis file

329
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,879
for the last number of years so in terms

330
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,959
of the

331
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,919
the medical legislation and subsequent

332
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,439
regulation they

333
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:55,599
they implemented they're very

334
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,040
progressive and we've also found

335
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,040
since coming in because they were

336
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:59,599
obviously doing work to attract foreign

337
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,599
investment

338
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,040
into the country that they have really

339
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,040
been as supportive

340
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:06,480
and uh as incredible as we would have

341
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:08,240
hoped they would have been by way of

342
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,839
addressing any questions that we have

343
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,480
working through the licensing process

344
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,560
with us

345
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,240
almost as a partner rather than just as

346
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:15,278
solely as a regular that shows up at the

347
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,440
very end

348
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:18,320
um of the journey so we've been very

349
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,600
happy with that

350
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,600
and of course the other piece with malta

351
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,200
that's um that's on a

352
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,560
on a commercial basis but allows us to

353
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,839
do things that a lot of other european

354
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:28,559
countries do not

355
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,600
is basically processing non-eu gmp

356
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:31,919
certified flour

357
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,440
into eu gmp certified flower that's a

358
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:35,599
really important nuance

359
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,360
that not many uh countries actually

360
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,120
permit for right now

361
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,120
um and so for us what that does it

362
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,799
diversifies our supply chain

363
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,320
of course we have to do a full audit

364
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:45,199
process of the supplier to make sure

365
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,240
they're still up to certain

366
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,440
specifications

367
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,600
but they don't actually have to have

368
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,000
been inspected and certified by

369
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,040
a european regulator for us to import

370
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,958
their biomass

371
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:56,319
as starting raw material that's a huge

372
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:58,559
differentiator for us

373
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,839
and it kind of changes and distinguishes

374
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:02,719
our business model from most other

375
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,640
operators in europe

376
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,320
okay brilliant yet this has been highly

377
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,240
informative so far i'll leave you with

378
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,160
one last thing if you could predict how

379
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,560
europe is going to go over the next

380
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:14,240
five years do you see recreation within

381
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:16,639
five years or do you see a dominant

382
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,919
pharmaceutical distribution model within

383
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:20,879
five years

384
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:22,719
i see most european countries enabling

385
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:23,600
or broadening the medical cannabis laws

386
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,879
that they have today

387
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,320
and i hope that we can get to a place

388
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:28,720
where within five years the entire

389
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,920
european bloc

390
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,680
and the uk have full medical access

391
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:34,879
programs where any patient in need of a

392
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:37,199
cannabis medicine

393
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:38,639
is able to get it i don't see much

394
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,200
movement in the next five years

395
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:43,039
on the adult use side outside of the the

396
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,240
experiments the trials that we already

397
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:45,679
know of so

398
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,278
we know the dutch are putting a system

399
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:48,479
in place uh we know switzerland is

400
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:51,039
putting a system in place

401
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,839
for for effectively on an experimental

402
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:53,519
basis

403
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,360
i think those will go well those will

404
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,200
start in the next 12 months

405
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,360
um and then we'll probably while we

406
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,800
won't have implementation of auto use

407
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,919
programs in the next five years i do

408
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:05,278
expect that you've got some

409
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:07,199
bigger economies debating it sincerely

410
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:08,799
and on the cusp of implementing adult

411
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,560
use i would hope

412
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:11,838
yeah i think italy might be one of those

413
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:13,359
and we are you've everybody's heard the

414
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,720
rumblings of luxembourg it's

415
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,399
where how quickly that gets through

416
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,000
their parliament is another thing i

417
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,278
think what you highlighted malta's

418
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,759
government being open

419
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:23,600
to the capital investment coming in and

420
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:25,759
having a strategic plan to

421
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,360
to lure that investment in is a great

422
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:28,159
model that any country i wish our

423
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,639
government

424
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:32,399
would be able to be as uh have as much

425
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,919
foresight and intelligence as malta

426
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,360
seems to have had so

427
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,799
thanks a million for calling on the show

428

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,519
for you this year and

431
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,200
