cannabis law expert on the show and we

00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,800

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,278
the irish industry do you want to maybe

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,800
give everybody an overview of

14
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:32,799
your position in the industry and how

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,039
you got to where you're okay so by way

16
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:38,238
of background i'm a barrister uh by

17
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:40,000
profession um i qualified in 1999 and

18
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:42,320
practiced for 14 years in the dublin

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,359
eastern circuit but i've also been an

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,159
academic lawyer for the last 23 years

21
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:50,479
i'm in around 2013 as academic students

22
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:52,640
looking for a new research field and the

23
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:54,718
area of drug policy regulation and law

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,640
reform immediately kind of spoke to mind

25
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,640
and piqued my interest and i suppose

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,558
what kind of entered me into the

27
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,558
industry i suppose like many lawyers was

28
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,478
being in court one day and seeing a

29
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:06,478
young man being prosecuted for

30
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:09,200
possession of a small amount of cannabis

31
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:10,400
in this case was about 22 euro i

32
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,760
remember looking at the judge and

33
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,200
looking at the other lawyers in the

34
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,840
court and kind of feeling a certain

35
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,000
amount of unease about this and so the

36
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,079
question kind of came to my mind

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,159
why is cannabis

38
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:24,640
prohibited and that really started a

39
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,240
journey which coincided i suppose with

40
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,200
the movement in the united states

41
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:31,919
principally in washington and colorado

42
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,799
by way of popular ballot initiatives to

43
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,719
regulate cannabis uh for adult use so

44
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,880
when it started with this question of

45
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,719
why and went back to the origins and it

46
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:43,199
discovered that cannabis has been

47
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:45,640
subject to international controls really

48
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,640
since the second opium convention in

49
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,560
1925 under the league of nations the

50
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,599
curious thing about it was that cannabis

51
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,079
was not in fact on the agenda as the

52
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:57,519
title of the actual convention was opium

53
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:01,279
but there was a dispute between the

54
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:03,759
united states and the united kingdom

55
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,079
over opium controls and it was into this

56
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:09,280
kind of gap that this islamic

57
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:11,919
fundamentalist and egyptian diplomats by

58
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,360
the name of muhammad al-quindi sort of

59
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:17,519
put indian hemp on the agenda and he was

60
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,520
coming from that as was islamic point of

61
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,640
view of any intoxicant is bad

62
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,400
particularly the subhashish in egypt but

63
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:26,639
there was also an ulterior motive

64
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,439
because indian hemp of course was a

65
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:31,839
major competitor to in to egypt's cash

66
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:35,919
crop which was of course

67
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,840
uh cotton so by kind of exploiting this

68
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:41,280
dispute between the united states and

69
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,800
britain uh cannabis ended under uh ended

70
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,280
up being subject to international

71
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,680
controls and by virtue of that uh the

72
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,640
united kingdom and uh introduced the

73
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,439
dangerous drugs act of 1928 the british

74
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:57,119
medical association were dead against it

75
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:58,878
and by extension in ireland in 1934 now

76
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,920
then we move to the united states and we

77
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:03,439
see how it really is an enterprising

78
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,199
bureaucrat by the name of harry

79
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:07,439
ainslinger

80
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:09,679
who works as federal bureau of narcotics

81
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,519
and he's seeking to effectively build an

82
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,760
empire for himself

83
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,400
in the area of drug control and he

84
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:18,158
ceases upon the use of marijuana in

85
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,120
terms of his popularly used in the

86
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:23,439
united states among i suppose mexicans

87
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,000
of the time and african americans in

88
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:28,479
louisiana and icelander was racist

89
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,360
there's no doubt about that and by using

90
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:34,719
marijuana to kind of platform himself he

91
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,640
built this empire of drug control and

92
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,799
prolonged his career which really went

93
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:40,958
up until the 1960s and he was one of the

94
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,760
primary architects of international

95
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,560
cannabis prohibition most notably the

96
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:48,639
single narcotics drugs convention and of

97
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,959
course by virtue of that the united

98
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:53,279
states way behind it the nixon

99
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,239
administration uh introducing the

100
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,640
controlled substances act 1971

101
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,719
and again you know as part of their

102
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:03,119
policy in other words good politics but

103
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:05,680
bad policy they really seized upon the

104
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,080
likes of the steve psychedelics and

105
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,319
cannabis in particular as a political

106
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,239
stick to i suppose beat their opponents

107
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:15,039
and we see the war on drugs kicking off

108
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:18,079
in the 1970s and then being reiterated

109
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:20,478
by the reagan administration so what we

110
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,560
have is this prohibition which of course

111
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:26,639
outsources i suppose

112
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:29,519
the cultivation distribution sale

113
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,519
of cannabis really to organize crime and

114
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:35,680
the rest is history so what we see

115
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:39,198
around 2012 2013 is really the beginning

116
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,040
of the end of this prohibition cycle um

117
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,879
that really has been with us for almost

118
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,479
century and that's where i became

119
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,719
particularly interested in in other

120
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:50,478
words how you transition something from

121
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,400
prohibition uh to regulation

122
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:54,159
okay amazing great overview for

123
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:56,879
everybody

124
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,439
thank you very much and basically first

125
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,519
topic i wanted to jump into with is the

126
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:03,038
argument for legal cannabis in ireland

127
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:05,120
we see tomorrow that the justice

128
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:07,120
committee are having a meeting on a

129
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,199
possession of 3 p.m

130
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,800
what do you think is the main factor

131
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,160
that the politicians should be looking

132
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,960
at when we're talking about illegal

133
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,120
cannabis in ireland is it taxation jobs

134
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,319
social equity removing the catch from

135
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,439
the drug leaders what do you think is

136
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:21,360
the primary

137
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:23,120
all of those issues really i think the

138
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,560
focus of the justice committee tomorrow

139
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,000
is largely on the area of

140
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,000
decriminalization for

141
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,560
the major controlled drugs whether we're

142
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,160
talking about heroin cocaine

143
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:39,918
psychedelics cannabis lsg the ones that

144
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:42,400
are typically say used for recreational

145
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:44,560
use but your criminalization is really

146
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:47,279
just prohibition light it's very similar

147
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,120
to what happened in the united states

148
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:51,439
under alcohol prohibition in other words

149
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,918
you can possess it how you could consume

150
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:56,160
it but you cannot produce or sell it so

151
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:58,000
decriminalization is part of the overall

152
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,080
scheme of harm reduction measures and

153
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,680
that itself is a good thing particularly

154
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:03,359
for those with problematic drug use

155
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,560
through the criminal justice system has

156
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,960
penalized

157
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,280
but in terms of how i would approach uh

158
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:10,799
the subject i see cannabis is slightly

159
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:13,439
different and what we need is really is

160
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,600
a customized approach to dealing with

161
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:18,240
these different drugs and regulation is

162
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,319
really the one that best suits cannabis

163
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,560
in other words the era of global

164
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,240
cannabis prohibition is coming to an end

165
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,800
it's not no longer a question of

166
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,280
countries like ireland regulating

167
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,520
cannabis for what we call adult use it's

168
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:34,959
not it's really just a question of when

169
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:37,359
and how we go about it is perhaps the

170
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:39,120
thing that we must consider so

171
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,160
at the moment what we have is an

172
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,600
unregulated illicit market which affords

173
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,000
no protection

174
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,240
to those who choose to consume cannabis

175
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,279
for you know their own use those who are

176
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,759
self-medicating but come outside the

177
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:56,000
scope of our very restrictive medical

178
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,598
cannabis access program most notably

179
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,839
people who are suffering from chronic

180
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:01,120
pain and i suppose inevitably you're

181
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,478
going to get teenagers who are

182
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,319
experimenting

183
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:06,318
with the use of soft drugs whether it's

184
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,319
mdma or ecstasy

185
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,479
or indeed cannabis now that's not an

186
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,479
ideal situation because no drug is made

187
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:15,279
safer in the hands of criminal gangs so

188
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:16,800
the responsible way to approach this is

189
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:19,000
neither prohibition doesn't work the

190
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,360
penalization of people who use it

191
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,439
decriminalization allows organized crime

192
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,919
to continue supplying a market while not

193
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:28,160
prosecuting people for use but then the

194
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:31,519
sensible approach is then well why not

195
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:34,880
sit down design a regulatory model which

196
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:37,439
provides for product safety from seed to

197
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:39,279
sales so that we can oversee the process

198
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:41,279
and design it in such a way that we

199
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:43,439
protect public health better than a

200
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:45,279
system where which is unregulated and

201
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:48,160
illicit and just as a point of

202
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:50,959
observation supposing you have a 17 year

203
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,199
old child who is experimenting now at

204
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:55,359
this moment in time there are no

205
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,400
controls in other words all this person

206
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,560
has to do is to know when to buy where

207
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:02,560
to buy and have the money there's no id

208
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,879
requirements there's no product safety

209
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,959
there's nothing now ideally when we're

210
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,680
talking about adults is it's a better

211
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:11,198
situation uh we would prefer a better

212
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,840
situation where you know you have

213
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,240
dispensaries uh cultivators who are

214
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,679
licensed subject to product control

215
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,079
safeties and all the sort of things that

216
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,240
we would you know we would associate

217
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:25,598
with i suppose agricultural products

218
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,800
food products uh alcohol beverages and

219
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:30,639
indeed tobacco so this is the preferred

220
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,639
and the better route and this is what

221
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,479
has happened in 19 states in the united

222
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:36,158
states um

223
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:40,560
and increasingly more countries starting

224
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:44,799
with uruguay in 2013 canada in 2018

225
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:48,159
um south africa um georgia uh mexico

226
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:50,000
coming on stream uh malta in 2021 and

227
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:51,919
obviously in the next year and a half

228
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,919
germany the largest country in the

229
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:56,319
european union and this is where the

230
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:57,838
domino effect kicks in in other words we

231
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,160
will then see other countries in the

232
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,000
european union uh most likely we're

233
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,159
looking at luxembourg we're looking at

234
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,559
belgium the netherlands has moved

235
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:08,639
towards a licensing system

236
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:11,199
in terms of cultivation they had a

237
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,080
decriminalized model since 1976 and

238
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,560
again the problems with

239
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,879
decriminalization were obvious there and

240
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:19,039
then we will see france italy and so on

241
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:21,838
and so forth so it's not a question of

242
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:23,679
if ireland regulates for abuse it's the

243
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,440
question of when rather than put it on

244
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:27,599
the long finger and

245
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,000
go down the incrementalist approach

246
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,159
which i think are kind of conservative

247
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,159
political establishment or i suppose

248
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,838
attempting to do

249
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:38,319
you should go about it in a more

250
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,000
pragmatic consistent fashion and look at

251
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,760
what germany has done over the last

252
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,240
number of weeks by having hearings with

253
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:45,838
over 200 witnesses designing the

254
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,480
legislation which

255
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,720
should come on board in the next uh six

256
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,680
months and then having a regulation

257
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,200
market up and running by early 2024 so

258
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:56,719
that is the preferred route to go

259
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,480
forward

260
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,399
okay incredible so that basically

261
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,000
outlines the argument for legal cannabis

262
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,320
smith the other question i wanted to ask

263
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,639
is the politics against us is this a

264
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,560
case of senior civil servants into the

265
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:10,559
department of health and a lack of

266
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:11,599
leadership in all of the main political

267
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,518
parties

268
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,200
is it a is there kickback from one

269
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,560
specific area do you think or do you

270
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,360
think nobody just wants to take this

271
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:21,199
ball and run with it with the fear

272
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,800
there's a couple of factors here i think

273
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,480
most politicians who i've had an

274
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:26,879
opportunity to talk to it are quite

275
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,039
pragmatic and they understand uh the

276
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:31,120
arguments in favor and you know they're

277
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,799
just taking their time about going about

278
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,600
it they don't want to make any huge

279
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:37,120
jumps and that's political conservatism

280
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,560
there's a small

281
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:43,120
and very vocal group within the medical

282
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:44,879
profession who've been extremely active

283
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,120
in i suppose putting forward the

284
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:49,838
argument of reefer madness something

285
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:53,519
which stems back to the 1930s uh

286
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,959
propagated by ainslinger and his pals uh

287
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,360
in the federal

288
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:58,958
bureau of narcotics controls

289
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,519
but the interesting thing was the

290
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:03,278
american medical association and the

291
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,078
british medical association back in the

292
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:08,320
1930s were totally against it in terms

293
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:10,479
of politicians i suppose in every single

294
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,640
party within the rochester that was to

295
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,278
say for regulation but there is this

296
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:18,480
element of i suppose the specter of our

297
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:20,720
conservative past uh in other words

298
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,480
the conservative tale kind of wagging

299
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,800
the dog but ireland is a far more

300
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,959
progressive country as we have seen in

301
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:29,679
recent referendums such as the same sex

302
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:31,119
such as abortion and other issues so i

303
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:32,639
think if if

304
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,240
if this was a matter that actually went

305
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,480
to a public vote of course it's not a

306
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,759
constitutional issue uh i don't think

307
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,120
there would be any doubt about it the

308
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:41,039
overwhelming majority of the irish

309
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,039
public would probably vote in favor but

310
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:45,439
however it is a matter of parliamentary

311
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:47,120
legislation and so yes there are

312
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,880
conservative elements within the civil

313
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,519
service that is not damaged there are

314
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:53,838
conservatives within the major political

315
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,480
parties but i think they are starting to

316
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,480
open up and see what is happening and

317
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,519
realizing that you know it's only a

318
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:05,360
matter of when not a question of it

319
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,720
yeah no very well put um for the

320
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,519
for the last question actually just when

321
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,639
we were talking about it there um

322
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,159
do you see a case where basically the

323
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,000
next topic i wanted to discuss you've

324
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:18,240
got a number of cases basically against

325
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,159
the doh and somewhere against the dpp

326
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,959
basically on the sale of cbd products in

327
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:25,360
ireland do you see a scenario within the

328
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:26,719
next 12 months where there will be cbd

329
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,200
dispensaries

330
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,720
selling flour to the public

331
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,560
well

332
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,959
that's a real possibility those matters

333
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:36,958
are of course subject to say so i really

334
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:39,119
can comment on precisely what the

335
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,719
outcomes of this case will be

336
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,799
yes there is a there's a possibility of

337
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,440
course in other jurisdictions you see

338
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:47,120
this in greece for example you see it in

339
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,000
the netherlands you see it in germany

340
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,159
etc so again you can make the extension

341
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,799
that this will happen there is of course

342
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:56,719
challenges uh for i suppose policing

343
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:58,479
because you know sometimes very head is

344
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:02,320
difficult to make a distinction between

345
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:05,278
raw hemp flour and of course you know um

346
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,120
cannabis of high thc components so

347
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:09,200
it's a slow process and maybe there is

348
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,240
an argument that really we should have

349
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,480
legislation governing cbd to begin with

350
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,000
but i don't see any impetus from any of

351
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,278
the governing parties at the moment but

352
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,399
that's you know something that can be

353
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:20,000
put out there

354
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,639
okay amazing and just another one that

355
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,120
had done your last topic so basically

356
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,278
the to legalize cannabis in ireland this

357
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,519
can't be brought for a vote by the

358
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:31,200
public it has to be done internally in

359
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,039
in the realm of politics is that's

360
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,839
correct this is correct of course

361
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:37,919
because ireland is a signatory to the

362
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,480
single narcotics conventions of the

363
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:43,599
amending conventions like trump

364
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:46,240
inventions etc etc but um our law

365
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,320
governing drugs uh controls is the

366
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,198
misuse of drugs act 1977 which is

367
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,920
effectively a copy largely of the 1971

368
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:56,159
act in the u in the united kingdom so it

369
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:59,120
is exclusively a matter for the

370
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:01,600
europeans uh to legislate for but there

371
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,159
is nothing to actually preclude the allo

372
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,399
raptors from passing a bill and that

373
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:08,319
bill could put something to a public

374
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,919
plan besides republic vote that's not

375
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,278
recruited by our law now it doesn't

376
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,838
necessarily mean that that would be

377
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:16,559
binding um it's more like a reference

378
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,320
than anything else so uh but i don't see

379
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:21,679
that happening because parliamentarians

380
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,600
don't tend to like to give away um their

381
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:26,000
soul power and the so power of the

382
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,000
erectus is of course to make law the

383
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,799
executive is of course to implement that

384
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,799
law uh etc so i don't see that happening

385
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:33,919
but you know there's about there the

386
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:35,599
interesting thing we've seen over the

387
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:38,000
last number of years is of course the

388
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,040
creation of these citizens assemblies

389
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,320
now

390
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:42,000
the argument is well isn't the

391
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,760
parliament the citizens assembly to

392
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,759
begin with why are you outsourcing this

393
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:48,159
to other people but this is a very

394
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,360
popular model at the moment and really i

395
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:51,838
think they've kind of kicked the cam

396
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,000
down a little bit to next year so there

397
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,680
is an assembly that will listen to the

398
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,919
whole issues about

399
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:59,919
decriminalization etc and i really think

400
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:02,000
that a cannabis regulation should form

401
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:04,159
part of that and bringing in the experts

402
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,320
from the likes of camera who is of

403
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:08,000
course the regulatory body in the likes

404
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,600
of the united states where these are the

405
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,278
people who are civil servants who deal

406
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,278
with it on a day-to-day basis in the

407
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:15,198
regulated states they have phenomenal

408
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:16,958
expertise and they can tell you the

409
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:19,359
mistakes that were made initially the

410
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:21,198
successes and the way forward to making

411
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,759
this work in other words regulation

412
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:25,919
takes time and the object of regulation

413
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:27,679
of course is two-fold first of all one

414
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:29,838
would have to say we want to remove

415
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:31,599
organized crime from the equation but

416
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,360
secondly you do want to protect public

417
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,959
health at the moment we have the worst

418
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,879
of all worlds we have this prohibition

419
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:38,479
that doesn't work and this feels

420
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:40,399
organized crime and no drug is made

421
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,079
safer to the public and therefore all

422
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,480
the kind of extreme sort of things that

423
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:46,000
can happen with any bad

424
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,079
product um

425
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,039
in the market happens under prohibition

426
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:52,719
so regulation is the root for

427
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:54,719
okay brilliant last thing before i let

428
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,000
you go is can you explain to everybody

429
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,600
what the incba is and

430
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,559
certainly a great role that they have in

431
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,120
the industry

432
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:05,359
so the incba is the representative body

433
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,360
for lawyers who work in the regulated

434
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,879
cannabis industry and relation industry

435
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,879
such as industry it was founded in 2015

436
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:16,320
by three women lawyers in bartlett in

437
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:18,480
california amanda conley chad malik

438
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,560
laura de caro and then subsequently

439
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,680
joined by mary shapiro and it's largely

440
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:23,518
driven by women which is very

441
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:25,919
interesting and has grown to over a

442
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,639
thousand lawyers in the united states

443
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:31,198
and beyond and so it is expanding so

444
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,198
it's really loyal you know a body of

445
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:35,519
representative lawyers providing you

446
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:37,919
know ice assistance education for

447
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,679
lawyers who work in the industry and

448
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:42,000
that's very important because as the

449
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:44,239
industry grows in the regulation markets

450
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,559
whether it's for adult use whether it's

451
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,480
for medical use uh whether it's

452
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:50,719
industrial hemp and the relation

453
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,360
products that come with this you need

454
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,800
experienced lawyers who know this area

455
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,278
um you know really you know when you

456
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:59,278
mention cannabis law too people

457
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:00,799
look at you kind of strangely agree in

458
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:02,399
our own profession but then you have to

459
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:04,240
remind them that this is black letter

460
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,279
law we're dealing with everything from

461
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:10,959
international law european law medical

462
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:13,918
law pharmaceutical law drug policy

463
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:16,318
regulation licensing transactions

464
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,079
product liability

465
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:19,838
mergers and acquisitions and so on and

466
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:21,279
so forth so this is why you need

467
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:24,159
experienced lawyers and this is why the

468
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:26,160
incba exists to provide you know the

469
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,160
education the resources for those who

470
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,240
are in the area and obviously to develop

471
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,480
academic programs in the colleges and

472
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,079
universities and they're already largely

473
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,759
in existence in the united states and

474
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:38,480
harvard and yale and many of the ivy

475
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:41,679
league schools northwestern um

476
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,120
vanderbilt and rutgers etc so my job is

477
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,960
going to assist that process in

478
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:47,279
developing academic programs in the

479
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,400
united states and in europe but also as

480
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:52,399
a member of the international committee

481
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,240
