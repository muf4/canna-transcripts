I'd make sure you guys are one of the

11
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:26,459
stars of the show with the UK CBD world

12
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:28,859
at the moment so I was great to talk to

13
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,599
the the top companies in the industry do

14
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:32,759
you maybe want to give everybody a quick

15
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,159
60 second overview of how you found

16
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,659
yourself at nature can and founding that

17
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:41,640
with your partner

18
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:43,558
definitely yes so but my sort of CBD

19
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,359
Journey started about five years ago

20
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:47,339
when I first started looking into the

21
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:49,859
product and seeing that it was looking

22
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:53,039
like it was being legalized and in

23
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:55,859
Europe in 2018 obviously

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,960
um so I went out there looked at sort of

25
00:00:55,859 --> 00:01:00,539
how we were going to set up a supply

26
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,120
chain basically that was going to be a

27
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,859
little bit future-proofed on the THC

28
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,079
side because it was a bit High over in

29
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:08,579
the in the us at the time the sort of

30
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:10,019
limits and everything well still it

31
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:13,920
still is

32
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:17,099
um so I set up a supply agreement over

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,400
in Oregon over in the states and then

34
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:23,640
luckily met Andy Duckworth who's my

35
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,219
partner he was the CEO of my protein

36
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:30,299
so he built that business to you know

37
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:31,618
350 million turnover you know fully

38
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,880
globalized in all the different

39
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:35,879
countries

40
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:37,219
and he jumped on board and we managed to

41
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:39,899
get into

42
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:42,840
first of all the UK then set something

43
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,939
up in Germany Ireland

44
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,560
expanded into a few more spots and

45
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:50,099
eventually now we're at sort of 45

46
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,960
countries trading CBD

47
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:53,519
it's an incredible old story I'm sure

48
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:56,339
you've had your hair pulled out dealing

49
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:59,280
with the Irish last time we've got over

50
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,618
here we won't talk too much about that

51
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,618
yeah you know we've we operated in

52
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:06,299
Ireland from the start as well and we

53
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:08,459
saw that it was

54
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:10,739
you know a little bit difficult people

55
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,560
were having issues with I think there

56
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:15,719
was a big sort of raid a few years ago

57
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,580
on one of the big High Street stores and

58
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:20,939
other problems as well

59
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:23,040
yeah well that made us concentrate our

60
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:25,079
mind on making sure that every bit of

61
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:27,419
these products were sort of to those

62
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,580
regulations and that was one thing that

63
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:31,619
we did from the start where

64
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,180
that was always the worry that when

65
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,520
you're dealing with controlled drugs

66
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,900
like the THC element of it

67
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,520
that you

68
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,800
and if you want to deal in all the

69
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,640
different countries the best way is to

70
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,340
stay

71
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:47,399
as low as possible so

72
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:50,519
we've always developed the product to

73
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,280
keep removing keep getting lower loqs on

74
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:55,019
the on THC because that's the trip up in

75
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,120
every country you know if you go over

76
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:59,580
that limit basically but Island

77
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,739
especially very hot on it

78
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,060
yeah that's it it seems to vary across

79
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:05,280
Europe as much as they've got the set

80
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,920
standard of 0.02 or three percent

81
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,719
Ireland seems to have it and no holds

82
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:11,939
bar that it's zero percent to THC

83
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:13,500
completely the topic I brought down I

84
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:15,719
want to talk today about is the Cannabis

85
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,818
supply chain can you maybe answer a

86
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:19,739
couple of questions on this first one is

87
00:03:17,818 --> 00:03:22,318
basically where do you think the

88
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:24,420
majority of CBD is sourced from

89
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:27,179
currently available on the market is it

90
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:28,979
North America is it Eastern Europe is it

91
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,980
Central Europe where do you think it's

92
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:36,179
the main market for CBD

93
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:38,340
the main Supply so the raw ingredient is

94
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,959
from the states in my opinion there is

95
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,360
obviously some supplies in Eastern

96
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:44,098
Europe as well that um

97
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,860
built up over the last couple of years

98
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:48,419
but because of the the length of time

99
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,940
that they've been doing it in the states

100
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:53,639
in the competitive pricing that the

101
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:56,039
price of the biomass

102
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:59,339
but a lot of it is coming from North

103
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:01,500
America still just as a an aside from

104
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,000
that I was over in Thailand just before

105
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,039
Christmas because obviously that

106
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,299
Market's all opened up now

107
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:11,759
and the pricing over there is extremely

108
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:15,239
expensive still for raw ingredients so

109
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:18,000
the biomass is incredibly expensive all

110
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:20,160
of these extractors have just invested

111
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,379
you know five six million into their

112
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,360
facility and trying to recoup some of

113
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:28,019
those um the capital expenditure from

114
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:30,360
that so it's incredibly expensive

115
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:32,819
initially in these markets but as they

116
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,439
mature obviously with scale and

117
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:36,959
everything else they start coming down

118
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:40,199
in price that's why I think that the US

119
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:42,418
has still got a good hold because it's

120
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:45,600
very competitively priced but the

121
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:48,120
quality is is good as well

122
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,000
okay very good how important is

123
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,500
extraction to the process and who do you

124
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,819
think are the best territory in the

125
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,240
world when it comes to the extracting

126
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:56,240
side of things

127
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:01,379
so

128
00:04:57,779 --> 00:05:03,959
again it because the US have been doing

129
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:05,939
it for so long and that you know all

130
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:09,180
extractors are definitely not created

131
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:11,519
equally I've been to sort of 25 we're

132
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:14,340
very close to our extractors you know

133
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:15,839
work exclusively over with um with IAH

134
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:19,258
in Oregon

135
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:21,418
they've got machines that are from Roto

136
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:24,660
Chrome and which is a European business

137
00:05:21,418 --> 00:05:27,719
and they deal in absolute specialist

138
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:32,100
purification so you're getting

139
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:35,280
you know to to parts per million of each

140
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,600
product or phytochemical whatever it may

141
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,418
be

142
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,580
so I think

143
00:05:38,418 --> 00:05:43,799
you know when you invest in those types

144
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:46,139
of machines and extraction it makes a

145
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,120
huge difference so at the very front end

146
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:50,220
with cheap machinery

147
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,560
you know you you don't know what's being

148
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:54,780
left in there you can't extract the the

149
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,000
bits that you want never mind the sort

150
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:58,559
of control drugs talking sort of

151
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,439
chlorophyll and lipids and everything

152
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,139
else but when you've got these machines

153
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:06,060
which you know the seven figure costs

154
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:08,699
these machines to buy we've got two of

155
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:11,339
them in that in that facility they're

156
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:14,639
extremely precise and you know that's

157
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:17,459
where I think it needs to go

158
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,019
very interesting and move a narrative UK

159
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:21,180
just a couple of questions that I think

160
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:23,339
you might be the perfect answer on a

161
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,199
scale of one to [ __ ] show how bad is the

162
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:26,698
novel food process currently at the

163
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,900
moment

164
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:31,199
oh

165
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:33,779
do you know what this one is this is the

166
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,419
the difficult one because

167
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:37,739
I've got a caveat it all by saying at

168
00:06:36,418 --> 00:06:41,038
the start

169
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:43,918
this has become so big so quickly as an

170
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:46,740
industry so to police it was always

171
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:48,779
going to be incredibly difficult

172
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:51,000
some of the weight decisions that have

173
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:53,159
been made would not be what I'd do I

174
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,680
went you know I think it should be done

175
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,780
at ingredient level for a start that if

176
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,759
you've got a safe raw ingredient then

177
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:01,619
you know by putting it in a chocolate

178
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,819
cookie that's been in the supply chain

179
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,399
for

180
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:07,680
to 300 years is not going to make much

181
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:09,599
of a difference and so that that would

182
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,500
be my first thing but what I would say

183
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,020
is

184
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:16,500
you know there's so many people

185
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:18,299
that have got into the industry you know

186
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,038
over the last few years

187
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:23,098
there's so many people that are looking

188
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:25,560
at abusing the system as well where you

189
00:07:23,098 --> 00:07:27,598
know we were one of the first ones that

190
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,660
got to the next stage on novel foods and

191
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:32,699
I think there was 74 businesses or 92

192
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,620
businesses originally on that first day

193
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:37,439
that got across or Aura actually

194
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:40,500
applications of which we had nine

195
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:43,019
and then the pressure was put on the FSA

196
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:46,139
from all sorts of different sources more

197
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:48,659
sort of documents submitted so they had

198
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:51,660
to take them through to the next stage

199
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:54,780
and then let sort of um

200
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:56,340
discount them at the next sort of part

201
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:59,818
of the process which was never how it

202
00:07:56,339 --> 00:08:02,939
was meant to be so I'm hoping it's going

203
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:04,439
to be sorted soon but I'm also not

204
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:06,538
holding my breath

205
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:08,519
yeah do you think it's a case out

206
00:08:06,538 --> 00:08:11,339
because Europe is so heavily influenced

207
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:13,680
by the farm industry that the synthetic

208
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:15,060
and the biosynthesized molecules are

209
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,680
going to be the ones that they end up

210
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,598
going well we know this site this is

211
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,699
replicable this is going to be easier

212
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:21,779
for us to manage than extracted plant

213
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:24,180
matter

214
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:26,038
yeah I think that that does make it

215
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,060
easier but I think the problem with it

216
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:29,519
is

217
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:31,680
consumers don't want that product you

218
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:34,740
know they they want a natural

219
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,799
alternative that really works and you

220
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:40,379
know the vast majority of people in CBD

221
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:43,679
believe in the Entourage effect and that

222
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:45,899
it's the raw plan with you know some of

223
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:49,259
the other minor cannabinoids working

224
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:51,839
together so I don't actually think

225
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:54,838
consumers want so you're almost not

226
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,640
solving the problem because that you

227
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:58,440
know people still want to buy the sort

228
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:01,740
of natural alternatives

229
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,779
so I think this you know one of the

230
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,360
things is that the industry hasn't done

231
00:09:03,778 --> 00:09:08,759
itself any favors as well by

232
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,620
proving a lot of these

233
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:12,179
things and you know some of them are

234
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:15,600
massive money if you're doing a global

235
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:17,519
study and it's 25 million that's you

236
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,659
know a lot of cash to fund and there are

237
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,399
some companies doing that but

238
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:23,579
unfortunately it's more of the sort of

239
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,799
big farmer and what we're doing at the

240
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:28,200
moment is

241
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:31,319
um studies at University so we sponsor

242
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:33,540
PhD courses in like Prof dot courses and

243
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,540
with that we do studies about

244
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:39,000
you know you're in build up

245
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:41,179
um how it works for sort of sleep with a

246
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,080
blind Placebo test and things like that

247
00:09:41,179 --> 00:09:45,419
and I think

248
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,519
we've got to build up the evidence as

249
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:49,679
well as an industry to show how safe

250
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,120
this product is and how well it works

251
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:53,219
for people

252
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,799
yeah I think the efficacy and the

253
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,778
clinical trials and they're proven that

254
00:09:55,799 --> 00:10:00,539
uh statistics are going to outweigh just

255
00:09:57,778 --> 00:10:03,000
people's nuanced opinions on this but

256
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:06,360
one or two questions on the UK how

257
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,220
realistic is the UK going to have an

258
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,940
adult use cannabis marker within the

259
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:15,120
next five years

260
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:18,000
so I think about five years would be a

261
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,639
sort of timeline at the moment we're

262
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,860
actually in the process of buying a

263
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,120
pharmacy license and moving into metcan

264
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,580
ourselves

265
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,940
we're the same in Germany where we've

266
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:31,860
got a venture set up over there

267
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:34,019
and

268
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:36,959
like Germany's getting this recreational

269
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:39,959
Market you know hopefully fully

270
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:42,778
legalized in 12 months in 2024 around

271
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:45,539
then and the more that I hear about it

272
00:10:42,778 --> 00:10:48,720
and the more as time goes on it just

273
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:51,419
makes absolute sense where

274
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,459
you know we can there's tax money to be

275
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:54,719
made out of it as well and it not to be

276
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:57,239
the sort of

277
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,459
[ __ ] show of the states as well Excuse

278
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,659
excuse the French but um

279
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:05,879
you know that sexually illegal you know

280
00:11:02,659 --> 00:11:07,980
heavily taxed per state you can't move

281
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:11,759
it interstate and everything else to

282
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:14,459
sort of create proper Commerce so

283
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:16,139
I do think we'll do it but I think we're

284
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:17,578
still sort of five years ago we're

285
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:19,679
definitely going to be behind the

286
00:11:17,578 --> 00:11:22,019
Germans and watching what they do I

287
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,939
think yeah the Czech Republic as well

288
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:25,679
look like they might even steal a march

289
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,600
on Germany with the the Coalition of

290
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:30,299
politicians they've got at the moment

291
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,159
yeah you I spoke about this yesterday

292
00:11:30,299 --> 00:11:34,199
actually and um

293
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:37,500
that is going to be a really interesting

294
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,778
one we we have a facility one of our

295
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:42,179
partners over in the Czech Republic that

296
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:43,439
made capsules for us and incredible

297
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:45,239
business

298
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,640
and you know they're looking into they

299
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,259
they do a lot of CBD capsules now as

300
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:52,019
well and

301
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:54,240
somebody like that is well placed in a

302
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:56,278
market that's but that should be the UK

303
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,839
especially after we've brexited and

304
00:11:56,278 --> 00:12:01,019
everything else we should be the ones

305
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:03,120
that are growing this with you know cgmp

306
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:05,879
Farms that are exporting to all these

307
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,919
European countries and exporting now

308
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:09,899
that we've taken it back you know what

309
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:12,059
didn't want to brexit I'm just going to

310
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:14,700
say as well but

311
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:15,419
um especially to an Irishman

312
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,180
um

313
00:12:15,419 --> 00:12:20,519
we're but we've got to make the most of

314
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:23,159
it now if if this is what we've done

315
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:25,860
then we've got to take the laws into our

316
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:28,500
own hands and look at how we can this

317
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,899
industry is going to be enormous in 10

318
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:33,240
years time you know never mind how big

319
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:35,578
it is now we're playing the long game

320
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,139
here and it's it's just going to get

321
00:12:35,578 --> 00:12:40,019
bigger and bigger as more places

322
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:41,879
legalize but if we don't get a move on

323
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:44,039
we'll be left behind we'll be an

324
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:46,078
importer instead of an exporter the

325
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:47,778
people who you know aren't making the

326
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:51,659
cash out of it are the ones who are

327
00:12:47,778 --> 00:12:53,820
supplying the cash to everybody else

328
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:55,259
yeah you would have told what the Tories

329
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,060
being empowered that they're very

330
00:12:55,259 --> 00:12:59,700
business friendly and they facilitated

331
00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:02,039
the GW Pharma r d that allowed the Jazz

332
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:04,379
acquisition I think Richie siddock just

333
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:06,120
seems to be the worst possible person in

334
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:08,039
charge at the worst possible time for

335
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,740
the Cannabis industry in the UK

336
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:13,139
yeah and for me I think it's a vote

337
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:15,120
winner with the public but

338
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:17,639
you know without getting too political

339
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,860
the donors behind the Tory party and

340
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:23,459
everything else what's their sort of

341
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:26,639
interests in allowing you know

342
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:28,979
sort of have they got alcohol have they

343
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,899
got farmer Investments all of these

344
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,879
types of things where and they're the

345
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:36,120
guys that don't want this the farmer

346
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:38,399
guys the alcohol to be pushed through

347
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,919
yeah it seems to me that Europe is going

348
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,200
to spill into its own model where it'll

349
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:44,759
be Social Clubs Allah Spain that'll

350
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,320
start to dominate around Europe and

351
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:48,539
it'll be more known for profit

352
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,278
organizations as opposed to profit heavy

353
00:13:48,539 --> 00:13:51,899
dispensaries for cookies and whatnot in

354
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:52,980
the states and then the other half of

355
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:54,659
the industry is going to be applied

356
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,399
pharmaceutical ingredients that are

357
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:58,078
going to be Pharma companies will take

358
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,759
control of a couple of molecules and

359
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:01,439
create a range of medicines from that

360
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:03,539
seem to be there will be a massive

361
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,940
divide between the two sectors

362
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:07,919
yeah that's that's what what I always

363
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:10,440
say it you know big Pharma doesn't want

364
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:12,958
you to grow your own medicine do they no

365
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,000
no same way as McDonald's don't want to

366
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,199
give you the recipe to their Big Mac we

367
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,320
want you to come in and eat the whole

368
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:21,300
thing themselves totally

369
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,440
so tell me this it's really a 15 minutes

370
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:24,240
what are the things you're looking

371
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,680
forward to over the next 12 to 24 months

372
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,120
which you guys and all the projects you

373
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:28,319
have working on

374
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,259
so

375
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:34,019
um really excited about metcal

376
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:35,519
um that's really this year going to be a

377
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:37,259
big Focus for us in the different

378
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,220
territories

379
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:41,698
um

380
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:43,500
CBD expansion into the Far East we're

381
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:45,838
already sort of trading in the Far East

382
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:48,659
but that's going to be further and you

383
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:51,300
know some of other wellness products and

384
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:53,819
we've just got so much good MPD that

385
00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:56,519
we've worked on over the last year two

386
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:58,920
years that some have been soft launched

387
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:00,419
some into different territories and

388
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:03,120
we're going to expand that across

389
00:15:00,419 --> 00:15:04,919
everywhere but I think that the big

390
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,778
thing with that is because of the way

391
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:08,639
novel Foods worked and everything else

392
00:15:06,778 --> 00:15:10,919
it's been a bit restrictive on MPD

393
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,720
whereas we're gonna can't do it in the

394
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:16,500
UK but everywhere else is going to see

395
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,600
some fantastic products coming this year

396
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,980
