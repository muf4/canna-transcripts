well i think

28
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,640
i uh came in right at the um sort of

29
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,280
this

30
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,519
wave of cannabis advocacy on the west

31
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,599
coast that happened in the mid 90s my

32
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:14,640
family i moved here in the mid 90s from

33
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:16,158
england

34
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,000
and uh

35
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,799
they didn't have any idea they were plop

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,759
plotting me down in in such a hotbed of

37
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,759
of herbal medicine activism

38
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,239
but i started off with the university in

39
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:32,159
college as a volunteer and this man

40
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:34,959
named ted smith who owned the very first

41
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,719
cannabis dispensary in canada it's the

42
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:39,679
longest running it's still open it's

43
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:42,000
still operating we'll talk about that

44
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,040
he introduced me to medical cannabis

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,959
back in the early 2000s when i was at

46
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,600
college and university

47
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:51,839
and i not just stand medical but the

48
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:53,599
hemp and and really just um

49
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,118
opening my eyes to

50
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:57,599
sort of the

51
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:59,519
opposite view that i've been taught as a

52
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:02,000
child and many is taught during

53
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,718
prohibition the cannabis is bad

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,959
but

55
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:07,759
he taught how there's many positive uses

56
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:09,038
for it and i became his employee some

57
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,560
years later

58
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,759
my

59
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,878
my younger sister contracted cancer skin

60
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:17,598
cancer

61
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:20,318
melanoma skin cancer and

62
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:23,679
she was at the end of the options from

63
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:26,000
the doctor and ted smith in the club at

64
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,400
this time in the early 2000's

65
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,080
helped her during the last months of her

66
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,400
life she

67
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,640
did die after one year after contracting

68
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,239
melanoma it's very dangerous

69
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:37,598
uh deadly

70
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,959
condition

71
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:43,759
um but she uh she got benefited quality

72
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,080
of life-wise being able to restore her

73
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:47,759
abilities to to eat and have a have a

74
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,040
good sleep which helped her communicate

75
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:51,840
with her family during the last few

76
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:53,679
months jesus you can imagine there's an

77
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,920
invaluable time to be able to

78
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,280
communicate with your loved one who's

79
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:59,280
going to die so

80
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,519
i saw the value in that and i wanted to

81
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,080
help so i became the baker and the

82
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,920
product maker for ted smith i was only

83
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,879
one year after i started that that i got

84
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:11,518
arrested now in a local downtown uh

85
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:14,479
apartment building in victoria bc

86
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,640
and in response to the arrest we raised

87
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:20,158
a constitutional challenge

88
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:22,318
and this was to uh the current medical

89
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:25,120
marijuana laws which only allowed in

90
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:25,919
canada people to have dried cannabis

91
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,680
and

92
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,280
they would have to smoke it or they'd

93
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,840
have to chew it and swallow that down

94
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,080
hole which didn't make any sense to us

95
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,719
we extracted cannabis into vegetable

96
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,519
oils and butters and made food out of it

97
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:42,080
to serve people with cancer and aids and

98
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,400
lots of serious medical conditions you

99
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,840
know only only helping those who had

100
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:51,840
permanent physical diseases and ailments

101
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:55,200
and so taking it to court in 2012 we won

102
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,719
uh in the bc supreme court

103
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:58,238
we then took it

104
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:00,639
all the way up to the supreme court of

105
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:04,000
canada where we had a unanimous

106
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:07,438
uh victory there and instantly made

107
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,280
edibles oils extracts legal for anybody

108
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:11,438
in canada to make

109
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,360
uh that

110
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:15,039
sorry for interruptions that's the orvi

111
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,239
smith challenge that you're describing

112
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:18,399
there is it

113
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,719
that's right yes

114
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:23,519
and uh i'd be the smith but uh there's a

115
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,720
ted smith as well and we're not related

116
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:26,959
but uh we

117
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,360
we uh you know worked together all the

118
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:30,159
way through

119
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,919
met all the way through the

120
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,759
communications campaign that went along

121
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:35,599
with it we launched a newspaper called

122
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,840
cannabis digest

123
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,560
and we use that to help

124
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:42,879
publicize the the truth about the case

125
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,759
while the newspapers muddied it up and

126
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,519
got the details wrong we published 10

127
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,360
000 copies and distributed them across

128
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:52,560
the country just to make sure that

129
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,400
people knew what was really going on and

130
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,360
after we did win in supreme court of

131
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,599
canada

132
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,000
the government were forced to make laws

133
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,439
they called section 56 laws and they

134
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,040
introduced a new uh limits called a

135
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:07,600
three percent limit

136
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,879
on the strength of the edibles and oils

137
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,879
and this was a limit that wasn't

138
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:12,319
established in the court

139
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:14,560
but this is something that governments

140
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,800
can do they make laws

141
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,199
here in canada and courts

142
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,038
chop them down chop them up uh make them

143
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,639
null and void the parts which aren't

144
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:25,439
constitutional

145
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,600
and so uh the government in my opinion

146
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:30,399
is reintroduced an unconstitutional

147
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,800
limit an arbitrary limit on the strength

148
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,478
of the edibles and that has carried over

149
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,680
into the legal system so if you want to

150
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:40,000
buy legal recreational cannabis uh

151
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,079
edible otherwise you're restricted to a

152
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,959
very

153
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:46,719
low dose and while that's good helps

154
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:48,319
people get in uh

155
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,080
newbies especially

156
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:52,639
who we really cared about who we're

157
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:55,279
really working for is the most sick most

158
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,879
vulnerable most in need and those people

159
00:05:55,279 --> 00:06:00,159
need higher doses

160
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:02,959
and so we continue to provide higher

161
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,840
dose cannabis against the law in

162
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:06,638
victoria bc to

163
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:08,079
or

164
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,120
more than that there's quite a lot of

165
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:11,279
people

166
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,120
who access cannabis through the victoria

167
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:15,839
cannabis buyers club

168
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,360
this is the longest running dispensary

169
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:20,159
in canada

170
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:23,439
and this uh club was recently charged

171
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,360
6.5 million dollars a fine was sent from

172
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:26,879
the provincial government

173
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,038
to uh

174
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:30,639
basically to shut the club down which is

175
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:32,800
not going to work

176
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,879
in response to that a

177
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,400
another constitutional challenge has

178
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:38,319
been raised a

179
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:41,120
big 700 page

180
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,840
document full of patient stories full of

181
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,399
legal arguments has been

182
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:47,519
in health canada's hands for over a year

183
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:48,638
now

184
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:50,719
and

185
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:54,000
we're pushing for an exemption to the

186
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,319
cannabis act so that we can continue to

187
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,918
provide those higher strength

188
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,639
cannabis products

189
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:03,439
to those who have higher needs

190
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,400
and uh and so that's something that we

191
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:06,399
uh

192
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:08,959
protest in the street for still these

193
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:11,519
days just last week was down in the

194
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:12,799
front of city hall in victoria bc

195
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:15,758
doing a

196
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,960
live trivia cannabis game show with a

197
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:22,319
crowd of people where we

198
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:24,959
showed the public that we can be a fun

199
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,280
uh open community of people very

200
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:29,359
knowledgeable and teach a few things

201
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:30,478
while we're out in the public

202
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,360
so

203
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:35,680
it's uh it's been that way

204
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,919
all along trying to

205
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,759
bring cannabis out of the shadows trying

206
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:42,079
to be as

207
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,479
out there as we can come out of the

208
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:47,198
closet as a cannabis community

209
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:49,918
and uh and it's a lot of fun

210
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,319
so it's not all serious amazing

211
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:54,000
amazing so after you guys were

212
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,479
successful with the orbeez smith

213
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,038
challenge what was the what was it like

214
00:07:56,478 --> 00:08:01,360
then creating a community channels of

215
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:03,120
communication with the relevant parties

216
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,240
be able to ensure that what you guys

217
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,240
wanted got enacted

218
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:11,038
well it's

219
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:12,959
what we had uh argued with the harper

220
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:14,959
government all the way to the supreme

221
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,198
court of canada the harper government in

222
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:20,638
canada wanted to introduce

223
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,720
mandatory minimum sentencing for

224
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,038
what i was doing and also for growing

225
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,840
more than six cannabis plants these are

226
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:29,120
a new laws at the time that we protested

227
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:30,959
against

228
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,918
so the government in canada especially

229
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:37,759
the conservative government has been

230
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:40,559
very oppositional to cannabis and so

231
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:43,200
no no easy communications could be made

232
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:45,679
there here in bc it's a little bit

233
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,720
different and we've had things like the

234
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:51,919
sensible bc campaign which came before

235
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,800
legalization where we tried to

236
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:56,958
decriminalize cannabis um but that

237
00:08:54,799 --> 00:09:00,240
didn't work we have a much higher

238
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:02,958
bar for um we have to get more votes

239
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,399
than washington or colorado who at that

240
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,159
time

241
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,720
their voting initiatives got them

242
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:11,039
legalized cannabis so we've had to fight

243
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,839
really hard in canada it's a

244
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:16,958
bit of a high bar i think for getting

245
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:20,160
this this out but uh with the liberal

246
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:22,479
government now there's since they put in

247
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:25,439
uh kind of the cows act they have a

248
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,240
four-year review of that act which has

249
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,760
been delayed thanks to covid

250
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,480
but

251
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:34,159
while working with aurora cannabis i

252
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,759
helped to

253
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:40,319
put together some suggestions and uh

254
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:42,879
some ideas that the government might uh

255
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,959
use to improve the system

256
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:46,720
uh including the obvious ones that i

257
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:48,239
just mentioned

258
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,560
but there's other there's a lot of other

259
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,360
ways we can improve cannabis in canada

260
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:55,439
too and a lot of fun that

261
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:59,320
could still come to what is really over

262
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,320
regulated hyper-regulated

263
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:02,240
industry

264
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:04,240
which you can expect because we're the

265
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,680
first in the world but what i'm excited

266
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,879
about is

267
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:09,838
tourism

268
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:10,879
we want to encourage people to come from

269
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,279
ireland

270
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:17,278
to enjoy a

271
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:19,600
nice farm tour from cannabis tours

272
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:20,958
enjoy our beautiful natural

273
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,839
environment

274
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:24,879
and

275
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:27,360
the finest cannabis that you'll ever see

276
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:29,360
or experience in your life and a touch

277
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,360
of the culture that's grown up here too

278
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,759
which is a lot of fun

279
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,079
so tourism is certainly certainly a part

280
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:36,078
of that

281
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:40,480
incredible yeah i think tourism it's one

282
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,958
thing you haven't heard come out of

283
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,240
canada yet is any sort of proportion or

284
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:47,919
any sort of cannabis tourism whereas we

285
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,839
even in ireland we hear things about

286
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:52,000
vegas and arizona where you can go over

287
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,760
there a lot of people go to california

288
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,559
you've got new york coming online now

289
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:57,838
which is gonna i think be a a huge hub

290
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:59,838
yeah i think the

291
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,920
the channel communication between the

292
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,079
canadian tourism companies who may be

293
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:05,759
operating these tours and europe don't

294
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:08,639
seem to be a

295
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:10,159
as clear as yet

296
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:13,199
it can be a lot of fun before

297
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:14,639
legalization i operated

298
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,480
a couple of

299
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:17,519
consumption lounges they called vapor

300
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,879
lounges

301
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,679
where you'd have

302
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:23,838
cannabis cocktails being served you come

303
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:26,078
and have a bloody mary jane

304
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:29,760
or another one of these that we made up

305
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:32,319
fun names and the dab bar laid out

306
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:34,720
so you could learn how to

307
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,920
dab not sure how much dabbing goes on in

308
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,839
in ireland

309
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:39,278
but here it's very popular on the west

310
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,279
coast

311
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:43,278
and i will teach you how to do these

312
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:45,838
things a little bit safely have somebody

313
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:47,200
there who can instruct new newcomers

314
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,600
people maybe

315
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,200
coming from overseas um

316
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,680
you need a little bit of instruction on

317
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,959
how to consume cannabis safely

318
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:56,399
but not a lot

319
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,479
and

320
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,679
it's something that attracts a lot of

321
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,560
culture so

322
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:06,719
would have musicians coming in

323
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:09,359
comedians sort of a central hub

324
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,839
in a way for the community

325
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,560
and it's so nice to be able to come out

326
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:18,079
of the woodwork and come together and

327
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:21,359
have a centralized place to consume and

328
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:23,120
and communicate and socialize

329
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,440
i feel like after

330
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,399
so much isolation social isolation in

331
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:31,440
the world we could all use sitting down

332
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:35,120
and uh having a nice cup of vape or

333
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:37,600
whatever it is we're gonna be able to do

334
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,360
very interesting so quickly before we go

335
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,519
what are you looking forward to over the

336
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,440
next 12 to 18 months in the canadian

337
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,039
cannabis industry what's the the one

338
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,720
thing you've got your eyes on

339
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:48,958
[Music]

340
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:52,240
well i definitely like i say the

341
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:54,799
consumption lounges is an issue which is

342
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,919
on the forefront of the british columbia

343
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:58,240
government

344
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:59,439
but there's a few others i mean it's

345
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,759
it's

346
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,839
slow moving in terms of development of

347
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:06,000
the industry here kovid

348
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,320
is part of that but we've just had

349
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,679
released the direct delivery

350
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,879
system so

351
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:15,120
finally bc producers can sell directly

352
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:17,039
to bc retailers without having to go

353
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,278
through the government warehouse we just

354
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:21,759
had a strike here in bc where no

355
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:24,399
retailers could purchase any cannabis

356
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:26,958
because the bc government controls

357
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,159
that channel but uh fortunately now that

358
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:31,439
is over

359
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:34,399
and the direct delivery is is in and the

360
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,519
next part of that is called farmgate

361
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,399
which is

362
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,959
having a store at your farm so that

363
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,919
people can come to the farm

364
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:46,159
meet you maybe go it's on a tour and go

365
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:49,039
to your gift shop and purchase some

366
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:51,278
cannabis there while they're on vacation

367
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:52,159
while they're on a tour

368
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:54,078
and

369
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:55,679
take that take that at least

370
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:57,278
while they're in canada

371
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:58,879
so these don't take it on the plane with

372
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:01,120
you

373
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:03,278
so farm gate and direct delivery are the

374
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,399
most exciting two things that are coming

375
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:06,240
to uh

376
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:09,198
to british columbia but consumption

377
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,959
lounges hot on the heels

378
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:13,120
and uh i

379
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:15,039
i look forward to the community being

380
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,720
able to come together more just this

381
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:20,879
year we had our first major

382
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,120
cannabis convention in victoria which is

383
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:24,559
the capital of british columbia

384
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,839
and we were able to take over the

385
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:29,359
empress hotel which is this landmark

386
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,600
piece of architecture in downtown

387
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,240
victoria and we had a vapor lounge right

388
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,159
in the center of town elevated

389
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,680
in front of everybody it really felt

390
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:40,719
like times had changed and uh

391
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:42,879
so

392
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,879
so i'm hoping for more of that

393
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:47,198
more uh

394
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:48,399
more of us to be able to share ideas

395
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:49,519
like this

396
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,958
and

397
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:54,480

398
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,319

399
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,079
