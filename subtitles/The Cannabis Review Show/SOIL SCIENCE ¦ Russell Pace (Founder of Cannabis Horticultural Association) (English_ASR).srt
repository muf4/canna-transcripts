2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,599
welcome everybody to the next episode of

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,000
the cannabis review i'm delighted to be

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,120
joined in this episode by russell pace

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,960
he's the founder of the cannabis

6
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:18,879
horticultural association russell is

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,960
also a cannabis cultivation consultant

8
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:22,480
with a specialization on nursery

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,480
production and integrated pest

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,080
management he's been group cultivating

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,800
cannabis for the last 20 years with the

12
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:30,479
past 16 in humboldt county how are you

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,320
keeping russell

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,160
good good thanks for having me i

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,000
appreciate it it's really nice to uh

16
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:38,159
connect overseas

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,920
the technology is awesome delighted to

18
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:41,279
have young major one of the people who

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,879
got a wealth of information and

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,039
knowledge that could be bestowed to the

21
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:46,799
audience so the objective was to give

22
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,280
everybody a quick little overview of a

23
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:50,878
couple of difficult topics and do you

24
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,079
maybe want to give

25
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:53,519
i actually generally i'm going to jump

26
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,520
straight into the first topic instead of

27
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,359
doing a big long introduction so

28
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,840
soil science can you maybe give the

29
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,519
viewer a a couple of minutes overview of

30
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,600
how important soil science is to the

31
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,118
cultivation process

32
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,640
yeah sure you know i'll try to give an

33
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:08,239
overarching uh

34
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,320
topic you know

35
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:13,039
soil science to me is uh you know the

36
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:15,599
complexities between soil biology and

37
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,600
soil chemistry and a lot of times you

38
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:20,079
know people just think of soil science

39
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,839
as just what what the chemistry is but

40
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:23,920
you know over the last decade for me

41
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,400
personally i've learned how important

42
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,000
biology is too you know and i got sort

43
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,920
of tipped off to it you know through

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,078
elaine ingham

45
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,240
and her whole soil biology

46
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:36,319
uh court all of her courses and that

47
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:38,560
whole industry that's been developing

48
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:40,559
and you know basically people think

49
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,280
sometimes you just add nutrients into

50
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,040
the soil and the roots of the cannabis

51
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,519
plant or any plant uptake those

52
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,439
nutrients and then that's how the plant

53
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,679
absorbs the nutrients

54
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:54,879
but what's amazing what's what's going

55
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,360
on actually inside the soil within the

56
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:59,759
within the biology is just it's so

57
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,438
staggering how many reactions are

58
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,519
occurring in the soil

59
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:04,398
you know like i i try to remember how

60
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:07,118
many

61
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,639
billions of uh of microbes there are in

62
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:10,878
one handful of soil but it's it's an

63
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,878
it's a staggering number of microbes in

64
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:15,759
one hand of soil you know you have your

65
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:17,120
protozoa your amoebas your flagellates

66
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,439
your ciliates

67
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,239
your bacteria your fungi

68
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:24,878
your arthropods there's like a whole

69
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,239
range of of life that's it's occurring

70
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,759
in the soil

71
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,080
and so

72
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:31,919
you know basically what when the when

73
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,239
the nutrients go into the soil they're

74
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,679
not always in bioavailable form or if

75
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,599
they're already in the soil they're not

76
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,959
in bioavailable form and what what

77
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:41,919
occurs is that

78
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,479
there's this really complex interaction

79
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:46,000
between the root systems and the soil

80
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:47,840
microbiology

81
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,400
and the root systems are actually

82
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:54,800
releasing exudates and exudate is just a

83
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,239
chemical that or you know actually i

84
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,319
think they're more like carbohydrates a

85
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,840
lot of the times it's like a it's a

86
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:01,679
secretion

87
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,239
there's a secretion that's occurring

88
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,159
from the roots going into the soil

89
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,000
they're crossed there's a crosstalk

90
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:10,399
going on with the biology where the

91
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,759
plants root systems are releasing these

92
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,680
exudates

93
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,239
to communicate

94
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,719
with microbiology and then they'll talk

95
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,120
to fungi and be like here you can have

96
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:24,080
some of this but in exchange i need some

97
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,480
potassium or phosphate then the fungi

98
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,360
high fill network can extend like you

99
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:30,878
know many feet outward and if they're

100
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,319
connected it's like a little super

101
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:37,120
highway that over here you know i'll try

102
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:39,598
to get a screenshot over here it feeds

103
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,120
through and can actually transport

104
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:43,359
nutrients all the way over to the

105
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,599
plant's root systems for the plant to

106
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,000
grow so this is like incredibly complex

107
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:50,000
interaction and at first you know this

108
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,919
whole thing was just like the industry

109
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,199
you know enlarges like feed the

110
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:55,598
nutrients in the soil and the plants

111
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:57,280
uptake them and it's moving more towards

112
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:00,158
feed the soil like make sure you have a

113
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,239
healthy population of microbiology in

114
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:05,598
the soil because what that does is it

115
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:08,319
allows you to optimize the nutrient

116
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:10,000
uptake and it's means it means that you

117
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:11,839
don't have to use as much nutrients if

118
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,158
you have a really healthy soil biology

119
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,680
you can use a fraction of the percentage

120
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:17,599
of nutrients

121
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,439
and still achieve the same result or

122
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,359
even better because of plant health you

123
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:23,680
we all know like our how important it is

124
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,439
our microbiology and our stomach like

125
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,439
they're starting to recognize like our

126
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:30,079
our health is like intricately tied to

127
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:32,000
the microbiome in our stomach well the

128
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:34,560
same with the earth and it's that old

129
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,240
alchemist saying as above so below like

130
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,680
it's the same process that's going on

131
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,079
and we need to be aware of how important

132
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,959
soil biology is for soil science

133
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:44,639
okay let's a brilliant overview so you

134
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:46,399
can see a future now where you're

135
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,000
getting basically let's say grow at home

136
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:50,799
kids are going to have

137
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,439
soil pre-planted and as important as the

138
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,680
genetics part of the the cultivation

139
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:57,519
process which uh again is a hollow

140
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,519
marker to open up into

141
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:01,038
and second topic i wanted to talk to you

142
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,240
about and maybe give

143
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:04,560
it something that i wouldn't know too

144
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,800
much about is agro ecology can you maybe

145
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,038
give to everybody watching a good

146
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,038
overview of what this is and how you

147
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:14,000
specialize in

148
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:16,399
yeah no so agroecology is something

149
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,959
that's not very

150
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:20,959
it's i understand it but i it's not in

151
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:22,719
my wheelhouse it's it's more of

152
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:25,839
agroecology to me like i talk with

153
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,320
agroecology a lot with my buddy matthew

154
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:31,038
gates who is an entomologist down in san

155
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:34,000
diego he has a handle uh sink angel on

156
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:36,079
instagram he's a absolute powerhouse of

157
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,478
knowledge you know so

158
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:40,240
one thing that that's important for me

159
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:42,719
is that i don't always have all the

160
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,560
answers to everything but what i do have

161
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,000
is the means and ability to access all

162
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,560
of the answers to everything that's

163
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,639
something i pride myself on but you know

164
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,478
it's like to me there's this concept of

165
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:00,000
agroecology

166
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:02,159
where you're tying in agriculture

167
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,879
with ecology it's like it's the

168
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:08,120
combination of the two

169
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:11,120
and they they sort of espouse the term

170
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:13,600
agroecology to try to

171
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,360
optimize you know these large

172
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,960
agricultural

173
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,439
um

174
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:21,839
plots you know and they try and they're

175
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:24,160
trying to tie them into some type of

176
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,038
with some type of ecological framework

177
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,360
you know

178
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:30,318
and so maybe agroecology looks something

179
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,879
like oh we have a bunch of acres of this

180
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:36,080
one crop but we're planting

181
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:39,360
uh rows intercropping rows of some type

182
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:42,639
of companion plant to attract beneficial

183
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,680
insects you know agroecology means oh

184
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:48,478
we're gonna cover crop this winter

185
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,959
all of those kinds of any any type of

186
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:53,839
way that you can integrate some

187
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:55,758
ecological methodology

188
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:57,839
into

189
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,479
traditional agriculture

190
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:03,279
that to me is what agroecology is i'm

191
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:05,758
sure there's agroecologists that will

192
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:08,239
chime in and you know offer their

193
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,038
more technical definition of what it is

194
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,879
but that's to me what it means and

195
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:14,159
it's kind of like one of those terms

196
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,478
where

197
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,240
i don't know people overuse it in some

198
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:20,159
some like you know

199
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,800
it sometimes gets misused in the

200
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,599
industry like you know like uh what am i

201
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,598
trying to say um

202
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,959
no no when people it's sort of like when

203
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,720
people use like when it when it when a

204
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:34,478
company that's trying to create a

205
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,639
product like a food product and they

206
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:37,918
call it natural you know it's all

207
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,918
natural

208
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:43,038
you know it sort of gets overused

209
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:44,959
sometimes in some some fields so it's

210
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:47,360
important just to understand it for what

211
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:49,758
it is like which is an important way to

212
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,280
integrate ecological methods into ag

213
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,280
agriculture

214
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:55,198
yeah that's brilliant is the objective

215
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:57,119
of this is to educate everybody i don't

216
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,199
think half the people out there have the

217
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,560
answers to everything but i think by uh

218
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,000
sharing these ideas and bits of

219
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,800
information is how everybody kind of

220
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,839
gets up to speed what are they curious

221
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,240
to ask you about um humboldt county well

222
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:13,038
it was a maybe a year or so ago got a

223
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,918
jurisdiction almost like champagne

224
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:18,959
when it comes to cultivation of cannabis

225
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:21,279
do you know the exact uh purview of

226
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:23,359
exactly what that law is and what it

227
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:26,399
means to the industry

228
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,840
uh yes the the old appalachians battle

229
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:29,918
as they say

230
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:33,918
yes the appalachians yes i'm i'm

231
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:36,958
definitely sort of in the midst of uh

232
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:38,879
just watching everyone work towards

233
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,958
creating appalachians now

234
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:44,080
uh i don't think there was it wasn't a

235
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:46,319
law it was just you know there's

236
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,480
there's classifications they're trying

237
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,360
to establish i don't know

238
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,680
the details of like

239
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,360
it's it's a complicated topic because

240
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:57,120
basically i mean i'll go on a side a

241
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,800
side tangent here for a second you know

242
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,879
it's like if you look i have mixed

243
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:03,278
feelings about it because

244
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:05,759
if you look at the true

245
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:08,559
appellations and terroir that's

246
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:11,919
associated with wine production right

247
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:14,639
you know we all are well tuned into that

248
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:17,838
these grapes are growing in the ground

249
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:21,199
for decades right decades

250
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:24,880
and cannabis is a plant that is one

251
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:27,278
season and so there's a lot of complex

252
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:29,439
variables when you're trying to

253
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:32,720
identify how

254
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,720
a farm is going to apply

255
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,959
that you know for a perm for for a

256
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,959
classification for appellations of a

257
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,919
certain region you know like how how

258
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:42,958
does

259
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:45,599
the terroir of the soil of the sea air

260
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:47,518
affect the growth of a cannabis plant

261
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,920
how does it affect the secondary

262
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,278
metabolite production you know like the

263
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:53,599
champagne region in france wouldn't

264
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:55,759
suppose i don't know a lot about it but

265
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,519
it's a specific type of soil obviously

266
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:59,759
those roots grow in the ground for

267
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,600
decades and they're sucking out those

268
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:03,360
minerals you know there's like acidity

269
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,680
levels there's like very specific things

270
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,759
that produce a flavor

271
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:09,599
and i don't know i don't know how

272
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,200
they're gonna necessarily achieve that

273
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,278
in cannabis but they're working towards

274
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,519
it i think it is possible i think

275
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:17,838
there's a pos there's definitely a

276
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,078
framework of possibility where if you're

277
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,399
you have to go into the native soil you

278
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:24,159
can't have potting soil you know you

279
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,078
have to be in the native soil you have

280
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:27,679
to you be using inputs from that

281
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:30,319
environment

282
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:32,239
you know and there's important variables

283
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,839
that need to be set in place for those

284
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,480
appellations to occur but it is

285
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,560
occurring it's also happening i think in

286
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,480
mendocino county it's the whole emerald

287
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:41,919
triangle that's really the hub it's like

288
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,278
the emerald triangle in northern

289
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:45,599
california

290
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:47,278
is that hub where all the appalachians

291
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,959
are being talked about and trying to be

292
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:52,159
developed so i know it's kind of like a

293
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:53,919
tangent but yeah that's really

294
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:55,278
it's really interesting to me and it's

295
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:57,360
it's in the it's a lot of it's in

296
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:58,720
development like they're

297
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,120
i think there's what's that what's that

298
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,200
group the origins council they're called

299
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,320
the origins council they have a lot of

300
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,320
information

301
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,040
on appellations too you can check them

302
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,399
out

303
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:09,679
um you might want to talk you might want

304
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,919
to talk to them that might be a good

305
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:13,838
person to reach out to yeah let's try to

306
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:16,240
get step by step i understand every

307
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,640
single component of this global industry

308
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,039
so ireland can be a key player when it

309
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:22,720
all goes legal worldwide yeah what's it

310
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:25,278
what are your laws in ireland right now

311
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,759
it's curious so there's a basically an

312
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:30,000
mcap medical cannabis access program but

313
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:31,838
it limits to a handful of different

314
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,600
diseases and the products are obviously

315
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,880
just brought in um

316
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,759
some of the

317
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:41,600
let's say less yeah canada who didn't

318
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:41,600
get it exactly right and have a huge

319
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,519
europe is getting a bit of a tidal wave

320
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:49,199
going now in fairness you've got germany

321
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,360
are going to have a recreational market

322
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,440
hopefully soon you've got movements

323
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,519
going on malta are going to be a big hub

324
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,920
in terms of cultivation and processing

325
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,120
of flowers so you'll start to see step

326
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:01,519
by step

327
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,600
europe come over and i think you'll have

328
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,120
especially cultivation the farmers over

329
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,200
here are already some of the best in the

330
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,440
world as it is so i think when they get

331
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,600
to tap into the genetics and the real

332
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,519
understanding of the cannabis plant and

333
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,200
i think you'll see a lot of new strains

334
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,159
and genetics coming out of europe but in

335
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,000
time

336
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:19,600
the last topic i wanted

337
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,519
about was

338
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,120
the best weed is grown in ah yes i've

339
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,639
asked a ton of cultivation people this

340
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,200
i'm not putting you on the spot and i've

341
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,200
got no it's fine hey i'm in humble i'm

342
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,440
in humboldt county so

343
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,480
i've been in humboldt county since 2006.

344
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,720
so

345
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,879
i would say i would be very careful and

346
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,320
i would say the best weed in the world

347
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:43,600
is grown in

348
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,360
the emerald triangle which means

349
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,240
humboldt county

350
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,480
trinity county and mendocino county

351
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,720
northern california the emerald triangle

352
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,800
i could say humboldt county

353
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,920
you know but i have too many friends

354
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:59,919
they're in mendo and trinity too

355
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:03,199
and they all grow it's it's the whole

356
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:05,439
bio region of that that area

357
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,000
where you know it's been cultivated

358
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,880
forever it's you know they these people

359
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,440
these

360
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:12,519
generational farmers have battled the

361
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,519
police

362
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:18,639
forever and they've been getting seeds

363
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:21,679
from overseas you know from afghanistan

364
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,839
and pakistan and land races from down

365
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:25,679
south america you know and

366
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,760
they've been breeding and cultivating

367
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:29,759
these like this is the hotbed of where

368
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:30,879
all this breeding has occurred has

369
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:33,039
occurred

370
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:35,600
so i would definitely without a doubt

371
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:37,759
say the emerald triangle is the zone and

372
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,440
humboldt county is obviously one of the

373
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:42,078
best known names like you don't know

374
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,680
about trinity and mendocino so so a lot

375
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:45,278
of times when you say humboldt county is

376
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:46,958
the best wheat in the world

377
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:49,039
there's a certain sense of pride in that

378
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:51,359
because i've been in the county i'm

379
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:53,519
right on the county line like i go two

380
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,759
miles east and trinity counties right

381
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,919
there so you know it's like we're right

382
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:59,600
right on the border there um

383
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:02,719
yeah humble county is the best you just

384
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,040
so many amazing genetics and uh up here

385
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,120
breeding i'm breeding i'm doing a

386
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:09,439
i started a seed company part of chaws

387
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,759
we're doing seed production now so we're

388
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,760
producing our whole line of genetics for

389
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:15,679
concentrate production

390
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:18,240
and that's really exciting so that's in

391
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:20,638
the developing works right now and uh

392
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,839
yeah that's it emerald triangle final

393
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,079
answer

394
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,519
yeah i have a figure we we've done some

395
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:27,278
stuff before where we figured out where

396
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,360
the best oysters are grown in the world

397
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:31,838
and it turns out it was in galway by

398
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,399
this irish family and it was because

399
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,560
pacific rain water came off the burn

400
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,399
another bit of soil came off the land

401
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:39,838
and it combined with atlantic waters

402
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,519
where they were only place in the world

403
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,600
that had ferrari oysters they were

404
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,839
called the graded in zero to ten in

405
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,000
terms of the best size these guys had

406
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,639
zeros and they used to get

407
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,480
the owner of uh harrods all the time so

408
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,879
i pretty much picture the emerald

409
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,278
triangle is that exact synopsis plus for

410
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:59,679
oysters the exact nutrients the exact

411
00:14:57,278 --> 00:15:02,159
pollution care air count the exact

412
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:04,559
lighting and phd that they they get so

413
