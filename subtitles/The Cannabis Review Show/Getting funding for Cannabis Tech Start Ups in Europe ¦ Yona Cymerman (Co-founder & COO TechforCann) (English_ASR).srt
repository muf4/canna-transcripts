welcome to another episode of the

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,440
cannabis review

4
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:13,678
i am delighted to be joined in this show

5
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:15,359
by jonas simer manana how are you

i'm good thanks how are you i'm

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,840
fantastic thank you very much so you've

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,600
been

10
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:23,679
in the news a lot over the last week or

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,080
two can you kind of give everybody a

12
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:28,160
little overview of how you got to

13
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:30,559
co-founding tech for can and your

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,000
journey in the cannabis industry

15
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:35,759
sure so i'm actually originally canadian

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,840
but i've been living in israel for over

17
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,280
30 years my entire career has been in

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,920
the israeli

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,039
tech ecosystem so i worked for a couple

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,160
of high-tech companies

21
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:48,159
then i ran my own agency

22
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:50,718
doing strategic marketing for israeli

23
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:52,238
tech companies i ran that for 12 years

24
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,759
then i got into the medical cannabis

25
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:54,399
space honestly because i was just

26
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:56,479
looking for

27
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,079
something interesting and you know this

28
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:59,679
was 2017 2018

29
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,160
and the canvas industry was everywhere

30
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:03,759
and booming so i opened a business

31
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:04,719
development company with a partner in

32
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:06,640
canada

33
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:08,478
and we were bringing over israeli

34
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,840
cannabis technologies to the canadian

35
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:12,079
market so we would do their

36
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,520
commercialization strategies

37
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:16,319
you know make sure they were able to

38
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,359
overcome any regulatory hurdles

39
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:19,758
and when they were ready we would

40
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:21,438
introduce them to either investors or

41
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,799
licensed producers or extraction

42
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:25,199
companies for

43
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,280
either raising capital or joint ventures

44
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,320
licensing agreements etc

45
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,400
um and then corona hit

46
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:33,519
and essentially what we're doing now is

47
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,759
we're setting up

48
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:36,959
europe's first medical cannabis tech

49
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,879
accelerator

50
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:40,559
it's headquartered and funded uh by

51
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:42,078
malta enterprise which is like the

52
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,840
innovation authority of the maltese

53
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:46,319
government

54
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,200
and we're looking to support early stage

55
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:49,839
entrepreneurs

56
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,840
in the cannabis industry we're talking

57
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,560
about ip-based technologies that

58
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,600
actually

59
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,000
solve a need in the industry

60
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:00,559
so we're not looking at brands and as i

61
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,319
said it's very early stage companies

62
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,240
so we're really looking to support them

63
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:06,798
and help them build their company

64
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,239
so that they can access the tremendous

65
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,479
you know european

66
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,360
market we're talking specifically about

67
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,000
medical cannabis

68
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,599
not recreational or adult use um and

69
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,919
like i said we're looking specifically

70
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:18,719
at

71
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:19,519
intellectual property um and companies

72
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,800
that have something

73
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,159
unique um to the industry

74
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,080
okay that kind of brings me on to the

75
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,439
first topic of conversation is

76
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,040
what is check for can you know you

77
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,520
answered a good bit of it there is there

78
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:31,519
a

79
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,519
is this a short medium or long term

80
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,360
strategy how hard was it to get the

81
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,719
maltese enterprise

82
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,760
government on board yeah so i mean the

83
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:42,959
way we saw it

84
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,919
is that you know 2017 2018 2019 there

85
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,000
was this huge

86
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:47,598
boom in the cannabis industry but all

87
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,800
the investment money was going to

88
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:50,799
cultivation

89
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,800
um and we understand that in order for

90
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,959
this to be uh you know

91
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,439
continuing to be a long-term growing

92
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,479
dynamic industry we have to

93
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:00,479
we have to make sure that we're

94
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:03,199
providing products and and

95
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,479
processes and solutions that are safe

96
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:06,079
and they're cost effective

97
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:07,840
and they're clinically validated and

98
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,200
they're sustainable

99
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,360
ultimately to that we're bringing

100
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:12,799
products to more patients

101
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,560
and educating both patients and

102
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,560
physicians that they can benefit from

103
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,959
these this amazing plant

104
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,400
um really what we're seeing is that you

105
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,439
know the barriers of entry

106
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,920
for the cannabis industry to biotech to

107
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:26,959
large pharma to the high-tech sectors

108
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,598
those are challenges

109
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,080
that we need to overcome so whether

110
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:31,679
that's

111
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,239
you know producing stable products at

112
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,519
scale or reducing operational costs

113
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,080
um validating biopharmaceutical products

114
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,158
for

115
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,120
specific indications digital health

116
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:42,798
solutions

117
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,239
across the board there is room for

118
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,000
improvement for the industry and that is

119
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,640
what tech for can is doing

120
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,560
so essentially what we're doing is we

121
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:50,958
are it's a short-term program it's 12

122
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,840
weeks

123
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,280
it's a 12-week cohort that during that

124
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,598
cohort

125
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,438
the companies get funding they get a

126
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:04,158
mentorship program and a curriculum

127
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:05,919
commercial services provided by leading

128
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:07,519
financial bodies

129
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:09,199
so that will help them with any legal

130
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,080
questions marketing financial

131
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:13,598
contractions

132
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,360
regulatory issues that they may have

133
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:16,959
but the real kicker here and what makes

134
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,400
it special and different than any other

135
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,959
accelerator

136
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:23,758
is that entrepreneurs who join us get to

137
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,600
do a validation pilot or a feasibility

138
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,720
study or a proof of concept

139
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,479
in an eu gmp licensed facility so

140
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,160
they're already able within the three

141
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:33,599
months of the cohort to move forward

142
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,840
either with proof of concept or

143
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,800
commercialization milestones so

144
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:39,359
essentially the

145
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,120
the startup just by joining the cohort

146
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,199
just by completing the cohort

147
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,040
essentially increases their valuation

148
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,439
and at the end of the cohort they

149
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,120
we we will write up like a poc report

150
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,680
for our investors

151
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,600
and then investors can then uh continue

152
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,639
in in ongoing rounds directly to the

153
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,320
startups

154
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,000
um so we're really i mean we use the

155
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:58,560
word accelerator and not incubator

156
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,600
because

157
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,560
it's it's short and intensive with

158
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,080
concrete steps to bringing these

159
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,280
products to market

160
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:10,959
um and then and because they're already

161
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:12,879
partnering with a licensed producer

162
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:14,000
that's eugmp that's a potential partner

163
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,360
or customer

164
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,959
so at the end of the cohort they may

165
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,560
even be at a position where they're

166
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:21,918
ready for a joint venture

167
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,519
um and obviously we chose malta

168
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:26,159
not only because of its access to

169
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:27,758
mainland europe but it already has eugmp

170
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,199
certified production which we don't

171
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,600
really have in israel

172
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,400
um the country had the government has

173
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,680
declared

174
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:35,519
that they want to be the medical

175
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,319
cannabis capital of europe they've

176
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:40,560
invested 110 million euro in a

177
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:44,079
designated industrial area

178
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,959
um they have a lot of leading canadian

179
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:47,519
companies

180
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:49,279
um are setting up in malta setting up

181
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:51,519
operations in multi in order to access

182
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:52,559
mainland europe so those are our natural

183
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:54,478
partners

184
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,839
and finally the whole situation with

185
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,879
kovid i mean

186
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:00,879
you know in israel we're 60 vaccinated

187
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,879
we can travel malta is a small island

188
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:04,639
that hasn't been hit hard by covid

189
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:06,800
so the expectation is that we'll be able

190
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,038
to have in-person cohorts

191
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,079
um although you know some entrepreneurs

192
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:11,519
will choose to do the curriculum

193
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:12,879
virtually that's fine but they're

194
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:16,240
guaranteed a spot

195
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:18,560
to do the pilot in the eu gmp facility

196
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,400
okay amazing lots of exciting things

197
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,280
happening in malta at the moment we were

198
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:23,679
talking to the guys

199
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:24,478
material ventures as well so i kind of

200
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,560
see that

201
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:27,918
malta and ireland vote with the kind of

202
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,759
beneficial tax rate

203
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:32,000
are going to be the kind of two dominant

204
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,000
spaces kind of pivoting towards

205
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,360
servicing the medical cannabis industry

206
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,879
and then further down the road the

207
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,600
recreational industry because

208
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:40,719
that will follow at some stage sooner or

209
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,639
later so

210
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,160
yeah it's an interesting space to be the

211
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,639
next topic i wanted to talk to you about

212
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,240
is there's

213
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,680
a lot of startups coming into the

214
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,840
industry now at the moment

215
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,680
everybody's looking to raise capital a

216
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:53,439
lot of the institutional investors won't

217
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,199
be touching it as of yet until

218
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,759
all the eyes are dotted and the t's are

219
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,000
crossed if you would set up a cannabis

220
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,080
startup anywhere in the world what city

221
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,519
would you pick

222
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:05,519
wow um

223
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:09,439
it's a good question what city would i

224
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:12,000
pick i would

225
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:12,800
um it really depends what you're doing i

226
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,079
think

227
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,720
i'll tell you what our chat the

228
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:18,719
challenges that we found um

229
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,160
we found that there's a lot of money in

230
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,440
europe right now

231
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,240
um people aren't looking for the early

232
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:26,079
stage

233
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,598
startups though so you know most

234
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,959
startups need you know two hundred

235
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:29,598
thousand dollars two hundred and fifty

236
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:32,638
thousand 000

237
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:34,000
in order to make their next step and

238
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,840
most of the investors are looking for

239
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,360
much larger tickets which is why the

240
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:39,119
accelerator is a good

241
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,720
is a good place because the

242
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,800
entrepreneurs get the funding that they

243
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,199
need but the investors are essentially

244
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,319
investing in this this platform this

245
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,840
portfolio

246
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,520
diversified portfolio that we're

247
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:52,560
offering them um

248
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:53,439
i would say that what we've found is

249
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,959
that

250
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:59,038
in the us there is huge money but a lot

251
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:01,519
of it is going to brands

252
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:02,159
um which is not what we're interested in

253
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:03,758
they're not

254
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,319
looking yet at the early stage

255
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:10,080
technologies um

256
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,479
and so there just seems to be a lot of

257
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:13,439
money

258
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:14,719
in europe right now um for the cannabis

259
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:16,399
industry and you're right that the

260
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,400
institutional investors are being very

261
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:19,359
careful and very wary but it's coming

262
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:21,198
it's happening

263
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,400
so i would say that if you're in the

264
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,720
real medici

265
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:25,519
medical cannabis europe's your place if

266
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,560
you're looking for

267
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:30,399
recreational or adult use

268
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,479
then yeah you're probably better off

269
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:35,918
with north american investors

270
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:38,080
do you tell me do you see a case of

271
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:39,679
where the growers and farmers in europe

272
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,440
are end up producing

273
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,519
let's say we go 10 years down the line

274
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,720
wreck is is illegal in europe as well as

275
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,200
it is in north america

276
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,240
do you see europe having the the more

277
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,000
superior let's say

278
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,680
brands and growers like they do with

279
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,958
wine or champagne or

280
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:55,039
a number of different products like

281
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,439
shufflers or do you see south america

282
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,838
then

283
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,279
i mean the low cost alternative that

284
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,640
pumps into north america

285
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:02,799
because it's all about margins and

286
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:04,559
profits at the end of the day so

287
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:05,919
yeah i think looking 10 years down the

288
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:08,159
line that's what we're looking at

289
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:09,360
so you know high quality pharmaceutical

290
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:12,719
grade cannabis will

291
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:16,159
come from whether it's south america or

292
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,278
africa um i absolutely see that

293
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:20,159
happening but it's

294
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:22,080
it's gonna take a while um and also some

295
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:25,199
countries you know let's say germany

296
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:28,240
or whatever are only going to allow

297
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,440
homegrown locally home locally grown

298
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,039
cannabis production so

299
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,120
i think ultimately it's uh it's a

300
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,879
decision about money and taxes

301
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,360
you know as long as it's worth their

302
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:41,519
while to cultivate in

303
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,320
france or germany or whatever then great

304
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:47,360
but once we have these

305
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,680
more sophisticated products and

306
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,440
we've a we're able to have plant

307
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:55,838
stability at scale

308
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:57,519
um then it will go commodity i believe

309
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,279
i mean some countries will probably keep

310
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,600
their own growth for like

311
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:01,600
um

312
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:09,600
really really high-end products

313
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:10,958
um but yeah

314
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,399
[Music]

315
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:15,679
you could have it just like liquor

316
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,600
you could have it like liquor whereas

317
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,879
again the bottle of vodka over in europe

318
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,920
is 80 euro

319
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:23,360
and it did you've got a similar kind of

320
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:24,319
cheaper bottle on sale in different

321
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,399
parts of the world so

322
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,760
hopefully the the premium growers and

323
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,519
the guys with the real knowledge of the

324
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:31,519
plant end of being the ones who

325
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,959
can profit from the european industry

326
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,000
the last thing i want to talk to you

327
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:36,000
about was

328
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,639
israel had become a world leader in the

329
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,559
r d side of medical cannabis

330
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,759
what were the steps that got them there

331
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:44,479
was it professor

332
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:46,240
raphael or was it a couple of other

333
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,480
steps do you think

334
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,000
yeah so israel is an interesting story i

335
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,680
mean we've been doing research on

336
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,639
medical cannabis longer than anyone else

337
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:54,479
like you said

338
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:56,399
rafael mushulum has been doing this

339
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,278
since like the 1960s

340
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,000
he's the one who isolated thc um and

341
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:02,480
he's

342
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,240
now 90 something years old and he still

343
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,839
goes to his lab and he still does work

344
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,320
and he's still doing research

345
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,440
and all the universities in israel have

346
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,839
um

347
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:16,800
uh like cannabis curriculums now

348
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:18,480
um and so in terms of israel look israel

349
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:20,639
made the desert bloom

350
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,000
for many many we we are the startup

351
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:25,120
nation specifically

352
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,320
in act and and other relevant

353
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,360
technologies

354
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,360
um cannabis is no different where

355
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,200
israel i think missed its opportunity

356
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,720
israel hasn't had a short opportunity

357
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:39,640
to be a leading supplier of

358
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,240
high quality cannabis you know we've got

359
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:44,720
350 days of sunshine a year

360
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,639
we've got the technology we've grown

361
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,160
tomatoes in the desert

362
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:50,559
and companies are now applying that to

363
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:53,120
cannabis the problem is that due to

364
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:54,000
regulatory concerns we can know we can't

365
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,240
expert

366
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,519
so ironically israel is might be growing

367
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,200
the best cannabis and might be having

368
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,799
the best technologies but we're also

369
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,519
right now the largest importer in the

370
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:03,278
world

371
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,560
because for regulatory reasons we can't

372
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:07,679
export yet now that's

373
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:09,439
that's that is happening um

374
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:11,199
and you know we've had four elections

375
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,079
over two years so we're looking for gov

376
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,079
for for political stability and then

377
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:17,679
being able to provide for the local

378
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:18,719
market and then companies will be able

379
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:20,319
to export

380
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,320
having said that all the largest

381
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,760
cannabis producers do already have

382
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,519
off-take agreements

383
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:26,958
to europe and north america they're just

384
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,919
waiting for the sort of stamp of

385
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:29,359
approval

386
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:31,519
where i do see that israel has a

387
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,320
tremendous opportunity is in the

388
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,360
uh technology sector like i said with

389
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,278
the start-up nation

390
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,480
a lot of people are applying their

391
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:41,679
incredible

392
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,120
knowledge and innovative spirit to the

393
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:46,239
cannabis industry

394
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,639
i think there's a lot to look at here a

395
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:52,159
lot of spin-offs from existing actech

396
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:54,320
technologies for the cannabis market um

397
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:55,919
and it's it's exciting it's very

398
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,399
exciting what's going on here i will say

399
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:57,838

400
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,120
