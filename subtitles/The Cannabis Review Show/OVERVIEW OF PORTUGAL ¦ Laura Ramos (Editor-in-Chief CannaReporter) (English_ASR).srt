overview portugal right now we have 18

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,639
licensed companies

54
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:14,159
um i don't know if my internet cut a

55
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:16,958
little bit but i will try to keep on uh

56
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:19,199
portugal is now 18 licensed companies by

57
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,640
informa that are allowed to produce

58
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:26,238
cannabis for medicinal purposes

59
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:29,199
recreational the adult use is not yet

60
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:32,560
legalized but i think it will be in the

61
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:34,719
next few years

62
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,199
nevertheless the hating licensed

63
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:39,840
companies we still have

64
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:42,799
more than 80 that are awaiting an

65
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,680
informant inspection to be authorized

66
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,480
also to produce medicinal cannabis what

67
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,640
makes a portugal

68
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:53,840
the center maybe the center of

69
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:57,279
excellence to produce medicinal cannabis

70
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:00,080
the climate uh the professionals highly

71
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,318
skilled professionals um

72
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,280
and maybe the all the environment in

73
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:08,000
portugal makes it uh the the

74
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,400
the perfect conditions to grow cannabis

75
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,479
so i think portugal will be the center

76
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,200
of the world for cannabis at least in

77
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,639
europe it's already i think

78
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:17,759
yeah no i definitely agree if you know

79
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:18,958
what you're talking about that it's

80
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:20,239
interested

81
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,598
the money and the investment that's

82
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,719
already gone into portugal i think

83
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:24,878
you're a couple of years ahead of

84
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,158
everybody denmark has their ornamental

85
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:28,399
flower industry but i don't think

86
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:30,000
they've got the scale at that portugal

87
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,959
or ground be able to deliver to the

88
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,519
european market and and i think they

89
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,799
they they don't have either the 300 days

90
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,680
of sunny

91
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,760
sun

92
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,599
which i think it's makes quite a

93
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:43,439
difference they'll have an expensive

94
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:46,158
electricity bill trying to keep up with

95
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,759
the portuguese

96
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:50,158
and can you tell me is there a

97
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:52,318
portuguese uh centered companies that

98
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,158
have gotten a foothold early on or has

99
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:55,280
it all been north american companies

100
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:57,120
that have come over and set up

101
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,360
facilities here

102
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,319
uh no i think it's from all over the

103
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:06,239
world even

104
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:07,839
israel canada united states even china

105
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,719
russia

106
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,120
i know that many countries are looking

107
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:15,039
to portugal as

108
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,798
you know as the the

109
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:22,800
uh door to enter the european market and

110
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:25,519
the perfect place uh to grow cannabis

111
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,400
yeah now and the the institution that

112
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:31,039
oversees the uh the

113
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:33,279
industry over there it's called informed

114
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,879
are they a governmental organization or

115
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:37,599
were they set up as an independent

116
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:40,560
organization outside of government

117
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,680
you mean information information

118
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,560
yes

119
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,360
informed is the regulatory agency it's

120
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,079
from the government and it's the the

121
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,800
health authority and they they are the

122
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:54,399
ones who authorize companies to produce

123
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,240
cannabis

124
00:04:54,399 --> 00:05:01,038
medicinal cannabis then if you look into

125
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,319
other markets like hemp it's another

126
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:05,839
department but yes it's informed

127
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:07,680
okay because we've been gone around the

128
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:10,799
world and there's the various different

129
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,680
regulatory councils that are popular

130
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,520
so over in portugal you've got infirmed

131
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,680
deals with the medical cannabis side and

132
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:19,279
then the hemp organization that'll deal

133
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,800
with the hemp side do those

134
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:22,638
organizations fit underneath the

135
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,400
department of health or are they

136
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,160
specific independent organizations

137
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:28,719
within government

138
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:32,800
no they are from the government informed

139
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:35,840
it's a part of the health ministry and

140
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,879
the gov which is the general directorate

141
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:39,839
of

142
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:43,360
food and veterinary it's a part of the

143
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:45,679
agriculture ministry and that regulates

144
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,759
the the hemp part

145
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,319
very interesting and have you been

146
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,840
looking around europe now in terms of

147
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:54,079
the next topic i wanted to talk about

148
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:55,198
it's logistics we know portugal kind of

149
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:56,959
grows

150
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,120
at good quantity and the exports have

151
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:01,599
driven in the hundred percentage year on

152
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,038
year now in terms of the logistics is

153
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,120
that something that you see a

154
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:07,199
specialized company in portugal dealing

155
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,038
with the whole industry or do you see

156
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,360
that actually being a competitive space

157
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:12,560
because i can imagine that uh

158
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,840
the likes of some of the smaller

159
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,519
countries aren't going to grow their own

160
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:17,279
product the logistics side of this in

161
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:19,839
europe is actually going to be a big

162
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:22,959
component of the entire industry

163
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:25,918

00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:32,000

working on this side of the business i'm

171
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:50,319
not very into the i know they are doing

172
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:53,758
this but and that you need a special

173
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:56,639
license to to distribute it's not very

174
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,720
easy it's not like and everyone can do

175
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,360
it so it's also

176
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,560
a little part of the market that small

177
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:07,360
companies are entering like security for

178
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,160
instance we some years ago we would

179
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,240
never think that security companies

180
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,639
would be working with cannabis and now

181
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,680
we have security companies in portugal

182
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:20,478
organizing small conferences to give

183
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,439
more information and workshops for

184
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:26,560
security professionals to enter the

185
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:29,199
cannabis market and this happens with so

186
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,199
many professions that before they

187
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,280
couldn't even imagine one day they would

188
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,080
be working with cannabis so i think it's

189
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:37,839
uh it's really interesting to see

190
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:39,680
yeah i think

191
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:41,598
the more industries that start touching

192
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,199
off the cannabis industry and realizing

193
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:45,120
the money that's been generated there at

194
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,800
the more normalized it's going to end up

195
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,000
coming in due course

196
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,598
yeah yeah and many will come because

197
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,360
as you might know

198
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:58,319
the cannabis industry is one uh of that

199
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:01,680
will generate more more employment in

200
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:04,319
the future more jobs in the future so

201
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,120
i think many people that they don't even

202
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,120
think

203
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,000
they could ever work with cannabis will

204
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,399
in the future be working with us

205
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,478
yeah no i agree with that in terms of

206
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:15,598
recreational legalization in portugal

207
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:17,439
you were saying that it's probably a

208
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:19,680
couple of years away what's your best

209
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:22,000
guesstimate on when you'd be able to go

210
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,720
let's say on a kind of a tourist to

211
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,038
lisbon and be able to enjoy like new

212
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,039
york has just legalized for september

213
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:30,478
over in new jersey a couple of weeks ago

214
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:32,639
it has dispensaries and all and it

215
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:35,918
becomes now a bit of a a selling point

216
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:37,679
for going somewhere on a vacation

217
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:41,360
well you know i think there's a lot of

218
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:43,519
hypocrisy all around uh the recreational

219
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:48,480
cannabis because in portugal you can

220
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,480
smoke anywhere i mean it's not uh

221
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,160
that's why i say it's hypocrite because

222
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,269
you can get cannabis everywhere you have

223
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,879
um

224
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:59,360
[Music]

225
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:01,838
many people trying to sell to tourists

226
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:05,200
in the in downtown lisbon

227
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:07,680
so um i don't know legalizing would be

228
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,879
just regulating you know this market

229
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:10,000
because it's

230
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:13,200
happening

231
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,240
um every day everywhere

232
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,040
and since cannabis was decriminalized

233
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,360
uh it's not a big problem if you are

234
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:24,559
smoking cannabis or

235
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:27,278
using cannabis anywhere but uh the thing

236
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:30,399
is that uh there's a lot of prejudice

237
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:32,240
you know people still think that uh

238
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,720
the people who smoke cannabis are the

239
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,480
drug addicts uh

240
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,600
and we need to to

241
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,759
break these myths and break the stigma

242
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,839
but this takes a long time

243
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:46,639
and i know i know from some sources

244
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:49,600
inside the parliament that it's like the

245
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:51,360
taboo uh subject the people don't want

246
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,839
to talk about cannabis they don't want

247
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,039
to start discussing cannabis because

248
00:09:53,839 --> 00:10:00,399
there's still a lot of people that based

249
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:02,078
their arguments on myths and psychosis

250
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,120
or this like

251
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:08,559
a gateway drug to other drugs and we

252
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:12,720
should have a serious discussion so we

253
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:14,159
could regulate uh to minimize

254
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,720
also the

255
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:18,958
you know the risks especially for youth

256
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,160
people because many people don't know

257
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:22,799
that the

258
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:25,120
the cause for overdoses the biggest

259
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:28,799
cause for overdoses in the youth people

260
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:31,039
here in portugal is alcohol so uh

261
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:34,078
teenagers are dying

262
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:36,319
of how from alcohol coma

263
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:39,919
and they wouldn't die with cannabis you

264
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,839
know but if you uh talk with with um

265
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:44,639
deputies or members of the parliament

266
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,800
they are afraid they will die from

267
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,439
cannabis or they would get psychotic or

268
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:52,559
schizophrenic so i think that it should

269
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:55,920
be um a very serious discussion and

270
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:59,759
informed discussion not based in myths

271
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:03,039
but unfortunately i think we are a lit

272
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:05,439
a little bit uh far away from this point

273
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:08,559
i i really hope that this will will

274
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:11,519
happen soon maybe after other countries

275
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:15,278
start to legalize in in europe like

276
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:19,039
germany for instance i would love to

277
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:19,759
to see portugal going um in front you

278
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:21,679
know

279
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:24,679
be being um

280
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:27,759
the pioneers again as we were with the

281
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:30,000
decriminalization but unfortunately i i

282
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:32,000
don't think we are at that point

283
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,958
just because of prejudice

284
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,320
yeah i think there's a lot of

285
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,759
misinformation on the other side and

286
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,360
there's people fighting to keep it

287
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:39,519
illegal as much as people are fighting

288
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,720
to legalize it so it's it's a battle

289
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,240
that i think will go on for another

290
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,759
couple of years before we have a united

291
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,720
europe industry

292
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:46,480
yeah

293
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,839
yeah the last thing i want to talk about

294
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,639
before i let you go as a european

295
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,040
industry leader just uh roughly i don't

296
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,440
want you don't need to pin your career

297
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:57,199
on whoever you pick but who do you see

298
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,279
is having the best kind of companies at

299
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,278
the moment in europe is it germany with

300
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:03,120
them on the crisp of uh

301
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:05,679
of the election is a portugal is it

302
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,200
denmark is it the netherlands who do you

303
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:10,599
see as kind of being the leader at the

304
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,600
moment in europe

305
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,240
okay sorry it cuts a little bit the

306
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,399
connection with the internet i don't

307
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,240
think i got the rest of your question

308
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,839
i'm sorry yeah so what i was basically

309
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,440
asking is which territory do you think

310
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,279
has the leading companies in europe at

311
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,680
the moment is it denmark the netherlands

312
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:30,159
germany portugal everybody is kind of

313
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:31,919
specializes in one specific kind of

314
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:34,000
element of this industry who do you see

315
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:35,759
as people has the best collection of

316
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,639
companies at the moment

317
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:41,838
i think germany is ahead for

318
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:44,720
obvious reasons because um in terms of

319
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:48,000
medicinal cannabis use and prescription

320
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:52,079
and you know the market is uh uh more

321
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,039
advanced in the final users to the final

322
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:55,599
users

323
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:58,559
in terms of production i would say that

324
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:01,200
maybe portugal because we are the the

325
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:04,719
ones that are producing the most

326
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:08,399
and uh last year uh portugal exported

327
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,200
around 30 tons of cannabis which is a

328
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,320
lot

329
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,320
and

330
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,920
this this year in 2022 on the first

331
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,720
quarter

332
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:20,799
we already were over i think it was over

333
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,320
20 tons so

334
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:27,039
it we will maybe probably double uh

335
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:30,240
or more than that the the amount of

336
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:32,559
exportation of cannabis so i think in

337
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:36,240
terms of production production maybe

338
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:39,359
portugal is uh far ahead um

339
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,959
but not in terms of uh you know market

340
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,759
cannabis market

341
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:45,359
uh i think germany or i don't know maybe

342
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:48,480
the the uk

343
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:52,240
when because they regulated the cbd now

344
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:55,199
um they are far ahead portugal i think

345
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,560
and of those 30 tons that got imported

346
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:58,240
last year how many like what's the

347
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:00,000
percentage share of companies is there

348
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,799
like one dominant company that exported

349
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,679
50 of that or is it spread across let's

350
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:08,479
say 10 or 12 different smaller operators

351
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:10,879
i wish i knew i asked this to inform it

352
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:14,000
but they don't say they just say it was

353
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:17,120
30 tons and they don't they don't reveal

354
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,600
who exported the most and to where

355
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,440
we know some countries um

356
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,519
they exported to

357
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,880
but some information they say they

358
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:29,120
cannot reveal by for um

359
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:30,399
you know commercial reasons

360
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,799
so we don't know

361
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,720
