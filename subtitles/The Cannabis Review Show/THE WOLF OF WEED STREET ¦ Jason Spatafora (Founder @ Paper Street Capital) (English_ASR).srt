overview of where the game started in

19
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:43,039
the canadian kind of small shares and

20
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:46,320
where you're kind of at at the moment

21
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:49,000
with the msos in america yeah so i i

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,399
actually started in um

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,600
2013 um and this was when

24
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,039
um then attorney general eric holder had

25
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,679
given a

26
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:03,359
statement that the department of justice

27
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:05,840
was not going to um go after states that

28
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,240
had marijuana laws on the books

29
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,320
um and i was you know a newer investor

30
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:12,560
and i was like wow cannabis i'm like is

31
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:14,239
are like pot stocks a thing

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,359
um and

33
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,640
i went and and googled it like anybody

34
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:21,359
else and

35
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,719
i found like 10 companies on this uh

36
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:24,959
this website

37
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:26,879
and i ended up buying one i was my first

38
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,919
penny stock i ever bought

39
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,158
um

40
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,118
and it went up like 50

41
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,799
uh

42
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:34,959
two days later i was like oh my god this

43
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,118
is amazing i'm like what what did i find

44
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:39,438
like i you know i felt like a discovered

45
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:40,719
fire and then two days after that it

46
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,839
dropped 50

47
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:46,798
so i ended up losing 150 bucks

48
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,600
um and i was kind of hooked from there

49
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,799
um

50
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:53,280
and just kind of trying to you know like

51
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,520
look for these sorts of things and these

52
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,000
were early days you know it wasn't even

53
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:59,039
canadian companies really they were a

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,200
couple

55
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,560
um but not too many you know this is

56
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,079
before canopy aurora chronos and and all

57
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,840
of them

58
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:09,439
so it really was a crap shoot in the

59
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,920
early days

60
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:14,479
so yeah and from there

61
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:16,639
then colorado went legal

62
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:19,199
and um you know you didn't even really

63
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:20,719
have unicorns you had like

64
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:23,359
uh

65
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:25,919
stables of unicorns because you could

66
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,120
buy something at a half a penny back

67
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:28,639
then

68
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,560
and

69
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:31,518
you know watch it go up ten thousand

70
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,598
percent

71
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,920
um which to put that in perspective if

72
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:38,318
you bought a million shares of the stock

73
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:40,958
at a half a penny it would cost you five

74
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:42,799
thousand dollars and if it went to you

75
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,439
know 50 cents

76
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,360
that's a half a million dollars and

77
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:49,280
people were making money like that you

78
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,879
know the problem was a lot of people

79
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,400
just thought it was going to go higher

80
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:53,439
and higher and higher

81
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,239
um

82
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:56,239
and

83
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,719
never took money off the table and then

84
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,280
watched it just go right back

85
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:05,199
so you know like the

86
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:08,000
discipline in the early days um was

87
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:10,238
something that you were forced to learn

88
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,479
um and it's you know something that we

89
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:16,319
still have trouble with today you know

90
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:17,840
in 2022 eight years later

91
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:19,679
okay very interesting just getting that

92
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,840
money off the table at the appropriate

93
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,719
time is the key to this whole game isn't

94
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,519
it

95
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,318
yeah

96
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,680
for sure i've used notice to i've

97
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:29,839
noticed a kind of let's say an

98
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,680
underground world or reddit forms full

99
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,200
of cannabis investors now that are

100
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,760
starting to get pretty substantial like

101
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:38,479
we talked to roger forsberg aka puff

102
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:39,919
daddy he was on the show last week so

103
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:41,280
i'm starting to notice there's this

104
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,158
little cult

105
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,400
uh

106
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:46,318
gathering and crew happening on on

107
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,719
twitter and on reddit that's basically

108
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:50,958
uh tearing the cannabis emissions apart

109
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:53,840
and building up the kind of first tier

110
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,239
cannabis mso shall we say yeah

111
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,560
yeah i mean you know

112
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:02,080
i i love that you know

113
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,280
cannabis has always been a cult sector

114
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,599
always

115
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:09,199
you know and and we've always had our

116
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:10,798
you know call it like our teams you know

117
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:13,039
i like this company you like that

118
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,560
company we're gonna beef we're gonna you

119
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:15,438
know fight it out

120
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,879
um

121
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:20,639
and and now you've got all these these

122
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:22,478
teams basically

123
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,879
uh you know like

124
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:26,319
fighting the people that own the arenas

125
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:28,959
you know

126
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:30,079
called the exchanges and whatnot

127
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:31,839
um

128
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,519
and so

129
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:35,519
you know these people that we're

130
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:38,000
adversaries at one point are a little

131
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:38,719
bit galvanized to kind of like team up

132
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,040
and

133
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,720
and are forced to

134
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:48,319
explain like to everybody else why this

135
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:51,040
is still uh a meaningful investment

136
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:54,159
um you know the the the sector has

137
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,400
just been absolutely hammered you know

138
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,960
when it in terms of from like a capital

139
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,959
markets perspective um now the

140
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:02,399
businesses on the other hand have been

141
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:04,638
thriving

142
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:06,959
um which is

143
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,478
very hard for people to understand and

144
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:11,359
you know it's a point that i always make

145
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:14,000
that the business like you could like a

146
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,038
strain of marijuana from one of these

147
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,839
companies

148
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:20,079
um take like a med men okay like med men

149
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:22,959
is a great brand you know it's very

150
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:25,279
visible the stores are nice

151
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:26,959
um from a capital markets perspective

152
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:28,159
like a public company

153
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:32,079
it is

154
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:35,759
aids it is as close to stock market aids

155
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:38,399
it's like if aids and ebola had

156
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,720
a baby

157
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:43,198
that's what med men would be from a

158
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,560
capital markets perspective so you you

159
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,919
have to

160
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,800
um

161
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:50,319
understand that going into it and now

162
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,120
you see a lot of these people on the

163
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:55,439
reddit forums twitter trying to explain

164
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,759
that to to all these people that it's

165
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:59,439
not so much a problem with the companies

166
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,080
it's a problem with

167
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:04,639
um the exchanges that they're on it's a

168
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:07,839
problem with that there's only 95

169
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:10,720
percent um

170
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:13,439
or there's instead there's 95

171
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,800
retail ownership and only 5

172
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:17,120
institutional

173
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,840
which basically means that

174
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:23,199
all these stocks are being priced in by

175
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:24,000
complete morons and you know i and i say

176
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,319
that

177
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,759
all the time that i think pot stock

178
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,919
investors

179
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,919
um you know

180
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:35,198
90 of them are probably the dumbest

181
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:36,399
people in the world yeah well i think

182
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,079
there's a lot to be left to the

183
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:40,399
imagination if you can't read a balance

184
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,758
sheet or read a profit a loss sheet or

185
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:43,599
even see what kind of cash flow some of

186
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,080
these companies have i think that's what

187
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,919
seems to be happening is that the mass

188
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:50,719
or vast majority of campus investors

189
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:52,560
have no nuanced financial skill and

190
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,880
somebody basically been able to explain

191
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,959
to them look this is why this stock is

192
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:59,120
man united and this stock is real madrid

193
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:00,959
or why i think there's a lot of value

194
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,360
and i think that's going to be

195
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,879
the next let's say wave of financial

196
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,680
gain in the industry i see it as the

197
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:09,918
media and the info the

198
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,160
influencers being able to have a direct

199
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:14,240
voice to these large consumer bases as

200
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,720
you said some are truly some are cure

201
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,879
relief it all depends it's almost like a

202
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,800
little a tribal situation that seems to

203
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,639
be happening in the the

204
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,919
retail investor market

205
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,120
yeah for sure

206
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:28,240
um

207
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,079
yeah and you know it's also

208
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,560
there's a little bit of nuance in there

209
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:35,519
as well as being an investor in this

210
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,759
space um you know like you always and

211
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:40,719
i'm sure you've seen it where i think

212
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:43,520
that people that dollar cost average in

213
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,160
cannabis are always going to get killed

214
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,758
um meaning like they have a budget and

215
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,439
i'm going to buy some here i'm going to

216
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,680
buy some air and then i'll buy some a

217
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:54,399
little bit further down if it goes down

218
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,959
i just buy some more that's never worked

219
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:59,679
um you know i've always been somebody

220
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:01,439
that core trades position meaning like i

221
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,519
have a set position

222
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:08,399
um that i buy usually in the summer time

223
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:11,120
and i have uh like call that eighty

224
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:14,560
percent i don't touch and then with that

225
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:18,478
20 on the upswing i do trade it as a

226
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:21,680
means to grow the entire position but

227
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:23,519
also take it as almost like a dividend

228
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,199
uh meaning like

229
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:28,000
i'll give you a quick

230
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:31,199
rundown say i buy a thousand uh

231
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,759
shares of the stock at um ten dollars

232
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:38,560
and then it goes to eleven dollars well

233
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:40,559
i sell 250 shares okay so that's 25

234
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:43,918
all right well now it goes back down to

235
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:47,439
10 and i i rebuy it i don't buy back i

236
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:49,919
just buy back 250 shares i pocket the

237
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,160
difference which is the 250 bucks and i

238
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:56,000
save it for a rainy day um and that

239
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:58,879
served me you know also like going into

240
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,799
um february to the summer which is the

241
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:03,039
back half of the year and that time

242
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:05,199
period which i call the odds of march

243
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:08,559
like you're not buying you're not taking

244
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:13,040
on size um the market has

245
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:15,359
sucked since 2014 from march to summer

246
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:17,838
um you know that's when you're

247
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,680
uh you're not increasing your exposure

248
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,600
you're decreasing it and you're waiting

249
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:24,879
for that that summer low

250
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,360
to you know buy stuff back you know i

251
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:29,919
can and then like my last and final rule

252
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,399
is if anything that i own ever hits an

253
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:34,799
all-time high in february

254
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:38,958
um which is right before that march

255
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:42,319
start i sell 30 of the position

256
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:43,759
no matter what um and that's

257
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,560
at a minimum

258
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:48,720
so in february of 21 where everything

259
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:51,679
hit an all-time high

260
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,320
just doing that um saved me a lot of

261
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:56,799
grief across the board

262
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,480
you know so there is some nuance this

263
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:00,240
isn't you know you have to remember

264
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,039
these are all speculative companies at

265
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,519
the end of the day in a sector that is

266
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:06,719
going to be wildly different 10 years

267
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,720
from now

268
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,560
than it is right now you know if you go

269
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,278
back to when prohibition ended there was

270
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:16,159
like 300 companies you know now there's

271
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:17,039
10 and maybe you can name five

272
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:19,679
right

273
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:21,360
yeah now i agree the amount of

274
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:23,039
information and data and i think you

275
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,320
need to be consuming at your level that

276
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,838
people aren't just going to be able to

277
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,079
pick the right

278
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:31,040
solution off the bat from researching

279
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:32,719
companies to board the ceo looking at

280
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,879
the balance sheet profit and loss sheets

281
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,320
the history of the relationships that

282
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,838
have been had at that company i think

283
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,800
there's a huge amount of data that needs

284
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,800
to be

285
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:42,719
consumed on a daily basis to make those

286
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:44,559
nuanced decisions i'm going to jump on

287
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,320
to the next topic and it's basically the

288
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:48,799
wolf of weed street the moniker you have

289
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,720
on twitter did that just come out of the

290
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:52,879
movie and you put one and one together

291
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,278
and got two or was there yeah

292
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:58,838
that's exactly what happened um actually

293
00:10:55,278 --> 00:11:01,439
um i was engaged at the time and my

294
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:03,760
fiancee went out with a bunch of her

295
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,800
friends and um

296
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:06,639
and i

297
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:09,120
just so happened to have off and i was

298
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:11,919
doing something completely different

299
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,159
at the time and

300
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:16,000
i was like oh and nobody's home i was

301
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:18,319
like i'm gonna you know smoke a joint

302
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,759
and watch some tv

303
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,560
and

304
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:23,360
so that's what i did and i saw a trailer

305
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:25,599
for

306
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,200
um the wolf of wall street

307
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,680
and i was like

308
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,360
haha wolf of weed street that would be a

309
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:33,838
funny name

310
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,839
and um i was like i bet somebody on

311
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,920
twitter already has it so i went to

312
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,200
twitter and nobody had it

313
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:41,679
and i was like

314
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,839
stoned and i was like oh just make a

315
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:45,439
goof of it and i put like a photoshopped

316
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,240
head of a wolf

317
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,440
on leonardo dicaprio's body

318
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,600
and

319
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,720
you know it's just a goof to start and i

320
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,680
was like man

321
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,160
i can talk about all of these companies

322
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:00,638
that i'm like are really scammy

323
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:02,879
um anonymously and and that's what i was

324
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,600
doing you know like no recourse like i

325
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:06,799
could just say whatever i wanted to say

326
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,079
um

327
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:10,159
and

328
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:11,599
that's exactly what i did and people

329
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:14,480
were really

330
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,480
uh you know responsive to it you know

331
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,320
they they liked it and i just kind of

332
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,879
like showed things and

333
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,639
and you know at the end of the day like

334
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:25,200
we were all kind of in the same boat

335
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,480
there was not a lot of information out

336
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,360

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,278
we were finding a lot of companies that

355
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:12,958
were just po boxes

356
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:14,480
um so

357
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,239

358
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,639

and uh i get up you know like

385
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:15,919
30 minutes later hour later

386
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:18,078
the whole entire cannabis market and i

387
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:19,120
think this is january 10th

388
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:21,519
um

389
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,560
2014 dropped 60

390
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:27,759
in an afternoon in an afternoon so i

391
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:29,518
remember my account was at like 75 000

392
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:32,000
and at the end of the day it was it

393
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,600
closed at like 29 000.

394
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,198
now because i've been looking at the

395
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,839
sector so hard

396
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:39,759
i had a pretty good idea where like

397
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,279
what the good companies were and and

398
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:43,360
where it would balance

399
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:46,240
um so i kind of divided what what i have

400
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,079
left into these companies and you know

401
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,240
everybody just kind of followed along

402
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:53,120
and then the wolf just kind of

403
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,879
uh got bigger and bigger from there

404
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,039
oh it's an amazing story if anybody's

405
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:58,799
not following i should highly recommend

406
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:00,799
that you go and get over to twitter and

407
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:03,120
follow the wolf of wall street or wheat

408
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:04,719
street um last thing before we go i want

409
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,839
to just touch on the true trading group

410
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,759
that you're a part of can you give

411
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,120
everybody just a little overview of that

412
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:10,639
uh organization

413
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,000
yeah so

414
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,919
um it's great uh you know during co like

415
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,198
this is something because you know when

416
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:19,039
we were going back and i just talked

417
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:21,719
about that first website that i went on

418
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:23,519
to find uh pot socks that was

419
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,879
marijuanastocks.com and that was a site

420
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:30,240
that uh myself and my two other partners

421
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:32,720
mike and adam um ended up buying

422
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,919
um which was kind of like full circle

423
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,839
and then true trading group was

424
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:41,919
um an idea

425
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:44,399
um that adam had

426
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:46,639
uh to you know basically get out of the

427
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,759
investor relations world and you know

428
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,079
make it

429
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,560
like an educational platform think of it

430
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:54,479
like netflix but for trading where

431
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:55,359
you know you pay one price and then you

432
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,159
get

433
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,240
um all these things you know like all

434
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:03,120
the content all the

435
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,720
you know courses the tests everything

436
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,600
all in one place

437
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,759
um and then during and then code would

438
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,519
and

439
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,919
you know i i

440
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,639
honestly like i i really didn't want

441
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:18,719
much to do with it and then

442
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,799
um kobet hit

443
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,240
and i was get i was already doing it on

444
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:24,159
twitter like telling people what i was

445
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,399
buying and i just found like all these

446
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:29,919
people were really ungrateful

447
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,278
i became a moderator there um and now a

448
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:32,639
part owner

449
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:34,799
and

450
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,120
we basically start with like 300 people

451
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:38,479
now we're at 10 000 with the whole idea

452
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,399
of like

453
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,440

454
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,078
know

455
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:47,279
um and you know there's a whole

456
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:51,039
psychological aspect to investing um and

457
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:52,958
trading that nobody talks about um

458

477
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:31,599
you know

478
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:33,599

00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,879
it and take a test and that's how you

484
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,600
you know that you're ready

485
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,840

um you know through there

487
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:54,079

490
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,840
bucks

491
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,360
for a week and you get some courses and

492
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:03,119
then you can also listen to us like

493
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:05,519
throughout the course of the day

494
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:08,000
it's not just about like getting alerts

495
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:10,720
and somebody telling you what to do

496
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,200
um because that that doesn't that only

497
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,759
worked so long right you want to be able

498

to make your own trades and and

499
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:20,480
ultimately that's that's the goal um and

500
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,960
then people stay

501
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,120
