1
00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:04,139
foreign

2
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,778
DeFalco who's a partner and director of

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:21,240
research at CB1 Capital how you keeping

4
00:00:18,778 --> 00:00:22,859
today Lauren good how are you Owen I'm

5
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:24,299
fantastic thank you very much for taking

6
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:25,380
your time to do this I know you're very

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,820
busy

8
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:28,018
um do you maybe want to give everybody I

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,460
think we'll start off with your story

10
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:31,320
because you've got a pretty interesting

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,120
story in your background with cannabis

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,200
and tell everybody how you came to be in

13
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,379
the industry

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,059
sure so yeah I mean the last 25 years in

15
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,879
finance and

16
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:45,599
it's about 2008 I was coming back from a

17
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:48,599
trip to the home office at HSBC at the

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,280
time and and ended up waking up in an

19
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,559
ambulance as I was waiting for a car to

20
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,700
pick me up at the airport back in on

21
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,339
Long Island

22
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:59,399
and basically was told that I had a

23
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,379
massive seizure and my neurologist so I

24
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,140
went to go see after that told me that I

25
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:06,840
had to start taking these medications or

26
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:10,739
I would no longer be allowed to drive so

27
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,900
I start to take them and ended up

28
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:14,699
stacking myself up on a host of other

29
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,400
meds to deal with the side effects of

30
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,939
these seizure beds and it was just a

31
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,320
decline cognitive abilities and I knew

32
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:24,298
this was not a good long-term solution

33
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,399
for the seizure disorder so I started to

34
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,680
look around and found this work being

35
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,359
done overseas in Israel Italy and Spain

36
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,820
and other countries on the

37
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:35,099
endocannabinoid system

38
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:37,078
and I took a lot of the data especially

39
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:39,478
in regards to diet and applied it to

40
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:41,879
myself copious amounts of cannabinoids

41
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:43,618
and a year later I had another EEG with

42
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:46,379
my neurologist and she said there was no

43
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:48,000
more seizure activity and a light bulb

44
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:50,459
kind of went off like wow this this

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,319
actually works and you know from that

46
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:54,199
point on I I just drove to find out as

47
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:56,459
much as I could about what this

48
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,320
endocannabinoid system was and the

49
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:00,539
opportunity

50
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:03,298
okay incredible can you maybe explain to

51
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,820
everybody what CB capital and CB1

52
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:07,860
capital is and what your exact tactics

53
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:10,500
in this industry are

54
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:11,878
sure so yeah we're a long short hedge

55
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,580
fund uh

56
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:16,378
also have a sister arm that is advisory

57
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:20,099
for a whole bunch of private public

58
00:02:16,378 --> 00:02:22,199
companies but focused on cannabinoids uh

59
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:24,119
you know the name CB1 is the first

60
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:26,759
cannabinoid receptor that was discovered

61
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,860
in in the mid 90s

62
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:31,759
um and and so the idea with GW

63
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:35,640
Pharmaceuticals as the first successful

64
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:38,399
uh ideation of this with their epidiolex

65
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:40,859
was to find companies uh going through

66
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,620
drug development uh through the FDA or

67
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:47,160
EMA and targeting the endocannabinoid

68
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,840
system as well as other parts of you

69
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:50,759
know receptors in the body that that

70
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,200
cannabinoids seem to bind

71
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:55,019
too

72
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:56,939
okay very good next topic I wanted to

73
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:59,400
jump on to is opportunities in medical

74
00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:01,139
cannabis do you think the industry at

75
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,519
the moment we obviously know Canada and

76
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,958
America have got a head start when it

77
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:05,459
comes to their cultivation and the

78
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:07,560
recreational side of the industry

79
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:09,420
whereas Europe seems to have laid out a

80
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,759
more medical focused industry do you

81
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:13,378
think Europe is going to have an

82
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,598
advantage when it comes to the creation

83
00:03:13,378 --> 00:03:17,840
of these new drugs and targeting

84
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:20,098
receptors and the creation of a

85
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,300
pharmaceutical grade companies in this

86
00:03:20,098 --> 00:03:22,979
industry

87
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,439
you know I'm not sure if they're going

88
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:27,598
to have an advantage as much as much as

89
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,098
this just opens up more opportunities

90
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:31,679
for investment

91
00:03:29,098 --> 00:03:33,719
you know the the U.S has as a hybrid

92
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,000
model in a sense that the state programs

93
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:38,098
are medical they're all different in

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,500
every state and then there's drug

95
00:03:38,098 --> 00:03:43,798
development through the FDA such as GW

96
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:47,098
Pharmaceuticals with epidiolex so you

97
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:49,620
know two distinct markets uh in the near

98
00:03:47,098 --> 00:03:52,259
term the medical program especially in

99
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,239
Europe should start to really grow and

100
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:56,340
the longer tail because of the amount of

101
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,340
time involved is the drug development

102
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:01,739
and that's what we foresee being the

103
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,080
larger market as time goes on but it

104
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:06,060
will take time to get these these drugs

105
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,440
into the clinic and through an approval

106
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,539
process

107
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,280
and when it comes to the ingredients out

108
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:13,378
of this industry do you think the

109
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,780
biotechnology companies that are using

110
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:18,060
fermentation engineering and bio

111
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,978
processing to be able to deliver these

112
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,259
molecules on scale that might only be

113
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:24,240
available at a minute percentage when it

114
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:25,918
comes to the actual plant material do

115
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,139
you think they're the future of the

116
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:31,019
medical side of the industry

117
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:33,478
yes we we believe that anything that's

118
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:35,279
cheaper more consistent

119
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:38,099
the Purity levels that you'll get

120
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:40,258
relative to organic farming you know

121
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:43,199
lends to the idea that those especially

122
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:45,960
for the minor cannabinoids should be the

123
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,478
preferred vehicle for research you know

124
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:51,659
retail opportunities as well consistent

125
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:55,019
supply chain with Purity is is very

126
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:56,820
important so depending on how successful

127
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:59,240
the scaling up of some of these miners

128
00:04:56,819 --> 00:05:02,279
which we've seen some companies not

129
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,800
execute on there are a couple left that

130
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:06,119
have we believe and so if they're

131
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,040
successful with some of these miners

132
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,740
that that should be the go-to for for

133
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,900
many purposes due to the cost

134
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,840
and what makes a good investment

135
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:17,279
opportunity for you guys what are are

136
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:20,279
there a couple of key principles the

137
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:22,258
management team potential for IEP we can

138
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:23,819
do like danaher systems do where we come

139
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:25,740
in and we can Implement our business

140
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:27,779
methods onto this company and increase

141
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,600
the value of it is there a specific

142
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:32,519
strategy or is there no one size fits

143
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,340
all for this industry at the moment

144
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:37,198
yeah I mean ideally like you know

145
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:38,698
management is always key at a time to

146
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,759
understand who The Operators are to

147
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:45,379
drive the vision forward

148
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,379
um but you know there's

149
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:52,139
I would say

150
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:53,879
looking at the moat of The Operators is

151
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:56,280
very important understanding their

152
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:58,560
advantages there from an IP perspective

153
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:00,899
or anything else those are key

154
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,579
differentiators the size of the

155
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:05,279
available Market are you actually

156
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:07,500
solving a problem that exists or are you

157
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:09,899
just trying to duplicate something

158
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:12,300
some other process out there so ideally

159
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:14,758
looking at management understanding the

160
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,978
moat looking at the opportunity those

161
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:18,780
are all very key factors but especially

162
00:06:16,978 --> 00:06:19,680
in a startup it always comes back to the

163
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:21,839
management

164
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,959
so when it comes to making Investments

165
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:26,818
for you guys being a a data gatherer of

166
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:29,519
sorts and understanding the nuances of

167
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:31,259
policy around the world would be a very

168
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:32,818
advantageous thing to spot the best

169
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:35,639
opportunities coming for you guys would

170
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:38,220
that be correct yes very very focused on

171
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:40,740
the regulatory change that's happening

172
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:43,440
in various geographical regions that

173
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:45,600
does present opportunities so the U.S

174
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:47,759
has been signing with uh you know

175
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:52,080
Federal changes that have not occurred

176
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:54,660
for years now and how that you know will

177
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:58,139
drive the industry as a key factor into

178
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,639
how we look at the investing opportunity

179
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:01,079
um so looking at that looking at

180
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:02,639
journals you know for the drug

181
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:05,038
development side there's

182
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,199
been some new cannabinoid a couple of

183
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:10,079
cannabinoid focused journals that that

184
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,639
are doing a lot of the you know showing

185
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,698
a lot of the pre-clinical work being

186
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:16,439
done that will help to guide drug

187
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:18,900
development in terms of the right

188
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:21,180
Avenues so yeah research is always key

189
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:24,598
looking there's a ton of information out

190
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:26,400
there and it's it's increasing the

191
00:07:24,598 --> 00:07:28,139
amount of of information that's being

192
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:29,818
driven through through the you know

193
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:31,379
research being done through pre-clinical

194
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:33,840
processes

195
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:35,219
do you think the real value is in the

196
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:37,439
Pharma companies of the biotech

197
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,300
companies being able to get access to

198
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:40,620
these molecules and then blend them and

199
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,478
mix them together to create their own

200
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,939
formulations for a various tip of

201
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:46,680
different ailments is that the Big Money

202
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:49,319
Shot when it comes to this side of the

203
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,478
industry and if it is when it comes to

204
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:53,460
the IEP side of things do you think it's

205
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:54,899
most advantageous to get the IEP as

206
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:56,758
quickly as you can or to keep the

207
00:07:54,899 --> 00:07:58,739
process that you've created to yourself

208
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:00,680
for as long as you can what's the most

209
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:04,740
advantageous route

210
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:07,019
yeah so Trade Secrets versus patents you

211
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:09,418
know it really depends hey you know if

212
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:11,579
you're talking about retail type

213
00:08:09,418 --> 00:08:13,258
operations sometimes those trade secrets

214
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:15,538
are better off kept but if you're

215
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:18,180
looking at drug development you're going

216
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:19,259
to have to have a patent behind the

217
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,699
products you're bringing to Market

218
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:23,098
unless you're going through an orphan

219
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:28,020
indication or something of that nature

220
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:30,538
so yeah IP uh on on cannabinoids the

221
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:32,879
combination for different indications a

222
00:08:30,538 --> 00:08:35,639
combination of cannabinoids we believe

223
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:39,360
that is you know where things are headed

224
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:41,699
there's a difficulty once you get Beyond

225
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,500
a couple different API you know there's

226
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:46,740
a Botanical route that you can go

227
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:50,220
through with the FDA as well so we do

228
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:52,799
believe that once they understand what's

229
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:55,259
really driving the Entourage effect as

230
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:57,719
they say for for you know therapeutic

231
00:08:55,259 --> 00:09:00,539
benefit we can identify the specific

232
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:03,360
compounds and the specific mechanism of

233
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:05,699
action that by isolating those compounds

234
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,100
and putting them together that that

235
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:10,259
should be the path forward for a lot of

236
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,980
these companies for drug development but

237
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:16,019
there's also enzyme inhibition and

238
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:18,480
catabolization uh that other companies

239
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:21,899
have looked at jazz Pharmaceuticals has

240
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:24,539
a far inhibitor for PTSD that reads a

241
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:25,980
phase two out late fall early winter

242
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:29,278
this year

243
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:31,639
and that is not a cannabinoid it's a

244
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:34,139
enzyme inhibitor but it targets

245
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:36,179
endocannabinoids within the body so

246
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:39,120
definitely different ways of targeting

247
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:40,019
the system uh we saw no bone artist the

248
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,259
other day

249
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:44,940
purchase a Canadian cannabinoid focused

250
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:46,200
direct development company for about a

251
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,180
billion dollars

252
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,040
as they're going into a phase two for

253
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:52,859
obesity

254
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:55,620
um so that's interesting uh it's early

255
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:58,259
early endings I'll say and the

256
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:01,139
development should keep ratcheting up

257
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:02,879
higher as more research is done

258
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:04,799
the last topic I want to talk to before

259
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,419
electrical was endocannabinoid Article

260
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:08,458
drugs can you maybe give everybody an

261
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:10,439
overview what are the steps that are

262
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:12,479
going to be involved for a company to

263
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,240
create an endo cannabinoid targeted drug

264
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,159
is it product development or even drug

265
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,500
trial clinical trial or there are

266
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:22,500
multiple steps in between

267
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:25,080
well I mean you have to identify the you

268
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:27,120
know the target the indication with the

269
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:30,360
compound as well through you know

270
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,459
Perry's processes once you've identified

271
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,839
the right compound and indication you

272
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:36,778
have to go through all the pre-clinical

273
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,980
work unless you're going to use a

274
00:10:36,778 --> 00:10:40,338
compound that's already gone through

275
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,959
that for 505b

276
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:46,380
so you know pre-clinical work animal

277
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:48,719
studies IND entering the clinic is the

278
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:51,659
normal process uh you know it's

279
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,420
typically how most of these work

280
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:55,679
when it comes to the U.S industry How

281
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:57,899
likely are we to see Federal

282
00:10:55,679 --> 00:11:01,379
legalization in the next 12 months or is

283
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:03,320
this just a an ongoing uh point of

284
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:06,360
annoyance for everybody over there

285
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:09,360
legalization will take probably years

286
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:11,639
there are other steps along the way

287
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,680
there is the banking bill the safe act

288
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:15,539
as they call it which is supposed to

289
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:18,179
come back up for

290
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:20,879
committee uh September of this year

291
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:22,078
there's also rescheduling that's in

292
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:24,778
motion

293
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:27,120
behind the scenes and the timing of that

294
00:11:24,778 --> 00:11:29,220
rescheduling is hard to know some point

295
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,379
between the end this year and the end of

296
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:34,860
next year is the assumption that people

297
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:38,458
have and if we get a rescheduling down

298
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:41,639
to a schedule three uh or lower it

299
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:45,419
allows an opportunity for retail uh

300
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:47,879
loses their 280e tax uh penalty in a

301
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:49,799
sense for drug development

302
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:51,899
you know there's not too much difference

303
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:55,559
there was a bill that was take that put

304
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:57,240
forth I think last fall that that try to

305
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:59,578
or some people thought was going to open

306
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,039
up the pathway for cannabinoid drug

307
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:04,559
development not so much

308
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:06,778
but you know if you could do your

309
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:08,338
pre-clinical work and then you can move

310
00:12:06,778 --> 00:12:09,720
forward with an IND you'll be able to

311
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:10,980
work with these compounds in that

312
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,778
setting

313
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,220
incredible I know you're a very busy man

314
00:12:12,778 --> 00:12:15,899
so I'm not going to keep you any longer

315
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,399
it's been absolutely fantastic talking

316
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:19,379
to you learn for anybody who wants to

317
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:21,120
learn more about CB1 Capital you can see

318
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:22,379
the website below it'll be in all the

319
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,539
descriptions of where you're watching or

320
