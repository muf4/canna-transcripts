provide

27
00:00:55,759 --> 00:01:01,280
yeah so i've been working for the past

28
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:04,478
10 years in drug policy i started

29
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,239
working at the u.n especially for unodc

30
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:09,200
the office for drugs and crime in

31
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:11,519
central america and south east asia and

32
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,400
i came back to france about seven years

33
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:17,438
ago to work more on the civil society

34
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,840
side of drug policy among the influence

35
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:21,069
and lobbying aspect of it

36
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,240
and um

37
00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:25,118
[Music]

38
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:27,438
one thing leading to another uh with my

39
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:28,118
current partner aurelia

40
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:31,758
we

41
00:01:28,118 --> 00:01:34,560
co-created the professional hemp union

42
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,799
about three years ago uh which gathered

43
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,439
for the first time professionals from

44
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,079
the cbd and medical cannabis sector in

45
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:44,798
france so very burgeoning markets both

46
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:47,039
of them um so it was the first

47
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,240
professional representation in order to

48
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,560
have a united front to talk with um

49
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:55,280
legislators and and and elected

50
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,719
officials and the administration

51
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,359
managed the

52
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:02,158
union for about a year we produced

53
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:03,759
several groundbreaking white papers that

54
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,040
helped shape

55
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:10,399
both markets regulations uh in the year

56
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:14,080
afters and uh about three years ago we

57
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,840
started to create ogre associates uh in

58
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,280
the um

59
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,159
uh

60
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,039
the we needed to find a new way to

61
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:25,520
accompany the development of juicy class

62
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:28,959
systems and so the idea was really to

63
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,120
create a highly specialized group

64
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,319
that was a

65
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,319
open to to support companies from france

66
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:37,759
and from abroad that wanted to do a

67
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:40,479
business in

68
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:43,519
cbd in medical cannabis market we do

69
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:45,759
also a lot of industrial hemp projects

70
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,680
um so now we

71
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:50,878
work in france a lot but because of

72
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,599
koveed we started working a lot in other

73
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:55,039
countries and so now we have uh we're

74
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:57,280
heading projects a little bit of

75
00:02:55,039 --> 00:03:00,639
everywhere uh in the world

76
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,400
so it's been a fantastic ride since then

77
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:04,238
amazing yeah you guys seem to be at the

78
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,239
central focal point of the french

79
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,400
industry i kind of wanted to bring you

80
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,039
on to give everybody a little clarity on

81
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,760
the french cannabis industry so we had

82
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:16,400
in november 2020 the court of justice of

83
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:19,759
the european union confirmed cbd wasn't

84
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,599
narcotic then we had in november 2021

85
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:23,919
which is last year a legal firm called

86
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:26,798
latham and watkins with a lawyer evelyn

87
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:28,719
von k muellen won a court case that

88
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,560
basically solidified that you could have

89
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,639
0.03

90
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,280
in your cbd and you could use the whole

91
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:38,399
plant to process oils and to use for

92
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,799
tinctures but then separately cbd flower

93
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,120
has been banned for sale have i

94
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,080
summarized that correctly for where we

95
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,920
are at the moment so mostly and and they

96
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,959
really sometimes in the detail in the in

97
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:52,719
the details um the 03

98
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,640
is not directly coming from the kind of

99
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:57,519
a case but more in the ongoing

100
00:03:54,639 --> 00:04:00,719
discussions at the reform for the

101
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,519
agricultural common policy from the eu

102
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,799
that's

103
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:08,319
we raised the bar at 0 3

104
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,560
which it was prior to the end of the 90s

105
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:13,438
where upon you know lobbying efforts

106
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,079
from the agricultural french actually we

107
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:17,199
lowered down at zero two percent

108
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,280
um

109
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,720
interesting to know that it's not

110
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:25,039
so much of a norm but rather a

111
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,759
limitation upon which farmers can

112
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,879
receive subsidiaries from that

113
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:33,600
agricultural common policy so it's a

114
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:35,918
little bit of of this and on on the

115
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,680
other side um

116
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:41,120
flowers is

117
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:45,040
open to sell but only on b2b so the

118
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,680
issues is direct to consumer cell

119
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,520
okay so how would they see

120
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,199
how would that make sense that if b2b

121
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:52,560
also it's just the processing of flour

122
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,520
they're allowed to sell flour to each

123
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,600
other okay i get you and we i can only

124
00:04:55,519 --> 00:05:00,079
you can understand that to a degree with

125
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,240
the similarities with thc and cbd flair

126
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:04,399
being almost identical and the police

127
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,918
not being kind of informed enough to be

128
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:09,839
able to know the difference between the

129
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:09,839
two flowers so do you see this

130
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,479
behind that behind that we we do know

131
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:20,959
it's a fallacy because it's not causing

132
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:23,599
a problem in many other countries where

133
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:25,839
they do have different markets and

134
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,800
capacities for police forces to make the

135
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,679
difference through very useful and easy

136
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,879
uh

137
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:36,319
you know easy use uh types of of of

138
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:39,600
monitors and testing and testing kits so

139
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:41,759
um the issue is a much more political

140
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,439
ploy than than that you have to

141
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,160
understand that the context right now

142
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:50,560
france is the one of the presidential

143
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:53,600
campaign um and so uh everything is kind

144
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,639
of tainted by it by this and macron for

145
00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:00,000
the past two years has uh went into a

146
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:03,519
direction uh with his government in uh

147
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,959
making clear that they didn't want to uh

148
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,599
legalize

149
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:10,079
flowers from the hand markets because

150
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,879
they would give too much for them the

151
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:14,879
impression that they're regulating

152
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:17,038
legalizing cannabis

153
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:18,478
that's the real reason

154
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:20,159
do you see what you've seen over in

155
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,839
ireland here now a number of the stores

156
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,520
that are selling cbd flower have been

157
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:24,799
targeted directly and there's a couple

158
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:26,959
of other people around europe that we've

159
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,960
talked to it seems to be that the

160
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:30,959
industry for selling cbd flower will

161
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:33,038
only be able to flourish when a

162
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:35,359
recreational market is actually in place

163
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:37,120
do you see that being the case

164
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,199
no because i think it's already

165
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,160
flourishing and it's uh you know

166
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,800
whatever governments want to try to do

167
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,199
uh and let's take the example of france

168
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,680
uh for the past three years there's been

169
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,879
you know up and downs of of of

170
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,840
repression against retailers uh mainly

171
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:58,719
of cbd flowers uh with you know back and

172
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:01,119
forth in that in that regard so it's

173
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,520
never been uh what we call in france a

174
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:07,519
long fluff tranquil a long tranquil

175
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:10,478
river um the the the idea right now is

176
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:13,598
that it's directly

177
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:16,560
forbidden by the french government but

178
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:19,199
we a lot of people consider that it's uh

179
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:23,360
it's a contradiction to the european you

180
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:26,240
know flow goods uh of of commerce goods

181
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,319
you know and so we we we we're gonna

182
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,680
we're gonna see a lot of movements in

183
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,919
the legal aspect of it so i don't think

184
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,120
there was there's a need

185
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:39,758
right now or even if it's you know

186
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,680
germany aside you know uh there isn't a

187
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,400
lot of european countries that are

188
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,319
moving into that direction of complete

189
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:49,120
cannabis legalization

190
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,919
but we do see you know a use and

191
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,639
ecommerce of ham flowers a little bit of

192
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:56,639
everywhere so i i do think that

193
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,960
depending of the country regulation the

194
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,879
market is more or less open but it's

195
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:02,959
going to be existing because in france

196
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,080
even if

197
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:09,198
very hypothetically they stop selling

198
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:11,519
flowers in every retail stores on the on

199
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,160
the territory they're still

200
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,918
online marketplaces you know and suffice

201
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,319
to change your website to put it on

202
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:20,639
another server in another country

203
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,879
and you're good to go um so there's a

204
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,598
lot of you know contradictions and

205
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,919
issues with the new recommendation and

206
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:29,759
my take is that it's not going to hold

207
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:32,399
but it might take you know a couple of

208
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,839
years still to get a proper regulation

209
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,839
back in france

210
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,240
okay so you see the european ruling

211
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,080
within time being the de facto ruling

212
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,320
across all the european nations and the

213
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,919
governments will just have to abide by

214
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,080
because we can see a number of different

215
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:48,399
court cases froms flower centers

216
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,920
happening all across europe so the

217
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,519
argument isn't going to be able to

218
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:53,199
withstand do you think over a long

219
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,278
period of time

220
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,519
well i i you know i come from drug

221
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:59,759
policies and drug policies when you look

222
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,759
at the science look at the data you know

223
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:04,639
that prohibition you know whatever the

224
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:06,958
substance usually don't work and creates

225
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:09,199
you know unfundable

226
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:11,359
negative consequences that are much more

227
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,920
harmful than the than the products in

228
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,480
itself and so there is a sense of

229
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:19,199
denying reality you know these products

230
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,519
exist the use of those products exist

231
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,680
and if we take the flat the the flower

232
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,679
heaven you know flat have flowers it

233
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:28,639
even has you know very very strong you

234
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:31,919
know uh helpful capacities in order to

235
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:33,039
substitute more harmful products to uh

236
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:35,679
this one

237
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:38,159
so we can consider that you know

238
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:40,159
the wave is going to move forward at

239
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:42,319
which speed and what is going to be the

240
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:45,360
tempo is going to change depending of

241
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,760
its countries but i do think indeed that

242
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,879
there is no way around it you know

243
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:53,278
if the market is not properly legally

244
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:55,759
regulated it's going to be taken by the

245
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:58,480
black market and black market don't care

246
00:09:55,759 --> 00:10:00,559
about quality products don't care about

247
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,320
you know which age they're selling their

248
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:04,879
products to

249
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,519
and obviously there's no taxes and and

250
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:10,000
and all that so it's it's a it's a

251
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,480
question about just recognizing reality

252
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,720
and how can we reduce the harm of

253
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,440
potential harmful products to the

254
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,360
maximum and and not denying that you

255
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,959
know those products and their users

256
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,560
exist

257
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:23,838
yeah couldn't agree with you more on

258
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:25,278
that i want to jump on to the second

259
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,920
topic that i want to talk to you about

260
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:29,360
which is the cutting edge of cannabis so

261
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:30,639
from the people that i've talked to so

262
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,320
far you can kind of start to paint a

263
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:34,240
picture that malta are becoming one of

264
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,160
the leaders they've got a enterprise

265
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,320
board that have a million euro tech fund

266
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:40,000
for the cannabis industry denmark have

267
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,839
their ornamental flower industry which

268
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,919
gets backed by the government germany

269
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,000
are no doubt our renowned entrepreneurs

270
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:47,679
and with the recent news we'll have a

271
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,679
number of different cutting edge

272
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,919
technologies who do you see is the kind

273
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:54,159
of the foremost experts in europe when

274
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:55,759
it comes to this uh cutting edge

275
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:57,439
technology in cannabis and is there a

276
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:59,278
specific company or two that you think

277
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,880
everybody should keep an eye on

278
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:03,278
i think it's a really good question i

279
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:05,600
think the the sad truth i think is

280
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:07,919
europe is lagging behind a lot in

281
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,720
comparison to you know what's going on

282
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:13,838
in the u.s and canada and especially in

283
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,480
israel in terms of you know r d and and

284
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,800
can attack development uh i think we're

285
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,039
lagging behind a lot so it's very hard

286
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:23,359
to find you know and i think it's a

287
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:26,159
great news because it means that the

288
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:29,120
leader spot in that domain is yet to be

289
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:31,519
taken so it's up to the government that

290
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:35,039
will put in place the sufficient and

291
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:37,919
proper regulation in order to foster uh

292
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:39,360
proper you know r d and entrepreneurship

293
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:42,000
into those

294
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,159
those markets i think dalma denmark is

295
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,879
doing great things on the medical side i

296
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:50,399
think germany is going to be you know

297
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:53,759
the central actor and the norm maker for

298
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:56,559
uh many of the you know the the markets

299
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:58,480
medical and social use

300
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:02,159
i think in in both of things they're

301
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:05,839
gonna be uh become the leader um

302
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:07,838
i think the uk as a vibrant uh ecosystem

303
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:11,120
uh that is you know

304
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:13,760
you know more or less uh being helped by

305
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,000
their own national regulations

306
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:18,559
um i think it's an interesting you know

307
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,480
uh market to explore i think there's

308
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,879
great research that is being done in

309
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,360
spain right now i think it's one of the

310
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:28,399
the country to look at it for you know

311
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:31,360
clinical and and observational studies

312
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:33,278
of interest um and hopefully uh you know

313
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,639
we'll have things in france you know we

314
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:38,799
have great people working on genetics uh

315
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:42,399
manipulation and i think it's uh one of

316
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:44,479
the the greatest you know um uh frontier

317
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,159
that we're gonna have in order to have

318
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,720
personalized

319
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:50,559
medicine in cannabis which is i think

320
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,600
the way to go forward

321
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:56,078
um so yeah i think it's an exciting time

322
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,399
and i think the the competition is only

323
00:12:56,078 --> 00:12:59,759
it's only starting

324
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,278
yeah i couldn't agree with you more i

325
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:02,399
think israel are the tip of the spirit

326
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:04,879
at the moment when it comes to the

327
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,958
warranty in this sector and uh europe

328
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:09,120
has a lot to learn but as i said i think

329
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:12,000
when europe does get going i think we're

330
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,799
going to put on a turbo skates and we'll

331
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,159
uh catch up fairly quickly if not exceed

332
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:18,159
some of the territories already

333
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,600
mentioned i hope ireland becomes one of

334
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:20,958
the dominant players like we are in

335
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,120
europe where we're at the steppenstown

336
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:25,439
between north america and europe for a

337
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,200
lot of services and uh various other

338
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,279
segments of the industry but i think

339
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,759
it's an exciting 2022 we've got ahead

340
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:31,759
for the year

341
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:38,159
yeah i agree i think you know working in

342
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:40,480
cannabis is never tranquil it's always

343
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:43,039
new things happening and so it helps

344
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,120
build resilience which i think is the

345
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:48,399
number one quality that you need to have

346
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,240
to work into that that mo this markets

347
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,839
uh but it's back it's it's it's

348
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:56,159
incredible because we're we're

349
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,920
making as we're building as we're making

350
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:00,399
it you know yeah it's it's always

351
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:02,879
creating new things each client that we

352
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,000
work with it's kind of a new

353
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:06,240
challenge

354
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,480
and a different service that we haven't

355
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,919
reproduced or done before

356
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,639
and

357
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:15,360
hopefully we can help build uh the

358
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:18,159
ecosystem in order to have weight

359
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,240
because today you know um

360
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:22,319
we're not you know taken seriously by

361
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:26,240
some governments because it's still a

362
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:28,959
fairly small industries um so we we see

363
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,440
the the growth behind it so we're in in

364
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:34,399
you know we're quite certain that the

365
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:37,920
balance will shift and we're trying to

366
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:39,679
move that shift as soon as possible

367
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,799
