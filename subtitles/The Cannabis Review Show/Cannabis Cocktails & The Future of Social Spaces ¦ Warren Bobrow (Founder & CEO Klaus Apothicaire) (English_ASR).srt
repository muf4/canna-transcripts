the the banking industry to the cocktail

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,359
whisperer into the cannabis industry now

17
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:49,599
well i'd i'd use cannabis recreationally

18
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:52,558
and also medicinally since i was about

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,879
12 years old so it's and i'm 60 now so

20
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,799
it's not just overnight

21
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:58,878
but uh but i

22
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:00,640
i had a i had a path i had a different

23
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:03,519
path i've done a lot of things i've had

24
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,040
a lot of failures and uh i felt that if

25
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,040
you were going to be passionate about

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,960
anything that you do in life you should

27
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,840
find out what you love

28
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:14,239
and uh i worked in the off an on-premise

29
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,960
liquor industry for a number of years

30
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:19,359
rum judge i worked for a russian company

31
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:21,280
named marucia beverages

32
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:24,000
and uh you know it was a great

33
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,719
experience i got to see the world but it

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,079
also put about 50 pounds on me that i

35
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,798
didn't need

36
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:33,759
because of all the high sugar

37
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:36,000
and i developed some health problems not

38
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,118
you know massive health problems but i i

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,239
developed

40
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:42,478
glaucoma which i knew was exacerbated by

41
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:44,478
the amount of sugar that i was in taking

42
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,399
by being a rum judge

43
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:47,359
so i uh

44
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,478
during

45
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:53,359
july of 2018 it was uh tales of the

46
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:57,118
cocktail down in new orleans and uh

47
00:01:53,359 --> 00:02:01,280
i took my last distilled spirit strength

48
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:03,438
okay wow and so now you've got a close

49
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,359
apothecaries now i was doing a little

50
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:07,359
bit of research now so i realized that

51
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,118
klaus is a translation for victory of

52
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,280
the people

53
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:13,598
apathy kerry is a person who solved

54
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,719
medicine and drugs at one stage so i

55
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:16,878
want to know as i write in my

56
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:19,919
investigation that those two names were

57
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:22,399
put together intentionally well uh klaus

58
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:25,519
is his name i do you know i do have a

59
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,520
physical uh german drinking gnome he's a

60
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,480
uh you know he's a good little guy let's

61
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,400
see if i can get him out of his uh

62
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,079
out of his place

63
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,879
where i have him

64
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,640
someplace here he is bear with me you

65
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:40,318
have to move around a little bit when

66
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,559
you uh

67
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:43,759
broadcast things with me

68
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,120
here he is

69
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:47,439
uh

70
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,360
there he is brilliant okay he's a

71
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:54,560
traditional german drinking gnome and uh

72
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,400
i found him to be uh quite a wingman

73
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,439
and you know i was traveling around the

74
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,120
world by myself and you'd pull him out

75
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:04,318
and put him on the table

76
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,959
and uh he starts conversations

77
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:08,719
so i named my beverage after him

78
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,479
although i i should say you know i wrote

79
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:12,800
the book uh

80
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:15,280
cannabis cocktails i wrote another book

81
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,319
named apothecary cocktails

82
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,158
you know

83
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:22,359
two of my six books and uh you know the

84
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:24,719
the whole idea of of gnomes and

85
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,480
apothecarians and healing all work well

86
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:29,199
together and and by the way you know

87
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:30,560
it's mystical mystical thought mystical

88
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:33,439
healing stuff

89
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,759
so uh you know being in ireland you have

90
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:37,680
a great appreciation for that well we

91
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:39,679
certainly would we certainly would

92
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,319
creating all sorts of magical potions

93
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,080
and spells over here we are so can you

94
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:45,598
maybe give everybody a little overview

95
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,159
about the drink that's launched next

96
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:50,079
week we know you're an expert mixologist

97
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:51,439
can you let us know what you're in store

98
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,680
for we know we've got a number of cool

99
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:56,079
brands over the u.s we can see we've got

100
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,959
the guys uh luke and jake at cannes

101
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,319
you've got a xander at arteta new york

102
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,799
you've got yourself there's a lot of

103
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:05,119
excitement in the the beverage space

104
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,319
that the non-sugar beverage space can

105
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,360
you tell us

106
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:11,679
what to expect from your range of drinks

107
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,159
um well my my range of drinks are made

108
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,280
with all natural ingredients

109
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:18,478
my ginger syrup is usda certified

110
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,279
organic

111
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:24,719
the uh the citrus element is from a

112
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:27,359
company in france named liver zerboiron

113
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,080
they don't use any any chemical

114
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,720
pesticides in any of their products

115
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:36,478
and i chose to use their lime puree in

116
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,639
mind and then i have a rice vinegar uh

117
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:41,680
effect in it there's a little bit of

118
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,918
rice vinegar which gives it a tangy

119
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,079
effervescence in a way but no fizz i

120
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:49,039
mean it's not like a you know a clear

121
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:51,039
seltzer with industrialized ingredients

122
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,919
in it this is an offshoot of my own

123
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,759
mixology of my bartending experience

124
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:58,240
where i would create drinks for

125
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,639
customers or guests who would come to

126
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,199
want to get you know drunk by me

127
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,918
so uh you know this this doesn't have

128
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:09,840
any alcohol in it it we've took a route

129
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:11,758
of uh terpene forward as opposed to

130
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:13,599
making drinks that only say they have

131
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,600
cannabis on the label but you don't have

132
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,520
any idea what's in there i could name a

133
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,520
dozen of them that don't taste anything

134
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:21,439
like cannabis although they say they

135
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,198
have cannabis in them

136
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:26,079
that's that wasn't my approach my

137
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,160
approach was to create a beverage that

138
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:30,959
smelled like cannabis tasted like

139
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,280
cannabis and tasted like the other

140
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:35,918
three amazing ingredients which are in

141
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:37,918
the drink it's a very simple process

142
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,439
it's a very simple drink and it's

143
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:42,639
something that you could recreate

144
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,600
quickly if you had to

145
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,240
okay

146
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,680
it sounds pretty impressive and what

147
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:52,199
what can we expect is it just going to

148
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,199
be in the u.s for now um

149
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:56,879
you know my my business partner was

150
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:59,359
saying something about mexico but what

151
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:59,360
do i know

152
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:03,359
i'm sure it will be to mark herself into

153
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,000
as many territories as you can get

154
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,919
yourself into the next you know

155
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,319
as i said i'm i'm not a young man

156
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:12,000
although i'm young at heart so i'd like

157
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,000
to be able to move forward in this

158
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
pretty quickly because i'm in the point

159
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,959
of my life where i'd like to spend more

160
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,918
time promoting rather than selling

161
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:23,758
yeah i understand completely well maybe

162
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:26,159
something that you can help me uh

163
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,319
promote is what the future cannabis

164
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,240
cocktails and social spaces will look

165
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,800
like we've seen a couple of consumption

166
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,280
lounges open up in south uh or south san

167
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,680
francisco and it you'd be a bit of a

168
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:39,679
fool not to think that one's time let's

169
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,079
say in new york once legalization fully

171
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:46,879
money in space is being created that

172
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,199
serves nothing but cannabis that has

173
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:51,199
music associated with the cannabis

174
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,840
industry food associated with the

175
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,319
cannabis industry and the specific

176
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:58,879
genetics and the specific drinks will be

177
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,360
of high premium content out of high

178
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,959
value is that the way you see it going

179
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,639
oh my gosh i would love to see that i

180
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:06,799
mean i've been to amsterdam a dozen

181
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,319
times and enjoyed everything that there

182
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,400
has to do there

183
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,680
uh so i didn't go to amsterdam just for

184
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:14,638
the museums um and i would love to see

185
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,959
that

186
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,840
that image of the coffee shop played

187
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:21,519
back

188
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:23,119
in the united states unfortunately

189
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:26,000
you know we have a lot of stigmas in

190
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,000
place i live in new jersey uh you know

191
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,560
cannabis may be quote unquote legal but

192
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,079
you can't buy it you can't sell it you

193
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,918
can't have it there are many uh counties

194
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:38,079
in the state which are doing something

195
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:39,519
that they call home rule where you know

196
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:40,399
they don't want weed they don't want

197
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,719
weed

198
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:45,279
it's they're they're stigmatizing it and

199
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,160
keeping the stigma so when i my own

200
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:50,159
company is located in california

201
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,759
i you know i like spending time there

202
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,080
because i don't have to look over my

203
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,319
shoulder quite so much

204
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:58,000
yeah okay tell me this on a personal

205
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,560
little note what's your favorite state

206
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,959
to smoke and consume cannabis and who's

207
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,680
got the best plays in america oh

208
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:06,478
it's

209
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,639
that's i hope i don't antagonize anyone

210
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,719
by saying this but

211
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,918
for me uh

212
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,919
my very favorite is oregon

213
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:18,318
i'm not quite sure what it is but it

214
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:21,439
reminds me the most of maine and when i

215
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:24,160
lived in maine back in the 1980s it you

216
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:26,079
know cannabis was still illegal there

217
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,240
everyone had it no one could buy it it

218
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:30,478
was the same kind of thing but uh so i

219
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,959
when i go to oregon i feel like i'm in

220
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:34,240
maine without the stigmas

221
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,000
yeah well that's we've had a couple of

222
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,080
people actually say oregon and a good

223
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,958
friend of the show jeremy plum from

proof cultivars is based out in oregon

225

226
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:47,359

to do some hand selling and uh you know

245
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,000
little events that here and there where

246
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:34,159
they pop up

247
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
basically just focusing on getting the

248
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:38,559
uh the product out in the beverage out

249
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,120
there for for customers and for guests

250
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:43,199
and uh and getting it in their hands and

251
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,120
letting them taste something that's as i

252
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,000
said it's not a seltzer and it's made

253
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,399
with real ingredients and it's delicious

254
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,480
it's sophisticated and delicious and not

255
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,759
sweet

256
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,920
sophisticated and delicious sound like

257
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:58,240
two of my favorite words my friend can

258
00:09:55,919 --> 00:10:00,719
you tell me this what type of milligram

259
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,879
dosage is it or is that important when

260
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,639
it comes to a drink like this what's the

261
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,320
the length and duration of the bulls

262
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:08,399
that you make at us

263
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,560
it's a good question um we're using 10

264
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:16,320
milligrams of terpene forward emulsified

265
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:17,599
nanotechnology thc from vertoza

266
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,000
it has a

267
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,639
you know the last i took i enjoyed a

268
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,679
little can of it i drank the half of the

269
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:27,600
can

270
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:30,559
um it has about a five minute onset

271
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,560
so it's very quick and it's we're using

272
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:35,679
a specific strain

273
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:39,439
which is called hippie crasher

274
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:41,679
and it is a indica dominant

275
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,279
uh hybrid

276
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:47,519
so it has a it has nice talkative nature

277
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:50,240
into relaxation and eventually at the

278
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,240
end of the night good sleep

279
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,399
it sounds like absolutely

280
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,839
a dream for me i look forward to next

281
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,360
time i'm over in california i'll be

00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,800
