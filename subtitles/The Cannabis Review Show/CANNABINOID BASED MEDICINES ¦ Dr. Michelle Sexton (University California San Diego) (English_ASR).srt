2
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:11,599
welcome everybody to the next episode of

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,480
the Cannabis review I'm delighted join

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,759
to this episode by Dr Michelle sexon how

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,000
you keeping today

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:21,160
Michelle I'm well and how are you doing

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,599
I'm fantastic thank you very much you're

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,480
a naturopathic doctor can you maybe

9
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:28,039
explain everybody your current position

10
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,960
in the industry and uh how long you've

11
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:30,800
been in the

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,840
sector

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,480
well I'm a naturopathic doctor which

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,600
means that my training was really

15
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:43,519
focused on the world of complimentary

16
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:46,320
alternative integrative and traditional

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,320
medicines like Botanical medicine and

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,079
we're fully trained in medicine but our

19
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:56,198
our primary therapies are centered

20
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:59,600
around natural products and um you know

21
00:00:56,198 --> 00:01:01,599
building Health up uh from the ground up

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,280
address addressing root causes rather

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,320
than just trying to treat symptoms and I

24
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:10,879
got involved in cannaboid research when

25
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:14,000
I was in medical school back in 2005 I

26
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:16,879
did a post-doctoral fellowship in the

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,599
pharmacology of canabo at the University

28
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:21,078
of

29
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:24,399
Washington uh and I'm now currently at

30
00:01:21,078 --> 00:01:27,719
the University of California San Diego

31
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:31,040
where I'm involved in uh one of the

32
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:32,560
first cannabis clinics at a major

33
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,960
academic

34
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,280
institution so I see patients there and

35
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:41,199
give advice and counseling around the

36
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,680
use of cannabis as

37
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,040
medicine you've gotten a very extensive

38
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,640
track record I I recorded 18 different

39
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:51,240
papers published in peerreview

40
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,759
journals um was it a conscious decision

41
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:55,280
that when you decided to focus on

42
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:56,959
cannaboids for Medical Treatments was

43
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,640
there an inflection point that convinced

44
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:01,718
you to go in that

45
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:05,118
direction uh actually no it was very

46
00:02:01,718 --> 00:02:08,000
serendipitous uh I did not set out to

47
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:09,159
focus on cannabis or cannabinoids I was

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,759
doing some

49
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:15,079
research uh in the role of a protein

50
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:17,479
receptor in

51
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:20,519
neuroinflammation uh especially around

52
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:23,799
brain tumors and so when I got to

53
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:26,719
Seattle Washington for my ND degree I

54
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:29,040
wanted to continue researching and I got

55
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:31,759
in contact with Dr nephie Stella at the

56
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:34,719
University of Washington and this was

57
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:37,479
really more around uh the activation of

58
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:40,199
microa cells which are immune cells

59
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:42,959
resident to the brain and I didn't even

60
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:46,199
know that he was studying uh

61
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,560
cannabinoids and so I I fell into his

62
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:50,959
lab and doing some work there and that

63
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,280
was really how it all came about was

64
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:57,439
sort of from the science piece and not

65
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:00,519
you know from personal experience or uh

66
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:02,199
through the industry directly

67
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:04,560
very interesting the first topic I

68
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:07,199
wanted to talk about was cannaboid based

69
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,959
medicines can you maybe give everybody

70
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:12,598
the the most up-to-date overview on what

71
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:14,199
are the furthest most advanced medicines

72
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:17,238
that are using cannaboids as key

73
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:18,598
molecule ingredients what's the timeline

74
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:20,799
do you think that you're going to see

75
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:23,280
before one of these comes to Market and

76
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:26,319
actually is a dominant

77
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,158
player well I mean when we talk about

78
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:32,798
canabo uh you know there are plant-based

79
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:35,840
canabo and then we have many many uh

80
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,879
synthetic compounds different classes of

81
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,438
compounds we know that these different

82
00:03:37,878 --> 00:03:43,359
classes of compounds can act

83
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:45,560
pharmacologically in different ways and

84
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,680
I think in the pharmaceutical industry a

85
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,959
real interest is in

86
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:54,280
um CB2

87
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:57,438
receptor uh CB1 receptor Agonist that

88
00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:00,479
don't cross over into the brain and also

89
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:03,560
targeting the endoc canabo system by

90
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:07,119
inhibiting the uh degradation or the

91
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:09,959
hydrolysis of our endoc canabo so it's

92
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:13,400
very interesting that after about 30

93
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:16,639
Years or or longer I think it's we're

94
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:19,358
approaching 50 years of formal research

95
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:23,000
of the endoc canabo system there's

96
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:27,240
really not uh still any drug on the

97
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,839
market other than THC or combination of

98
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,800
THC and CBD that have been actually

99
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:35,399
approved as

100
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,600
medicines is there a big opportunity

101
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:39,719
then in the creation of these

102
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,520
formulations whether you're picking a

103
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,520
Pharma generic where the patent does run

104
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:46,198
out and you're adding cannaboids to

105
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:47,879
enhance the efficacy of that or is it h

106
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:50,120
potentially a biotech company who can

107
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:51,918
make their own Entourage effect from a

108
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,720
multitude of turbines flavonoids and

109
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:56,120
cannaboids and turn that into a

110
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,240
formulation that's got patent uh

111
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,240
protection around it which of those two

112
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,960
Avenues is the most ad advantageous do

113
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,280
you think or they both running in

114
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:08,319
parallel with each

115
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:10,478
other well yeah patent medicine you know

116
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:14,120
is kind of interesting it can be hard to

117
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:17,319
get um patents around you know

118
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:19,720
formulations um but you know because

119
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:22,839
these are natural products you can't

120
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:25,479
patent you know an individual natural

121
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:29,079
product um so I think that the you know

122
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:32,918
the industry is really way ahead of our

123
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:34,879
you know formal scientific research into

124
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:37,519
all of these different combinations you

125
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:39,639
know we have a lot more information from

126
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:42,639
people in the real world just using all

127
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:45,360
of these because when we go to try to

128
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:48,079
actually study formulations there are

129
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:52,240
not that many available uh as a

130
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:56,120
researcher to study so I think you know

131
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:58,519
until it becomes easy to study different

132
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,879
formulations the industry is going to be

133
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:04,519
really far ahead of the science in

134
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:08,120
trying to figure these things out so I

135
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:11,279
mean I'm a I'm a natural medicine doctor

136
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:14,439
I was an herbalist even before that you

137
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:18,559
know so plant medicine for me is the

138
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:20,279
whole plant and so that's my preference

139
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,360
you know rather than I I think there's a

140
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:25,318
role for single molecules you know

141
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,598
because we have a lot of very difficult

142
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:30,240
to treat diseases on the planet today we

143
00:06:27,598 --> 00:06:32,560
live in a complex environment

144
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,360
um so I think we need powerful medicines

145
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,079
but I think that we also need plant

146
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,879
medicines for their role in building our

147
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:42,918
health up and this is where you know

148
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:45,759
cannabis can play a role in toning our

149
00:06:42,918 --> 00:06:48,758
endocannabinoid system uh if we're doing

150
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,879
that wisely with uh you know

151
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:53,759
understanding the dosing particularly of

152
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:57,079
THC the most potent

153
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:59,598
molecule very interesting next question

154
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:01,519
is how does somebody fine tune their

155
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:02,918
endocannabinoid system what are a couple

156
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:04,598
of tips that you'd give for people who

157
00:07:02,918 --> 00:07:07,839
are watching or listening to

158
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:11,598
this well the endocannabinoid system is

159
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:14,679
a system designed to ensure our

160
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:18,279
survival and unfortunately in today's

161
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,840
very stressful world you know we

162
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:23,119
sometimes we're really fighting for

163
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:26,198
survival even on our physiologic level

164
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,639
and the one of the primary impacts

165
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:30,639
negatively impacting our endoc canabo

166
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:34,160
system is

167
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,280
previous trauma generational trauma

168
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,599
chronic

169
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:40,918
stress and you know there's hardly

170
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:43,240
anybody that escapes those and so how

171
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:47,240
that impacts our

172
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:52,360
biology uh also impacts our endoc canabo

173
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:54,400
system so number one for toning our

174
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:58,319
endoc canabo system is learning

175
00:07:54,399 --> 00:08:00,878
something called stress resilience so

176
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,280
often you know know if we have been

177
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,039
beaten down by a lot of stress in our

178
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:09,519
life we sort of have to relearn how to

179
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:13,478
cope we honestly have to reprogram our

180
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:16,000
brains and this takes a lot of work and

181
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:19,918
in this process we are toning the endoc

182
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,800
canabo system there are many plant-based

183
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:25,878
compounds that can also tone the system

184
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:29,319
I think uh on one of your previous

185
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:30,680
episodes uh beta carene which is a

186
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:33,759
common uh

187
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:38,080
sesquiterpenoid found in different foods

188
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:43,759
so these these compounds in low

189
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:46,440
abundance serve to uh you know build up

190
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:50,759
the expression of receptors in our body

191
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:53,399
I I think this is a primary human plant

192
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:55,759
interaction uh and and relationship that

193
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:58,759
we have with plants that these are not

194
00:08:55,759 --> 00:09:00,919
compounds that are in a dose that's

195
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:04,039
necessary neily going to be therapeutic

196
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:06,879
for something but in plants and the way

197
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:10,278
with that we consume them their role is

198
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:12,240
to Simply tone systems so if you can

199
00:09:10,278 --> 00:09:15,519
think about this like with peppers and

200
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:18,560
the compound capin which hits our trip

201
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:22,200
V1 receptor that's the you know feeling

202
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:25,479
the Heat or The Spice from pepper so at

203
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:28,079
even having you know low level of spice

204
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:31,519
you're toning that trip V1 receptor to

205
00:09:28,078 --> 00:09:36,439
continue to be expressed so I I see the

206
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:39,159
same function with using low dose of THC

207
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:42,040
to help build the receptor expression

208
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:45,480
and so this can be really necessary in

209
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:48,319
people that have been uh exposed to

210
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:51,959
Childhood traumas other trauma in

211
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:55,120
adulthood and chronic stress including

212
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:57,199
PTSD wow very interesting indeed the

213
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,320
next topic I wanted to talk about you've

214
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,519
got a lot of expertise is kind of noise

215
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:04,440
and neuropathic pain our Irish medical

216
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:06,720
dep Department came out after a

217
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,000
multi-year study on on medical cannabis

218
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,480
and one of the things they said it's

219
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
it's Crystal Clear cannaboids do work

220
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,320
for neuropathic pain what has been your

221
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,120
experiments or experience in the

222
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:21,800
research in this H sector so

223
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,639
far well I mainly have Clinical Research

224
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:26,039
in this experience or clinical

225
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:30,039
experience working with chronic pain

226
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:32,480
patients over the last 10 years or close

227
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:34,759
to 10 years at UCSD where I became

228
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:38,680
formerly involved with uh the pain

229
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:42,039
division at UCSD and so we were actively

230
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:45,439
using cannabis to help people exit

231
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:48,319
opioids and many of these patients are

232
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:51,480
chronic neuropathic pain sufferers so a

233
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,720
neuropathic pain is specific to like

234
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:57,200
nerve damage which can be different from

235
00:10:53,720 --> 00:11:01,000
other tissue damage or other causes of

236
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:05,519
pain and this is where the evidence is

237
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:09,039
really strong for THC binding at the CB1

238
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:11,919
receptor and so there's several

239
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:15,679
mechanisms throughout the body by which

240
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:19,958
THC can very much turn down the volume

241
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:23,000
on neuropathic pain and in my experience

242
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:25,359
uh CBD is not effective for neuropathic

243
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,399
pain I know that there's been some good

244
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:31,480
animal data um but having worked with

245
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:34,759
probably over a thousand chronic pain

246
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:37,680
patients who often arrive saying they've

247
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:40,360
already tried CBD and then when we move

248
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:44,599
them over to like a onetoone product of

249
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:47,759
THC CBD they get much more pain

250
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:50,278
benefit and I I honestly think too that

251
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:53,799
for neuropathic pain and and some

252
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:57,240
subtypes of that that actually inhaled

253
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:59,838
cannabinoid is is a much better delivery

254
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,000
more rapid getting uh a higher

255
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:05,800
concentration of the compound into the

256
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,519
brain and the tissue uh to provide

257
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:12,399
adequate benefit from neuropathic

258
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:16,039
pain what do you think is the perfect

259
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,919
Administration route for uh the dream

260
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:20,439
product is it is it injectable is it a

261
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:23,599
topical cream it is a soluble tablet is

262
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,600
it a solid

263
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:29,759
tablet well that's a great question I

264
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:32,000
mean I think that uh inhalation works

265
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:34,519
very very well you know I know that we

266
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,320
have challenges with our uh various

267
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:39,240
governmental

268
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:42,560
organizations um wanting to approve

269
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:45,480
inhaled cannabis you know as a medicine

270
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:49,078
uh we typically are using uh dry

271
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:52,440
vaporization of flour not concentrates

272
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:55,078
because of the the dose uh and that you

273
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:58,040
know we know that it's very bioavailable

274
00:12:55,078 --> 00:13:01,078
that way it's a very rapid onset which

275
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:03,559
can be beneficial for many patients um

276
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:06,879
so you know if some were someone were to

277
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:09,278
be able to demonstrate something oral

278
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:11,198
that could have that rapid of an onset

279
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:13,879
you know that could really benefit

280
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:17,120
patients um I'm often having patients

281
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:19,399
using a combination of inhalation for

282
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,360
that rapid effect followed by something

283
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:23,600
oral so they're not having to inhale

284
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,120
again in a couple of hours but getting

285
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:29,800
more extended relief and not having to

286
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:32,919
wait on the onset that usually can take

287
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:35,879
anywhere from one to three hours uh for

288
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:38,599
patients to reach their uh T-Max in the

289
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:41,399
bloodstream from ingested

290
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,720
canabo yeah now I want to move on to

291
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:45,519
your book that has been released can you

292
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:48,480
maybe tell everybody reasons behind

293
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:52,198
writing the book and the target

294
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:55,800
audience yeah so my book is uh titled

295
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:58,399
eat sleep relax protect forget an endoc

296
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:59,559
canabo guide for systems wholeness for

297
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,000
women

298
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:06,758
so this just arose out of my um you know

299
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,839
experience starting around 2005 of of

300
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:11,600
studying this system and also because I

301
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:15,480
really started my healthc care career as

302
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,560
a midwife and an herbalist and so I just

303
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,440
think that there's some misconceptions

304
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:22,838
about cannabis especially around Women's

305
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:25,480
Health and I in the book I call these or

306
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:28,160
herban Legends and so I'm just trying to

307
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:31,199
clear some of those up and present some

308
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:34,519
factual information around um the

309
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:37,159
utility of cannaboid based medicines in

310
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:39,759
women's health as well as when to

311
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:39,759
exercise

312
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,360
caution it's been fantastic talking to

313
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:45,879
you Michelle and hopefully we get to

314
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,440
touch base again towards maybe the end

315
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:49,278
of this year and get an update on all

316
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,320
the research and development that you

317
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:52,559
guys are are taking part in but for now

318
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,000
thank you very much for taking your time

319
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:58,869
to do this thank you so much for

320
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:02,360
inviting me until next episode everybody
