1
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:04,979
foreign

2
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,939
policy analyst Steve Rhodes Steve is a

3
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,039
senior drug policy analyst that

4
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:26,339
transformed drug policy foundation in

5
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,380
the UK he's also an author of After the

6
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:30,480
War on Drugs a blueprint for regulation

7
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:32,399
has contributed to a number of

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,020
Publications on the subject so I'm

9
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,058
absolutely delighted to be able to talk

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,399
to you today Steve how are you keeping

11
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:40,558
pretty good thank you

12
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,878
excellent a lot of time I think we're

13
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:43,799
going to be able to bestow a lot of

14
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:45,718
information on the viewers that they may

15
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:47,279
not necessarily come across can you

16
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,200
maybe give everybody a little overview

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,780
of how you ended up as a senior policy

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,480
analyst and we uh the message of drugs

19
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,799
was uh so uh important a topic for you

20
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:57,779
to write about

21
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:59,939
well I actually kind of stumbled into

22
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,399
into drug policy

23
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:04,500
um about 20 years ago I was actually

24
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,939
working for Oxfam and that would have

25
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,859
been my kind of academic background and

26
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:10,019
policy background had been more in

27
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:11,219
development work but drug policy always

28
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:14,879
struck me as

29
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:15,840
um this strange area of of social policy

30
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,599
and

31
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,460
um policy thinking that seemed oddly

32
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:27,239
divorced from a lot the Norms of of of

33
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:29,579
of policy making and to the pragmatic

34
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:31,618
Public Health and Social Justice concept

35
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:34,259
which seemed to be sort of infusing a

36
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:37,319
lot of other policy but but with drugs

37
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:40,079
not even all drugs just certain drugs

38
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:42,658
um they seem to exist in this odd kind

39
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:45,899
of uh evidence-free ideological space

40
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:48,180
and the results of it uh of that

41
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:50,040
approach have been disastrous and

42
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,200
they're there for everybody to see and

43
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,479
looking at something like the misuse of

44
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,420
drugs act 1971

45
00:01:54,478 --> 00:02:00,060
in the UK which was obviously 50 years

46
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,399
old it was his 50th Anniversary last

47
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,259
year so half a century a year

48
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,420
um on almost any indicator that you

49
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:09,300
would choose it's been a you know

50
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,038
manifestly being a total disaster this

51
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,560
was a policy that was very specifically

52
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:15,059
supposed to eradicate drug markets and

53
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,239
deter drug use

54
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,699
but drug use has risen pretty much every

55
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,920
one of those 50 years overall

56
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:24,659
um and Drug markets have expanded

57
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:26,878
illegal drug markets controlled by

58
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:30,359
unregulated criminal entrepreneurs have

59
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:32,519
expanded to meet that growing demand

60
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,120
um despite increasing amounts of money

61
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,500
being put into increasingly punitive

62
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,819
enforcement efforts

63
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,919
um so it hasn't done what it was

64
00:02:38,818 --> 00:02:43,259
supposed to do but it's had this whole

65
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:44,939
raft of disastrous consequences in terms

66
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:47,159
of criminalizing hundreds of thousands

67
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:49,378
even millions of people one of the

68
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:51,120
calculations we did was that we looked

69
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:53,878
at all the evidence more than three

70
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,920
million uh criminal records have been

71
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:57,539
issued under this act since it was

72
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:59,759
enacted

73
00:02:57,539 --> 00:03:01,859
um so it's not it's it's a non-trivial

74
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:03,598
piece of legislation the people say they

75
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,739
talk about the war we never thought and

76
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:06,299
when are we going to start really

77
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:08,759
fighting the War on Drugs well three

78
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,860
million criminal records

79
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:13,139
um speaks to that I think

80
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,819
um you know almost a million years of uh

81
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:17,039
prison time has been given out under

82
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:19,039
this under this act so

83
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:22,019
it's it it's it's

84
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:24,479
profoundly punitive and profoundly

85
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:26,700
harmful but does not seem to have been

86
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:29,039
delivering any useful benefits at all

87
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:30,899
and it's also hugely expensive we spend

88
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,340
you know upwards of seven billion in the

89
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,760
UK

90
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,739
um a year uh enforcing uh the the

91
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:41,340
Mississippi drugs act and dealing with

92
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:43,140
its its Fallout and consequences so it

93
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,780
felt like a good moment to have a have a

94
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:47,878
you know a moment of reflection on the

95
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,919
50th Anniversary

96
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:51,298
um to look back at the failings of the

97
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,219
misuse of drug debts and the War on

98
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:54,900
Drugs more broadly

99
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:56,699
um and think about how we might move

100
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,158
forward in a more pragmatic and

101
00:03:56,699 --> 00:04:00,598
evidence-based reasonable way based on

102
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:02,639
public health principles and social

103
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:04,439
justice principles and human rights

104
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:07,139
principles kind of things we can all get

105
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:09,120
behind but that don't seem to have been

106
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:10,919
uh associated with drug policy

107
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,379
historically so that's a lot of the work

108
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:15,419
that Transformers been doing

109
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:17,699
um and yeah I mean my journey with

110
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:20,579
Transformers started very much kind of

111
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:22,919
at the activist sort of uh almost like

112
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:26,840
Street protest type stuff 20 years ago

113
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:30,418
but as the uh reform

114
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:32,939
uh movement has moved from the margins

115
00:04:30,418 --> 00:04:35,159
into the mainstream we've become a lot

116
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:37,079
more focused on detailed policy work so

117
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,880
for cannabis we've produced this book

118
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:41,279
called How to regulate cannabis a

119
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:43,439
practical guide I'm not trying to sell

120
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:45,779
this you can go and read it online a PDF

121
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:47,719
for free on the transfer website it's

122
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:50,638
been translated into multiple languages

123
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:53,820
it's informed policy making in Uruguay

124
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,918
and Canada and Mexico and a number of

125
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:57,300
European countries like to live in Malta

126
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:58,859
where we've also been working with

127
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,520
governments so we're no longer just

128
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:04,800
doing advocacy operating governments

129
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:06,959
about how awful their cannabis policy is

130
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,079
when they do make the decision to to

131
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:12,299
move we are actually working with uh

132
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,219
governments now as consultants helping

133
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,079
to design the detail of the policy which

134
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,600
has been very much a focus it transforms

135
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:22,680
work and the misuse of drugs Act is it's

136
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:25,320
almost totemic of the failings uh of

137
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:28,439
drug policy and cannabis policy given

138
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:31,860
just the appalling outcomes despite 50

139
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:34,079
years of just doing the same thing and

140
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,000
you know not getting anywhere so that's

141
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,279
kind of where we're up to

142
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,538
um at the moment

143
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:41,638
amazing but the first topic I wanted to

144
00:05:39,538 --> 00:05:44,699
talk about was the misuse of drugs act

145
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:46,620
now or in Ireland it's the 1977 act but

146
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:48,300
in the UK it's the 1971 act where we now

147
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,759
know that the Irish copied the exact

148
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:53,879
pretty much template that the UK had

149
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:56,100
developed from a very starting point

150
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:58,620
you've already mentioned that it's more

151
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:01,139
ideological and research free that this

152
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,939
was uh created around is there an

153
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:05,699
element that's a little bit like America

154
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:08,279
with ainsler where there was businessmen

155
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:10,319
that had specific interests in

156
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:11,939
Industries or is this basically just

157
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,399
they were too stupid for their own good

158
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:15,779
at the time and didn't foresee what baby

159
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:19,019
going around the corner was a little bit

160
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:21,179
of uh influence from from capitalism

161
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:24,299
side of things or was it basically just

162
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:27,418
a misinformed politicians who uh who who

163
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:30,300
drew up this legislation

164
00:06:27,418 --> 00:06:32,879
um I don't think it was it was a it

165
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,259
shaped by industry particularly at the

166
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:36,360
time I mean they may have had some

167
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:37,620
influence it was more shaped by what was

168
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,300
going on

169
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:42,478
um around the world so you know American

170
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:44,579
policy thinking was key

171
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:46,918
um significantly that the UN drug

172
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:50,758
control treaties

173
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:53,818
um that were sort of uh the the main one

174
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:55,199
being the 1961 uh single convention on

175
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:57,660
drugs

176
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,060
um significantly informed the design of

177
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:02,400
our misuse of drugs act I misuse of

178
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:05,339
drugs Act was essentially a domestic

179
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,839
response to the UN conventions on drugs

180
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:09,839
and they were very much shaped by

181
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:11,879
American narratives and driven by by U.S

182
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:13,198
political pressures so all those all

183
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:14,759
those

184
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,740
um disconcerting and uncomfortable

185
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:18,840
things that happen in the US around the

186
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,939
kind of thinking on punitive drug policy

187
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:23,879
issues around race and issues around

188
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:25,500
kind of corruption and and some of those

189
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:28,978
unpleasant political pressures that

190
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,839
shape U.S drug policy then fed into un

191
00:07:28,978 --> 00:07:32,818
drug policy and then fed out into

192
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:34,978
countries around the world

193
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:36,960
um and in because of the UK's position

194
00:07:34,978 --> 00:07:38,459
for whatever reason

195
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,019
um like you say the misuse of drugs act

196
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:43,859
informed what's happened in Ireland

197
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:45,299
similarly a lot of drug policy

198
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,038
um in a number of countries has been

199
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,660
shaped by the misuse of drugs act so

200
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:51,360
like in New Zealand their misuse of

201
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:53,340
drugs Act is very similar to our one and

202
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,199
it the same is true in a number of other

203
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:58,258
countries so you've seen this kind of

204
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,819
iterative repetition of mistakes of the

205
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:01,259
past

206
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:02,879
um and you know people make mistakes

207
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:04,560
sometimes they're they're well they're

208
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,598
well intentioned but misinformed

209
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,538
sometimes they're corrupt but the

210
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:11,579
problem is if you go on for decades and

211
00:08:09,538 --> 00:08:13,800
decades and the outcomes are all

212
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:16,198
appalling you know not just failure on

213
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,660
their own terms but clear evidence of

214
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:20,300
systemic harms stemming from this

215
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,400
legislation and this whole kind of

216
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:25,860
ideological policy Paradigm and then you

217
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:29,038
still don't evolve and change and you

218
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:31,199
know try and reconsider and reflect on

219
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:33,418
what's got wrong and you know move

220
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,038
forward on that basis that is really

221
00:08:33,418 --> 00:08:37,319
where the problem is you know we can we

222
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:40,199
can critique the war the the misuse of

223
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,899
drugs at 1971 and it certainly it

224
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,879
deserves a critique but just as bad it

225
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:46,980
really is the politicians who failed to

226
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:49,379
do that for Generations now more than

227
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:51,240
half a century it's clearly been a

228
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:53,039
failure looking at Rising drug use

229
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,500
looking at Rising drug deaths looking at

230
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:57,719
the toll of criminalization and the cost

231
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,100
that we the amount of money we've hosted

232
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,680
doesn't work

233
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:04,259
but yet here we are we're still stuck

234
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:05,819
with it 50 years later despite that

235
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:09,120
horrible failings and I think that is

236
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:12,120
the the most you know the most shocking

237
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,039
part of the of this generally

238
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,440
um disastrous piece of public policy

239
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:19,679
making this awful story

240
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,940
okay so tell me this next topic is if

241
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:22,979
we're going for a blueprint for

242
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,899
regulation if if we have politicians

243
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:28,980
watching this now what are the top three

244
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:31,799
steps that a government can use for uh

245
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:33,300
steps towards a regulated market

246
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:34,500
well I think the first thing they need

247
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:36,659
to do is to acknowledge that the current

248
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,458
policy isn't working and we need to have

249
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:40,500
a rethink and that needs to be more than

250
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:44,219
just tweaking the failings of

251
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,659
prohibition it really needs to be uh a

252
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:48,240
more fundamental rethink acknowledging

253
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:50,519
that prohibition per se is not an

254
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,139
effective policy Paradigm dealing with

255
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:54,000
the reality of drug use dealing with the

256
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:55,980
reality of cannabis use and saying look

257
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,320
this Market is going to be here

258
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:01,740
whether we like it or not whether we

259
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:04,800
approve or morally morally condone uh

260
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:06,600
cannabis use or drug use and we need to

261
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:09,299
deal with that reality in a pragmatic

262
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,940
way and you know inevitably that leads

263
00:10:09,299 --> 00:10:15,000
you to say look if it's the choice

264
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:17,399
between you know criminal markets or or

265
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,799
responsibly regulated markets within the

266
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:21,659
Ambit of the state we have to go towards

267
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:23,579
that so I think the first thing to do is

268
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:25,019
to acknowledge that this this is a

269
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:27,379
debate that needs to happen and then you

270
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:30,000
can move on to some of the detail about

271
00:10:27,379 --> 00:10:32,100
what a regulatory framework would look

272
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,320
like what are the overarching principles

273
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:36,300
who needs to be at the table in terms of

274
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,560
Designing the policy and then you get

275
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:39,299
into the detail you know how do you

276
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:40,739
regulate production how do you regulate

277
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:43,079
the products themselves how do you

278
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,700
regulate the vendors and retailers how

279
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,940
do you regulate access to this Market

280
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,500
you know what are your channels of

281
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:51,060
accountability those are all questions

282
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,458
that Transformers have gone into you

283
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:54,838
know enormous amounts of detail with in

284
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:56,518
our book

285
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:58,200
um I think we need to be first and

286
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:59,519
foremost Guided by public health and

287
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,420
issues of Human Rights and social

288
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,620
justice I think we need to keep

289
00:11:02,419 --> 00:11:07,199
Financial interests and corporate

290
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,459
interests at arm's length we don't want

291
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,519
to repeat the mistakes that have been

292
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:14,039
made with alkaline tobacco

293
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:15,959
historically and

294
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:17,578
we we need to be open-minded and say

295
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:19,979
look we need to follow the evidence and

296
00:11:17,578 --> 00:11:21,599
if things work then we carry on with

297
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,700
them if they don't work we need to have

298
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,980
the flexibility encouraged to set to

299
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:29,160
acknowledge failures and take a step

300
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:30,959
back or to to be able to evolve

301
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:33,179
um really we just need to be thinking

302
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:35,518
about cannabis policy in the same way we

303
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:38,819
do pragmatically think about any other

304
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:41,519
area of Public Health or human rights

305
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:43,680
and social justice unfortunately that is

306
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,419
not what's happened historically we just

307
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:48,838
need to do what we do with everything

308
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:51,919
else and bring it back into the the

309
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:54,660
realm of intelligent pragmatic

310
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:57,659
principled evidence-based policy making

311
00:11:54,659 --> 00:11:59,578
where unfortunately it has not very much

312
00:11:57,659 --> 00:12:02,338
not been

313
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:06,319
um over the past five five decades and

314
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:09,360
arguably uh even further back than that

315
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,740
incredibly well informed material it's a

316
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,180
it's a wealth of information about the

317
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:14,159
viewers are going to be living Last

318
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:16,379
Thing Before I Let You Go the new UK

319
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:18,719
government we had a recent story on Lids

320
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:21,659
trust block and bermuda's regulation

321
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,339
attempts is she a friend or a foe to the

322
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:25,519
Cannabis industry now that she's in

323
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:25,519
power

324
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,360
history I mean

325
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:34,860
our current government will you know

326
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:37,860
Herald the Golden Age of pragmatic uh

327
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:39,778
drug policy reform uh suela Bravo and

328
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:42,659
the new Home Secretary is perhaps even

329
00:12:39,778 --> 00:12:44,759
worse than pretty Patel and it was a

330
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:46,500
pretty low bar because she was pretty

331
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:50,100
awful

332
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:55,440
um it seems like they are driven by

333
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:58,019
ideology or other interests political uh

334
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,779
priorities rather than public health

335
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:03,299
science and and basic principle that

336
00:13:00,778 --> 00:13:05,639
there seems to be a dramatic reluctance

337
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:07,679
to engage with

338
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:10,159
um the debate on pragmatic drug policy

339
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:12,958
reform to sort of reject

340
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:14,278
uh any of the critique of the misuse of

341
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,338
drugs act or the whole prohibitious

342
00:13:14,278 --> 00:13:19,439
Paradigm there's been some progress in

343
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:21,420
terms of uh treatment and service

344
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,339
provision for people with drug problems

345
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:25,979
and I think we can welcome that from the

346
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:27,060
drug strategy but on the supply side or

347
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,399
in challenging some of the more

348
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:33,179
fundamental problems of prohibition let

349
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:35,399
alone exploring uh options for legally

350
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:37,859
regulated markets we haven't seen any

351
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:39,000
movement on that at all despite all the

352
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,379
changes that are happening around the

353
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,500
world and we're now looking at four or

354
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:46,019
five EU countries who are moving rapidly

355
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:48,659
towards legally regulated

356
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:49,860
cannabis markets and transform we are

357
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:52,439
working with a number of those countries

358
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:54,539
helping to design and shape uh that

359
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,100
policy but we don't get the call from

360
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:58,980
this government and they don't seem

361
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:00,778
interested and no unfortunately does uh

362
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:03,539
our main opposition party even though

363
00:14:00,778 --> 00:14:05,458
the liberal Democrats and greens do have

364
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:06,778
more sensible policies so there is a

365
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:08,759
debate happening and you can see public

366
00:14:06,778 --> 00:14:10,320
opinion shifting

367
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:11,939
um and even media and informal opinion

368
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,980
is Shifting as well but the government

369
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:16,139
does not seem to be shifting and it's a

370
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:19,620
very very low priority I mean arguably

371
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:21,899
things like brexit and uh at covid have

372
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:23,519
absorbed an awful lot of oxygen but

373
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:25,980
um drug policy let alone drug policy

374
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,480
reform seems to be much more caught in a

375
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,940
kind of populist Law and Order debate

376
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,680
than anything representing uh you know

377
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:33,060
pragmatic Public Health policy Amendment

378
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,739
it's regrettable but that's where we are

379
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:35,778
I'm not expecting any change before the

380
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:39,360
election

381
00:14:35,778 --> 00:14:41,639
okay so you don't see any a a medical

382
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,839
cannabis Market in the UK growing and

383
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:45,839
growing do you think it's going to be

384
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:47,639
Europe that shows the way and uh it

385
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,380
becomes irrefutable for the government

386
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:51,240
to be turned down with the revenue that

387
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:53,578
can be generated through tax and jobs

388
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,139
created and social Equity programs where

389
00:14:53,578 --> 00:14:57,120
it could be showcased in the likes of

390
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:58,680
Germany

391
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,000
um I mean certainly medical cannabis I

392
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:01,500
mean we already have uh one of the

393
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,078
biggest medical cannabis Industries in

394
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:06,120
the world and unfortunately a lot of

395
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:07,439
people in the UK don't have access to

396
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,940
medical cannabis and that's that's

397
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,100
regrettable the medical cannabis has

398
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:13,920
nominally been legalized access to it is

399
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:15,600
nominally legal um but not really

400
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,639
through the NHS so you can only get

401
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,620
Medical Campus in the UK on private

402
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:21,240
prescriptions unless you're very very

403
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,980
fortunate

404
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:26,399
um the medical cannabis industry is is

405
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:27,420
doing fine thank you in in the UK

406
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,679
um the government doesn't particularly

407
00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:31,259
want to talk about it but in many ways

408
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:32,698
it's a commercial success story

409
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:34,319
um but the medical cannabis injury is

410
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:35,519
very different from the non-medical

411
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,680
Cannabis industry and I think it's

412
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,259
important to separate out both those

413
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:41,939
Industries and more importantly that the

414
00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:43,740
relevant policy questions around them

415
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:45,540
because they're just not the same you

416
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,339
know we have a medical heroin industry

417
00:15:45,539 --> 00:15:49,198
we have a medical ketamine amphetamine

418
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:51,300
and cocaine industry there are lots of

419
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:53,219
legal drug industries that have little

420
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:55,379
or no bearing on issues around

421
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:57,060
recreational Supply and prohibition for

422
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:58,559
recreational use so I think it's

423
00:15:57,059 --> 00:16:00,299
important when we talk about these

424
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:02,219
things to be able to separate out those

425
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:04,559
two policy debates and progress on

426
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:07,019
medical cannabis in no way reflects

427
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:10,018
progress unfortunately in the UK on on

428
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:13,740
non-medical adult use or move toward

429
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:15,179
legalization in that uh area so we have

430
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,759
had some programs made with cannabis but

431
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:19,379
unfortunately not at all on uh

432
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,559
recreational adult use cannabis in the

433
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:21,559
UK

434
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:29,399
