[Music]

2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,399
approach this from a such a different

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,679
perspectives colored by our guests our

4
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:22,320

we'll try to tie this together now this

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,839
is a summit when I think of a summit

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,820
that means that people are supposed to

8
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:31,859
ask questions people are supposed to

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,960
walk away with some of the things that

10
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,359
are in their head at the end of this day

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,100
answered so please don't hesitate to

12

raise your hand if you have a question

13
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,840
of a particular topic let's try to

14
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:44,340
integrate those questions as we move

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,920
along

16
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:50,039
uh my name is Bob Hobart I'm an attorney

Denver Colorado I lead the Cannabis

19
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:57,539
Industry Group for an international law

20

25
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,680
um really happy to be in Ireland talking

26
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:13,739
about something that's new or hopefully

27
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,840
going to accelerate the conversation

28
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:17,879
because it's public policy that of

29
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,880
course is controversial but if done

30
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:23,459
correctly it can be a change that

31
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,859
actually benefits society that benefits

32
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:28,079
and perhaps provides cover for

33
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:30,000
politicians and and bureaucrats and the

34
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:32,158

reviewing all these matters since 2016

57
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:33,419
when in Mexico the regulations start

58
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:36,599
so the well the last year I had the

59
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:40,199
opportunity to join this beautiful

60
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:42,539
project uh that we are going to create

61
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:45,000
the first Camp living community in

62
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:47,818
Memphis and the only reason why I

63
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,180
quinned my my nice firm in Mexico City

64
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:54,238
and I moved to live near the sea is

65
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,819
because in this project we're a three

66
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:00,060
important things number one we're

67
00:02:56,818 --> 00:03:02,818
educating each time we we talk about the

68
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:05,219
project people if they buy you or not

69
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:07,799
they finally think it go with your

70
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:11,400
information number two we're showing the

71
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:14,239
government a legal business in hand in

72
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:17,519
Mexico we're going to import right now

73
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:21,180
materials and the third one and the

74
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:24,539
third one is that uh we are opening the

75
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:29,340
industry right and people may be friend

76
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:32,639
between him and Kennedy's uh for uh for

77
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:35,039
adult uses or medicine uses and in times

78
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:37,738
they don't understand that when we're

79
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,658
opening the industry for him we are also

80
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:43,200
opening the industry for all the family

81
00:03:39,658 --> 00:03:46,079
of Canada right Canada is a word that

82
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:49,378
means is the name of the family of all

83
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,620
the plants and this is one of the things

84
00:03:49,378 --> 00:03:55,199
I want to discuss today guys about the

85
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:58,140
importance of the definitions in our

86
00:03:55,199 --> 00:04:01,139
regulations and in the law because in

87
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:04,079
Mexico the problem it is not that

88
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:06,779
cannabis it is not legal it is about the

89
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:11,219
definitions that are not clear so the

90
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:14,519
authorities have no tools for for

91
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:16,500
openness industry but this is the reason

92
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:19,139
why I click the firm and now I am

93
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,358
leading this project and uh well I'll be

94
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:24,180
very happy to see you around italuma and

95
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:27,299

there to show and also this is a a good

97
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:32,400
destination because it is a well-known

98
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:35,460
International destiny Asian so we're not

99
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:39,539
only going to educate and open these for

100

folks in the space Mike tell us a little

119
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,418
bit about more about yourself for for

120
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,699
your background involve into the campus

121
00:05:30,418 --> 00:05:34,560
safely yeah I was with you know one of

122
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:36,478
the big four accounting firms and

123
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,579
realized that cannabis was going to be

124
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:40,978
something that was going to go state by

125
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:43,560
state and so I've moved from Texas to

126
00:05:40,978 --> 00:05:46,319
California uh before it became legal

127
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:50,038
there are the props six to four uh in

128
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:52,439
2015 and then storyboarding about the

129
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:55,139
Cannabis industry eventually I wrote I

130
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:58,019
treat this as a book a research book on

131
00:05:55,139 --> 00:06:00,780
multi-state cannabis taxation for talks

132
00:05:58,019 --> 00:06:03,000
or borders and so I went doing each

133
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:05,279
state and how they tax this industry

134
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,478
whether you're a cultivator manufacturer

135
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:12,779
or distributor or retailer at each state

136
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:15,839
has their own rules their own tax system

137
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:18,659
you know to tax this industry it's very

138
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:20,698
confusing for for cannabis companies and

139
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:23,819
then most recently about two years ago

140
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:27,000
during covet I moved for California to

141
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:30,020
New Jersey as I saw this industry movie

142
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,939

143
00:06:30,019 --> 00:06:35,159

we're in a car together uh people are

152
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:53,519
driving on the wrong side of the road uh

153
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:57,060

158
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:08,038
frontier uh several years ago and began

159
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:10,199
Whitney economics he's regarded as one

160
00:07:08,038 --> 00:07:12,779
of the top economists in the entire

161
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:14,038

yeah sure so

168
00:07:23,098 --> 00:07:29,639
um it's nice to be here eventually

169
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:32,400
uh yeah I had I took a secure this route

170
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:35,460
5 into the account Australia really

171
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:37,439
nothing to do with it I was doing the

172
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:40,019
flight of Economics at Intel Corporation

173
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:42,959
and sizing up their supply chain and

174
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:44,159
doing Global Supply Chain work and I was

175
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:47,279
teaching economic setting University

176
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,919
when Oregon state of Oregon on the west

177
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:52,500
coast of the United States was just in

178
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:54,359
the on the cusp of legalizing on an

179
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,038
adult you site

180
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,840
um and so I started looking at the

181
00:07:56,038 --> 00:07:59,399
market one of my students was in that

182
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:01,679
industry already and I asked them how

183
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:04,198
big the industry was he said I don't

184
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,240
know you're the eponymous you tell me

185
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:09,000
um and so I took that challenge quite

186
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,879
literally and and started looking into

187
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,620
it realizing uh at what point that it

188
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:15,620
was just this huge market and

189
00:08:15,978 --> 00:08:21,478
was quickly picked up by a vertically

190
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,220
integrated company and they wanted me to

191
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:26,519
run their operations

192
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:29,340
so we eventually uh Mike from the doleus

193
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:31,378
or medical to adulties and then we were

194
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:33,439
the first company to go public on the

195
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:37,259
Canadian Securities of exchange

196
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:40,440
via with Bruce takeover at RTO

197
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:43,259
um and so we kind of paved the way for

198
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:46,380
um canvas uh you know public offerings

199
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:48,659
in Canada with U.S offices

200
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:51,120
um and with that being the chief

201
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:53,879
operations officer I got a a really good

202
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,459
perspective all facets of the canvas

203
00:08:53,879 --> 00:09:00,000
industry in front growing to processing

204
00:08:56,458 --> 00:09:02,099
and distribution retail and so then I

205
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,980
started using that and developing some

206
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:07,860
of my andromic theories and so I started

207
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:11,100
just trying to answer general questions

208
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:13,560
about business and the economics of

209
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,540
cannabis and so I started building the

210
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:17,518
foundation for others to use in the

211
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:19,980
economics Community there's had a lot of

212
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,379
folks in the space right now I'm not yet

213
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,720
and that there's a lot of interest that

214
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:26,458
not a lot of folks actually added for

215
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,560
anticipation Ken

216
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:29,879
um so with laid the foundation and you

217
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:32,159
know on

218
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:35,360
um you know consumer Behavior business

219
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:37,500
Behavior a labor a taxation uh

220
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,740
governments that influence on the market

221
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,059
like so try to build a body of work and

222
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:45,299
economics

223
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:48,778
and just uh focus in on that while other

224
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:52,019
people did good work in tax and in legal

225
00:09:48,778 --> 00:09:52,980
and other areas so that's the end of my

226
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:55,620
story

227
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:58,259
and when you talk to people about

228
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,639
numbers in the Cannabis industry there

229
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:01,259
tends to be a little bit with

230
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:03,958
exaggeration

231
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:05,879
because we all want to talk about how

232
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:08,579
exciting and how successful the industry

233
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:10,740
is in some ways that's true other days

234
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:12,000
that's not true but it's very critical

235
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,500
it's very important when you're trying

236
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,539
to make your taste whether that's to

237
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,458
support public policy whether your

238
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:19,019
company's raising money whether you're

239
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:21,359
out there in the marketplace looking for

240
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:23,100
partners it's very important to have

241
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,440
accurate information real information

242
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,580
and information that is based in reality

243
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,580
particularly when you're talking about

244
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:31,440
numbers over the next hour plus we're

245
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,778
going to talk about some of the market

246
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,519
numbers we're going to talk about the

247
00:10:33,778 --> 00:10:38,778
markets themselves we'll talk a little

248
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,778
bit about some of the regular

249
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:47,458
I just that perhaps Ireland can

250
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:49,078
participate it if not this entire region

251
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:51,179
in terms of what Commerce will look like

252
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:52,259
and as I mentioned please just read if

253
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:55,019
you have a question that we'll try to

254
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:58,860
work those in along the way uh okay

255
00:10:55,019 --> 00:11:01,440
comments at the outset uh here is indeed

256
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:03,659
a global cannabis industry no make no

257
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,940
mistake about it sometimes those of us

258
00:11:03,659 --> 00:11:08,278
that work in a particular country or in

259
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,959
the U.S a particular state region we

260
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:12,958
understand what's happening in our

261
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:14,939
region but everything is connect now you

262
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:17,759
say how can everything be connected when

263
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:21,720
particularly in the United States the

264
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:24,360
industry is illegal right marijuana and

265
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,459
by the way let me say this I'm going to

266
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,259
use the term marijuana to refer to the

267
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:30,838
marijuana side of the industry meaning

268
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:32,639
high THC products I'm going to use the

269
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:33,980
word hen corn and talk about not

270
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,778
intoxicating

271
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:39,480
compounds and Industrial uses

272
00:11:36,778 --> 00:11:41,759
um all of those things in my opinion

273
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,620
fall under what I call the Cannabis

274
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:45,179
industry so you might hear people talk

275
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,519
about the Catalyst industry they just

276
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:49,620
mean marijuana but the Cannabis industry

277
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,480
based on what I've seen and how I've

278
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:54,360
worked in the industry for 14 years now

279
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:56,339
really has two distinct sectors hemp and

280
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,200
marijuana and that's less pronounced

281
00:11:56,339 --> 00:12:00,060
when you travel in nationally because

282
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,040
they make less of a hard-line

283
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:05,458
distinction between the two but I wanted

284
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:07,319
to frame that for you so the and

285
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:09,899
abilities are not meant to be scientific

286
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:13,140
numbers but the global cannabis industry

287
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:15,480
is projected to be 75 billion dollars

288
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:17,879
within the next three to four years

289
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,579
those numbers could be higher or lower

290
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:23,759
depending on which uh projection sources

291
00:12:20,578 --> 00:12:26,338
you use but roughly roughly half of that

292
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:27,838
number comes from North America and then

293
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:29,700
the other half of that number is the

294
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,220
rest of the world and the Aggregate and

295
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,440
this is quite significant because even

296
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:36,839
when you think about participating in

297
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,240
this industry some venture capitalist

298
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,640
funds and Equity Funds they'll say well

299
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,740
the Cannabis industry is very small I'm

300
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:45,419
not going to pay attention to it yet and

301
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,759
that's true when you compare it to some

302
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:49,500
other things but it's not a small

303
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:52,679
industry not by any stretch of the

304
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:55,019
imagination and it is indeed global

305
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:56,879
so what is the Cannabis industry the

306
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:58,078
Cannabis industry evolves as I mentioned

307
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:00,659
hemp

308
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:03,419
it involves marijuana it involves the

309
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:06,838
technologies that overlay those sectors

310
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:09,479
it's International it's domestic we're

311
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:12,000
talking about industrial uses we're

312
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:15,539
talking about pharmaceutical uses we're

313
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:20,220
talking about consumer uses for wellness

314
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:22,199
and for other non-intoxic properties of

315
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,778
the plant and you're talking about in

316
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:27,300
many jurisdictions recreational or adult

317
00:13:24,778 --> 00:13:30,360
use the polite way perhaps to talk about

318
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:32,578
using cannabis without regulation and I

319
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:35,700
believe there are four distinct public

320
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:37,859
policy lays that already exist when

321
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:40,560
you're talking about cannabis the first

322
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:42,120
is industrial uses it kind of speaks for

323
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:44,638
itself when I talked about industrial

324
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:49,200
uses you can imagine what I mean fighter

325
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:51,419
writer plastic fuel building materials

326
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,879
so forth and so on these are historical

327
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:55,799
uses and by the way I'll know in the

328
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:58,559
1930s

329
00:13:55,799 --> 00:14:00,719
there was a magazine article in a

330
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:03,778
magazine called Popular Mechanics that

331
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:07,200
magazine projected hint

332
00:14:03,778 --> 00:14:10,559
to be the next billion fee billion

333
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:12,480
dollar industry in the 1930s they were

334
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:14,578
talking about hepting a billion dollar

335
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,159
industry and here we are many years

336
00:14:14,578 --> 00:14:19,439
later after public policy changes and

337
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:22,078
the light actually starting to see this

338
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:25,380
occur so that first of the four lanes is

339
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:28,078
the industrially the secondly when I

340
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:30,899
call over-the-counter marijuana this is

341
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:32,939
when you go buy a flower or it foil

342
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:35,578
distill it from that flower or an

343
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:37,380
infused product which is intended to

344
00:14:35,578 --> 00:14:40,019
produce a structure active effect it has

345
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:42,000
high THC they do our dispensary system

346
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:44,278
in the United States think of what

347
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,139
Germany's about to do think about what

348
00:14:44,278 --> 00:14:48,179
Czech Republic is about to do so forth

349
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:50,579
and so on I call it over-the-counter

350
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:53,159
marijuana because there's very little

351
00:14:50,578 --> 00:14:56,219
distinction between medical and adult

352
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:59,519
use in most markets except how it

353
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:01,860
qualifies the purchaser of that product

354
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,440
if I'm in an adult use Marketplace I

355
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:07,079
simply have to be 21 if I'm in a medical

356
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:09,839
Marketplace I simply have to have a

357
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:11,759
doctor validate that I have one of a

358
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,399
range of conditions it's a mere

359
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:17,220
qualifier for how he purchased the

360
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:20,039
product second of the four lanes the

361
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:21,720
other two the pharmaceutical rate this

362
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:24,059
is a different Lane than the

363
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,860
over-the-counter marijuana Lake and I

364
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:27,958
would question anyone that suggests that

365
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:30,000
over-the-counter marijuana is actually

366
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:32,278
medical marijuana not because there's

367
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,320
that efficacy there certainly is but

368
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:36,179
it's over-the-country marijuana a

369
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,240
pharmaceutical complex the medicinal

370
00:15:36,179 --> 00:15:42,778
complex they control this third plate it

371
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:44,519
requires approval by FDA and like bonds

372
00:15:42,778 --> 00:15:47,159
different jurisdictions around the world

373
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:50,039
for specific conditions we just saw it

374
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:52,799
they did the fourth Lane is what I call

375
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:56,458
Wellness or neutral thoughts think of

376
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:58,740
CBD think of protein from hip these are

377
00:15:56,458 --> 00:16:01,319
compounds of a cannabis plant that don't

378
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:04,079
produce a high that are regulated as

379
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:06,060
Foods or supplements in the marketplace

380
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:07,919
and that of course is evolving as well

381
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:09,239
particularly when you throw in the fact

382
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:11,099
that there are noble Foods here in

383
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,620
Europe

384
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:16,560
um ultimately I believe you have to have

385
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:18,120
a balanced public policy approach where

386
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,919
you legalize cannabis in any

387
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,720
jurisdiction what do I mean by balance

388
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:24,240
look at some of the Latin American

389
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,220
countries that initially came out of the

390
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,139
box look at Colombia look at Uruguay

391
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:30,480
they looked at tech support only

392
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:33,480
mountains we can't really have an

393
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,120
Economy based on an export only model in

394
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,860
a brand new industry it doesn't work so

395
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,259
you have to balance that with some

396
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:42,360
sembulence of a domestic industry as

397
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:44,519
well and that's what we're seeing begin

398
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,560
to evolve I think Colombia is a good

399
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:48,659
example of that where they started out

400
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:50,458
with X Court only and by the way they

401
00:16:48,659 --> 00:16:52,919
only allow the exportation boil

402
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:55,439
initially they changed that law

403
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:57,719
recognizing that the market dictated

404
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,620
that flowers needed to be exported as

405
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,139
well

406
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:04,078
and now they're embarking on a domestic

407
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:06,298
distribution of regulated system so for

408
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:08,519
for the for their country so my Buddhist

409
00:17:06,298 --> 00:17:10,679
with that balance I think you create the

410
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:12,959
most Economic Opportunity so those of

411
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:15,000
you that Lobby or work in public policy

412
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,339
please think of that because you can't

413
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,558
have a successful industry just

414
00:17:17,338 --> 00:17:20,879
participating on one side or the other

415
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:23,759
and then the last thing I'll say before

416
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,760
we dive into some of the numbers Bo is

417
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:28,500
um is the United Nations right let's

418
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:30,119
talk about the United States for just a

419
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,798
moment and it's an important thing when

420
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:33,899
you think about the U.N dimension on

421
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:36,240
narcotic drugs which effectively has

422
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:39,840
been in existence for dozens and dozens

423
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,819
of years now it classifies cannabis as a

424
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:43,558
highly restricted drug and all of its

425
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:45,599
membrane agents have had to enact very

426
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:46,859
strict control policies around cannabis

427
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:50,279
around marijuana

428
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:51,439
well that changed recent November of

429
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:54,960
2020

430
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:58,500
the committee of narcotic drugs adopted

431
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,779
a new recognition for medicinal cannabis

432
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,700
for the first thought they said this is

433
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:05,940
a fail that's different and should be

434
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:08,160
controlled differently than drug type

435
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:10,259
marijuana for example as they refer to

436
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,940
it another thing that happened by the

437
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:15,179
Indiana Nations at that same period of

438
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:17,700
time is they began to recognize that CBD

439
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:19,500
and non-intoxicating compounds like CBD

440
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:22,558
for the HEB

441
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:24,960
fall into the industrial exception found

442
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:27,240
under the U.N convention so why couldn't

443
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,038
his law and regulations color all of

444
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,900
this but it's entrepreneurs and markets

445
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:32,879
that drive it so Bo let's talk about

446
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,798
some of the numbers Market wise and and

447
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,480
think just however you'd like it to go

448
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:39,240
with this I think it would be good at

449
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,099
this up level said what is the uh what

450
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,900
is the global economy look like I threw

451
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:45,359
my number out there that I read and then

452
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:49,860
how does that in your mind uh break down

453
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:52,500
my range yeah sure so when you when

454
00:18:49,859 --> 00:18:55,139
forecasters try to predict what the

455
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:57,419
total demand is they've looked towards

456
00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:00,000
conception they look towards surveys

457
00:18:57,419 --> 00:19:02,340
that are being conducted by the U.N by

458
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,980
these various uh governmental agencies

459
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:07,019
help authorities and the like and

460
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:09,179
generally it goes like this

461
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:11,700
they call you up by the thought they say

462
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:13,759
hi I'm Tim the government do you smoke

463
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:17,640
wheat yes or not

464
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:18,960
and so in countries where it's

465
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,720
prohibited

466
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,579
everybody's going to respond uh no I

467
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:27,179
don't know anybody that

468
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:28,319
so can those surveys in the countries

469
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:31,559
that

470
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:33,538
are prohibited this the responses and

471
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:35,038
the consumption rights are recorded

472
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:38,700
that's very very low

473
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:40,980
in other countries like worldwide or

474
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,419
Canada or the United States when

475
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,819
somebody calls you up and then there

476
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:46,380
were met and says do you smoke weed when

477
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:48,240
it's normalized and when there's

478
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:50,940
distribution channels and all sorts of

479
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,099
stuff then the percentage of people that

480
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:55,740
admit to using cannabis in the previous

481
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:57,659
year and previous month it's relatively

482
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:00,359
high and so

483
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:03,000
um a lot of the demand is based upon

484
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:05,459
consumption and then they decide that

485
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,579
badly to that consumption and then the

486
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:10,079
number of consumers so it's consumers

487
00:20:07,579 --> 00:20:10,798
consumption status

488
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:14,519
um

489
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:16,379
from the numbers from the unodc

490
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:20,038
um based upon these predictions the

491
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:22,500
total Global Market is between 250 and

492
00:20:20,038 --> 00:20:24,839
350 million dollars and I think this is

493
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,700
extremely underrecorded

494
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:29,519
um because in the United States the

495
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:31,440
total Mark and elicit illegal is over a

496
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:33,720
hundred billion dollars a month

497
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,840
so that would mean that the U.S market

498
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:38,160
is roughly a third of the tall Global

499
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:40,678
demand

500
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:44,038
um enough just I'm just not buying that

501
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:46,019
um and so but from a consumption or a

502
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:49,200
consumer perspective the largest market

503
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:51,599
in the world is actually a nation uh

504
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,340
it's China it's India

505
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:56,159
um it's the Asian countries and then

506
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:58,319
effort and then then the US and Europe

507
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:00,600
and so when you look at it from a

508
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:03,298
consumer perspective those are the

509
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:05,879
largest markets in the in the world but

510
00:21:03,298 --> 00:21:07,859
from a dollar or a Euro perspective the

511
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,860
largest market is in North America and

512
00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:13,079
specifically the US uh and then the

513
00:21:10,859 --> 00:21:14,819
European market from a dollar or a Euro

514
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:17,879
for stat to this is the second largest

515
00:21:14,819 --> 00:21:19,980
market from a for a revited for step

516
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:24,539
um well not for Dukan was that

517
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:27,360
as the global Marketplace normalizes the

518
00:21:24,538 --> 00:21:29,400
prices in these U.S market and European

519
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:31,558
market will actually fall and so

520
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:34,500
there'll be some normalization of the

521
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:37,139
market and the the that it is total

522
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:39,779
addressable Market still legal and and

523
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:42,179
legal but kind of normalize and and

524
00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:44,940
shake out and then you'll start saying

525
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:47,038
uh you know the value of that Asian

526
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:48,900
market relative to the European and the

527
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:51,720
U.S markets

528
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:53,640
um and so so you can look at it from a

529
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,779
dollar or a Euro perspective where you

530
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,480
have to look at it from a consumer

531
00:21:54,779 --> 00:22:00,000
perspective and I do vote

532
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:03,058
um in addition to that uh

533
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,220
it's often overlooked about Supply and

534
00:22:03,058 --> 00:22:07,619
so where is this Supply coming from some

535
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:10,440
life firm has developed models that

536
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:12,119
looks at supplied particularly in the

537
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,580
United States about where the supply is

538
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:17,099
coming from and then the value of that

539
00:22:14,579 --> 00:22:19,918
Supply as well

540
00:22:17,099 --> 00:22:22,740
so Mike what are some of the things that

541
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,840
our industry or Market chillers we

542
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:27,900
talked about tax evil we were preparing

543
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:30,000
for this video comments on at least just

544
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:32,100
some other thoughts on what prevents a

545
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,200
new program from actually succeeding

546
00:22:32,099 --> 00:22:36,418
what what Stein is more

547
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,159
yeah and you know this one of the buses

548
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:40,020
that I think Ireland and other countries

549
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,659
could learn from what's happened here in

550
00:22:40,019 --> 00:22:46,139
the the U.S

551
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:49,140
what generally happens is this statement

552
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:51,840
local governments determine how much was

553
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:54,299
he they want to generate from Cannabis

554
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:57,480
taxation so let's call it a hundred

555
00:22:54,298 --> 00:23:00,359
Billy and then they figure out well this

556
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:03,839
is how many and how much things sales we

557
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:08,099
have to add that we expect will generate

558
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:10,199
100 billion in tax and then they back

559
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:12,719
into it and they figure okay when is the

560
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,759
tax rate that I have to have times the

561
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,339
amount of sales that will equal 100

562
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:20,879
billion and they work backwards this way

563
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:24,000
because they want to budget you know 100

564
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:26,400
billion dollars of tax revenue the

565
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,440
coming from Cannabis

566
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:32,519
um but unfortunately what that does is

567
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:35,279
it creates such a high tax rate that the

568
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:37,440
legal Market just strikes because they

569
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:41,700
have no regulation they have no testing

570
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:44,519
they have no uh tax obligations and so

571
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:46,200
um they they do quite well that meant

572
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:49,500
we're seeing this right now in New York

573
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:52,440
city where the work recently of Akeem

574
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:55,798
adult used label and they've only

575
00:23:52,440 --> 00:24:01,380
granted four licenses and of those four

576
00:23:55,798 --> 00:24:04,259
licenses uh two uh are you know social

577
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:06,780
Mike Woody licenses that we called where

578
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:09,599
people that have been arrested or

579
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:12,418
incarcerated for

580
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:14,339
drug trafficking in the past they're

581
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:17,759
trying to make amends to them and say

582
00:24:14,339 --> 00:24:19,918
hey let's you know that it's legal

583
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:22,500
let's expunge their their criminal

584
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,700
records let's you know make it so that

585
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:26,819
they get

586
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:28,798
etiod first opportunity into this new

587
00:24:26,819 --> 00:24:31,500
business in New York

588
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:34,980
um but problem is with with only four

589
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:38,400
legal dispensaries there are

590
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:41,519
countless illegal dispensaries that are

591
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:44,100
selling Goods now and the problem is is

592
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:46,980
that when they get caught they basically

593
00:24:44,099 --> 00:24:49,199
get a slime ball to wrist fine and that

594
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:51,720
said and then they turn around and next

595
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,279
week they have another Shuffle just

596
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,839
really quickly to that foot there was an

597
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:57,119
article the other day

598
00:24:54,839 --> 00:25:00,119
there was a there was a store near Times

599
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:02,219
Square not licensed it was shut down

600
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:04,139
four consecutive times it just keeps

601
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:06,240
opening again to your point because

602
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:08,220
there's no repercussion there's no

603
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,200
nobody gets arrested maybe they get a

604
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:12,179
ticket but it's legal it's just not

605
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,159
licenses and regulated completely yet

606
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:16,919
and that's that perhaps that you need to

607
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:19,020
jump yeah that that you know and it's

608
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:22,559
very surprising that here in the U.S

609
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:24,839
that you know we saw this in Colorado a

610
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:28,079
California Washington or in all these

611
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:31,379
states that that came adult you sleep

612
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:33,298
years ago that now these news Stakes on

613
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:37,080
the East Coast are making the very same

614
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:40,798
mistakes uh you know even at New York

615
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:44,158
there have been attacks um cannabis not

616
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:47,158
based on the purchase price you know THC

617
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:50,520
content which is also kind of a

618
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:53,220
dangerous way of doing this because an

619
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:55,440
incentive for some of these uh testing

620
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:57,480
Labs you know to be payable much for

621
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,880
money and say hey just make it you know

622
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:01,740
not a hundred milligrams fake it showed

623
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,880
as 90 milligrams because it is a lower

624
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,640
cost

625
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,880
that's just not a good way to really the

626
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:12,000
forced a Man attack system

627
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:14,400
on the Helms so just to supplement this

628
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,700
a little bit uh another common estate

629
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:20,519
that's made from state to state to state

630
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:22,038
related to tax is that they expect this

631
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:24,720
huge surge attack

632
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:26,400
immediately out of the gate and they

633
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,740
don't realize that it takes a while

634
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,080
takes a couple years to deploy a legal

635
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:33,359
program and then develop the rules and

636
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:35,699
then refine the rules and throughout

637
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:37,439
that process more and more

638
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,900
um there was a full participate in

639
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:43,038
political system and so there's a ramp

640
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:46,380
that takes place in terms of not only

641
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:48,778
illicit to levo Consumer conversions but

642
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:51,120
the amount of tax that's generated at

643
00:26:48,778 --> 00:26:53,159
the state level and so it'll ultimately

644
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:55,019
get us aware their objectives are if

645
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:56,700
they if they did things right they'd

646
00:26:55,019 --> 00:26:58,859
have tests too much and distance that's

647
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,900
bias consumer being abroad and

648
00:26:58,859 --> 00:27:02,719
conversion it'll eventually get there

649
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:05,700
but it takes a while and I think

650
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:08,940
aesthetic expectations with legislators

651
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:11,640
and with Regulators on their uh

652
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:12,960
realistic ramp is is extremely important

653
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:17,340
in the work

654
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:19,980
at that street uh that is an important

655
00:27:17,339 --> 00:27:23,339
part but the renulation in all around

656
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:27,919
the world the classical series shine are

657
00:27:23,339 --> 00:27:27,918
how we're going to

658
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:36,059
isolation what is THC what is CBD what

659
00:27:33,058 --> 00:27:39,740
is a cannabinoid and I don't know guys

660
00:27:36,058 --> 00:27:43,619
please have a question for us did it is

661
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:46,798
correct to classified in Canada's

662
00:27:43,619 --> 00:27:49,379
industry regarding the person of

663
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:52,379
ndabinoids in the product you know

664
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:56,039
because that is a drawlet if you are

665
00:27:52,380 --> 00:28:00,960
putting more taxes because you have a

666
00:27:56,038 --> 00:28:04,200
plea tree then then the system it is not

667
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:07,079
quite cooperate the correct way in a

668
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:10,319
like Sciences as an as a pharmaceutical

669
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:13,558
journey I can tell we have if the

670
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:16,019
General Health law the definition of THC

671
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:20,759
in the classification of a controlled

672
00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:23,900
substance where the log states that is a

673
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:26,519
major public health problem

674
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:29,700
products which contain more than one

675
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:32,819
percent of THC and this is a mistake so

676
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:35,640
when we're done to talk about starting

677
00:28:32,819 --> 00:28:38,579
the radiation we need to be clear with

678
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:40,980
those definitions in order to not repeat

679
00:28:38,579 --> 00:28:43,199
eight hour mistakes because we're here

680
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:45,720
to talk about our regulations the

681
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,419
mistakes we've been through and I want

682
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:51,419
to help you to do not go to the same

683
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:52,860
things as us but only was it but no no

684
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:54,059
it's great so so think about this stuff

685
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:56,819
think about

686
00:28:54,058 --> 00:28:59,940
when a government decides to actually

687
00:28:56,819 --> 00:29:02,278
put a law or a regulation in place and

688
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:04,380
they start to tax you on THC content

689
00:29:02,278 --> 00:29:06,960
it's almost like the government's saying

690
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:09,600
hey we're doing you a favor

691
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,700
public we're allowing these compounds to

692
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:14,099
be introduced into society and we're

693
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:16,740
going to tax it upon how much fun you

694
00:29:14,099 --> 00:29:19,019
can have or how much TNC in it when the

695
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:21,359
right approach is not that approach it's

696
00:29:19,019 --> 00:29:23,220
the exact opposite it's suppose what

697
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:24,898
Beau would might describe this when a

698
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:27,360
government looks at the industry and

699
00:29:24,898 --> 00:29:29,519
says what industries do for the

700
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:31,918
government not let the government be do

701
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:35,099
for the industry that's the way that

702
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:37,140
things become moved forward so if the

703
00:29:35,099 --> 00:29:39,719
government can rely on the taxation the

704
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:41,460
tax dollars they can do things and you

705
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:44,159
can show that and for those of you

706
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:46,558
making an argument for talking with

707
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,539
public policy makers you can look no

708
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:51,119
further than pick a state in the United

709
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:53,220
States pick a country Latin America you

710
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:55,859
can show that those tax dollars have

711
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:59,038
been put to use for schools for

712
00:29:55,859 --> 00:30:02,099
Education campaigns for roads for public

713
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:04,200
buildings for the public health there

714
00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:06,298
are so many things that come out of

715
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,159
Taxation for the Cannabis industry and

716
00:30:06,298 --> 00:30:10,740
it's all positive it but it's not about

717
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:13,320
the government saying we will allow you

718
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:15,120
to do this what can we do for you it

719
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:17,278
should be the other way around what can

720
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:18,898
the private sector in a new industry do

721
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:21,000
for the government which ultimately

722
00:30:18,898 --> 00:30:22,678
benefits to people now around I'd like

723
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,538
to come back to some of the things

724
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:26,399
you've talked about uh we talked about

725
00:30:24,538 --> 00:30:28,679
other markets trying to get off the

726
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:31,079
ground uh and having been off the ground

727
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:33,720
like the U.S market but of course what's

728
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:36,359
happening in Mexico Mexico of course is

729
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,919
135 million people as I understand it

730
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:38,778
very very large country by way of

731
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,419
population

732
00:30:38,778 --> 00:30:45,898
its Supreme Court had issued a a finding

733
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:48,659
four years ago that says you have to

734
00:30:45,898 --> 00:30:51,178
allow for and create a law for adult

735
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:52,740
news or dispensaries for lack of a

736
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:54,778
better way to put it but that hasn't

737
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:56,640
happened yet but talk about the the

738
00:30:54,778 --> 00:30:59,640
three different policy Lanes medical

739
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,080
adult use and and the hemp and uh what's

740
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:03,960
happening in Mexico and how it relates

741
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:06,418
you think too General Global policy and

742
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:08,220
development so

743
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:12,000
um in Mexico everything starts with a

744
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:15,600
medicinal regulation we start because of

745
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,000
at trial individual go against the

746
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:19,079
government asking a permission for

747
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:24,778
evidence

748
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:27,418
so after this first trial daily one a

749
00:31:24,778 --> 00:31:29,460
ton of Trials came right not only for

750
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:33,840
the medicinal area also for the

751
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:37,679
recreation or other ears period and uh

752
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:40,259
for a good in 2017 we had our first

753
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:42,720
amendment in the generality of law which

754
00:31:40,259 --> 00:31:46,140
allowed us to grow calories for

755
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,480
medicinal and a clinical research Corpus

756
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:53,159
right

757
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:57,899
and that 2021 January where two years

758
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:59,940
after death the held Authority execute

759
00:31:57,898 --> 00:32:01,678
the regulations for the medicinal

760
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:05,340
illness

761
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:08,159
these regulations are are really

762
00:32:05,339 --> 00:32:11,759
interesting because for first time the

763
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:15,480
field Ministry execute a regulation in

764
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:18,898
which other authorities are related and

765
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:22,200
it's kind of a copy of the drugs

766
00:32:18,898 --> 00:32:25,019
regulation we had before but they added

767
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,220
the word Candace right cannabinox THC

768
00:32:25,019 --> 00:32:29,879
CBD

769
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:32,880
so uh what people pertend and is curious

770
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:35,640
is that we have a 100 percent of legal

771
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:39,360
medicinal system but we do not have

772
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:42,000
access for cannabis in medicinal

773
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:44,879
purposes right we can't go to a

774
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:49,380
drugstore we even though we do not find

775
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:52,320
the CBD oils you know in the pharmacies

776
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:56,159
you need to obtain these in maybe Easter

777
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:59,220
on Facebook in social media it either

778
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:01,919
Amazon it is not selling in Mexico CBD

779
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:04,140
so what is the problem here and the

780
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:08,520
lesson from these industries this

781
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:11,820
medicinal area internet for today

782
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:14,700
we need to understand that medicinal

783
00:33:11,819 --> 00:33:17,339
academies it is not only about the

784
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:19,798
Pharma industry right we need to

785
00:33:17,339 --> 00:33:22,678
understand there are other ways for

786
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:25,679
having access to amazing all panelists

787
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:28,140
that will not take us a lot of time

788
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:31,080
because for the Pharma industry the

789
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:33,659
medicinal and candidates will take a lot

790
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:36,178
of years with clinical research a lot of

791
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:39,179
investment or they will make these drugs

792
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:42,419
and by the way congratulations guide for

793
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:45,659
with all your what are you doing here

794
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:48,419
um but this takes time and takes money

795
00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:51,600
and is an industry that a lot of people

796
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:54,360
is scared if or does not know enough

797
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:57,599
right example the law firm I was working

798
00:33:54,359 --> 00:34:00,959
in was a really challenge to bring the

799
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:04,379
lover into into the catalase interest

800
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:07,740
because people it is afraid all the time

801
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:11,280
when they saw the Cannabis because right

802
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:13,440
so the lesson here is to understand that

803
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,599
the Chinese medicine the medicinal

804
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,059
calories it is not only aimed for the

805
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:21,300
pharmaceutical industry and that there

806
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:23,519
are other ways and systems to give

807
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:27,000
upstairs for the patients for calories

808
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:28,858
without needing to wait all this time

809
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,679
and all this money and all this

810
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:35,219
immersion right and investment source

811
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:38,760
then it's like a ham industrial camp in

812
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:41,579
this 2017 in this amendment uh was the

813
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:44,639
exemption and we are allowed with the

814
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:47,759
commercialized exam or products which

815
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:50,820
contain cannabbing noise that does not

816
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:53,159
uh have more than one percent of THC and

817
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:56,399
here comes I think of definition in a

818
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:58,920
lot of regulations there is a state that

819
00:34:56,398 --> 00:35:00,299
if the product contains or the crop

820
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:03,358
contains

821
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:06,119
more than one percent of THC that is

822
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:08,759
recreational or menacing up but it

823
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:12,358
contains less than one percent of THC it

824
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:14,880
can this is not right hand and a

825
00:35:12,358 --> 00:35:18,679
specific plot within a specific genetic

826
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:22,740
and that yes these plants uh

827
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:24,598
generates low percent of DHT but the

828
00:35:22,739 --> 00:35:28,078
thing here is again the classification

829
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:30,599
what my law states is that I can

830
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,460
commercialize Import and Export products

831
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:35,880
which contain not not more than one

832
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:38,519
percent of THC not only in him right uh

833
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:40,858
so this part of the the technicians and

834
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:42,719
that classification uh that we're going

835
00:35:40,858 --> 00:35:46,139
to start working here and there is only

836
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:49,980
important and uh well hint is little but

837
00:35:46,139 --> 00:35:53,338
it is not regulated again guys it is

838
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:55,858
about regulation not over regulation

839
00:35:53,338 --> 00:35:59,039
okay because when governments and

840
00:35:55,858 --> 00:36:01,980
leading leader are scared about Randy

841
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:04,440
Laden they tend to over regulate and

842
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:07,559
then you over regulate a market with

843
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:10,920
taxes if you over regulate a market with

844
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:12,838
a new regulation for cannabis that says

845
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:16,079
the same thing the other one you know

846
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:18,599
can't trouble so so let's keep it simple

847
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:20,760
please and the third thing is we're

848
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:23,940
recreational is really funny in the

849
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:26,640
recreational area in Mexico in 2020 the

850
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:29,220
Supreme Court executed Crete which state

851
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:31,920
that the parts of the Articles which

852
00:36:29,219 --> 00:36:36,659
means the prohibition for constitution

853
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:39,599
of calories are not more legal but the

854
00:36:36,659 --> 00:36:44,219
Supreme Court only state a document they

855
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:46,140
do not amend the law so uh now what

856
00:36:44,219 --> 00:36:48,358
consumers are doing they are going

857
00:36:46,139 --> 00:36:51,118
reproductive automation against sanitary

858
00:36:48,358 --> 00:36:53,960
risks which is a signal of MBA as

859
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:56,880
corrupt permission of transmission

860
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:58,079
they have permission but we do not have

861
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:02,460
a market

862
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:05,460
so we are then going to find the colors

863
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:08,940
in the other market right but now with

864
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:14,099
affirmation so you let me know which is

865
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:17,579
worse not regulate or have a lack in our

866
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:21,119
regulations because we are scared of the

867
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:24,539
industry that we do not know or is

868
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:27,119
instead regulating with clear rules in

869
00:37:24,539 --> 00:37:28,338
my perspective these the crates of the

870
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:32,519
Supreme Court

871
00:37:28,338 --> 00:37:35,099
means a lot more danger for public scale

872
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:38,579
that consumers are following a

873
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:42,480
permission with products that are not

874
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:45,380
regulated right so only a little bit

875
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,699
about what is happening in Mexico

876
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:50,338
just adds to that a little bit because

877
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:52,379
we've been talking about taxes when

878
00:37:50,338 --> 00:37:56,578
talking about total address Walmart day

879
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:58,260
and you know like 250 to 350 million but

880
00:37:56,579 --> 00:38:02,460
that's just some adult use of medical

881
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:05,520
side uh Ed when it comes to tax policy I

882
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:07,260
don't think a regulators and and policy

883
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:10,920
experts really understand the Health

884
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:12,359
Market enough to be with that and so but

885
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:15,119
for perspective

886
00:38:12,358 --> 00:38:17,779
a lot of folks say that have this the

887
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:22,260
little sisters have been cannabis

888
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:23,780
when in fact with just some civil uh

889
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:26,520
market share

890
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:30,119
adjustments over to hemp substitute

891
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:33,599
products and Automotive in Plastics uh

892
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:36,599
in wellness and like the the hemp

893
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:39,960
industry globally is at a minimum 350

894
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:42,180
million but 350 billion dollars in total

895
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:45,539
addressable Market just on 10 prototypes

896
00:38:42,179 --> 00:38:48,838
alone and so if you add the industrial

897
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:52,440
side of cannabis to the adult use of

898
00:38:48,838 --> 00:38:55,679
medical it's a half Australian to a

899
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:58,139
trillion dollar market with the T so you

900
00:38:55,679 --> 00:39:01,199
know and so it takes

901
00:38:58,139 --> 00:39:02,940
um policymakers it takes some time to

902
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:05,279
understand the nuances of the market

903
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:07,320
that have this really to be more

904
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:10,140
concerned one inspired or it's graying

905
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:11,700
and it's couldadians right so people and

906
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:14,098
policymakers don't necessarily

907
00:39:11,699 --> 00:39:16,139
understand that and so when you're going

908
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:18,420
into these settings when you're trying

909
00:39:16,139 --> 00:39:20,940
to look at starting a business changing

910
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:22,500
policies looking at tax rejections and

911
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:24,720
light you really have to become an

912
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:26,159
educator before you can become an

913
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:28,319
influencer

914
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:30,779
yeah what what other thing about hemp by

915
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,599
the way who's heard of Delta a Fraser

916
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:35,280
van all right so Delta 8 is a

917
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:37,800
controversial topic right it's an

918
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,940
intoxicating compound derived from the

919
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:42,839
head plant

920
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:45,780
but not the Delta value THC guess what

921
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:47,880
this is the legal in the United States

922
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:50,400
there was a ninth circuit federal court

923
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:53,160
about two months ago that came out and

924
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:56,160
said Delta e quote of Hope comfortably

925
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:58,679
fits within the definition of hemp and

926
00:39:56,159 --> 00:40:02,098
the farm bill definition just last week

927
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:05,039
the DEA came out and it had a chance to

928
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:07,320
say that Delta 8 was a synthetic counter

929
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:10,679
and that it was illegal it didn't do

930
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:12,660
them instead it only talked about thc0

931
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:15,960
which is a non-naturally occurring

932
00:40:12,659 --> 00:40:17,879
product my point is this is a legal

933
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:20,820
product in the United States it's also

934
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:22,440
what I call Red state weed the red

935
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:24,359
States the conservative states in the

936
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:26,400
United States they probably won't adopt

937
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:28,920
the spenceries but they'll allow for

938
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,079
intoxicating compounds repent to be sold

939
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:33,599
in the marketplace so this is a brand

940
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:35,160
new very what they have been advised and

941
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:36,539
it's very challenging

942
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:38,039
um I want to summarize some things and

943
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:39,599
then Bo then sort of shipped to you our

944
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:41,219
part our objective is to sort of talk

945
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:43,380
about North America and the global

946
00:40:41,219 --> 00:40:46,019
economy talk about some numbers but also

947
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:47,880
focus on what's happening in Europe on

948
00:40:46,019 --> 00:40:50,219
the taxation piece

949
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:53,160
we talked about New York perhaps over

950
00:40:50,219 --> 00:40:55,439
tax and over regulate it is an eighth of

951
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:58,799
an ounce of cannabis will cost you about

952
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:01,019
70 to 80 dollars are you gonna go buy if

953
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,599
you're a consumer an 80 eighth of

954
00:41:01,019 --> 00:41:05,579
cannabis from a store when the guy that

955
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:08,338
you've always purchased it from will

956
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:10,800
sell it to you for 25 or 40. I don't

957
00:41:08,338 --> 00:41:13,380
think so and this is the challenge so

958
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,539
that's one month over tax over regulate

959
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:17,400
now look at what they did in Iowa this

960
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:19,619
was years ago this was the first country

961
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,000
I've drafted public policy of over 30

962
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:23,700
countries around the world in this area

963
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,219
Uruguay was the very first and what they

964
00:41:23,699 --> 00:41:28,919
did was they said we're going to set the

965
00:41:26,219 --> 00:41:31,259
price point per gram below the black

966
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:33,720
market or the illicit Market Paraguay

967
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:36,720
the largest illicit marijuana producer

968
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:39,059
in Latin America sends much much of its

969
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:41,338
cannabis into Uruguay

970
00:41:39,059 --> 00:41:43,619
well so they set the price at a dollar

971
00:41:41,338 --> 00:41:46,320
fifty per rent

972
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:48,838
because the black market the pair of

973
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:51,180
white cannabis was sold at 175 or two

974
00:41:48,838 --> 00:41:52,679
dollars per gram that's one way to

975
00:41:51,179 --> 00:41:54,899
combat it whether that works or not

976
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:56,940
remains to be seen but it certainly

977
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:58,559
beats this idea of an 80 date of

978
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:01,380
cannabis

979
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:03,779
um Bo let's talk about the exciting

980
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:06,000
opportunities in Europe uh things now

981
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:07,040
are focused on an additional end of the

982
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,380
shop

983
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:12,960
and hold through the uh you have Czech

984
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:15,240
Republic will be covert and uh as I said

985
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,280
earlier I think check will probably beat

986
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:19,679
Germany but we'll see it's going to be a

987
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,380
great race uh a really great race the

988
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:23,639
race is uh uh but let's talk about some

989
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:27,000
of the DraStic and they have to

990
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:29,460
Enlightenment earlier

991
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,338
yeah so about like I mentioned earlier

992
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:35,220
uh from a revenue perspective uh in

993
00:42:32,338 --> 00:42:36,599
Europe is the second largest market in

994
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:40,078
the world

995
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:42,359
um and it's split up between medicinal

996
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:46,740
and then these emerging

997
00:42:42,358 --> 00:42:49,019
um I told use countries and the like

998
00:42:46,739 --> 00:42:51,118
um but from a just a consumption

999
00:42:49,019 --> 00:42:53,838
perspective it's interesting to know

1000
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:56,579
that Italy is actually the largest

1001
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:59,099
market by from a consumption perspective

1002
00:42:56,579 --> 00:43:02,339
there's just a lot of votes in in the

1003
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:05,818
Lee that really enjoy this ugh but

1004
00:43:02,338 --> 00:43:07,619
what's you know what's the key to these

1005
00:43:05,818 --> 00:43:09,838
deployments like in Europe and the

1006
00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:10,980
United States and the like and I'm not

1007
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:13,019
sure if we're going to talk about that

1008
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:15,480
now or a little bit but

1009
00:43:13,019 --> 00:43:19,679
um the key to a successful regulatory

1010
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:21,780
rollout is having enough Supply in

1011
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:24,899
addition to decent pricing relative to

1012
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:27,720
Alyssa market and access for the

1013
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:30,599
consumers so if one of those three is

1014
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:33,118
out of whack then it really slows down

1015
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:35,519
the pace of Reform the pace of

1016
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:38,160
conversion and the amount of legal

1017
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:39,599
capture that the government and Country

1018
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:42,719
can get

1019
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:45,240
um and so in when I looked at Germany

1020
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:48,059
last year they really don't have enough

1021
00:43:45,239 --> 00:43:50,219
domestic Supply to support their rammed

1022
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:51,299
into the adult use space

1023
00:43:50,219 --> 00:43:52,858
um and so they're going to have to do

1024
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:55,260
some favor right now they're willing to

1025
00:43:52,858 --> 00:43:57,598
persistent to to opening up the market

1026
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:58,980
to foreign suppliers

1027
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,720
um and so they're going to struggle and

1028
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:02,400
they're not going to achieve what their

1029
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:05,039
bulls that they're that they're trying

1030
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:07,920
to meet uh meatball

1031
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:11,519
and this uh just the thought of

1032
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:15,119
legalization in Germany has uh driven

1033
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:17,119
policy uh reform in a lot of the

1034
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:19,619
European nations there's about

1035
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:23,240
conversations and during covid for

1036
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:27,660
example the the uh I'm a French police

1037
00:44:23,239 --> 00:44:29,879
asked that uh French government to do

1038
00:44:27,659 --> 00:44:32,219
more its reform and legalize and get

1039
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:35,160
more supply of cannabis on the market

1040
00:44:32,219 --> 00:44:37,500
because it was becoming such a problem

1041
00:44:35,159 --> 00:44:39,598
so even the police are asking the

1042
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:42,179
governments to do reform

1043
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,579
um in Spain there's um discussions and

1044
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:47,460
abortion

1045
00:44:43,579 --> 00:44:49,440
there's they've decriminalized it and so

1046
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:52,139
there's all these oh and then in Italy

1047
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,220
they're also looking at at legalizing as

1048
00:44:52,139 --> 00:44:56,578
well

1049
00:44:53,219 --> 00:44:59,098
um what's similar about in Europe to the

1050
00:44:56,579 --> 00:45:01,980
United States is that there's all these

1051
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:05,039
different models for legalization

1052
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:08,039
um and different strategies

1053
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:09,480
um none that's been unified but yet

1054
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:12,838
um in Europe and it's the same thing

1055
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:15,119
that spoke not out yet in uh in the

1056
00:45:12,838 --> 00:45:18,239
United States so I think ultimately what

1057
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:21,300
will happen is for once there's enough

1058
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:24,118
momentum now keep in mind there's

1059
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:25,859
sotheby countries in the world now or in

1060
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:28,220
excess of 17 countries that have some

1061
00:45:25,858 --> 00:45:31,199
type of legal access to either

1062
00:45:28,219 --> 00:45:34,618
cannabinoids adult use or medical so

1063
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:37,439
this is an emerging uh industry that's

1064
00:45:34,619 --> 00:45:39,059
accelerating in peace of Reform and I

1065
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,760
think Europe is going to be on the

1066
00:45:39,059 --> 00:45:43,400
Forefront of that

1067
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:47,160
and may actually

1068
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:48,900
displace the United States from that uh

1069
00:45:47,159 --> 00:45:51,719
from a market perspective because

1070
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:54,539
they'll uh they just take a different

1071
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:57,379
approach to Taxation and regulation then

1072
00:45:54,539 --> 00:45:57,380
does have been since

1073
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:05,220
the United States the way so I need you

1074
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:07,500
guys need to regulate to United States

1075
00:46:05,219 --> 00:46:10,019
push the regulation and then Mexico

1076
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:11,460
follow that right well but it's an

1077
00:46:10,019 --> 00:46:13,500
important point for better for worse

1078
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:14,880
than any countries do look at the United

1079
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:17,099
States and they're fearful of that

1080
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,720
relationship with the United States uh

1081
00:46:17,099 --> 00:46:20,940
particularly Latin America that's my

1082
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:24,500
experience is they don't want to step

1083
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:26,940
outside of U.S policy for fear of losing

1084
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:29,519
relationships business opportunities and

1085
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:32,159
just you know General diplomacy and I

1086
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:34,259
think that that's a major challenge even

1087
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:35,818
the United Nations I was in the Indiana

1088
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:37,619
Austria

1089
00:46:35,818 --> 00:46:39,000
four years ago for the committee on

1090
00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:40,559
narcotic drugs they were supposed to

1091
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,260
make the change they made in November of

1092
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:45,480
last year four years ago but they didn't

1093
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:47,700
because the United States was resistant

1094
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:48,780
so there seems to be this notion that

1095
00:46:47,699 --> 00:46:50,818
we're going to wait for the United

1096
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:53,760
States to give us approval but the

1097
00:46:50,818 --> 00:46:55,739
United States policy is just so messed

1098
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,839
up for lack a better way to put it on

1099
00:46:55,739 --> 00:46:59,939
all things cannabis but at the same time

1100
00:46:57,838 --> 00:47:01,619
it has the most consumers as bull points

1101
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:03,300
out and perhaps the most robust

1102
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:05,160
Marketplace

1103
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:07,019
um you know there's also there's also oh

1104
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:09,480
go ahead well I was going to say you

1105
00:47:07,019 --> 00:47:11,880
know in Canada is federally legal there

1106
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:14,480
and we still haven't seen you know any

1107
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:17,338
of the benefits of Canadian

1108
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:19,800
legalization to spread around the world

1109
00:47:17,338 --> 00:47:22,679
and to say hey a [ __ ] is the Canadian

1110
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:25,140
model uh independent other countries and

1111
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:27,719
so it's been a fortunate that it is

1112
00:47:25,139 --> 00:47:29,879
still the U.S that drives every and this

1113
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:32,879
is because it is not about regulation

1114
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:35,818
it's about industry it is about the

1115
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:38,579
market you know regulation are only the

1116
00:47:35,818 --> 00:47:41,338
the things we need to follow but uh

1117
00:47:38,579 --> 00:47:44,099
Regulators need to hear and to

1118
00:47:41,338 --> 00:47:46,380
understand the industry in order to

1119
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:48,180
create regulations in accordance for

1120
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:50,640
those markets right

1121
00:47:48,179 --> 00:47:51,239
for sure so my

1122
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:53,879
um

1123
00:47:51,239 --> 00:47:55,439
shipped a little bit to some of that the

1124
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:58,019
consumer patterns and the markets uh

1125
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:59,220
when we were talking uh you talked a

1126
00:47:58,019 --> 00:48:00,900
little bit about

1127
00:47:59,219 --> 00:48:02,759
things that don't exist in the

1128
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:06,300
marketplace there's a branding for

1129
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:08,160
products uh product development

1130
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:10,140
um what are some of those opportunity

1131
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:11,460
accounts so if there are folks

1132
00:48:10,139 --> 00:48:13,318
participating in the European market

1133
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:15,179
what could they observe to do

1134
00:48:13,318 --> 00:48:17,039
differently for hacks from a market said

1135
00:48:15,179 --> 00:48:20,519
well yeah one of the things that's been

1136
00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:22,739
very successful in the US is Brandy many

1137
00:48:20,519 --> 00:48:25,199
of the companies that are on the west

1138
00:48:22,739 --> 00:48:27,598
coast you know it's becoming a saturated

1139
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:29,759
Market there uh there's so many

1140
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:33,240
competitors if the only way to stand out

1141
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:36,119
is to have a recognizable brand and so

1142
00:48:33,239 --> 00:48:38,818
those companies are now will be Eastward

1143
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:41,940
with their brand also going worldwide

1144
00:48:38,818 --> 00:48:44,460
where my client says cookies and they

1145
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:47,760
now have 50 dispensaries across the US

1146
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:50,099
they've opened up one at the UK I want

1147
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:53,400
to be it out one in Tel Aviv and so

1148
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:55,500
they're becoming a worldwide brand uh

1149
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:57,838
like Coca-Cola so that they would be

1150
00:48:55,500 --> 00:49:02,039
renty dies no matter what country you're

1151
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:04,440
in and by getting that Grandy people

1152
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:07,858
that gravitate to a sugar Iran

1153
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:10,740
understand that if I'm by a a product

1154
00:49:07,858 --> 00:49:12,779
from the I get to serve the fact I like

1155
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:15,539
that fat and still those and go off that

1156
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:17,579
consistency it's like a McDonald's where

1157
00:49:15,539 --> 00:49:19,800
he could go anywhere in the world it did

1158
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:21,240
it and have a McDonald's it is going to

1159
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:23,519
be the same

1160
00:49:21,239 --> 00:49:26,219
um that's going to be very hard video in

1161
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:29,219
order to you know get confessors and

1162
00:49:26,219 --> 00:49:32,098
Elders excited about this company versus

1163
00:49:29,219 --> 00:49:34,919
competitor that nobody has heard about

1164
00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:37,859
the other thing is is that you know look

1165
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:40,740
across this road it's it's mainly meant

1166
00:49:37,858 --> 00:49:42,838
everything in this room today and this

1167
00:49:40,739 --> 00:49:46,199
Market is really still geared towards

1168
00:49:42,838 --> 00:49:48,539
either 21 to 35 year old millions and

1169
00:49:46,199 --> 00:49:51,419
the products serving for that well the

1170
00:49:48,539 --> 00:49:54,000
packaging is this is you know geared for

1171
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:56,639
that demographic and so there needs to

1172
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:59,280
be War within in this industry more

1173
00:49:56,639 --> 00:50:02,219
products Go With It uh

1174
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:04,680
things that appeal to women and it is

1175
00:50:02,219 --> 00:50:06,838
still so male dominated that's some area

1176
00:50:04,679 --> 00:50:08,338
that I think is very right

1177
00:50:06,838 --> 00:50:12,358
um in Europe and all over the world

1178
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:14,099
really on to you know produce products

1179
00:50:12,358 --> 00:50:16,139
that that really would appeal to 50

1180
00:50:14,099 --> 00:50:18,359
percent of the Oculus

1181
00:50:16,139 --> 00:50:20,879
well from very on any comment that based

1182
00:50:18,358 --> 00:50:23,759
on few C markets around what do you

1183
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:25,800
notice in sh's mail driven Pilots female

1184
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:27,540
driven policies they're a is there a

1185
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:30,599
hole in the marketplace

1186
00:50:27,539 --> 00:50:35,699
yes I I think it is a whole in Mexico

1187
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:38,640
also we we have a call I think uh that

1188
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:42,419
well for a Buddha for bad these

1189
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:46,500
industrating skiing open by by length

1190
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:48,960
right back then and uh

1191
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:51,239
but it is by the lip and yesterday I was

1192
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:55,199
talking with very that is very like

1193
00:50:51,239 --> 00:50:58,379
about uh women

1194
00:50:55,199 --> 00:51:02,939
Ming is scared to come in this industry

1195
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:05,760
and that is part of our work right uh

1196
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:08,818
because as I mentioned before every time

1197
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:11,280
you say calories there is a stigma be

1198
00:51:08,818 --> 00:51:14,099
quiet and uh

1199
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:17,940
if this is a market that is being

1200
00:51:14,099 --> 00:51:21,900
opening by men you know women were like

1201
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:24,960
yes or not and I think this will with

1202
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:27,780
time take the place in the moment you

1203
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:32,338
know uh this is about all countries

1204
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:36,059
starting to regulate and uh women were

1205
00:51:32,338 --> 00:51:38,880
trying to come in the industry and the

1206
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:40,980
effects I I saw in other countries in

1207
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:44,338
United States in Latin America I told

1208
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:48,300
her yesterday it is in Mexico we we are

1209
00:51:44,338 --> 00:51:51,838
starting to to get together in order for

1210
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:54,660
start pushing companies up but first of

1211
00:51:51,838 --> 00:51:57,119
all we need to identify ourselves our

1212
00:51:54,659 --> 00:51:59,759
roles in the industry and how we can

1213
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:02,940
play this and guys this is also really

1214
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:05,520
important for you to know and I am

1215
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:08,519
really thank you and I am honored to be

1216
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:11,759
in this panel with you guys this is

1217
00:52:08,519 --> 00:52:14,579
really important okay giving us space

1218
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:17,460
for women because we for always we will

1219
00:52:14,579 --> 00:52:19,559
have at the point of view than you you

1220
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:22,619
are fine with just your dates and came

1221
00:52:19,559 --> 00:52:26,220
with someone you here at human like okay

1222
00:52:22,619 --> 00:52:28,079
males we we are we are aggressive we

1223
00:52:26,219 --> 00:52:31,259
want to blow out we want to fight and

1224
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:34,140
take money and bring it home right and

1225
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:37,200
women were so careful we build planning

1226
00:52:34,139 --> 00:52:40,799
it we we create that the base of the

1227
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:43,078
society right so those two points of

1228
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:46,619
view in one industry are really

1229
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:48,960
important and to make uh also if we're

1230
00:52:46,619 --> 00:52:52,619
starting with all these industry to to

1231
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:54,300
give it a a change right

1232
00:52:52,619 --> 00:52:56,400
and you said something interesting other

1233
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:58,800
people is where you talked about over

1234
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:00,780
regulation the work over regulation and

1235
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:04,500
God and and sometimes I look at the

1236
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:06,839
existing system and we're looking at

1237
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:09,179
when I call the dispensary system right

1238
00:53:06,838 --> 00:53:11,400
the sort of U.S based way of selling

1239
00:53:09,179 --> 00:53:13,318
cannabis over the counter which uh is

1240
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:15,599
ultimately the the model that we're

1241
00:53:13,318 --> 00:53:17,699
seeing it's adopted verbally

1242
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:20,599
I would suggest we're at the we're at

1243
00:53:17,699 --> 00:53:23,699
the 10-year Mark of betadavis industry

1244
00:53:20,599 --> 00:53:26,280
and we have to re-evaluate this

1245
00:53:23,699 --> 00:53:30,000
dispensory system model because it is

1246
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:31,980
over text it is over regulated we see in

1247
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,920
the United States that these companies

1248
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:37,740
are dying left and right because of

1249
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:40,019
being strangled by over-regulation and

1250
00:53:37,739 --> 00:53:42,899
over taxation how do you create an

1251
00:53:40,019 --> 00:53:45,000
operable Market without forward Taxation

1252
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:47,818
and over

1253
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:53,280
with clear definitions

1254
00:53:47,818 --> 00:53:57,599
the program with phc is that THC is a

1255
00:53:53,280 --> 00:54:00,359
classified as a controlled synthesis so

1256
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:02,039
till the moment we do not have clear

1257
00:54:00,358 --> 00:54:05,539
regulation and not only national

1258
00:54:02,039 --> 00:54:08,400
International we need to go to the

1259
00:54:05,539 --> 00:54:10,858
Convention of the United Nations of

1260
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:13,980
nurkatrix and drops we need to start

1261
00:54:10,858 --> 00:54:15,779
from there to to have a clear regulation

1262
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:19,380
what is the problem with the

1263
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:21,900
overadillation it's that the legislator

1264
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:26,220
as I mentioned before is regulated with

1265
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:29,760
fear and with lack of knowledge but when

1266
00:54:26,219 --> 00:54:32,699
you understand that the THC is a

1267
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:36,540
compound that yes it is a secret propane

1268
00:54:32,699 --> 00:54:39,000
one but also can improve in other uses

1269
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:42,779
and in other ways the cvd as an example

1270
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:46,260
then you will be able to regulate with

1271
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:48,420
black with no fear and we clear it we

1272
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:50,760
know the statement in the lot that it

1273
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:53,579
that makes me makes me nervous the

1274
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:56,220
stigma in the law the law is a lot a lot

1275
00:54:53,579 --> 00:54:59,160
of regulations are only perming to be

1276
00:54:56,219 --> 00:55:01,318
following you know the attorneys we

1277
00:54:59,159 --> 00:55:04,980
Rizzle up we do not care if the

1278
00:55:01,318 --> 00:55:07,980
regulator thinks that THC or more than

1279
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:10,920
what percent of THC is a major major

1280
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:12,838
fully killed problem you know we're only

1281
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:16,680
going to follow what the regulation is

1282
00:55:12,838 --> 00:55:19,139
stated so the the the the ovary

1283
00:55:16,679 --> 00:55:22,919
deletions came because of the lack of

1284
00:55:19,139 --> 00:55:26,578
knowledge and uh how you change Deeds

1285
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:29,880
you need to to see first to the industry

1286
00:55:26,579 --> 00:55:31,619
not to regulate because regulate what

1287
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:33,960
happened in Mexico with as a principle

1288
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:37,019
they have been decree why because they

1289
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:39,300
were regulated for regulated only and

1290
00:55:37,019 --> 00:55:42,900
this is not the model we need to follow

1291
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:46,079
we need to change this uh I'm word I

1292
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:48,420
mean when I was in Santa Monica I also

1293
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:50,940
elaborate as it is a meal this is what

1294
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:53,519
the first citizen Bill we submitted

1295
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:56,460
reporters in nature for the relation

1296
00:55:53,519 --> 00:56:01,500
Federal Regulation of Canada and what do

1297
00:55:56,460 --> 00:56:05,300
we did we go with for interviewing each

1298
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:10,079
person in the Cannabis business model

1299
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:12,480
since that registry of the certified sea

1300
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:15,359
heal the

1301
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:17,940
um Wholesales stores that this is a

1302
00:56:15,358 --> 00:56:20,818
problem in Mexico the whole sales stores

1303
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:22,800
is a problem because even though it is

1304
00:56:20,818 --> 00:56:25,500
legal for industrial pan and for the

1305
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:28,920
medicinal purposes whole step Wholesale

1306
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:32,099
stores and drugs stores are not allowing

1307
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:34,500
these products even those are lid up and

1308
00:56:32,099 --> 00:56:38,460
again the problem is stigma the problem

1309
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:41,699
lap of knowledge so we need to see first

1310
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:43,858
the industry what do they need in

1311
00:56:41,699 --> 00:56:47,338
accordance for our current regulations

1312
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:50,159
please do not think about a new canaries

1313
00:56:47,338 --> 00:56:53,818
Europe is institution and what they are

1314
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:56,699
thinking about it but I am reassured

1315
00:56:53,818 --> 00:56:58,679
that we all have Federal Regulation for

1316
00:56:56,699 --> 00:57:02,519
all the products of what you need to

1317
00:56:58,679 --> 00:57:04,799
regulate is not a crop and eel can be

1318
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:07,380
bothering the the farmers and The

1319
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:09,900
Growers with the controllment of THC and

1320
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:12,358
the pros you need to regulate the prayer

1321
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:14,940
and who is going to use this product

1322
00:57:12,358 --> 00:57:16,980
because if the consumer is going to use

1323
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:20,400
this product for medicinal purposes

1324
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:22,619
needs to be a specific relation for that

1325
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:25,079
but if this is for concerns gender like

1326
00:57:22,619 --> 00:57:27,420
adult use will lead another regulation

1327
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:30,839
but the first thing we need to see is

1328
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:32,338
the consumers the patients the industry

1329
00:57:30,838 --> 00:57:35,759
and then

1330
00:57:32,338 --> 00:57:39,119
because of those start to wreck the love

1331
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:41,520
in order to not over regulate with he

1332
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:44,760
that we've already got regulations for

1333
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:47,519
the alpha Hall and tomato and you know

1334
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:51,380
same thing or alkaline tobacco can be

1335
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:54,599
hip to use just like manipus and so

1336
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:56,640
packaging everything has to kind of you

1337
00:57:54,599 --> 00:57:59,220
know child-proof packaging you know with

1338
00:57:56,639 --> 00:58:02,159
under 21 could purchase the product I

1339
00:57:59,219 --> 00:58:06,539
mean certain basic regulations then are

1340
00:58:02,159 --> 00:58:09,299
in tobacco and and alcohol should be

1341
00:58:06,539 --> 00:58:11,579
adopted for cannabis and and everything

1342
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:14,700
is already there you know so all the

1343
00:58:11,579 --> 00:58:16,559
regulations for for alcohol this you

1344
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:19,379
know it's already there bonded where

1345
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:21,780
else security of the product you know as

1346
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:24,599
it moves from one place to another place

1347
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:28,800
uh at the even the taxes you know do you

1348
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:31,079
have a low excise tax that now hunt the

1349
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:33,420
illicit Market out of business because

1350
00:58:31,079 --> 00:58:35,640
no one goes around leaning after you go

1351
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:37,500
around and say hey I know somebody

1352
00:58:35,639 --> 00:58:39,598
they'll sell you a bottle of vodka

1353
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:42,239
cheaper than at the store that's around

1354
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:45,059
the fort Middleton back we just go to

1355
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:47,639
the store we buy the vodka we pay the

1356
00:58:45,059 --> 00:58:48,599
tax I had nobody this is too concerned

1357
00:58:47,639 --> 00:58:51,298
about

1358
00:58:48,599 --> 00:58:52,519
so it develop some models

1359
00:58:51,298 --> 00:58:55,559
um

1360
00:58:52,519 --> 00:58:59,219
re-examining the dispensary model

1361
00:58:55,559 --> 00:59:01,680
and because like I said earlier it's an

1362
00:58:59,219 --> 00:59:03,358
up Supply it's the amount of access in

1363
00:59:01,679 --> 00:59:05,578
this price and so if you live at the

1364
00:59:03,358 --> 00:59:07,500
access through the century model they

1365
00:59:05,579 --> 00:59:11,280
may don't get as much legal

1366
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:15,239
participation so I looked at this model

1367
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:18,059
where you just open it up you tax it

1368
00:59:15,239 --> 00:59:20,639
either like album Hall you regulated it

1369
00:59:18,059 --> 00:59:23,940
kind of like tobacco or alcohol in in

1370
00:59:20,639 --> 00:59:27,118
the sense that you had labeling and you

1371
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:29,940
check IDs but then putting it into

1372
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:31,700
grocery stores and gas stations and

1373
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:35,818
everything else

1374
00:59:31,699 --> 00:59:38,759
the the amount of conversion

1375
00:59:35,818 --> 00:59:40,699
um was enormous the amount of

1376
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:44,520
opportunities for

1377
00:59:40,699 --> 00:59:47,159
products and Brands inspires into space

1378
00:59:44,519 --> 00:59:49,858
was enormous and it really did away with

1379
00:59:47,159 --> 00:59:54,420
the list work very quickly so opening it

1380
00:59:49,858 --> 00:59:57,539
up giving high volume access to more

1381
00:59:54,420 --> 01:00:00,480
consumers was really a viable model that

1382
00:59:57,539 --> 01:00:03,420
mapsolize tax revenue minimize the

1383
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:06,119
impact of the Alyssa warranty got people

1384
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:08,460
participating and didn't necessarily

1385
01:00:06,119 --> 01:00:10,980
have as much of the public health impact

1386
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:13,920
as as has been stated by other policy

1387
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:16,440
managers so there are alternative models

1388
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:20,159
out there that one can use to really

1389
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:22,200
maximize that the industry and give

1390
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:25,558
tremendous opportunities for four people

1391
01:00:22,199 --> 01:00:26,879
and so babe

1392
01:00:25,559 --> 01:00:30,780
down

1393
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:30,780
lesson nonsense

1394
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:38,760
enforcement for subjury now that you

1395
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:41,760
went there yourself saying compared to

1396
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:43,200
aldol Capo and you know let's say it's

1397
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:44,880
dirty in the baby wrote the world

1398
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:46,618
everybody was also that wants to replace

1399
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:49,500
it it was smart like they wouldn't

1400
01:00:46,619 --> 01:00:50,160
collaborate they wouldn't replace it so

1401
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:52,679
um

1402
01:00:50,159 --> 01:00:56,639
we should look back to what prohibition

1403
01:00:52,679 --> 01:00:59,219
enters also polar Builder but how it was

1404
01:00:56,639 --> 01:01:02,460
because the high CHC is basically what

1405
01:00:59,219 --> 01:01:04,500
absent was an alcohol when uh I think

1406
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:07,440
Molly was called whatever so alcohol

1407
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:10,739
today is taxed in different

1408
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:12,358
um Tears by actually alcohol percentage

1409
01:01:10,739 --> 01:01:14,939
so the thing that we don't want in

1410
01:01:12,358 --> 01:01:16,380
cannabis so we say outrageous is

1411
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:19,559
actually a practice all over Europe

1412
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:21,720
every European country has a 15 32

1413
01:01:19,559 --> 01:01:24,780
percent 30 percent of alcohol different

1414
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:26,338
taxation something to keep in mind a

1415
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:28,798
different point I'd love to know your

1416
01:01:26,338 --> 01:01:30,119
opinion on it uh branding you're only

1417
01:01:28,798 --> 01:01:32,280
telling half the truth about cookies

1418
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:33,960
cookies is building a bread not in the

1419
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:36,780
in the dispensaries cookies is building

1420
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:38,460
a brand in the streets cook is this uh

1421
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:41,160
pirated all over the world we have

1422
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:42,838
cookies packs 10 co-packs and jungle

1423
01:01:41,159 --> 01:01:45,000
boys packs in the streets this is where

1424
01:01:42,838 --> 01:01:46,798
the brands are being made credibility is

1425
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,019
created for recreational in the streets

1426
01:01:46,798 --> 01:01:51,119
not in the stores and cookies is

1427
01:01:49,019 --> 01:01:52,980
probably the only brand also I've been

1428
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:55,440
to Toronto lately there is no brand

1429
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:58,139
loyalty in Canada cookies is just

1430
01:01:55,440 --> 01:02:00,119
another store so I just want to question

1431
01:01:58,139 --> 01:02:03,000
a little bit of this and then see what

1432
01:02:00,119 --> 01:02:05,519
your reaction would be and um just yeah

1433
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:09,000
really look real thank you

1434
01:02:05,519 --> 01:02:11,400
hey I think you know it it's really both

1435
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:15,719
ways I mean you have to have some sort

1436
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:18,960
of crazy that creates that recognition

1437
01:02:15,719 --> 01:02:21,358
um but hey it's way it's been successful

1438
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:24,358
at least in the U.S you know in terms of

1439
01:02:21,358 --> 01:02:27,239
competitors because you know since it's

1440
01:02:24,358 --> 01:02:29,519
up right but in Market each state is the

1441
01:02:27,239 --> 01:02:32,338
zone of regulations you have to get your

1442
01:02:29,519 --> 01:02:34,500
own license and everything uh so that by

1443
01:02:32,338 --> 01:02:36,539
having a brand that is recognized from

1444
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:39,900
East Coast the West Coast at recently be

1445
01:02:36,539 --> 01:02:42,000
rest it's been very successful should it

1446
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:43,980
without seeing in terms of branding as

1447
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,440
well is that they're starting to Brand

1448
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:49,740
views for experiences within the brat

1449
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:52,679
and so you may have a coffees I don't

1450
01:02:49,739 --> 01:02:55,199
know a whole lot about cookies but you

1451
01:02:52,679 --> 01:02:59,159
may have something that is targeted

1452
01:02:55,199 --> 01:03:01,858
experience to that Stalker mod and

1453
01:02:59,159 --> 01:03:05,219
there's a targeted experience to you

1454
01:03:01,858 --> 01:03:07,798
know somebody going out and and doing uh

1455
01:03:05,219 --> 01:03:11,399
activities sports activities and there's

1456
01:03:07,798 --> 01:03:13,380
other uh user experiences branding

1457
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:16,079
related students just chilling out

1458
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:19,140
watching a load and so I'm starting to

1459
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:23,339
see this converting to where their

1460
01:03:19,139 --> 01:03:25,199
branding and a diffuser experience and

1461
01:03:23,338 --> 01:03:27,239
as long as that they have consistent

1462
01:03:25,199 --> 01:03:29,759
products that meet those consumer

1463
01:03:27,239 --> 01:03:33,779
expectations then they develop really

1464
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:37,400
good and durable Grand loyalty cousin

1465
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:37,400
you know out of the David

1466
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:49,318
uh things they're trying to be like

1467
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:50,519
Supreme is you know as this high-end you

1468
01:03:49,318 --> 01:03:54,599
know um

1469
01:03:50,519 --> 01:03:56,880
Urban brand and lifestyle and and the

1470
01:03:54,599 --> 01:03:59,940
the Cannabis products are just part of

1471
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:03,720
that why and uh this is an important

1472
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:06,240
date because before United standing in

1473
01:04:03,719 --> 01:04:09,719
school all the other rally regulated for

1474
01:04:06,239 --> 01:04:12,000
adult years they are they already have a

1475
01:04:09,719 --> 01:04:14,578
brat you know this is a really good

1476
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:18,539
marketing strategy to start building a

1477
01:04:14,579 --> 01:04:20,519
brand without a regulation maybe but you

1478
01:04:18,539 --> 01:04:24,119
know that cookies will be related with

1479
01:04:20,519 --> 01:04:26,460
other use but really recreational use at

1480
01:04:24,119 --> 01:04:29,460
easterner program but also they are

1481
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:31,920
selling T-shirts that they are creating

1482
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:35,220
a brand they are creating a light stop

1483
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:37,798
run and wait the recruit the the

1484
01:04:35,219 --> 01:04:41,399
regulation come they will be ready they

1485
01:04:37,798 --> 01:04:44,579
will be already there right so so why

1486
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:46,559
has cookies been able to expand so

1487
01:04:44,579 --> 01:04:48,298
rapidly as something that's in our head

1488
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:51,000
which is a very good question it's

1489
01:04:48,298 --> 01:04:53,338
because then use a licensing mod this

1490
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:55,679
goes to Mike's corn about rib

1491
01:04:53,338 --> 01:04:57,239
cookies there are some exceptions to

1492
01:04:55,679 --> 01:04:59,639
what I'm going to say but cookies

1493
01:04:57,239 --> 01:05:02,159
doesn't aluminance cultivation cookies

1494
01:04:59,639 --> 01:05:05,818
doesn't have its own licenses cookies

1495
01:05:02,159 --> 01:05:09,719
doesn't own its stores cookies just

1496
01:05:05,818 --> 01:05:12,058
licenses that need and puts requirements

1497
01:05:09,719 --> 01:05:13,919
in plates and yes I get your exceptions

1498
01:05:12,059 --> 01:05:16,260
to that rule but that's how they've been

1499
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:18,000
able to expand so rapidly so to

1500
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:19,680
everyone's Point here is they've

1501
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,298
developed a Lifestyle brand they've

1502
01:05:19,679 --> 01:05:23,578
developed the brand does that brand

1503
01:05:21,298 --> 01:05:25,679
start on the streets sure it does you

1504
01:05:23,579 --> 01:05:27,000
have to go to the consumers right you

1505
01:05:25,679 --> 01:05:28,798
have to go to the consumers and of

1506
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,599
course the other thing about cannabis

1507
01:05:28,798 --> 01:05:33,119
because especially what they're looking

1508
01:05:30,599 --> 01:05:35,338
at intellectual property laws IP laws

1509
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:38,640
whether there's a copy Mark copyrights

1510
01:05:35,338 --> 01:05:41,639
trademarks or other forms of patents

1511
01:05:38,639 --> 01:05:45,440
um a lot of those laws don't necessarily

1512
01:05:41,639 --> 01:05:48,179
allow protection of certain cannabis

1513
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:49,858
IP be chosen the fact that it's

1514
01:05:48,179 --> 01:05:52,618
federally illegal in the United States

1515
01:05:49,858 --> 01:05:54,719
and not exactly believable or strictly

1516
01:05:52,619 --> 01:05:56,818
in most other the jurisdictions so it's

1517
01:05:54,719 --> 01:05:59,399
hard to protect those things but I do

1518
01:05:56,818 --> 01:06:01,858
think that this is the low-hanging fruit

1519
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:04,440
so to speak the initial stages of the

1520
01:06:01,858 --> 01:06:06,838
industry are how do you attract existing

1521
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:09,720
cannabis users away from the illicit

1522
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:11,880
Market into the regulated commercial

1523
01:06:09,719 --> 01:06:14,459
market for tax generation otherwise

1524
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:17,700
that's step one then step two becomes

1525
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:19,559
how do you attract new users how do you

1526
01:06:17,699 --> 01:06:21,358
sub classify users and make a more

1527
01:06:19,559 --> 01:06:23,460
sophisticated product a more

1528
01:06:21,358 --> 01:06:25,619
sophisticated brand for someone who does

1529
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:27,659
want to identified with the person on

1530
01:06:25,619 --> 01:06:29,460
the street that's the cookies culture

1531
01:06:27,659 --> 01:06:30,659
for example all of these things are

1532
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:32,159
evolving and it's really really

1533
01:06:30,659 --> 01:06:35,058
interesting to watch

1534
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:35,058
um not even another question

1535
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:39,318
how did that

1536
01:06:40,858 --> 01:06:45,659
good morning

1537
01:06:42,539 --> 01:06:48,720
great problem just uh how to be nayser

1538
01:06:45,659 --> 01:06:51,358
but the the statement that both should

1539
01:06:48,719 --> 01:06:53,879
rest still or any file Alcatel on me how

1540
01:06:51,358 --> 01:06:56,338
tobacco that's their fat model issue how

1541
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:57,119
to fly that's

1542
01:06:56,338 --> 01:07:01,078
um

1543
01:06:57,119 --> 01:07:03,660
that's enough research absolutely what

1544
01:07:01,079 --> 01:07:05,579
the copper is this number one you see in

1545
01:07:03,659 --> 01:07:08,399
tobacco it's hidden more and more

1546
01:07:05,579 --> 01:07:09,960
restricted to the point where even they

1547
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:12,780
think which should not the Bible just

1548
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:16,500
make me is now being you know really

1549
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:19,440
anti is very attack out of the looks the

1550
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:22,139
big house nicotine countries such a

1551
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:23,940
prismatic bubble they didn't have a real

1552
01:07:22,139 --> 01:07:27,179
politically double covered from the

1553
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:29,519
armpitas so and the other issue helped

1554
01:07:27,179 --> 01:07:31,798
them out the beauticians team carried up

1555
01:07:29,519 --> 01:07:34,440
want is that they regulated you for

1556
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:36,838
about orbit Health Focus so to say hey

1557
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:39,420
where have we got a rock but I thought

1558
01:07:36,838 --> 01:07:41,279
maybe we're pursue it gets too

1559
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:43,559
normalized and maybe we have this

1560
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:46,140
restrict alcohol too and the bottlene

1561
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:48,599
grant risk and public health is around

1562
01:07:46,139 --> 01:07:50,400
that restriction of alcohol when you see

1563
01:07:48,599 --> 01:07:53,720
it across world and Hamlet is a pretty

1564
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:53,720
simple where for example

1565
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:59,280
destroyed by capitalist dried Collision

1566
01:07:56,219 --> 01:08:01,919
skit cattle they tell the scores they

1567
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:06,059
hit go outer knife style around it is

1568
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:08,818
versus illegal upon a camera you know

1569
01:08:06,059 --> 01:08:10,260
formalizations did is to be mad so this

1570
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:13,739
walking very very careful around this

1571
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:16,440
idea of this state regulation from other

1572
01:08:13,739 --> 01:08:18,659
risket clouds

1573
01:08:16,439 --> 01:08:20,579
and a lot of that goes on as well that

1574
01:08:18,659 --> 01:08:22,858
goes to this notion that the regulations

1575
01:08:20,579 --> 01:08:25,500
prohibit advertising and jurisdictions

1576
01:08:22,859 --> 01:08:28,980
are severely limited uh and they they

1577
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:30,420
prevent what a they store to do as the

1578
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:32,759
treats it differently than any other

1579
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:34,859
store and you can't just go out and

1580
01:08:32,759 --> 01:08:36,659
advertise and Market it in brand

1581
01:08:34,859 --> 01:08:38,940
um so it was about your points are very

1582
01:08:36,659 --> 01:08:40,920
little to you uh does that know what

1583
01:08:38,939 --> 01:08:44,238
happened please feel free to keep asking

1584
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:44,239
questions with yes sir

1585
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:06,719
dispensaries so and we agree this is the

1586
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:08,520
case in the CBD Market where there's

1587
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:11,338
groupies out there your consensus having

1588
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:13,500
problems which supported detained CBD in

1589
01:09:11,338 --> 01:09:17,039
a very little and air he's eat that to

1590
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:19,560
be combated and then resolves industry

1591
01:09:17,039 --> 01:09:21,479
run across the the social consumer has

1592
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:23,460
the balance in the products and they're

1593
01:09:21,479 --> 01:09:25,318
just not going to buy it

1594
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:26,880
yeah I'll come and that's about to jump

1595
01:09:25,319 --> 01:09:29,699
in here but when I would tell you this I

1596
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:32,100
would say that the uh yes in the

1597
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:34,619
marijuana industry it's in your interest

1598
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:36,900
to produce the highest potency product

1599
01:09:34,619 --> 01:09:40,798
at the lowest price point because that

1600
01:09:36,899 --> 01:09:44,939
is the basic marketplace right now but

1601
01:09:40,798 --> 01:09:47,939
one of the reasons why Delta 8 hhc these

1602
01:09:44,939 --> 01:09:50,479
have derived intoxicates are thriving in

1603
01:09:47,939 --> 01:09:52,919
the U.S and around the world is because

1604
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:56,218
consumers don't want

1605
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:58,859
to get this High consumers don't like

1606
01:09:56,219 --> 01:10:00,960
paranoia consumers don't want to walk

1607
01:09:58,859 --> 01:10:03,299
into a dispensary they want something

1608
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:06,300
that's more like a glass of wine versus

1609
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:08,340
a shot of whiskey so there's a major

1610
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:10,800
difference out there in terms of

1611
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:13,079
consumer behavior and you have to figure

1612
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:14,600
out what your Market is but would you

1613
01:10:13,079 --> 01:10:16,859
care to elaborate on that a little bit

1614
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:20,280
so that

1615
01:10:16,859 --> 01:10:22,139
it depends to find the market and the

1616
01:10:20,279 --> 01:10:25,019
and the rape and story structure in

1617
01:10:22,140 --> 01:10:27,539
terms of testing too high or testing too

1618
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:30,620
little and Turks and THC content because

1619
01:10:27,539 --> 01:10:35,519
in the market in some states

1620
01:10:30,619 --> 01:10:38,279
that you get more price per pound per

1621
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:41,159
ounce per gram for a higher THC the

1622
01:10:38,279 --> 01:10:43,559
product and so there's testing inflation

1623
01:10:41,158 --> 01:10:45,119
that's occurring because you know you

1624
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:48,600
want your brand to have the highest

1625
01:10:45,119 --> 01:10:50,698
amount of CHC and then at other states

1626
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:53,699
where and jurisdictions where they're

1627
01:10:50,698 --> 01:10:56,579
testing on the percentage of THC then

1628
01:10:53,698 --> 01:10:59,939
there's that incense it for those to be

1629
01:10:56,579 --> 01:11:03,920
lower now when you think of policy

1630
01:10:59,939 --> 01:11:06,539
around Taz what does tax do it either

1631
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:10,079
incentivizes or subsidizes something to

1632
01:11:06,539 --> 01:11:12,840
do uh to do something more or it

1633
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:15,960
punishes to do something less like you

1634
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:18,420
hide taxes on cigarettes uh produced

1635
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:21,600
less consumption so right now there's

1636
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:24,480
not a really good strategy on how to tax

1637
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:26,760
this because they the The Regulators and

1638
01:11:24,479 --> 01:11:28,919
the tax policy makers really don't know

1639
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:31,079
what they want out of this they just

1640
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:34,079
want the money right and so they don't

1641
01:11:31,079 --> 01:11:36,719
have effective strategies yet

1642
01:11:34,079 --> 01:11:39,179
um on you know what is the purpose of

1643
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:41,760
all of this right and so they're they're

1644
01:11:39,179 --> 01:11:45,960
creating distortions in the market uh

1645
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:47,940
and then like I said on the uh on the

1646
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:50,340
CPE side

1647
01:11:47,939 --> 01:11:53,039
um you know that's been in the United

1648
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:56,699
States at least relatively unregulated

1649
01:11:53,039 --> 01:11:59,039
so there hasn't been any labeling truth

1650
01:11:56,698 --> 01:12:02,158
and label truth and products or anything

1651
01:11:59,039 --> 01:12:04,979
like that so there's groups out there

1652
01:12:02,158 --> 01:12:07,738
that that test and rigorously test their

1653
01:12:04,979 --> 01:12:09,899
Fridays I'm in summons subscribers six

1654
01:12:07,738 --> 01:12:12,059
times throughout the process and then

1655
01:12:09,899 --> 01:12:14,819
there's others that barely tested at all

1656
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:16,800
if that if at all and so you've got

1657
01:12:14,819 --> 01:12:19,198
because of the lack of Regulation and

1658
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:21,000
oversight you've got this Market out

1659
01:12:19,198 --> 01:12:22,799
there that's kind of out of the Wild

1660
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,020
West it's a peripheral

1661
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:29,039
and so a lot of the

1662
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:31,320
um the hemp deride cannabinoid producers

1663
01:12:29,039 --> 01:12:33,600
and suppliers and retailers they

1664
01:12:31,319 --> 01:12:35,099
actually want to be regulated

1665
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:37,440
um but just like you said you just don't

1666
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:40,980
want to be too regulated or regulated

1667
01:12:37,439 --> 01:12:42,719
like a schedule one truck you know so uh

1668
01:12:40,979 --> 01:12:45,059
so it just depends upon what the

1669
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:46,579
objective is and when the market is as

1670
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:49,560
to whether or not you're going to see

1671
01:12:46,579 --> 01:12:51,658
inflation and met testing or deflation

1672
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:54,659
of the testing and the like

1673
01:12:51,658 --> 01:12:54,658
question

1674
01:12:56,460 --> 01:13:01,880
writing about regular special

1675
01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:05,399
take evidence

1676
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:06,980
she kind of bow was going on currently

1677
01:13:05,399 --> 01:13:09,539
then that the church

1678
01:13:06,979 --> 01:13:12,299
there's a big house of lay awesome the

1679
01:13:09,539 --> 01:13:14,300
major three zero in with about

1680
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:14,300
um

1681
01:13:16,039 --> 01:13:21,859
the microphone you know going to this

1682
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:21,860
period in Salvation

1683
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:27,900
we're going to be some you know players

1684
01:13:25,319 --> 01:13:30,238
that are going to drive through boothy

1685
01:13:27,899 --> 01:13:32,599
that is getting down during the Denver's

1686
01:13:30,238 --> 01:13:32,599
industry

1687
01:13:32,899 --> 01:13:37,019
going to come from

1688
01:13:35,279 --> 01:13:38,819
you think you know who's going to be the

1689
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:41,100
most aggressive type players do you

1690
01:13:38,819 --> 01:13:44,698
think would be you know big tobacco

1691
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:47,699
Pharma uh big alcohol perhaps uh Equity

1692
01:13:44,698 --> 01:13:49,259
firms uh what are your thoughts and and

1693
01:13:47,698 --> 01:13:51,119
because we're running out of time here

1694
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:52,560
I'd like everybody to sort of hit this

1695
01:13:51,119 --> 01:13:54,300
question and we can sort of round this

1696
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:56,039
out that that works

1697
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:57,840
um I'll tell you that like I just wrote

1698
01:13:56,039 --> 01:13:59,819
an article later in a first call I wrote

1699
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:01,739
an article in force where I compare the

1700
01:13:59,819 --> 01:14:03,119
first 10 years of the tech industry to

1701
01:14:01,738 --> 01:14:05,099
the first 10 years in the Cannabis

1702
01:14:03,119 --> 01:14:08,039
industry and IT addresses some of these

1703
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:09,960
points uh but think of this when the

1704
01:14:08,039 --> 01:14:13,198
bubble burst at the tech and the tech

1705
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:15,658
Boogle we didn't know who Google was we

1706
01:14:13,198 --> 01:14:17,879
nibble that is on was those things

1707
01:14:15,658 --> 01:14:19,559
didn't exist at that time so those

1708
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:21,719
people after 10 years of the decade

1709
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:23,880
usually went this is over it's all over

1710
01:14:21,719 --> 01:14:25,560
all of these people who's going to be

1711
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:27,239
the winner or the losers the point is

1712
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:28,980
you'll know the winners and the losers

1713
01:14:27,238 --> 01:14:31,500
are going to be in Canada because

1714
01:14:28,979 --> 01:14:34,339
everyone has to keep trying and it's way

1715
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:37,619
too soon in my business

1716
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:40,619
iron Sage she found that the wiener will

1717
01:14:37,619 --> 01:14:42,079
be down at Company

1718
01:14:40,619 --> 01:14:45,439
cool

1719
01:14:42,079 --> 01:14:48,479
achieves to integrate

1720
01:14:45,439 --> 01:14:52,379
social versions of Liberty

1721
01:14:48,479 --> 01:14:54,479
uh Excellence marketing strategy

1722
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:57,539
this company needs to be one of the

1723
01:14:54,479 --> 01:15:00,839
first ones because as we think with

1724
01:14:57,539 --> 01:15:03,119
example cookies I argument in these

1725
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:04,260
arguments but there are one of the first

1726
01:15:03,119 --> 01:15:08,279
ones

1727
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:10,020
and uh this company needs to see

1728
01:15:08,279 --> 01:15:13,979
what

1729
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:16,620
under what uh we're being through in

1730
01:15:13,979 --> 01:15:17,979
other markets in order to repeat those

1731
01:15:16,619 --> 01:15:19,579
mistakes right

1732
01:15:17,979 --> 01:15:22,259
[Music]

1733
01:15:19,579 --> 01:15:23,698
these needs to be arrested these

1734
01:15:22,260 --> 01:15:26,940
ruptique company

1735
01:15:23,698 --> 01:15:31,819
which is believed by

1736
01:15:26,939 --> 01:15:31,819
by new and German

1737
01:15:32,179 --> 01:15:39,539
Minds boiler all the tires listening to

1738
01:15:36,479 --> 01:15:42,479
the folders and uh and and learning

1739
01:15:39,539 --> 01:15:44,399
about the others you know but uh

1740
01:15:42,479 --> 01:15:46,738
Kennedy's these are these this ruptic

1741
01:15:44,399 --> 01:15:48,539
Market in in all our around the world

1742
01:15:46,738 --> 01:15:51,299
and this is the reason why we are here

1743
01:15:48,539 --> 01:15:54,658
so I know

1744
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:56,820
I I think the ones are in Dubai to can

1745
01:15:54,658 --> 01:15:58,379
succeed are going to need the ones that

1746
01:15:56,819 --> 01:16:00,960
have been managed good you know many

1747
01:15:58,380 --> 01:16:03,719
people forget that astique jobs you know

1748
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:05,760
started apple and built up into a

1749
01:16:03,719 --> 01:16:08,698
billion dollar company and then he was

1750
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:12,900
fired by the board because great

1751
01:16:08,698 --> 01:16:14,879
Visionary but not an executed NBA you

1752
01:16:12,899 --> 01:16:17,460
know to run a billion dollar Enterprise

1753
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:20,039
and many of these stand-up these are

1754
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:22,319
being grounded by inexperienced people

1755
01:16:20,039 --> 01:16:24,658
and and that's going to be changing it

1756
01:16:22,319 --> 01:16:26,698
and we're seeing it now where Ford War

1757
01:16:24,658 --> 01:16:28,379
uh people from the food and beverage

1758
01:16:26,698 --> 01:16:31,019
industry are coming into the market

1759
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:33,719
they're demanding first like Horrors to

1760
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:36,000
produce data analytics for them to say

1761
01:16:33,719 --> 01:16:38,158
how much is this product selling Thing

1762
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:40,380
Worth am I making money on this what's

1763
01:16:38,158 --> 01:16:44,639
my margin you know but what's my

1764
01:16:40,380 --> 01:16:46,560
inventory what's my uh all these things

1765
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:48,719
that they need to know about their

1766
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:51,000
company in order to run it you know

1767
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:52,439
efficiently and I think those the ones

1768
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,300
that are going to succeed along with the

1769
01:16:52,439 --> 01:16:56,819
ones that have access to council because

1770
01:16:54,300 --> 01:17:01,140
right now it's very difficult for

1771
01:16:56,819 --> 01:17:03,479
gambler's companies to obtain gecko when

1772
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:06,719
you can go ahead and invest in a Fortune

1773
01:17:03,479 --> 01:17:09,839
500 companies right now that

1774
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:12,899
down from their historic High stock

1775
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:14,819
plates so I think that that's with two

1776
01:17:12,899 --> 01:17:18,059
things that are gonna you know outline

1777
01:17:14,819 --> 01:17:21,779
of this you know in the next 10 years

1778
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:25,080
I've said in uh for years now that and

1779
01:17:21,779 --> 01:17:26,698
that redefining factors in the Canada

1780
01:17:25,079 --> 01:17:28,380
space will be

1781
01:17:26,698 --> 01:17:31,619
branding

1782
01:17:28,380 --> 01:17:33,840
scale and Supply Chain management and so

1783
01:17:31,619 --> 01:17:36,238
if you can manage your brand get your

1784
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:39,060
brand out there if you can scale it out

1785
01:17:36,238 --> 01:17:41,519
if you can manage your costs to where

1786
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:44,640
you're we're made profitable then you're

1787
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:46,980
going to be successful in this case uh

1788
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:50,539
with respect to the jobs and the layoffs

1789
01:17:46,979 --> 01:17:53,399
is to me is a natural flow

1790
01:17:50,539 --> 01:17:55,198
what cannabis represents as an industry

1791
01:17:53,399 --> 01:18:00,179
in heck of Alliance is called an

1792
01:17:55,198 --> 01:18:02,698
entrepreneurial events and so there's an

1793
01:18:00,179 --> 01:18:05,520
opportunity to achieve higher than

1794
01:18:02,698 --> 01:18:07,979
normal profits and when you achieve

1795
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:10,199
those and everybody wants in and so

1796
01:18:07,979 --> 01:18:12,899
you've seen some people early on that

1797
01:18:10,198 --> 01:18:15,839
had the problems but then everybody

1798
01:18:12,899 --> 01:18:18,420
jumped in and took all the profits out

1799
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:20,460
um and so what um what results from that

1800
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:23,100
when everybody enters in this it drives

1801
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:26,520
down a drop ability and it drives down

1802
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:29,880
your margins and then dead thinks

1803
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:31,520
consolidate so you know there's this you

1804
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:35,039
know period of

1805
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:36,840
multi-phases of of uh expansion and

1806
01:18:35,039 --> 01:18:38,819
consolidation expansion consolidation

1807
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:41,760
and I think that we're just in the

1808
01:18:38,819 --> 01:18:45,059
earlier phases of this right now and

1809
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:47,100
then uh I'm producing a Joshua court and

1810
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:50,340
uh this and conjunction with Leafly

1811
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:53,340
every year we co-author Joshua fork and

1812
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:56,579
what we're seeing is that a similar to

1813
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:59,940
what occurred in Canada out of early on

1814
01:18:56,579 --> 01:19:03,420
with this expansion and installed

1815
01:18:59,939 --> 01:19:05,819
capacity for production capabilities and

1816
01:19:03,420 --> 01:19:07,380
the light you saw that a bit with the

1817
01:19:05,819 --> 01:19:09,599
multi-state operators of the United

1818
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:12,119
States where they wanted to go into

1819
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:13,280
these new larfix between that the demand

1820
01:19:12,119 --> 01:19:18,238
will grow

1821
01:19:13,279 --> 01:19:20,279
and they installed the capacity but now

1822
01:19:18,238 --> 01:19:22,158
realizing that there's been a little bit

1823
01:19:20,279 --> 01:19:26,460
of a reset in the market

1824
01:19:22,158 --> 01:19:28,738
they don't mean to hire us to staff that

1825
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:32,219
capacity and so they're they're just

1826
01:19:28,738 --> 01:19:35,158
laying in weight but meanwhile because

1827
01:19:32,219 --> 01:19:37,859
the market is it is starting to compress

1828
01:19:35,158 --> 01:19:39,839
from a margin perspective and they are

1829
01:19:37,859 --> 01:19:41,639
started starting to have to cut costs

1830
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:43,319
and so

1831
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:48,420
um we're seeing that there were jobs

1832
01:19:43,319 --> 01:19:50,639
added in 2022 but there was a lot they

1833
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:53,399
wouldn't add it more but I did not been

1834
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:55,500
for the layoffs and other downsizing

1835
01:19:53,399 --> 01:19:58,738
approaches as large of MSS

1836
01:19:55,500 --> 01:20:01,698
okay if I do some job but thank you to a

1837
01:19:58,738 --> 01:20:01,698
wonderful people

1838
01:20:03,319 --> 01:20:08,719
with me and we're going to complete this

1839
01:20:06,119 --> 01:20:08,719
first session
