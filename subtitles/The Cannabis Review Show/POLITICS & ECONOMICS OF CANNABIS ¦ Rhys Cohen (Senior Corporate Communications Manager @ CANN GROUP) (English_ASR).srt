30
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,320
funnily enough so i got started in

31
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:11,920
cannabis in 2015 i did my honours thesis

32
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:13,679
in the politics and economics of

33
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,439
cannabis legalization with a focus on

34
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,799
colorado at the time

35
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:18,158
medicinal cannabis got legalized in

36
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,080
australia just a few months after i

37
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,320
finished my degree so i started calling

38
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:24,400
myself a consultant and built myself a

39
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:27,039
website and sort of went from there i've

40
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,040
had a few uh uh different incarnations

41
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,360

42
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,560

martin at cannabis and i was very sad to

53
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,000

their senior corporate communications

00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:00,399
manager so uh talking and writing and

57
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,079
working on a bit of commercial strategy

58
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,399
as well that's kind of the

59
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:06,158
overview perfect so a complete in-depth

60
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,080
knowledge you seem to have of australia

61
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,239
the topics i wanted to talk to you today

62
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,959
about first and foremost was the

63
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,520
politics and economics of cannabis in

64
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,400
terms of the politics in australia did

65
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,719
you find that the right-wing side or the

66
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,159
of the government were against the

67
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:23,840
legalization of cannabis and it was the

68
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:25,840
democrats in the greens shall we say

69
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,759
driving the initiative forward and do

70
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,959
you see that as a is that the same

71
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:30,159
template that you see around the world

72
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,159
are you starting to see the right

73
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,680
leaning parties swing into the cannabis

74
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,039
industry a lot more

75
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,640
it's interesting i mean clearly that's

76
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,400
very different conversations to be had

77
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,559
about medicinal versus non-medicinal

78
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,080
cannabis and the politics around that so

79
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,439
medical cannabis was legalized in

80
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,080
australia under a conservative

81
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:48,719
government in 2016.

82
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,760
but it had unanimous political support

83
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:51,919
from

84
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:54,399
every party of every political spectrum

85
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:56,639
no one in australia who's in politics

86
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,920
disagrees with the legalization of

87
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:59,439
medicinal cannabis obviously there's

88
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:01,119
some dispute about how exactly it should

89
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:02,560
work in practice but it has

90
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,840
comprehensive support and that's

91
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,239
reflected in the general population as

92
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,640
well probably up around 85 90 of the

93
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,000
australians support medicinal cannabis

94
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,719
when we're talking about non-medical

95
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,318
cannabis popular support is closer to 50

96
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:15,598
of australians think that cannabis

97
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:17,119
should be legalized for non-medical

98
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:19,199
purposes but once again it depends how

99
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,959
you how you ask the questions in the

100
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,359
surveys so to speak

101
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,719
and at the moment neither major party uh

102
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,440
supports any change to cannabis policy

103
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:31,840
and it is like you say the parties uh

104
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:33,519
further to the left the greens and and

105
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,680
the reason party and other left-wing

106
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,439
parties that support such a move as well

107
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,439
as the hardcore libertarians which we

108
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,919
tend to associate more with the right

109
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:44,239
wing of politics and that sort of

110
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:46,719
weird coalition of

111
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,239
left-wing far left-wing politics and and

112
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:50,080
hardcore libertarians is something that

113
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,519
we see in many other places around the

114
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,439
world you know particular colorado and

115
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,039
many u.s states as well there's been an

116
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:56,719
unholy marriage of those political

117
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:59,438
forces that have pushed through

118
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:01,120
non-medical legalization um

119
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:02,959
but it's not uh you know further

120
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,400
cannabis law reform in australia is not

121
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,560
really a topic a big topic of

122
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,200
conversation although we had our federal

123
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,799
elections uh over the weekend and it was

124
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:12,719
encouraging and or interesting at least

125
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,560
to see that the legalized cannabis party

126
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,919
at grassroots movements with no real

127
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,478
sort of resources to put into

128
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:21,358
campaigning uh managed to get nearly

129
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:23,439
seven percent of the senate vote in the

130
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,359
state of queensland and between two and

131
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:27,360
four percent of the senate vote in our

132
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,840
other states and territories as well so

133
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,360
um it's maybe becoming more of a

134
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:32,399
political issue but we'll have to wait

135
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,560
and see

136
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:36,319
okay so seven percent would have to be a

137
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,240
a good chunk of change of voters that

138
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:39,918
would actually go out of their way to to

139
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,439
give their number one vote to a party

140
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:42,879
dedicated specifically just cannabis

141
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:45,040
legalization

142
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,199
yeah it's pretty significant and

143
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,160
what was interesting to me in particular

144
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,160
was that

145
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,479
it it was queensland was the standout

146
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,960
state and what we know about queensland

147
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:57,839
with regards to cannabis is that about

148
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:59,439
50 of all of the approvals to prescribe

149
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:01,758
medicinal cannabis in australia are

150
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:03,600
currently issued by prescribers based in

151
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,360
queensland so we're not quite sure if

152
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,800
that also correlates to patients because

153
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,160
people get prescribed across straight

154
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,360
lines and that's becoming more and more

155
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,520
common and we don't really know where

156
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,120
the patients are but the prescribers and

157
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:15,279
the clinic networks and the pharmacy

158
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,360
networks that they are that they work

159
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:19,359
within are based in queensland so

160
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,360
something's in the water

161
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,000
okay so basically in terms of the

162
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,080
medical industry you've got let's say 70

163
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,439
80 favorability but when it gets down to

164
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:29,439
recreational it seems to be around that

165
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:31,038
50 mark seems to be the kind of magic

166
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:33,439
number worldwide where it was new

167
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:35,120
zealand's uh legislation that they had

168
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:38,160
it would be the same over in europe to a

169
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:42,000
degree and do you see that number

170
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:44,000
shifting with the the economics that the

171
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,439
medical industry is providing for

172
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,038
australia are they starting to see a

173
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:48,000
little bit of uh income come into the

174
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:50,719
government where they're like actually

175
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,959
hold on a minute we'd like 5x or 8x this

176
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,320
kind of revenue for our tax covers

177
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:56,159
potentially i mean look at the medical

178
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,560
industry is growing really rapidly you

179
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,439
know best estimates suggest that last

180
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,759
year the industry made maybe 200 million

181
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:05,600
dollars worth of revenue

182
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,479
this year it'll probably at least double

183
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,759
so the money's coming in whether that is

184
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:11,918
what's changing people's hearts and

185
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,319
minds i'm not so sure about if you look

186
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:17,519
at popular support for non-medical

187
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,120
legalization over time it has increased

188
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,519
you know a couple of percentage points

189
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,240
every year for many years

190
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:24,079
so

191
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,960
that which you know predates medical

192
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:28,639
legalization so maybe it has more to do

193
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:31,680
with the reduction in stigma and the

194
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,519
normalization of cannabis um

195
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,000
uh instead yeah

196
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:37,680
more so than people seeing uh dollar

197
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,800
signs in their eyes because you know

198
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,199
there is an opportunity here there's a

199
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,520
commercial opportunity but it's it's not

200
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,639
easy work and it's not you know

201
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:48,799
enormously profitable right off the bat

202
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,960
yeah i think the r d that needs to be

203
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,720
put into this industry uh

204
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:54,000
will scare a lot of companies away when

205
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,840
you see the kind of capital how

206
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,120
extensive it is how quickly the cash

207
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:58,318
burn rate can be in some of these

208
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,840
companies

209
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,680
yeah it gets pretty real pretty quick so

210
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,839
you know can group that i'm now part of

211
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,680
you know we're we're we've just finished

212
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:07,519
the first stage of a really massive

213
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,959
construction project for our sort of

214
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,279
vertically integrated cultivation and

215
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:12,959
manufacturing facility in australia and

216
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:15,119
the cost of that's i think somewhere

217
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:18,399
around 120 million at the moment you

218
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,000
know we also just uh earlier this year

219
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:21,679
launched a full

220
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,240
phase three placebo controlled

221
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,160
randomized clinical trial to investigate

222
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,400
our proprietary

223
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,319
cbd capsule product to investigate

224
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:31,918
whether it can help people with sleep

225
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,039
disturbance and which obviously we're

226
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,038
trying to get that into the

227
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:37,120
over-the-counter cbd uh channel in

228
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:39,519
australia so you know if you only took

229
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,800
those two expenses uh that'd be more

230
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,560
than most cannabis companies are

231
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,759
prepared to put into anything and then

232
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,759
of course there's all the money that

233
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:49,038
we've spent over the years on um staff

234
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:51,038
you know r d um developing new um new

235
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:52,959
genetic lines and our cultivars et

236
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:54,719
cetera et cetera so it's not it's not

237
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:56,318
for the faint of heart

238
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,680
yeah well i think if you have the

239
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,039
overview of the industry that's the one

240
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,598
place australia you can see is the

241
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:03,439
genetics and look and the specific uh

242
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:05,598
seed types that you guys can create and

243
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:07,279
then export all over the world is going

244
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:09,439
to be the money maker i think from that

245
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:11,038
territory i think i think i think well

246
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:12,399
yeah two places where i think will play

247
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:13,598
really well one is at the plant end of

248
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:15,359
the spectrum like you say because

249
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:16,959
australia you know we're

250
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,439
we're a banana republic you know all we

251
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:21,758
do is is dig up and send and send out

252
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:25,120
coal and we do primary produce really

253
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,759
well so you know wheat cotton rice we

254
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,399
put as a country a lot of money and a

255
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,240
lot of focus over a lot of years into

256
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:34,319
improving um

257
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,120
those sorts of crops and so we have this

258
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,879
great

259
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,918
r d machinery that can now be put

260
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:40,000
towards

261
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:41,519
cannabis and the cannabis plant itself

262
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,879
so we're really accelerating some

263
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,320
progress there in some really exciting

264
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:46,480
ways so that's the first one and the

265
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,000
second one would be at the pointy end at

266
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,720
the clinical end because we do punch

267
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,919
above our weight globally in terms of um

268
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,639
in terms of clinical trials in

269
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:56,240
particular it's comparatively quite

270
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:58,720
quick and easy to conduct clinical

271
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,360
trials in australia compared to the us

272
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,040
or europe and our regulatory standards

273
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,200
for therapeutic goods and for clinical

274
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:06,799
research are at a level where um you

275
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,839
know it's uh it's not like doing a

276
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:12,159
clinical trial in in um uh like in a

277
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,920
country whom i won't disparage as an

278
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:15,360
example but you know we are comparable

279
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:17,759
in terms of the quality of research that

280
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,120
we do with uh with um north america and

281
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:20,958
europe

282
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,039
amazing the next topic i wanted to jump

283
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:24,639
onto is industry analysis now i know

284
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:26,559
you've got a lot of expertise in this

285
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:29,120
can you maybe give everybody let's say

286
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:30,559
two good sources that you think are uh

287
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,159
places where you can see good

288
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:33,679
interesting analysis because as we

289
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,199
talked just before coming on there's a

290
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:36,879
lot of places that are just literally

291
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,720
seem to be making up numbers to tell

292
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:41,600
each other how great this industry could

293
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,200
possibly be whereas a real financial

294
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,040
breakdown analysis of some of these

295
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,278
sectors would not deliver the numbers

296
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:49,439
that some of these guys are producing

297
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:51,439
yeah i guess it depends what you mean by

298
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,680
industry analysis and which industry so

299
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,800
like in australia for example

300
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:56,639
there are very few sources of

301
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:59,120
information one

302
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:01,600
um has been fresh leaf analytics the

303
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,879
other i would say in terms of cannabis

304
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,959
coverage would be cannabis

305
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:08,159
i think they do exceptional coverage

306
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:10,078
obviously i would say that i'm

307
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,159
conflicted but i really recommend that

308
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:13,039
you check them out um what i'm excited

309
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:16,399
about

310
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:18,719
actually is more mainstream pharma

311
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,480
business intelligence companies

312
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,320
starting to service medicinal cannabis

313
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,519
companies so we're seeing that now like

314
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,959
you know companies that have been set up

315
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,519
they've been monitoring

316
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:29,278
say for example retail sales of

317
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,959
medicines through pharmacies in

318
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:32,639
australia for

319
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,399
big pharma companies in order to provide

320
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:35,838
them with insights they're now also

321
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,879
capturing information on medicinal

322
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:41,440
cannabis products and you know it's a

323
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:43,200
classic cannabis thing right to to

324
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,680
assume that you need to build a cannabis

325
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,440
specific solution for a problem from the

326
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:48,719
ground up well in actual fact people are

327
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,480
doing this sort of stuff all the time

328
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,000
already for other industries and there's

329
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,320
an opportunity to piggyback off it

330
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,078
globally though i would say you know mj

331
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,040
biz obviously

332
00:10:56,078 --> 00:10:58,799
and

333
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:02,480
i think prohibition partners have been

334
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:04,319
getting a lot better um but

335
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,000
but the challenge is

336
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,839
you know all forecasts are wrong some

337
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,240
forecasts are

338
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,240
useful

339
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,559
this this industry is still really a uh

340
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:19,519
you know uh how long's a piece of string

341
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:22,239
operation so i i try as best i can and

342
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,560
avoid forecasting out any longer term

343
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,720
than 12 months you know

344
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,319
yeah no i agree i think the golf or the

345
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,079
campus industry is almost like a golf

346
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,600
shot at the moment you can think you're

347
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:33,359
going to hit the same shot it might look

348
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,959
like the exact same shot but the chances

349
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,639
have you been able to replicate the

350
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:38,479
exact same shot over and over again

351
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,799
pretty much

352
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:44,639
but as a general piece of advice i'd say

353
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:47,120
like the the the more i the the sources

354
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,639
and the forecasts that i trust the most

355
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,200
are the ones that are the most

356
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:54,240
transparent and the most comprehensive

357
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:57,278
in uh disclosing their methodology

358
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,600
you know you can have a a wild forecast

359
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:00,958
that's you know out of left field maybe

360
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,639
it's too conservative or people think

361
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:04,399
it's too ambitious but so long as you've

362
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,519
got your methodology and you're explicit

363
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,759
about it

364
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,759
people can argue with the methodology um

365
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:11,600
and that's a fine argument to have

366
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:13,120
arguing with the end number is kind of

367
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,920
pointless unless you're actually talking

368
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,078
about

369
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:18,399
the nuts and bolts

370
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:19,919
yeah i agree with you and last topic

371
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,440
before i let you go i just wanted to get

372
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:23,199
a quick little overview of everybody of

373
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,600
australia that some people who might not

374
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,240
know the industry and understand it it's

375
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,000
medical only now recreational a couple

376
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,240
of the leading companies that you see do

377
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,759
you see europe being an actual realistic

378
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,360
market for australian companies because

379
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,519
we see little green farm up in denmark

380
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,278
at the moment some supply the german

381
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,959
industry but at the same time we've got

382
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:44,000
all the canadian companies supplying the

383
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:45,119
german industry and not to not to burst

384
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,879
our bubble but there's going to be

385
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,799
german companies who are going to supply

386
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:50,159
the german industry so how do you see

387
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:52,799
that playing out

388
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:54,480
yeah totally i mean look we we've got

389
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:56,240
our own situation here at the moment in

390
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,240
terms of oversupply

391
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,600
you know there's uh over 300 products

392
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,360
that are available to be prescribed in

393
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,839
australia at the moment most of those

394
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,320
are imported from overseas many of those

395
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,320
are of questionable uh quality and

396
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,000
compliance standards what i'm really

397
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,959
excited about is earlier this year the

398
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,958
australian government

399
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,919
implemented new rules they'll go into

400
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:18,000
effect

401
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:18,719
in about 12 months time

402
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,399
but

403
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,480
from june

404
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,480
next year we are going to require all

405
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,240
products that are imported to australia

406
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,399
to be manufactured to the same quality

407
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,959
standards as products that are made here

408
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:34,000
and australia is um a signatory to the

409
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:35,679
um to the international sort of gmp uh

410
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,039
the pigs pensions so you know we have

411
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:39,198
mutual recognition agreements in place

412
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:40,240
with germany for example any medicinal

413
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:43,439
cannabis product that's made in

414
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,879
australia um you know is already uh head

415
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,959
and shoulders above

416
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:50,320
any product that's been manufactured uh

417
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:54,799
in a gpp facility or in a gmp facility

418
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:57,360
in a non-mra country um so we will

419
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:58,879
have our you know we have a shot at at

420
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,320
exports and at servicing the

421
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,078
international market

422
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,879
we'll need more than just germany and

423
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:06,078
germany's medical market to sustain just

424
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:08,879
the australian companies that are

425
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:10,399
exporting um but you know as we see more

426
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:12,000
countries opening up and markets

427
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,679
continue to grow i think

428
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,799
you know the future of the industry is

429
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:15,679
pretty strong

430
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:17,120
um

431
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:19,039
and australia is part of that i think

432
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,000
we're you know outside of north america

433
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:25,360
there's australia germany and israel are

434
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,360
the only meaningful markets for medical

435
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,639
prescription medicinal cannabis access

436
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,039
globally and then of course there's all

437
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,480
of the cbd stuff going on in the uk um

438
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:33,919
which is a bit of a different kettle of

439
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,959
fish

440
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:36,399
yeah it's going to be an interesting

441
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:39,439
couple years now to see how all the

442
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,720
