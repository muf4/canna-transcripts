excellent i'm delighted to have you on a

12
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:28,800
matter of

13
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:30,399
many skills and talents i think you've

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,679
got to be a perfect person to have this

15
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:33,199
discussion that we're going to have

16
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:35,280
today so do you mind we want to give

17
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,600
everybody a quick little overview of how

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,280
you ended up in the cannabis space and

19
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,359
how it became kind of a

20
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,480
point of contention for you

21
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:47,600
sure yeah i um i began using cannabis

22
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:48,640
medically in 1998 when i was 16 years

23
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,760
old

24
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,920
i had been really seriously injured

25
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:56,159
and i was dealing with some

26
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,840
serious facial injuries some traumatic

27
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,038
brain injuries post-traumatic stress

28
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,640
disorder

29
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,520
but i couldn't talk to anybody about it

30
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,000
and

31
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,760
i began seeing the the sort of racist

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,840
patterns of drugs enforcement that were

33
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,040
going on in my los angeles high school

34
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,760
and neighborhood

35
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,840
and just wanted to better understand it

36
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,478
you know this thing that was helping me

37
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,200
was supposedly really super harmful and

38
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:20,640
bad and i had never heard otherwise

39
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,079
and so

40
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,840
i started digging into it and you know i

41
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:25,759
think drugs policy in general and

42
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,520
cannabis in particular it's a rabbit

43
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,439
hole that you can just kind of always

44
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:31,438
keep going down so i did work with

45
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:33,359
medical cannabis patients at the women's

46
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:34,399
alliance for medical marijuana

47
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,640
i worked with the american civil

48
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,880
liberties union for several years doing

49
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,478
drugs policy civil rights work

50
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:41,759
and then came to the uk to go to the

51
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:43,039
london school of economics where i

52
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,799
looked at

53
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,799
how the met police

54
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,159
enforce drugs law on the streets and how

55
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,159
that sort of fits in with day-to-day

56
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:54,479
policing activities and now my work

57
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,560
focuses a bit more uh on the engaging um

58
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,879
people in discussions about cannabis and

59
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,799
how we promote public education and

60
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:02,078
public health around cannabis

61
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,159
in a way that is you know different than

62
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:06,078
the paradigms of old where

63
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,000
i'm not sure if dare was in ireland but

64
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:10,239
the dare program drug abuse resistance

65
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,239
education which came about under ronald

66
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,560
reagan in the u.s was sort of what i was

67
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,319
educated under and it was drugs are bad

68
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,640
people who use drugs are bad and

69
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:20,399
everything about drugs is bad um and in

70
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,598
fact i remember a dare police officer

71
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,039
come into my school and telling me that

72
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:26,399
you can overdose and die on marijuana in

73
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:27,759
the same way that you can with heroin

74
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,239
and i was like oh like this is

75
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:32,159
really bad um and we're trying to change

76
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,400
that because i think there are some

77
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,519
potential small risks associated with

78
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,840
cannabis

79
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,680
but there's also a lot of of benefit

80
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,360
that can come from cannabis that people

81
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,840
potentially miss out on without good

82
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,280
drugs education and so if we can promote

83
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,400
harm reduction to deal with those

84
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,959
minimal

85
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,719
small potential risks and also

86
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,319
ensure people have better

87
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:53,680
experiences with cannabis and i think

88
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:55,679
that that's

89
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,080
something worthwhile doing and so that's

90
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,840
what i'm doing now and i i really enjoy

91
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,760
that work because i i think back to what

92
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,360
i could have used when i was younger and

93
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:05,280
i'm trying to maybe

94
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,760
fill that gap

95
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,280
yeah now understand and i think the the

96
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:11,518
difference between the list market and

97
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,519
the the regular market cannabis is

98
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,439
worlds apart and i think a lot of the

99
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,959
stigma comes from some of the toxic

100
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:18,479
substances that might have been put into

101
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,840
some of the street

102
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:21,039
products that

103
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,360
that's where the kind of negative

104
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:25,919
connotations come from the first thing i

105
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,840
wanted to talk to you about is cannabis

106
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,518
policy you've seen a number of different

107
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,680
industries around there are a number of

108
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,319
different nationalities around the world

109
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,480
enact cannabis policy what do you think

110
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:38,000
are the two things that people are

111
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:39,919
getting right and the two things that

112
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,560
people get wrong when cannabis policy

113
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:44,798
has been drawn up

114
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,680
um that's a great question i'll start

115
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,360
with the two things i think they're

116
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,280
getting wrong and

117
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,040
i think

118
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,840
at least what i saw with mr trudeau here

119
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:55,759
in canada was that cannabis legalization

120
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,158
was something that

121
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:59,679
came about but cannabis was still feared

122
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:01,840
by the government and so if you look at

123
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,040
the way the legalization came forward

124
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,878
i think they were trying to protect

125
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:06,878
their right flank against conservative

126
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:08,959
attacks and so

127
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:11,359
for example if you supply cannabis to

128
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,959
someone in canada who's a minor

129
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,200
you face something like up to 10 years

130
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,879
in jail actually i think it was 14. it's

131
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,478
a very high number whereas if if you

132
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:21,199
supply a minor with alcohol it's

133
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,399
potentially like a 500 fine and so they

134
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,680
really wanted to say look you know we're

135
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,519
legalizing cannabis but we're still

136
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,879
tough on cannabis we're still you know

137
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:29,120
it's not because we like cannabis that

138
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:31,120
we're doing this and i think that

139
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,800
undermined a lot of the process there i

140
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,478
think if you're going to say prohibition

141
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,000
is wrong we haven't been getting this

142
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:38,240
right for a century

143
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,680
you can't legalize but still claim that

144
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,918
you want to be tough on cannabis i think

145
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,400
you need to to try and have your your

146
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:46,478
rhetoric match the the legal status of

147
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,399
it um i think the other aspect of it

148
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:49,439
which is problematic was that

149
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:51,599
um

150
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:54,399
the legalization at least in canada

151
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,479
didn't do a great job of bringing

152
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:58,879
forward the legacy market bringing the

153
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:01,519
legacy market into the legal market and

154
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:02,800
undoing some of the harms of prohibition

155
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:04,799
you know just because we've moved to

156
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,478
legalization doesn't mean that we've

157
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,639
undone the harms of a century of

158
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:10,000
prohibition and if you don't acknowledge

159
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,519
all of the harm that was caused by

160
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,240
prohibition

161
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:15,519
then you you leave the remnants of it

162
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,560
sitting there and the people who are

163
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:18,319
harmed

164
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,399
know better off because we've seen that

165
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,719
you know the people who were working in

166
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:24,478
cannabis when it was illegal

167
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,320
aren't necessarily the ones profiting

168
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:28,719
now that it is legal and i think that

169
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:30,719
there's a bit of a problem there um in

170
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,160
terms of what people have gotten right

171
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,120
um you know i think in canada um and i

172
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,160
think

173
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,199
hopefully we'll start seeing this other

174
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:42,080
places i think ensuring a wide variety

175
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,560
of products available for people that

176
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:46,959
are very they're strictly regulated and

177
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,038
tested to ensure that people are getting

178
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:50,399
the product that they deserve

179
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:51,519
and the product that is claimed to be

180
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:52,399
sold to them you know we want to make

181
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:54,719
sure

182
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:56,638
that one of the benefits of legalization

183
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,720
is that you know you mentioned potential

184
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,800
adulterants and chemicals i think about

185
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,800
it more in terms of like paraquad and

186
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,720
other pesticides that can that can be on

187
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,560
unless it grows but also just in terms

188
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,240
of the environmental impact

189
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,319
that illicit growth can have i know you

190
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,720
know i come from california and illicit

191
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:15,280
grows in the mountains uh can be very

192
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,039
detrimental to the local ecology so

193
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:18,000
uh i think you know ensuring that things

194
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:19,759
are well regulated that the

195
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,360
environmental impact is minimized where

196
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,280
possible i think those are really great

197
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,319
aspects of legalization

198
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:25,198
and the other thing that i would say

199
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,560
about

200
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,240
legalization saying that they got right

201
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,959
at least here in canada and most of

202
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,680
canada is not having an artificially

203
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:35,519
high age for consumption

204
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,680
in canada the minimum age is 18

205
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,758
according to the federal rules provinces

206
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,759
can change that so for an example in

207
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,000
ontario they've aligned it with the

208
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,000
alcohol age which is 19.

209
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,399
quebec has gone to 21 for some reason i

210
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,319
think that's a bad call but we know that

211
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:51,918
people start consuming cannabis

212
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,720
usually somewhere between 16 and 18

213
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:57,120
years old their cannabis use is highest

214
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,680
um until the age of about 24 and then it

215
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,560
tends to peter out a bit and i think

216
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,959
it's really vital that we engage new

217
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,800
cannabis consumers in the legal market

218
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,318
not not because we want their dollars in

219
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,038
the legal market so much as we want

220
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,639
their practices to be supported by harm

221
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:14,719
reduction practices and to be able to

222
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,960
engage in public health and public

223
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,960
education opportunities that you get

224
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:20,399
inside retail stores and in legal

225
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:21,598
pathways

226
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:23,519
and so i think it's really important

227
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:26,639
that we we acknowledge that young people

228
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:28,318
around 18 19 20 are consuming cannabis

229
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,439
and i think it's problematic that the us

230
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,400
has stuck with

231
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:33,519
21 as their initial age for consumption

232
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:35,120
yeah well that kind of brings me on to

233
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:37,038
the next topic which is the narrative of

234
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,720
cannabis would you agree with the

235
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:41,120
statement that a lot of this kind of

236
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,039
kickback is because the

237
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,879
what americans would call republicans

238
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:46,878
what most people would call conservative

239
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,800
people are the ones pretty much the ones

240
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,280
enacting legislation and kind of have

241
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,240
got into the positions of power to be

242
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:57,359
able to stop or progress something and

243
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,038
the fear within that element of society

244
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,639
they're less informed on the topic so

245
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:02,800
therefore i think the fear is higher for

246
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,840
them hence some of the little stringent

247
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,680
ages of 21 or no edibles over 10

248
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:08,719
milligrams and all some sort of the

249
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,598
nonsense

250
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,280
laws that seem to get inactive is that a

251
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:15,120
case or do you see the narrative of

252
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:17,918
canvas on the democratic side just as

253
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,598
bad as the conservative side

254
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:22,318
yeah i wouldn't say it's just as bad i

255
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:23,598
think part of the issue is that

256
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,400
even people

257
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:27,680
on more the left-leaning political side

258
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:29,758
um

259
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,439
still sort of are indoctrinated in a

260
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,360
century of prohibition and the language

261
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:35,278
and the rhetoric and the fears

262
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,399
and so even

263
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:38,879
you know

264
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:41,679
supposed liberals like barack obama bill

265
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:42,639
clinton um

266
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,158
joe biden's a bit of a different

267
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:46,080
category there but i think even people

268
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:46,958
on the left are hesitant

269
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,800
because they still have a lot of

270
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:50,879
ingrained fear about cannabis even if

271
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:53,679
they previously consumed but i think

272
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:54,958
there's also a fear of public backlash

273
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:57,120
and sort of as i mentioned with mr

274
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:59,599
trudeau protecting that right flank

275
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,799
um and you know bill clinton famously

276
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,399
like he was

277
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:03,439
a liberal

278
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,600
well at least according to american

279
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,240
definitions but still enacted you know

280
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,480
very harsh welfare reforms

281
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,879
increased punitiveness around drugs

282
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,360
issues and so i think a lot of times

283
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:17,039
it's the fear of conservative uh

284
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,759
political ideas as opposed to

285
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:21,039
conservatives themselves uh changing the

286
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,039
legislation that's been one of the the

287
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:25,439
most disappointing aspects of you know

288
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:27,519
for example barack obama's presidency so

289
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,519
far with mr biden

290
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,200
although i do suspect with mr biden

291
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,839
we'll see the democrats move some

292
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,200
cannabis legislation soon uh in the

293
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,959
senate while they still at least retain

294
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,959
that 50 50 balance but

295
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:42,319
i think the narrative around cannabis is

296
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:44,319
based on on fear and stigmatizing

297
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,320
and so many people who have

298
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,519
opportunities and who even might think

299
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,200
that it's the right thing to do to

300
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,399
change cannabis laws

301
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,200
get held up because they don't want to

302
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,360
be seen as that guy or that that woman

303
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,839
supporting cannabis and

304
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,360
um i'd say you know what i i'm i'm

305
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,680
really proud that mr trudeau pushed

306
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,440
forward legalization in canada

307
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:05,679
he did it for a very specific political

308
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,920
reason which was it brought out the

309
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:10,399
youth vote and it was key to his victory

310
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:11,838
to get young people out and voting and

311
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,159
in his initial

312
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,760
electoral victory they came out in huge

313
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:17,278
numbers in a way that they hadn't

314
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:19,519
previously a lot of that's attributed to

315
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:21,679
cannabis so he had a political reason to

316
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,120
do it and i think a bit of the will to

317
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:24,239
do it as well and i'm glad that that

318
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,519
happened

319
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,440
and can you tell us a little bit more

320
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,120
about your misinformation campaign that

321
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,720
you guys are finding in the college that

322
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,399
you work out maybe highlight that a

323
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,079
little bit to the audience

324
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,159
for sure yeah so we launched the weed

325
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:37,759
out misinformation campaign

326
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,799
and we

327
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:40,720
you know as i said i thought back to

328
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:43,039
sort of like what what information did i

329
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,278
need when i was a young person and

330
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:47,439
i'm turning 40 soon and so i realized my

331
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:49,360
voice is not the right voice necessarily

332
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,560
to connect with young cannabis consumers

333
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,399
what we did is

334
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:54,399
we surveyed sixteen hundred canadian

335
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,720
cannabis consumers and then we held

336
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,720
focus groups with them to identify where

337
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,720
they get information about cannabis who

338
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,839
they trust to deliver information about

339
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,440
cannabis

340
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,480
what information they want about

341
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,120
cannabis

342
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,839
and then we took that and we gave it to

343
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,519
advertising students at humber college

344
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,000
and we had them build out some campaign

345
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,240
ideas and we took those campaign ideas

346
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,720
back to cannabis consumers to bud

347
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,799
tenders to public health experts so that

348
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,120
we had a campaign that was built on data

349
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:25,359
from young people that the materials

350
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,039
were built by young people

351
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,959
and so that the campaign would resonate

352
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:31,599
more and actually have a sort of a

353
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:34,078
human-centered design approach where we

354
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,480
took the needs of cannabis consumers as

355
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:38,399
the basis for what we would be building

356
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,240
and the idea is to dispel these old

357
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,639
myths because when you don't have

358
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,039
opportunities to actually learn about a

359
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:46,879
drug and how you can use it safely and

360
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:49,360
to achieve the things you want to

361
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:51,519
achieve with your cannabis consumption

362
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,560
there's a lot of room for problematic

363
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,240
information to sort of enter the the the

364
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:58,479
community and we want to start

365
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,159
dispelling those myths in part to reduce

366
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,480
some of the potential risks of cannabis

367
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:03,919
which there are some they're not great

368
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,639
you know they're far less than alcohol

369
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:09,838
but they exist and we can address them

370
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,200
by giving people good information built

371
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,800
you know based on the information they

372
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,399
want and need

373
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:16,319
as they've told us

374
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,559
and we can also then ensure benefit

375
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,000
maximization to say here's how to have

376
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,479
the best experience with cannabis

377
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,879
possible and i felt like that just

378
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,480
didn't exist in the right form

379
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:28,879
and didn't exist in a way that was

380
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,639
targeted both at consumers in general

381
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:32,000
but also targeted

382
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,000
to be

383
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
rolled out in retail stores so we've got

384
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,078
a lot of materials that are designed to

385
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,639
support bud tenders when they have

386
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:42,239
people in store who might say listen i'm

387
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,560
really new to cannabis what do i need to

388
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,000
know we've got a checklist that says

389
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:47,679
here's your first time or sort of

390
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,759
infrequent consumer checklist that you

391
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:51,679
can think about so what is the set and

392
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:52,559
setting that you're consuming cannabis

393
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:54,559
in

394
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:56,159
what is your goal with getting high

395
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:58,479
because not everybody has the same goals

396
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:00,799
some people want to get really baked and

397
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,159
sit on the couch and veg out some people

398
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,838
want to get a little bit high and go

399
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:05,439
garden some people want to get a

400
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,519
moderate amount of high and do different

401
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,360
things right everybody has different

402
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,440
goals and all of those goals are

403
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,399
worthwhile right they're all how people

404
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,320
want to consume and enjoy cannabis and

405
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:19,120
we're we want to make sure that people

406
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,639
understand how to get to that place

407
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,879
with their goals around cannabis

408
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,639
consumption and do so in a way that is

409
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:27,039
safe and effective for what they want

410
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,720
out of the experience

411
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:30,480
yeah now it's couldn't agree with you

412
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,720
more it seems to be a great campaign and

413
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,240
i hope we can check back in and

414
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,519
check up on that over the next couple of

415
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,039
months and see how everything's going

416
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,039
maybe share some of the information with

417
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:40,639
the european audience over here the last

418
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:42,719
topic i just wanted to jump on to i'm

419
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,039
just going to break it down into one

420
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,959
simple thing that you think challenges

421
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:48,639
facing cannabis legalization so over in

422
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,599
europe a lot of movement is happening at

423
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,159
the moment

424
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,440
what is the one big major challenge i'm

425
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:55,278
sure there's a myriad of different

426
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,079
things you could discuss but

427
00:13:55,278 --> 00:14:00,320
from taxation to licensing to social

428
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:03,198
equity what is the number to think one

429
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,959
thing that you think legalization

430
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:07,679
challenges

431
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:09,518
are are you thinking legally like um

432
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:11,198
getting legalization to happen or

433
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,039
biggest challenge once the legalization

434
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:15,198
has happened getting legalization to

435
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:16,879
happen sorry excuse me from that thing

436
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:18,078
yeah i know that's that's such a tough

437
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:19,919
question because you know we look at the

438
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:21,679
different models that have happened you

439
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:24,719
know if you look at the u.s states those

440
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:27,198
tend to be uh really driven by

441
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,440
um social movements led by cannabis

442
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:31,198
consumers uh you know i think about prop

443
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,040
64

444
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:35,519
in colorado which was the voter

445
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:37,919
initiative to legalize cannabis um and

446
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:41,679
how that was pushed forward by

447
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:42,958
um you know a really strong concerted

448
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:44,559
movement that had been building for

449
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,799
decades and decades of cannabis

450
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:49,518
consumers and cannabis policy advocates

451
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:51,198
but then you look at canada where it was

452
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,959
sort of a you know there was that that

453
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:55,039
movement but in the end i think it was

454
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,838
much more of a political decision as

455
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:58,958
opposed to a you know a weight of the

456
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:00,320
voters um

457
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:01,919
really signaling their intention that

458
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,680
prohibition needs to end

459
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:05,519
i i mean i think for me thinking about

460
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:07,679
the biggest sort of if i think about it

461
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,639
impediment to getting legalization to

462
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:11,359
happen

463
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,360
it's an old guard of

464
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,120
politicians who

465
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,720
are very concerned about keeping their

466
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,560
jobs and i think afraid of cannabis and

467
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,560
don't realize

468
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:24,958
the the number of people who consume

469
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:28,000
cannabis or who have consumed cannabis

470
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:30,159
and done so without any problems without

471
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,078
any detriment to their lives and in fact

472
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:34,159
can often reflect if it's past cannabis

473
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:35,838
use or current and say actually yeah

474
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:38,559
this has enhanced my life in some way

475
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:41,680
and i think that the biggest challenge

476
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:44,078
to to legalization is getting those

477
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:45,679
voices heard um and so i know there's

478
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:47,758
been some campaigns

479
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:49,359
you know i remember the

480
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,000
national organization for the reform of

481
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,399
marijuana laws normal in the u.s many

482
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,078
years ago how to smoke the vote campaign

483
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,679
and the idea was that cannabis consumers

484
00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:00,799
needed to come out and say

485
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:03,039
i consume cannabis i enjoy it um and and

486
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:04,559
so there's you know to even do that we

487
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:05,759
need to break down some of the stigma so

488
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:07,198
that people feel comfortable and then

489
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,360
once they feel comfortable do we get the

490
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:11,679
voices out there so the politicians

491
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,079
realize there is a voting block that

492
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,758
cares and that can be swayed if you say

493
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:17,359
actually yeah we're going to consider

494
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,600
cannabis legalization and figure out how

495
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,600
to do it in our specific

496
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,959
national context

497
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,879
i think just getting through to those

498
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:28,000
people and making them realize that

499
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:30,000
there is a viable population and also

500
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,679
um the sky isn't going to fall you know

501
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,039
getting them to be i guess my point of

502
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:34,159
be getting them to be not afraid of

503
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:35,278
cannabis

504
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,639
because frankly what we've seen in

505
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:38,559
canada is

506
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,879
not really increased usage rates in any

507
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:44,399
significant way there's been no increase

508
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:45,600
in you know like fatal car crashes um

509
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,078
we've seen a bit of an uptick in

510
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,839
emergency room visits but frankly i

511
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:52,159
think the data would suggest that that's

512
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,399
more about people being willing to

513
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:56,799
go for medical treatment if they've had

514
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,320
a bit too many edibles or something um

515
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:00,639
and not that they are having more

516
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,519
problems so i think it's it's just sort

517
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,278
of

518
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,558
old politicians who are afraid of

519
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:08,000
cannabis and once we can maybe you know

520
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:10,078
vote them out or move past them or get

521
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,078
them to see the light then maybe we will

522
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:14,078
um you know i think about joe biden in

523
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:17,359
this regard is a bit of an old school

524
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:19,678
guy was a drug warrior now seems a bit

525
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:21,438
open to it even if he's a bit hesitant

526
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,959
and i'm hopeful that maybe

527
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,400
he reads the political writing on the

528
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,480
wall and it's just like yeah actually

529
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,160
maybe this is something that we we can

530
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,798
support or at least not get in the way

531
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,720
of at least at a federal level in the us

532
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:34,720
it's a it's a great answer i think that

533
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,400
this is the old

534
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,160
uh politicians that are in there that

535
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,000
are entrenched in there i think are the

536
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,240
ones that need to be educated and

537
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,839
informed to most to get this policy

538
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,200
changed it's been great talking to you

539
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:47,279
down the line to talk to you all day

540
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,640
about policy and hopefully again we'll

541
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:50,720
touch base forwards the end of the year

542
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,160
and say see how your program's going and

543
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,440
how everything's turned around over in

544
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:58,200
europe here

545
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,200
awesome thank you your next episode

546
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,480
