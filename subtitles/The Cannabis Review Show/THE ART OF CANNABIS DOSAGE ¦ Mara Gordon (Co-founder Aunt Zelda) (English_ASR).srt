00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,320
of the cannabis review i'm delighted to

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,800
be joined on this episode by mara gordon

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,640
she's the co-founder of the renowned

well thank you and yourself

9
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:24,800
i'm very well thank you very much i'm

10
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:27,198
delighted to have you on the show going

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,679
to talk about the dosing in medical

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,599
cannabis on this episode and maybe mary

13
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:33,439
you could give the viewer an overview of

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,960
where you kind of got yourself into the

15
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:37,519
cannabis industry and where you are at

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,520
the moment over the us

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,760
so the the

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,800
way that i got into cannabis to in

19
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:46,079
initially was because there was no

20
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:48,799
data

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,480
around dosing and what you were taking

22
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:52,718
and how you were taking it how much to

23
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:55,839
take for various diseases etc and so i

24
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,640
decided to focus on solving the the

25
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,399
dosing questions uh initially this was

26
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,879
back uh 2010 when i started doing this

27
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,239
and been working on collecting data and

28
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,478
working with patients ever since

29
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:12,079
okay great so perfect person to talk

30
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:13,438
about on this topic i'm going to jump

31
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,359
straight away in the first topic and

32
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:17,118
that is the art of the exact dosage it's

33
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,280
a lot of the things i'm sure doctors are

34
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:20,719
afraid of prescribing the medicine most

35
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,400
people don't want to go near because

36
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:24,640
there's a myriad of combinations that

37
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,240
can be actually put together and it all

38
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,320
depends on patient can you give

39
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:30,399
everybody a little overview on your

40
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,078
methods and what you think may be the

41
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,240
perfect dose for different types of

42
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:36,719
people

43
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:38,640
um yeah the first thing i would say is

44
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,640
there's no such thing as a perfect dose

45
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,560
for the typical person

46
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,320
because there is and we're all have

47
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,759
different endocannabinoid systems and

48
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:47,758
they all work differently with different

49
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,759
diseases however we have been able to

50
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,399
identify patterns

51
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,640
that make it closer to a week we call it

52
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,560
a target dose where you work with the

53
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,040
patient or you wear an individual work

54
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,200
towards a target amount of the

55
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,799
cannabinoid that they're that they're

56
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,478
working with

57
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,560
and with the understanding that they may

58
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:08,159
have to exceed it or they may not ever

59
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,199
make it to that high point if they don't

60
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:13,359
need it which is okay but what we do is

61
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:15,919
uh we always

62
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,680
look at any of the data that's out there

63
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:20,079
in the research have there been any

64
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,520
studies pre-clinical or clinical on a

65
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,440
particular disease set then

66
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,200
and then we're able to look from that

67
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,520
through our data because we have been

68
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:31,598
collecting over 300 data points on each

69
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,439
patient going in and then looking at

70
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:34,878
what they're using and how they're using

71
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:37,120
it and then

72
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:38,719
whether it's being effective or not and

73
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,920
being able to make some

74
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:42,000
some

75
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:43,518
some predictions on what the target

76
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,719
should be for various diseases for

77
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,159
example

78
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,239
if you

79
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:49,439
based upon the

80
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,599
research that's been done in the

81
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:53,519
pre-clinical on

82
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:55,359
breast cancer

83
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,599
there's three major subtypes of breast

84
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,519
cancer we look at

85
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:01,359
what is uh

86
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,039
where the cannabinoid receptors are

87
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,599
whether they're present

88
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:07,120
within these types of breast cancer and

89
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:10,158
something that we can target we know

90
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:13,039
that thc actively

91
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:15,120
activates the cannabinoid receptors so

92
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:18,799
we want to make sure there's thc we also

93
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,080
know that cbd also works in another way

94
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,879
of of

95
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,440
on the cancer cells through other

96
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:27,919
systems within the body as well so we

97
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:31,919
might start out a a

98
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:35,679
a ratio of one to one on the amount of

99
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:38,318
thc and cbd that the patient will use

100
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,400
and then based upon where their age is

101
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:43,119
we have found that there's variances

102
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,640
that as we get older we need less

103
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,719
to be able to

104
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,559
impact because of changes in metabolism

105
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:50,158
and changes that we frankly don't know

106
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,400
yet

107
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,158
but i always i always

108
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,599
stress that people need to start with a

109
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:59,919
very very low dose of the thc

110
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:01,359
maybe sometimes we have people that are

111
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:04,000
older

112
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,400
my age and higher that we're we're using

113
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,199
like one milligram to start

114
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,640
and titrating up very very slowly so

115
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:12,878
that we make sure that they don't have

116
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,639
any adverse reactions

117
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:17,439
because

118
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:20,399
even though it might make somebody feel

119
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:23,360
too activated or too

120
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:25,439
much psychoactivity at a particular dose

121
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,840
if you titrate slowly enough you can

122
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:30,240
avoid that and also if you stay at a

123
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:32,239
certain level long enough like a few

124
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,079
days to a week at a certain level that

125
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,720
makes you uncomfortable your body will

126
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:39,279
acclimate and it no longer will do that

127
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,160
so if we're able to titrate people up

128
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:44,959
that way we also know that you need more

129
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,280
cbd than thc because thc is much more

130
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:49,839
powerful than cbd so when you

131
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:52,478
incorporate cbd at some point you may go

132
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:56,319
from that one to one to one to two one

133
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:58,800
to three whatever higher on the cbd

134
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:01,199
as long as you have lab results that are

135
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,199
associated with the product and i'm

136
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,160
talking like lab results that show the

137
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,800
cannabinoid and terpene content beyond

138
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,600
the just thc and cbd but even with just

139
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,000
those if you have that then you can

140
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,000
calculate how many milligrams are in

141
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,240
each dose so that you can be very

142
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,079
controlled on taking the same thing over

143
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,639
and over again

144
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:25,359
i made some topical here yesterday just

145
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,160
because i'm in i'm in mexico right now

146
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,319
and

147
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,560
i didn't have access to aunt zelda's

148
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,719
here so i made some in my kitchen based

149
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,759
on the old the old style the way i used

150
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,479
to make it

151
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,400
and i wanted it to be 10 milligrams per

152
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:42,240
milliliter

153
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:44,399
of cannabinoid so i was able to take the

154
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,800
extract that i had knowing the lab

155
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:49,198
results that were on it just do simple

156
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,680
calculations and when i figured out the

157
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,199
volume of what i was making i was able

158
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,840
to then calculate out how many

159
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,560
milligrams of cannabinoids i had to

160
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:00,879
include in order to achieve that

161
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,759
i always recommend that people start

162
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:08,319
extremely slowly for example you know

163
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:10,879
2.5 milligrams as a wellness dose of thc

164
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:13,360
is often what it takes to get somebody

165
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:15,600
um to the right place if you're treating

166
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,600
serious diseases then it's a completely

167
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,520
different subject but for like something

168
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,280
like anxiety or

169
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:23,120
or slight pain

170
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:25,119
for a healthy person

171
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,319
um or somebody that just needs a little

172
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,800
edge to get to sleep that 2.5

173
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,120
may be all they need

174
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,038
okay would you think 2.5 would be the

175
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,639
same when it comes to let's say a cbd

176
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:38,800
edible we know we're going to have an

177
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,240
influx of them in the market a lot of

178
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,079
the time when the novel food license

179
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,560
applications in europe especially go

180
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:47,038
through so do you what what do you

181
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,879
recommend is the perfect dosage for a

182
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:52,959
smackdown or for an active treat

183
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,879
you know when you're talking about cbd

184
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:56,478
it depends on how it's derived and what

185
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:57,519
else is in there

186
00:06:56,478 --> 00:06:59,839
because

187
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:02,240
cbd on its own

188
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,159
may make somebody feel activated you

189
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,560
know people talk about it not having any

190
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,039
you know psychoactivity is just not true

191
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,759
um it's certainly not true if it's a

192
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:13,038
whole plant where it's including

193
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,240
terpenes

194
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:18,719
and other components that may make

195
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,879
impact how a person feels

196
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,160
a lot of times the

197
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:24,959
hemp

198
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,840
varieties that are being grown

199
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:28,000
have

200
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:29,119
higher levels of pining in them for

201
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,279
example

202
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,959
and these might make somebody feel very

203
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:34,879
very focused or it might make somebody

204
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:37,439
feel very activated

205
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:39,839
and uncomfortable and anxious so

206
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:42,000
again i would say that if you're going

207
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:43,918
to get a a

208
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,839
candy bar or something which first of

209
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:47,198
all i don't i don't like that whole idea

210
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,279
but if you are if you're gonna get a

211
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,160
food product

212
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:53,758
i think keeping the whole thing under

213
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:58,160
under um

214
00:07:53,759 --> 00:08:00,080
10 milligrams for that purpose is good

215
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,280
maybe if you have something that can

216
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:05,598
easily be subdivided uh into pieces

217
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,359
accurately then you can have a hundred

218
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:09,120
milligrams for the whole thing with the

219
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,038
ability to get ten

220
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,959
these are not medical products though

221
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:17,199
yeah these are well these are products

222
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:19,038
for people that are self-medicating that

223
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,560
are you know they have like a little

224
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:22,318
minor ailment

225
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,639
like maybe they just need that little

226
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,840
edge taken off instead of having a glass

227
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,918
of wine or a beer so but if you're

228
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:31,839
talking about people that are ill or

229
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:35,278
people that are really having trouble

230
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:37,838
with pain or anxiety or you know ptsd

231
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:40,399
things like that i mean they may need 50

232
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,080
to 100 milligrams to accomplish it

233
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,918
i think that people that say that they

234
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,680
feel a lot better from 5 to 10

235
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:47,278
milligrams i think a lot of that is the

236
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:49,679
placebo

237
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:51,120
yeah okay agreed on that can you i'm

238
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:53,759
going to move on to the next topic can

239
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,000
you tell the audience formal clinical

240
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,039
cannabis research and trials that have

241
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,039
happened

242
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:00,799
we know that they take it an extremely

243
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:03,120
long time could you maybe give an

244
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:04,879
overview of where the industry is at

245
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,120
that are their products ready to come to

246
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:08,958
market apart from the handful that

247
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,759
already made it over here in europe

248
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:13,359
what's the overview on that part

249
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:15,360
you know it's interesting i was on a i

250
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,360
was on a panel uh

251
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,720
last week where we were talking about

252
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:24,159
this exact topic and um

253
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,480
what what i am seeing is that there's a

254
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:28,000
lot of innovation going on outside of

255
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,839
the united states

256
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,200
um the united states still has so many

257
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,560
barriers to be able to do solid

258
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,480
research

259
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:39,679
and the barrier

260
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:43,200
to entry of a drug into the marketplace

261
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:45,439
from the fda is is much stricter than it

262
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,640
is in some other places the eu is pretty

263
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,040
strict too

264
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:53,360
but the but it's certainly like places

265
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:56,079
like australia where we do trials and

266
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,720
south africa brazil

267
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,720
colombia

268
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,480
portugal for example places like that

269
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:07,120
canada but even with that it takes it

270
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,120
takes years to get something through

271
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,039
process and millions and millions and

272
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,078
millions of dollars to do it

273
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:12,879
um

274
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:15,120
so

275
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:17,600
uh for example when we

276
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,200
uh through the lira therapeutics which i

277
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,200
co-founded also

278
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,440
when we um

279
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,640
when we were trialing our xenoval

280
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,880
product

281
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:28,639
we were able to use the data that i had

282
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:30,838
been accumulating through aunt zelda's

283
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:34,319
over the years for people that had

284
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:36,399
insomnia to be able to get a target dose

285
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,519
to start with to have a a better

286
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:43,120
opportunity and a more likelihood of

287
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:46,480
success um with the trial because you

288
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,919
know most trials fail so if you could

289
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,519
start out with something that's already

290
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:51,919
got somewhat of a track record you have

291
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,959
a better opportunity but

292
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:56,000
you have to go through everything from

293
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:58,559
uh

294
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,240
safety tests and then you have to go

295
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:02,000
through a whole trial of safety and you

296
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,320
have something called pk which is where

297
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,879
you have to find out what the actual

298
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,760
dose tolerance is so you make sure you

299
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:12,159
stay within a certain amount

300
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:14,159
and then you have to try it in small

301
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:16,958
group and then a larger group and we're

302
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:20,719
talking double blind placebo it's not

303
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:23,838
always so easy um i had a uh i spoke to

304
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,000
an oncology nurse one time in pediatrics

305
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,600
and she said how am i supposed to how am

306
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,799
i supposed to you know have do this

307
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,600
double blind when it's so obvious

308
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:35,759
which patients are vomiting and which

309
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,159
patients aren't vomiting and which

310
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:40,480
patients are happy and which patients

311
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:42,719
aren't based upon i mean where's where's

312
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,240
the placebo on that

313
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:49,519
so it is very challenging um

314
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:52,480
what i have recommended is that drugs go

315
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,240
through more of a biopharmaceutical

316
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,399
plant medicine

317
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,399
nutraceutical type model

318
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,639
of approval instead of going through the

319
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,278
whole you know fda

320
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,600
uh uh system which is it can take a

321
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:07,200
decade in millions and millions of

322
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,920
dollars there's still no guarantee that

323
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,079
you're going to get anything to market

324
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:13,360
i saw that epidiolex was just approved

325
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:15,759
in spain

326
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,759
it's a it's a

327
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:20,639
not a very good product but they've

328
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:23,439
spent millions and millions of dollars

329
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,480
in years uh gw getting it to market and

330
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,399
and

331
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,360
it's going to be hard to to catch up

332
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,519
with that

333
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,519
the one the one thing that i do

334
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,078
recommend is that

335
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:37,200
i'm not sure whether you have this in

336
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:40,559
ireland or whether it's uh and that is

337
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,160
the concept of orphan drugs

338
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:44,239
orphan diseases

339
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:46,000
and these are these are diseases that

340
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,720
there's not enough

341
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,200
people that that are uh that have been

342
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,720
diagnosed with this to justify i mean

343
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,200
there's an actual number i think it's

344
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,720
like 250 000 or something where there's

345
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,920
an actual um where there's not enough

346
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,680
people

347
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:04,639
for the

348
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:06,799
uh typical pharmaceutical companies to

349
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,399
develop a treatment for them

350
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:10,479
you know like there's not enough people

351
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,799
with huntington's there's really not

352
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,959
enough pediatric cancer it's actually

353
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:17,039
relative i mean in my world it seems

354
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:19,359
like it's constant but it's really in in

355
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:22,159
reality it's it's rare

356
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,720
dravet things like that these are rare

357
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:26,958
diseases and the obstacles to getting a

358
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,839
drug through

359
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:32,638
trialing is much faster

360
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:35,040
we did an observational study

361
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,919
at uh chops uh children's hospital of

362
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:39,679
philadelphia on autism looking at four

363
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:43,120
formulations there

364
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:45,039
for our hope line and um

365
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:49,198
i wasn't part of it but it was my

366
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:51,039
company that did it and uh um we were

367
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:53,198
able to observe based upon these and

368
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:56,000
that was groundbreaking to be able to do

369
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:58,319
that at a mainstream institution so

370
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,839
getting a drug to market

371
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,519
by going through an orphan

372
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:07,519
designation and then prescribing it off

373
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:09,120
label is a really good option for

374
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,440
getting drugs out there that's how many

375
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,519
many drugs get to market they get there

376
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,839
for one thing and then doctors use them

377
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,399
for many other

378
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:19,839
things okay very informative i'm gonna

379
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,519
end with the last topic we're nearly

380
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,360
running out of time you're in mexico at

381
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,839
the moment i'm sure the

382
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,360
the on off again legislation that seems

383
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,959
to be happening there what's your

384
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,039
overview of the industry over there at

385
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:33,278
the moment is it ready to explode or is

386
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:34,799
it still going to travel on for another

387
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:36,240
little while

388
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:39,359
i think it's going to travel along for a

389
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,360
little while um i'm speaking an event in

390
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,360
cancun in

391
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,039
november and it's a business and

392
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,159
technology event

393
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:50,319
and my hope is that at that time we'll

394
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:53,278
be able to sit down with some more of

395
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,278
the decision makers i have um i've

396
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:58,078
already been talking with with groups

397
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:59,439
that are going for licensing to grow and

398
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:01,120
manufacture

399
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,959
and

400
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,959
i'm hoping something will happen this

401
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:07,919
year you know it's a it's a it's a

402
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:10,399
complicated uh culture here

403
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:12,240
with you know the history of cannabis

404
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,958
obviously it's kind of funny to think

405
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:18,079
about uh people bringing now so much

406
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:19,599
cannabis from california to mexico

407
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:22,159
when you go into the country there's

408
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,240
signs saying you're not allowed to bring

409
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:26,719
marijuana into the country and it's just

410
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,360
it's just hilarious to me based upon

411
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,160
where we came from here i'm hoping that

412
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,480
in the next year we'll see at least some

413
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:36,879
regulations starting to take place

414
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,440
because yes it's been it's been

415
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:41,519
legalized but there's no infrastructure

416
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,199
yet to support it

417
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,039
okay very interesting we'll have to get

418
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:47,359
somebody on to further educate us on the

419
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:49,120
mexican industry over time but it's been

420
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,639
amazing talking to murray your wealth of

421
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,240
information and it's been an absolute

422
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,680
pleasure i hope we get to try to get in

423
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,079
the future sometime

424
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:57,439
anytime you my pleasure no problem

425
00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:00,679
thanks everybody for watching see you

426
