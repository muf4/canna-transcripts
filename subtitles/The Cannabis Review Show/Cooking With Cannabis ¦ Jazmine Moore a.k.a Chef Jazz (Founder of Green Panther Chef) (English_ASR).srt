00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:50,799
cannabis years probably like a decade

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,878

crohn's disease right after i had

25
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:56,878

26
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,359

27
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:01,119
to around 84 pounds i was put on five

28
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,600
medications it was told this was

29
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:06,000
supposed to be my life right so i got

30
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,400
introduced to a doctor who introduced me

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,760
to um cannabis and just cooking with

32
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,439
plants in general so 13 years later i am

33
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,840
not on any of those pharmaceutical

34
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:18,478
medications and i exclusively use food

35
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,960
and cannabis for happiness

36
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:23,280
okay amazing so you had a very a firearm

37
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:24,879
journey to get to where you are now um

38
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,719

39
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:29,438

42
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:36,400
you guys have worked on over the last 12

43
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:38,078
months oh definitely so with our book as

44
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,359
well though we definitely do a lot of

45
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:42,078
private events

46
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:44,478
we do um a lot of catering and then

47
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:46,719
private events just for an elite

48
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:48,959
clientele in washington dc

49
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,959
yeah i can see infused dinner parties

50
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:52,879
being a huge thing when it comes to

51
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:54,640
europe legalization

52
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,560
can you maybe give the audience a little

53
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,799
overview of the best methods for cooking

54
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,600
with cannabis is it oil is a can of

55
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,280
butter is hash better than flour what

56
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:05,039
would be some of the top let's say three

57
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,239
tips that you give to the consumer who's

58
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,640
watching the show

59
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,639
definitely um know your numbers that's

60
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,559
number one if you want to know how to

61
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,839
create repeatable results you're going

62
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,759
to have to know your numbers that

63
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,878
doesn't have to go into knowing the

64
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:20,159
percentage of thc or cbd but just

65
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:22,639
knowing what's going to work with your

66
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:24,479
endocannabinoid system is that one to

67
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:27,759
five milligrams is that five to ten

68
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:30,479
milligrams and then upward um also as

69
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:33,359
well cannabis is allergic to water so

70
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:35,039
the best way to extract and get the most

71
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,160
out of your cannabis is in something

72
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:40,799
that is fat soluble so oils and butters

73
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,400
coconut oils as well but you want

74
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,040
something that doesn't have such a

75
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,560
drastic smoke point that you're going to

76
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,159
um

77
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,920
degrade your cannabis you're not going

78
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:51,759
to get the most out of your cannabis so

79
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:54,238
look for those extra virgin olive oils

80
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:56,639
look for those coconut oils look for the

81
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,120
the butters as well but those are the

82
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:01,119
best and something that's fat soluble so

83
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,519
no vegetable oil or canola oil or

84
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,920
anything like that to extract it

85
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,759
okay amazing let's move on now to your

86
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:10,158
recently uh

87
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:11,759
book that just got released can you give

88
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:14,000
everybody an overview of the story of

89
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,079
creating the book how you got it out and

90
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,080

yesterday so i'm going to share the link

94
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,680
with your community but it's called more

95
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,239
than a cannabis cookbook it took about

96
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,400
two years to do that or to write it and

97
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,719
um really it demystifies i want it to

98
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,480
bend perspective away from like sugary

99
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:36,560
treats you know into like a more

100
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:38,639

101
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,640
lot of clientele who just want

105
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:48,000
spurred this book more than a cannabis

00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:05,439
when it comes to light packaging and all

142
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:07,758
of that good type of stuff

143
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:10,639
but it is more on the sweet side of

144
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,000
things i really do like to um explore

145
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,000

00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:01,120
their toe into this

170
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:03,038
exact so there's two things i have one

171
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,959
recipe i've been cooking with this or

172
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:07,120
not even cooking i've been using the raw

173
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:09,038
cannabis flour and i've had so much

174
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,918
success with that um this drink is

175
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:14,560
called sexy on the inside so it has

176
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:17,120
basically using raw cannabis flour it's

177
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,680
a lot of green goodness inside of it but

178
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,519
i have that at least four times a week

179
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,000
you know and i've just had a lot of

180
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:26,240
success with that but one of my other

181
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,439
favorite recipes is our vegan seafood

182
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,120
paella

183
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:31,120
i love

184
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,959
yeah we're using oyster mushrooms in

185
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,079
there we're using a lot of like for the

186
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:38,318
umami flavor the capers and tomatoes and

187
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:40,639
it's just a beautiful dish

188
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,639
okay and dosage is a hugely important

189
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,478
part of this we had mara gordon on there

190
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,199
last week to talk about the art of

191
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:48,719
dosage how important is and how long

192
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,038
does it take you to kind of get the

193
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,039
exact dosage right for the different

194
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:55,839
consumers that are coming through your

195
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:58,159
doors yeah dosage does take a long time

196
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:59,279
that took me um in my beginning in like

197
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,360
my journey

198
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:03,198
i had a lot of trial and error around

199
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,879
that and so

200
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,879
you have to ask yourself if we break

201
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:09,038
down this in the book in detail but

202
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:10,478
asking yourself five questions really

203
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:12,639
and primarily just knowing your

204
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:15,120
percentage of your thc knowing your

205
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,560
carrier fat and the units of measurement

206
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,959
is going to lead you in the right

207
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,038
direction but in the book we actually

208
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,038
give you a table so you can plug and

209
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:25,199
play and you're able to create those

210
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:27,279
repeatable results so it really comes

211
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,080
down to like knowing those percentages

212
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:32,638
the numbers and then a calculator you

213
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:34,959
know it really isn't that difficult once

214
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,560
you know what to plug and play

215
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:38,239
yeah i suppose it's about sourcing the

216
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,560
perfect strain of flour first and

217
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,478
foremost for users and is there a

218
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,519
process that you go to if you're

219
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:46,719
creating a snack is it isolating right

220
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:48,399
this is the flour i'm going to use

221
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,400
because it contains this profile of

222
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:52,638
cannabinoids and terpenes and i know the

223
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:54,799
flavor is going to be x y and z out of

224
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,199
this is that kind of the process

225
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,960
absolutely and so when i am picking or

226
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,800
choosing a strand as well it's like what

227
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:02,560
is my outcome that's the first thing

228
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,720
when i'm working with a client how do i

229
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,759
want to feel as i always talk about

230
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,199
myself

231
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,199
when i talk because i have a

232
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,439
gastrointestinal issue crohn's disease

233
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,759
and so i really do look at strains or

234
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:15,038
cultivars that are higher in

235
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:16,720
beta-carotene you know and because the

236
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:19,199
reason being is because that interacts

237
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,479
with those gut receptors as well i look

238
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,478
for something if i'm dealing with a

239
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:24,878
little bit more pain management

240
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:26,478
something that's higher in mercy if i

241
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,720
need a little bit of boost i'll look for

242
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:30,878
something like limonene as well i really

243
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,599
pay attention to the terpene

244
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,918
content and then also second is like the

245
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,519
thc and cbd content

246
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:39,519
yeah i think terpenes are becoming a

247
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,200
thing with the canvas connoisseurs in

248
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,719
the market that they they're starting to

249
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,399
know their things and want those little

250
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,600
bit of extra bits of information on the

251
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,360
packaging

252
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,360
how are you going to see the eastern

253
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,959
seaboard of america

254
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,519
shaping up now that we've got new york

255
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:56,079
pretty much coming to market next march

256
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,560
what's the anticipation for there we are

257
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,160
definitely coming along i know it's been

258
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,000
a few years right we're a little bit

259
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:05,600
behind the west coast but we are coming

260
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
along um i know that there are some um

261
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,519
great uh i shouldn't say this online the

262
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,639
great consumption lounges there's some

263
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,799
great people that are talking to

264
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:14,958
politicians to push forward the

265
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:17,519
legislation um i am actually in

266
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:18,399
washington dc now and i've been asked to

267
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,080
speak

268
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,080
on a board just so they can kind of

269
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,600
navigate the language around how are we

270
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,320
going to introduce cannabis to the

271
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,000
public so i think that it's um

272
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,399
it's on the horizon

273
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,320
um federal legalization i'm not going to

274
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,240
give a date on that but it's definitely

275
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,399
on the horizon some people who need to

276
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,200
be in the room are finally starting to

277
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,240
discuss it and being taken seriously so

278
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,560
yeah

279
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,360
yeah i see consumption lounges being one

280
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:45,039
of the

281
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,039
focal points of the industry for

282
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:48,958
everybody to expect especially tourists

283
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:50,799
that are going to america new york vegas

284
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:53,278
these kind of territories i don't see

285
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,639
any reason why people are willing to pay

286
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:56,559
ten thousand let's say dollars for

287
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:59,759
bottle service and they won't pay the

288
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:02,239
exact same thing for uh premium broads

289
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:03,519
that was grown in the hills of nepal or

290
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,759
whatever it is they're going to come up

291
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,759
with so i think yeah and a music

292
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:09,919
curation combined with that environment

293
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:12,319
and that atmosphere i think could be as

294
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:14,958
big if not bigger than alcohol fueled

295
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,399
bars absolutely absolutely it's just

296
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:18,879
what it's going to take time it's going

297
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,958
to take education as well you know just

298
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:23,039
being more than a cannabis cook being

299
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:24,559
more than just like the standard so we

300
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:27,120
can break stigmas that's what it's all

301
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:28,799
about it's just more of acceptance and

302
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,720
you know and just opening up people just

303
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:32,639
have to learn a little bit more

304
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,320
yeah i think that's slowly marching on

305
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:35,679
that'll end up happening i'm gonna tilt

306
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,600
into something else give me the top

307
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:39,679
three songs that you listen to when

308
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,480
you're in the kitchen cooking

309
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:45,199
right okay so i do i love this artist

310
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,639
who's um named alkaline so i love a

311
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,640
little bit of reggae

312
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:52,480
i do love my top 40 like and then edm as

313
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:54,720
well so i love pop music i throw a

314
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,360
little bit of beyonce in there of course

315
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,360
and then i love like a little bit of edm

316
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,120
yeah i think it's those two worlds seem

317
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,639
to marry together so well the cannabis

318
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,959
industry and the music industry i think

319
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:08,078
there'll be uh so much more to to cover

320
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:09,599
in those two aspects um yeah i highly

321
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:12,078
recommend everybody checking out the

322
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,959
