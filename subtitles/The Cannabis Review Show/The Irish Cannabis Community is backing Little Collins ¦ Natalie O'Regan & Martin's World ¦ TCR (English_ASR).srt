me on today's show

13
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:31,919
um i'm going to get started on a topic

14
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:34,000
that we can kind of kick into that's

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,000
been making a lot of the headlines

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,200
at the moment a lot of people already

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,039
know who you are can you

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,239
give us your uh overview and what's

19
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,119
happened with the little collins

20
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:42,558
reaction that

21
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:45,679
your lawyer said do you want to give us

22
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:47,359
exactly the breakdown of what you think

23
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,840
has happened and why it's happened for

24
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:51,600
the audience well i'm not a lawyer yet

25
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,879
but i'm on the road to becoming one i'm

26
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,760
studying and trying to qualify at the

27
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:56,079
moment

28
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,640
but the the cusp of what's happening

29
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,799
with little collins is they are a cbd

30
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,840
uh business in galway and kilkenny and

31
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:07,200
they sell a range of cbd products from

32
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,400
butter to foodstuffs to oils to flour

33
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,640
all cbd and all

34
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,240
permitted under eu law because they

35
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,000
contain less than two percent

36
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:20,478
0.2 percent thc so in the last i think

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,400
may 2019 was their first raid and

38
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:23,118
they've gotten raided by the guards

39
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,520
repeatedly

40
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:26,319
since then i think four or five times

41
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,679
and

42
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:32,559
the issue up until recently was that

43
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,960
um ireland has no has a zero tolerance

44
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,600
policy to thc in our legislation

45
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:39,759
so regardless if it's cbd or not whether

46
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:40,078
it's eu permitted or not ireland's law

47
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,759
ha

48
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:44,478
is silent on thc so any my new trace of

49
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,478
thc

50
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:50,239
and cbd products by default are illegal

51
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:51,759
so they've been targeted they've been

52
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:52,640
raids they've had all their stock taken

53
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,519
off of them

54
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,320
and jp currently has a criminal

55
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:59,599
proceedings

56
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:03,118
against him due to this so we had

57
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:06,478
a recent kind of vape case in november

58
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:08,000
2020 from the eu so the ecj in that case

59
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:10,560
stated that

60
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,280
um the mark the member states cannot

61
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,039
prohibit the marketing of cbd products

62
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,959
and that is lawfully produced in other

63
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:19,199
member states in their member states so

64
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,959
ireland cannot ban cbd products that are

65
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:22,958
lawfully produced in another eu member

66
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,920
state country

67
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,598
but unfortunately our misuse of drugs

68
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:28,719
act hasn't been amended to reflect that

69
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:31,598
yet

70
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,080
so we are now in a position where eu

71
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:34,238
have

72
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,719
legally permitted cbd products but

73
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,759
ireland because of our silence on thc

74
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:40,878
content

75
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:44,878
cbd products are effectively illegal

76
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:46,159
so that is where we are today so we are

77
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,639
what's the process for getting that

78
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:52,079
amended they would have to

79
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:53,759
amend the misuse of drugs act so in the

80
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,760
misuse of drugs act it just says the

81
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:58,239
cannabis sativa plant is illegal

82
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:59,280
and it's scheduled under their misuse

83
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,599
the drug schedule

84
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,759
so they would have to amend that to say

85
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,039
either the cannabis plant is not illegal

86
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:06,719
which we would all love because it would

87
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,199
bring in legalization

88
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,400
but failing that they'd have to amend it

89
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:14,719
to

90
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,879
uh allow 0.2 percent thc

91
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:19,120
that opens up a whole kind of word

92
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:21,679
support

93
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,280
sorry there's no path forward at the

94
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,920
moment for people to amend that

95
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,878
uh for the audience to understand that

96
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:28,639
uh we we

97
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,639
we've now got the problem is there a

98
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:33,119
solution that we can we can present to

99
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:35,039
the audience as to look if we do x y and

100
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,799
z this is how we can amend this to have

101
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:40,158
the zero point three percent

102
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,840
thc quantity uh allowed in there

103
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:43,199
well it's just campaigning to the

104
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,640
minister for justice and the minister

105
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,079
for health and the t shock and raising

106
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:47,039
your voice loud enough so they'll have

107
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,440
to hear you

108
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:50,719
unfortunately we're not getting very

109
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:52,239
good responses from any of the

110
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:54,158
departments at the moment

111
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,519
so you contact the department of justice

112
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:56,798
and helen mcintyre will save the

113
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,080
department of health issue

114
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,519
you contact stephen donnelly in the

115
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,000
department of health they'll say it's

116
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,799
justice

117
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,438
issue you'll contact the t-shock and he

118
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,519
will say oh i'm talking to

119
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:08,560
helen mcinty the mr minister of justice

120
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,719
about this

121
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,920
but then again helen mcinty will say she

122
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:13,840
has no idea

123
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,958
that it's not in her remit go back to

124
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,439
stephen donnelly

125
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,199
so at the moment you're just getting run

126
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:20,399
around in circles from department to

127
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,600
department

128
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:25,120
um with no satisfactory response like

129
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,199
even if they turned around and said

130
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,759
we're working on it

131
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,520
yeah we'd accept a timeline like we

132
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,520
understand that these things do take

133
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:35,918
time they can't be changed overnight

134
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:36,879
it's not a click of the fingers action

135
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:38,959
that can be taken

136
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:40,159
but at the moment there is no

137
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:41,758
willingness to engage

138
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,680
from any governmental departments on

139
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,439
this issue and i think that is

140
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,280
the the crux of the story is they're

141
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,240
still they're still raiding premises

142
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,478
they're still

143
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,040
targeting cbd businesses and they're

144
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:56,159
still criminally prosecuting people for

145
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,919
cbd but at the same time from

146
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,759
where i'm sitting it only seems to be

147
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:00,719
certain businesses that are getting

148
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,479
targeted

149
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,919
you're not seeing the likes of holland

150
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:06,399
and bearish or booths

151
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:08,000
or anything like that who also stock cbd

152
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:09,839
products you're not seeing

153
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,519
the same level of enforcement to those

154
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:14,638
businesses as you would to the

155
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:17,038
the small local cbd shops in ireland

156
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,918
okay and martin are you hearing the same

157
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:19,519
it's it's the

158
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:21,198
we we'd be hearing it as well the deaf

159
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,560
ears you go to one department

160
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,400
you go to another department and you

161
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,478
just keep getting pushed from person to

162
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:28,959
person how are you coming across

163
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:31,120
your interactions with the guards and

164
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,799
members of politics so far

165
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,319
yeah well i've been campaigning for a

166
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,160
long time i

167
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:39,279
aired some protest that we attended back

168
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,280
in 2011 yesterday that was from the 420

169
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:43,279
protest of 2011

170
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:45,119
and even back then we were saying a lot

171
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:45,839
of the the similar things we were saying

172
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,600
today we had

173
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:48,959
luke mean flanagan down at that event we

174
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,120
had vincent lavery

175
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,719
it was an amazing uh very well attended

176
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,399
event um

177
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,639
but unfortunately here we are today

178
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:58,000
where we still don't have access to

179
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,280
cannabis we have a medical cannabis

180
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,800
access program

181
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:02,159
but still nobody's gotten access through

182
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,038
it we have a few patients who have

183
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,560
ministerial

184
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:08,959
uh license um but that that few is

185
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,399
isn't anywhere near the the many who who

186
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:13,439
need access to it

187
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:14,799
um so it seems like uh they're just i

188
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:17,360
don't know what they're biding their

189
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,918
times maybe to get things lined up so

190
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,000
big industry can come in and because it

191
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:22,399
seems there's no interest there at all

192
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,240
for

193
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:26,079
allowing somebody like little collins

194
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,680
let's say for setting up their business

195
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:30,079
they're coming down heavy on them

196
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,120
but meanwhile the likes of gw

197
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:35,120
pharmaceuticals

198
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,800
and are being sold for our 7.2 billion

199
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,240
and they're making massive deals so on

200
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,160
one hand we're criminalizing people

201
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,879
trying to set up industry here in

202
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,720
our own irish people and meanwhile we're

203
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,000
kind of like applauding these other big

204
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,319
massive companies who

205
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,839
are looking to sell into ireland uh the

206
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,039
same products we're criminalizing these

207
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:53,279
other guys for

208
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:55,120
and i don't know i i don't blame people

209
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,399
for thinking there's a conspiracy out

210
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,319
there to keep cannabis

211
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:59,679
illegal and because when you try to

212
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,439
engage with the politicians

213
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,720
and they don't take you seriously that

214
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:04,319
they treat you is not

215
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,080
very well pointed out they start making

216
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,280
you running around and chasing your tail

217
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:09,918
effectively

218
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:11,598
and you just have to think that there's

219
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:12,240
something bigger i play that they're not

220
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:15,120
willing to

221
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,160
play ball at all and because this isn't

222
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,918
an issue that we only brought up

223
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,880
yesterday as i said that protest i

224
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:22,639
aired yesterday was from 2011 and the

225
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:24,800
campaign for cannabis legalization i

226
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:28,478
believe it started back in 1990

227
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,800
um in cork so it's uh it's it's a sad

228
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:31,839
situation here today that uh patients

229
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,439
they're

230
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,198
they're seeing people benefit from

231
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:37,519
cannabis and they're not getting access

232
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,759
to that cannabis themselves because of

233
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:41,198
ignorance uh out there and unwillingness

234
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,400
to engage in conversations around

235
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,879
cannabis and cannabis and medicine

236
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:49,038
yeah i think it's a complete lack of

237
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,400
understanding has put fear in them that

238
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:51,360
nobody wants to put their neck on the

239
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:53,279
chopping board

240
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,240
and to a degree you can understand that

241
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:55,679
but at the end of the day the

242
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,439
politicians are there to serve the

243
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,000
people and enough of the people wants a

244
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:00,560
specific

245
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,560
thing then surely it is a workaround and

246
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,160
a responsible solution that

247
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,680
if you got the community together

248
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,840
everybody be able to put their two cents

249
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,560
in and be able to come up with the most

250
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:11,679
regulated and well-worked industry that

251
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,800
we could all come up because i think

252
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,800
everybody agrees

253
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,160
nobody wants this anywhere near children

254
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,478
nobody wants this anywhere near

255
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,520
teenagers this is a an adult use

256
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:23,038
product as is alcohol and it should be

257
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:26,000
treated no differently we

258
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:28,399
i think we'd all agree on that yeah i

259
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,160
certainly agree with you

260
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:31,519
okay perfect i've got a question for you

261
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,240
about now and i'm going to let you go

262
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:35,199
first

263
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,479
timeline for legalization what's your

264
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,479
dream scenario

265
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,759
and your kind of expectations of reality

266
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,038
martin's laughing because he already

267
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:43,418
gave out to me for my comments on this

268
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:46,159
people

269
00:08:43,418 --> 00:08:49,039
[Laughter]

270
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:51,039
my my dream is to have it legalized

271
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:53,519
tomorrow i have a legalized yesterday

272
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:54,159
like we are ireland as a country are

273
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,560
falling

274
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:58,159
so far behind the rest of the world

275
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:00,159
we're being laughed at

276
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:02,639
like we are absolutely being laughed at

277
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,799
globally by experts of

278
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,000
just our draconian laws our draconian

279
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:08,319
approach

280
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,240
it is ridiculous like ireland as an

281
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,120
agricultural economy have the

282
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,000
perfect island and the perfect scenario

283
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,480
to introduce

284
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,278
cannabis legalization and have it

285
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,000
homegrown

286
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:21,600
and have an irish industry of it and

287
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,039
irish products are loved all over the

288
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,560
world and i'm sure cannabis and hemp

289
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:25,679
won't be any different when the time

290
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:27,439
comes

291
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:30,000
so i think realistically i'd love to

292
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,519
have it done tomorrow that is my dream

293
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,958
but how long are we stuck with this

294
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,759
government who aren't going to engage

295
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:35,919
with us

296
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:37,360
and that's what i'll base my answer is

297
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:38,079
on how long are they going to be in

298
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,080
government

299
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,399
how long before we actually have

300
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,519
meaningful change and a meaningful

301
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,679
government that are actually going to

302
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,799
listen to the people and implement what

303
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:48,799
we want implemented

304
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:50,319
and implement what we need in this

305
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,319
country and a way forward in this

306
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,440
country

307
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,200
okay yeah

308
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,800
i certainly don't think natalie's wrong

309
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,160
in what she's saying i would agree with

310
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:02,159
her that uh

311
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:03,278
currently as it stands the way we look

312
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:05,360
at the scene

313
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:07,200
and i think we we are looking at until

314
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,360
the government changes

315
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,480
and but what i'm hoping to do i do see a

316
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,159
way in which like if

317
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,240
i didn't like the answer natalie gave us

318
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:16,159
she said and uh that that was

319
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,759
at the end of gino's event but i do

320
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:18,639
believe that they're not wrong on what

321
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:20,319
they're saying but

322
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,720
i do believe we can change that we can

323
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,920
speed it up and it's the the people can

324
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,320
be the catalyst in it

325
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:28,000
and that that's my that's why i'm out

326
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,040
there engaging in civil disobedience

327
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,120
protests

328
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:33,519
um because i i don't want to give

329
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,600
legitimacy to the law by respecting it

330
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,320
it's a it's a law that disrespects me

331
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,759
it discriminates against me and i don't

332
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,600
want to give it legitimacy and i don't

333
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:43,120
think anybody out there all should be

334
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,800
giving it legitimacy i think we should

335
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,799
be all marching down to the

336
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:48,078
guard station presenting ourselves

337
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:50,799
whether it be in in

338
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:52,719
kind of a solidarity with little collins

339
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:54,399
or whether it be just in solidarity with

340
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,278
the cannabis community at large

341
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,559
um we don't deserve this treatment and i

342
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:02,000
i think we could bring

343
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:02,799
the system to a halt and by people just

344
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,559
showing up at

345
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:06,240
the doors of a guard station and

346
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:08,399
together collectively

347
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,600
and just saying look we're here and

348
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,879
we're breaking this law

349
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,519
and um go do your job now if if you can

350
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:15,360
at all

351
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,039
um i believe if the whole community

352
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,560
stood up and actually engaged in

353
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:20,799
a meaningful way in this massive

354
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:22,559
disobedience kind of campaign

355
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:24,958
and the guys at the top would have no

356
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:25,199
choice but to address the issues because

357
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:27,919
the

358
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,399
the people working on the the floor they

359
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:30,159
won't be

360
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,839
able to keep up with the paperwork that

361
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:33,278
they wouldn't even have enough

362
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,800
room there to keep up with the share

363
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:36,000
volume of paperwork that would have to

364
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:38,240
go through the station

365
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,120
to deal with what i would hope would be

366
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,000
a very large

367
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,360
campaign of civil disobedience again as

368
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,759
it stands currently there's about a

369
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:49,039
two-year backlog in the the court system

370
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:51,120
so that's you have a right uh in

371
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:53,120
under your human rights i believe uh to

372
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,759
a speedy an expedient

373
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,039
trial and so if the backlog gets the

374
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:59,039
tree in foyers

375
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:00,240
i believe again another breach of your

376
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:01,679
your human rights there

377
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,759
where you're not even getting your trial

378
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,679
seen to in an expedient time

379
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:07,519
because i do believe that the misuse and

380
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:08,799
drugs act that has violated our human

381
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,480
rights in in more ways than our

382
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:11,199
constitutional rights in more ways than

383
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,079
one

384
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,959
and um yeah i think we we we have an

385
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:20,000
opportunity now really just to take uh

386
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:21,679
the system and bring it to a halt

387
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,278
but i think like with the little collins

388
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:24,799
thing recently for many

389
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:26,799
in the cannabis community like martin is

390
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:28,319
doing this a lot longer than i am

391
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:30,159
it's the straw that broke the camel's

392
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,720
back for many people like enough is

393
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:32,958
enough

394
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,000
like you're gone beyond targeting

395
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:35,679
cannabis users

396
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,759
and personal possession now you're now

397
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:38,799
targeting cbd like it's getting a bit

398
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,159
ridiculous now

399
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,838
and i think it is the straw that broke

400
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:44,000
the camel's back for a lot of people

401
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,000
and

402
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,480
it's a pity that that was the straw

403
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:49,119
because their business at the end of the

404
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,480
day and that

405
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,879
they knew the risk that they were taking

406
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,120
but there's been patients up in front of

407
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:56,399
judges before i've seen i've reported on

408
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,278
cancer patients who have been

409
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,919
criminalized for

410
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:01,039
growing cannabis and the judge would

411
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:02,799
completely dismiss

412
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:04,639
all of their claims that they were used

413
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:07,120
are growing it for medical reasons

414
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,879
and there was never an outpouring of

415
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,399
support from the cannabis community for

416
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:12,720
for those people um

417
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,559
unlike uh what little collins has got

418
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,920
and i commend the community for it i

419
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:17,919
think it's great but i would love to see

420
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:19,679
that reflected to each and every person

421
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:20,958
who's brought the court for a cannabis

422
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:22,479
conviction because

423
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:24,078
we're all in this together we're all

424
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,039
being targeted by the same misuse of

425
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:27,120
drugs act

426
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:28,559
and it's discrimination i believe it

427
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,240
better it is

428
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:32,000
yeah now and i think little collins got

429
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,720
the media uh

430
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,600
behind us with uh the use of social

431
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,519
media at the moment

432
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,959
not every case gets to see the light of

433
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,519
day unfortunately

434
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:43,119
and some do slip through the cracks um

435
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,360
i'm gonna finish on one last topic

436
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,639
and i think it's something that it's

437
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,639
worth highlighting

438
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,079
our irish cannabis community seems to be

439
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,079
growing every week

440
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:53,919
seems to be new young entrepreneurs you

441
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:55,759
you educated voices

442
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:56,958
some current educated voices who've been

443
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:58,559
doing this decades you've been doing

444
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:59,359
this long time again like yourself

445
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:01,359
martin

446
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,120
um it's in a good positive place at the

447
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,919
moment would you agree

448
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,560
and a second question do you think we

449
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:10,479
need a centralized database now

450
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:12,559
to start gathering all the different

451
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,199
businesses and different publications so

452
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:16,000
we can

453
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:17,838
present this as a create a jobs report

454
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,120
and maybe kind of try and present some

455
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,279
financial

456
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,720
data to the politicians and prove how

457
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:24,320
much this industry is worth to the

458
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:31,839
government

459
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:31,839
like i don't think that ultimately

460
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,480
what they're going to listen to the most

461
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,159
is money yeah

462
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,519
they're not going to listen to sob

463
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:41,600
stories they're not going to listen to

464
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,959
all this poor fellow that poor girl

465
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,639
they're not going to listen to any of

466
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,239
that what they're going to listen to

467
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,480
is money and money talks when you're

468
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,639
talking to the government

469
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,759
and i think if you can present them with

470
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,560
a realistic

471
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:55,600
realistic workable situation i think

472
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:58,879
there will be a lot

473
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,920
faster to listen then if you just if you

474
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:01,360
kind of like oh

475
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:02,799
just turn up with sob stories shall we

476
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,240
say no they're not sob stories either

477
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:07,599
because they're valid people and they're

478
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,600
they're important in their lives

479
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,079
if you're being ruthless like you can

480
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:13,359
get immune to the substories

481
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:15,120
as you were saying it's about having a

482
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,000
bit more depth behind that

483
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,440
yeah and i think like you you do have to

484
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,679
like even in my i've done a couple of

485
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,680
tweets recently where they've

486
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:25,120
uh confiscated x amount of cannabis and

487
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:28,078
i've said right 20

488
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,639
basic 20 v80 look how much is going back

489
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:30,638
to the revenue

490
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,560
if you break it down that simple i think

491
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:36,159
they will actually listen

492
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:37,838
but i think at the same time they're

493
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:40,240
probably uninterested

494
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,040
and frankly they probably couldn't be

495
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,240
bothered

496
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:43,519
they don't want to do the work for

497
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,120
themselves they don't want to do the

498
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,879
research they don't want to

499
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,480
actually see if this if cannabis

500
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:50,720
legalization is a viable

501
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,079
option so i think it's on the shoulders

502
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,360
of everybody else to

503
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:55,278
turn around and present this to

504
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,399
government

505
00:15:55,278 --> 00:16:00,000
yeah agree martin yeah i would agree

506
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,480
with you there certainly that the uh

507
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,759
the cannabis community is growing uh in

508
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,320
more ways than one

509
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,278
um certainly online that there's been

510
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,040
more and more uh

511
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:10,559
people stepping out of the shadows and

512
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:12,480
becoming vocal around it

513
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:14,559
um i wish there'd be more vocal all

514
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,759
along and uh we're even louder in their

515
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:18,638
support uh people like

516
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,480
blind boy um like he kind of came into

517
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,399
this situation there recently

518
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,159
and but again i would love to see maybe

519
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,320
somebody like blind boy uh engage in a

520
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:27,360
civil disobedience protest if he uh

521
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,360
believes that cannabis should be

522
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,879
legalized so much because uh

523
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,680
you're not put put your uh money where

524
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:35,198
your your emotion kind of thing uh

525
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:36,559
but but uh yeah i definitely do think

526
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:38,000
the cannabis community is getting a lot

527
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:39,758
stronger and there's

528
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,600
uh definitely moves being made by the

529
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,959
activists now to try to form a

530
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,800
centralized

531
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:46,719
kind of movement to try to bring all the

532
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:49,679
different groups in under the one

533
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,000
umbrella in order to unify our voice and

534
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:52,078
so

535
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,919
we can be stronger more uh more

536
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:56,000
efficient in uh being

537
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:57,120
heard by the politicians i think it's

538
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,958
important that we're all

539
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,720
pretty much uh saying that the same

540
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:02,958
things um

541
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,720
and we can't really do that until we

542
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:06,159
start having conversations together so

543
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,519
there is efforts there to bring the

544
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,880
cannabis community

545
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:12,480
uh together um not just so or so to the

546
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,079
border but not north of the border too

547
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,720
it seems like there's an all ireland

548
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:16,798
affair

549
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,880
um happening at the moment within the

550
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:21,439
cannabis community uh bought norton so

551
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,400
even across the the pond in the uk it

552
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,759
seems like uh

553
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:29,360
the the branches are all the general run

554
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,359
together um so to speak

555
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:33,519
yeah nowadays it's excellent to see the

556
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,080
industry grow as it is and i hope that

557
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,839
uh

558
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:37,199
we can maybe do this once every two

559
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:38,558
months or something like that get the

560
