1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:03,599
foreign

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,120
welcome everybody to the next episode of

3
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:14,459
the Cannabis review I'm delighted to

4
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:16,500
join in this episode by Nicholas Milne

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,480
who's the co-founder in CSO at Danish

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,640
based company octarine how you keeping

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,740
today Nicholas good thank you and

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,060
yourself I'm very well thank you very

9
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:25,679
much for taking your time to do this

10
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:27,419
sure

11
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:29,759
do you maybe want to give everybody an

12
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,800
overview of your position in your sector

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,239
and how you guys came about to found

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,020
octuring

15
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:38,640
yeah sure so uh my background is and my

16
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,399
co-founder's background is in yeast

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,219
fermentation and synthetic biology which

18
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:47,340
basically means we engineer the Genome

19
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,899
of of yeast to produce new and

20
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,879
interesting compounds by fermentation

21
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,759
and basically it's Akin I don't know if

22
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:55,259
you know but the yeast is this

23
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:57,479
microorganism that makes beer and wine

24
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:59,399
and bread and all these wonderful things

25
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:00,959
we we know and love but by playing

26
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,058
around with this genome you can get it

27
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,879
to produce other interesting compounds

28
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:08,280
basically in the same apparatus so our

29
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:10,739
fermentation process looks very very

30
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,200
similar to a process you'd see at a

31
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:15,599
brewery or at a drug manufacturing

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,719
facility what we do differently is we we

33
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:21,359
get that yeast to produce uh compounds

34
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:24,359
that it wouldn't natively produce

35
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:27,118
so we work within uh the psychedelics

36
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:30,060
value chain to manufacture psychedelics

37
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:31,739
we see a lot of difficulties in

38
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,540
extracting psychologists from their

39
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:36,298
native hosts particularly psilocybin

40
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,939
from mushrooms mushrooms aren't the

41
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,140
easiest organism to cultivate and

42
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:42,839
particularly they're very difficult to

43
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,640
standardize so we see fermentation as

44
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,439
this really nice Middle Ground where we

45
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,780
can get all of the sustainability

46
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:51,359
benefits of fermentation but we can

47
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,879
offer a much more consistent and stable

48
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:56,039
supply of of these compounds and

49
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:58,319
importantly uh cost one of the the big

50
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,060
advantages of yeast fermentation is the

51
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,879
cost that we can produce these molecules

52
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,460
and just as a rough input we're aiming

53
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:08,699
for to be to be able to develop or to

54
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:10,439
provide GMP grade psilocybin for dollars

55
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:12,419
per gram and even perhaps even lower

56
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:14,878
than that so the cost benefits are

57
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:17,098
really really significant

58
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:18,959
okay can we maybe break down the

59
00:02:17,098 --> 00:02:21,419
difference between using fermentation

60
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,580
and biosynthesis for cannabinoids and

61
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:25,738
for psilocybin obviously psilocybin

62
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,140
let's with Starbucks first the quantity

63
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:30,599
of psilocybin per mushroom or per plant

64
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:33,719
is not replicable over and over again so

65
00:02:30,598 --> 00:02:36,299
large-scale cultivation is not really a

66
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:37,680
a solution for large-scale drug

67
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,620
Discovery and development is that

68
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,959
correct well it is possible we just

69
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,060
argue that it's not very efficient so as

70
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,640
just a rough example

71
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,259
um psilocybin producing mushrooms they

72
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:52,018
produce psilocybin in the range of about

73
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:54,419
one percent dry Mass

74
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:56,939
um the the problem though is that on top

75
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:58,679
of producing psilocybin these mushrooms

76
00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:00,180
also produce a range of structurally

77
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,340
related compounds so these are the

78
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,560
intermediates byproduct degradation

79
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,300
products and from a purification point

80
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,000
of view you have to invest a lot of

81
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,379
additional resources to separate your

82
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,680
compound which in this case is

83
00:03:10,378 --> 00:03:15,359
psilocybin from the Myriad of other

84
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,519
structurally related compounds so it

85
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,739
does add a further complication step

86
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,180
it's also I mean and you know this if

87
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,400
you go to the supermarket and buy

88
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,379
mushrooms mushrooms are a hearty

89
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,900
creatures there are they have this tough

90
00:03:25,378 --> 00:03:29,039
outer layer they're very difficult to

91
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,260
kind of

92
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:33,658
um burst open and so you have to invest

93
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:36,419
a lot of resources in order to get the

94
00:03:33,658 --> 00:03:39,598
psilocybin out in contrast with our

95
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:41,518
fermentation method our yeast it grows

96
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:43,979
sensationally well in large scale

97
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,259
fermentation it simply secretes the

98
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:48,000
psilocybin into the surrounding media so

99
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:50,399
from a purification point of view that's

100
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,979
much easier and I think most importantly

101
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,480
our strains they only produce psilocybin

102
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:57,598
they produce nothing else that even

103
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:59,158
looks remotely similar to psilocybin so

104
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:01,798
from a purification point of view that

105
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:04,139
also makes it considerably easier

106
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:06,959
and so we can pretty much say the future

107
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:09,000
of this ingredient side about psilocybin

108
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,400
and rare cannabinoids is going to be

109
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,500
fermentation for the environmental

110
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,900
impact that it has the scalability it

111
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,120
has and as you said the dollars per gram

112
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:20,040
price do you see this over the next 10

113
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,120
years being the dominant player when it

114
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,280
comes to this out of the ingredient

115
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,040
Market

116
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:28,799
yeah we see it and yeast fermentation is

117
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,780
used to produce already a surprising

118
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,319
number of the ingredients in your daily

119
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:35,879
lives it's used to make vaccines

120
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:38,519
pharmaceutical drugs it's used to make

121
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:39,899
food ingredients biofuels bioplastics

122
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:42,299
that's already out there and

123
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:44,039
surprisingly large quantities I think

124
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,960
the area where it hasn't quite

125
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,460
penetrated to the to the extent as other

126
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:51,180
Industries is in small molecule

127
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:54,120
Pharmaceuticals so we see this as an

128
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:56,040
emerging application and when we looked

129
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,199
at psychedelics we you know psychedelic

130
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,479
the industry is being built mainly from

131
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:02,100
the ground up right this is not an

132
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:04,500
existing industry it's being built from

133
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,840
scratch and we see this as a really good

134
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,759
way to incorporate sustainability from

135
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:11,099
the outset instead of having to develop

136
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:13,680
an unsustainable industry and later go

137
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,900
in and improve it we see an opportunity

138
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,600
to use that from the get-go and we see

139
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:20,279
fermentation as the the most realistic

140
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,900
way of achieving this

141
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:23,459
and now let me move on to the

142
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:25,739
cannabinoid side of the industry

143
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:28,079
obviously everybody knows about CBD and

144
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,600
THC as the most prominent cannabinoids

145
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:32,698
but we all know that there's over 120

146
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,080
plus carnabinoids now when it comes to

147
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:36,900
those rare cannabinoids that are

148
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:40,198
available only in my new percentage is

149
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:42,060
the same process applied to psilocybin

150
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:44,038
or is there a different technique that's

151
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:46,139
used to extract these rare molecules

152
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:48,538
that that are at small scales

153
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:50,699
so in theory the story is very similar

154
00:05:48,538 --> 00:05:53,459
right the the cannabis plant produces

155
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:55,860
100 different 120 different compounds

156
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:58,379
most of them an incredibly my news

157
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:00,860
amounts how do you gain access to those

158
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:03,538
but I think a key difference is that

159
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,220
cannabinoids are notoriously complicated

160
00:06:03,538 --> 00:06:08,699
molecules and the way that the

161
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:10,919
biosynthesized is extremely complex and

162
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:13,860
far more complex than than most people

163
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:16,560
realize and so actually as a production

164
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:19,439
system the cannabis plant is in our

165
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,360
opinion probably the most efficient way

166
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:23,399
to get your hands on these molecules and

167
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,199
what we've seen in the last few years is

168
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:27,719
that we've seen in particularly breeding

169
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,978
techniques allowing us to gain access to

170
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,319
some of these these more rare

171
00:06:28,978 --> 00:06:33,379
cannabinoids So in contrast to

172
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:35,759
psychedelics we we actually see

173
00:06:33,379 --> 00:06:37,680
plant-derived cannabinoids as and

174
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,000
particularly a rare plant-derived

175
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,978
cannabinoids there's actually being the

176
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,800
major driver of the cannon bird market

177
00:06:40,978 --> 00:06:45,538
where we fit into this value chain is so

178
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,240
we we don't have an interest in

179
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:50,399
manufacturing cannabinoids we think the

180
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,918
plant is doing a fantastic job it's

181
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:54,899
cheap it's readily available the problem

182
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:56,519
we see with cannabinoids is their their

183
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:58,799
properties and anybody who's worked with

184
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:01,379
cannabinoids knows that issues around

185
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,300
their solubility their stability and

186
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:05,579
particularly their bioavailability a

187
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,720
really rate limiting steps and so

188
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:09,180
actually what we're doing in this

189
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,280
industry is we're using fermentation and

190
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:14,879
again sustainable bio-based approaches

191
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:16,739
to convert natural cannabinoids into new

192
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:19,019
and improved compounds with these

193
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:21,360
improved properties so with this very

194
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:23,339
simple fermentation based method we

195
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,879
produce cannabinoids that are fully

196
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:29,279
water soluble are extremely stable and

197
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,899
have very high bioavailability and we

198
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:33,179
see this combination as really The Way

199
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:35,818
Forward where the cannabis plant

200
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:37,439
produces the molecules we improve them

201
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:38,759
and that's the product that makes it to

202
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:41,339
Market

203
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:43,680
we hear a lot of talk about the full

204
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:45,719
spectrum effect of all the cannabinoids

205
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,579
that come from a plant together is the

206
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,280
future of this industry if we're able to

207
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:53,519
biosynthesize molecules individually

208
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:55,859
creating new formulations that may not

209
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:57,959
necessarily already exist in the plant

210
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:01,080
but are more advantageous for whether

211
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:02,339
it's inflammation or whatever ailment it

212
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:05,459
may be

213
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:08,698
yeah so we do see this uh talked about a

214
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:09,899
lot the the the idea that multiple

215
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:11,960
cannabinoids and perhaps even

216
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:15,179
cannabinoids met with terpenes

217
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:16,680
synergistically work together to have an

218
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,780
improved effect and that that definitely

219
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,560
seems to be something that's happening I

220
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:21,179
think

221
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,519
when we talk about things like full

222
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:25,019
spectrum versus individual compounds I

223
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:27,359
think that's more of a reflection that

224
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:28,680
we don't fully understand how all of

225
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,020
these different molecules work together

226
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,820
and so until we really understand that

227
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:34,500
the strategy is just to to mix

228
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:37,020
everything together and assume that

229
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,639
they'll all work together the way that

230
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:41,699
we see it is that in the future I think

231
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:43,740
we'll understand in much more detail how

232
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:46,980
specific cannabinoids interact together

233
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:49,320
and we do see formulations where perhaps

234
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:52,620
it's a mix of two cannabinoids and maybe

235
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,600
a terpene that gives the over

236
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:56,940
overwhelmingly the therapeutic effect so

237
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,259
instead of having to mix you know a

238
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,660
hundred different cannabinoids together

239
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:02,399
you can just mix two or three perhaps

240
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:05,039
with the terpene and and that is your

241
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:07,799
therapeutic product

242
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:10,199
do you guys at octuring work on your own

243
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:11,939
formulations or use singly just focused

244
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,500
on distribution we create the molecules

245
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:17,580
and we bring them to companies who then

246
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:19,320
work on formulation is there a a big

247
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,540
need and a big want to get into the

248
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,260
formula formulation creating side of

249
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:25,379
things

250
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:27,899
so we're firmly a business to business

251
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:29,580
company so we work with um consumer

252
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:32,519
Brands but also pharmaceutical companies

253
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,920
or drug development companies to advance

254
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:36,600
products made by fermentation down the

255
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:39,240
value chain so in the case of something

256
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,740
like psychedelics we would work with uh

257
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,480
yeah mainly with pharmaceutical

258
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:45,240
companies to take lead candidates into

259
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,039
the clinic on the cannabinoid side we

260
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,379
work with consumer Brands who are really

261
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:52,399
looking at specific cannabinoids to get

262
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:54,838
into consumer products so for example uh

263
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:57,179
consumer facing company a might be

264
00:09:54,839 --> 00:10:00,240
really interested in a water-soluble

265
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:02,458
version of CBD consumer Company B might

266
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,259
be really interested in CBG and we

267
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:07,079
developed the manufacturing process to

268
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:09,659
get those products into Market

269
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,220
how important is the Teeter amount when

270
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:13,259
it comes to the competition between

271
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,940
other companies in your Market is it is

272
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:16,740
a case of whoever gets the highest grams

273
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:20,100
per liter per hour is the winner of the

274
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:22,259
race or is there a scale of Purity that

275
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,778
can that can be more advantageous thing

276
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:27,120
going for the higher quantities

277
00:10:24,778 --> 00:10:28,919
yeah so at the end of the day cost of

278
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,720
goods is the the most important

279
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:32,819
parameter right how much does it cost to

280
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,040
produce a kilogram

281
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:37,760
tiger is a really important aspect of

282
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:40,740
that but it's by far not the only

283
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:42,360
important thing to consider so we

284
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:46,019
consider yeah so tighter is a really big

285
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:48,240
thing but actually the most important

286
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:50,459
factor when it comes to costs is is the

287
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,860
cost to purify how much do I have to

288
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:55,319
invest to separate my molecule of

289
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:58,800
interest from the sometimes complex

290
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,420
fermentation broth and that I think is

291
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:03,299
is where at least in our point of view

292
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:05,939
is where most of them the r d investment

293
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:09,000
has put and how to purify

294
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:11,339
and is choosing the correct substrate a

295
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,500
difficult task or is it the same for

296
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:17,700
most companies

297
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:20,299
so I mean so so sugar is by far the most

298
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:23,100
commonly used bulk ingredient it's

299
00:11:20,299 --> 00:11:25,078
incredibly cheap particularly compared

300
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:28,379
to the cost of the product right if

301
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:32,399
we're producing psilocybin at dollars

302
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:33,958
per gram glucose is cents per gram and

303
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,940
maybe even a little bit less than that

304
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:38,578
so I would say that

305
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:40,019
at least on the Psychedelic side not

306
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:42,359
many companies are thinking more

307
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:44,519
complicated than just adding sugar in

308
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,300
the in the case of cannabinoids I

309
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:47,399
actually think it's a little more

310
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:49,799
complicated it's as I said producing

311
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:51,958
cannabinoids is notoriously difficult

312
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:54,359
and producing it from glucose or other

313
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:55,859
sugars is is actually complicated as

314
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,839
well so I know that many other companies

315
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:59,399
are using sort of intermediates of the

316
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,399
biosynthetic pathway so things like

317
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:04,019
hexanoic acid which is more expensive

318
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,419
than glucose but it does make the

319
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:08,578
production process more efficient

320
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:10,259
when it comes to the biosynthesis of

321
00:12:08,578 --> 00:12:13,139
cannabinoids is everybody starting with

322
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:15,179
olivetylic acid and geranophosphate and

323
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:17,159
combining those for cbga or is there an

324
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:18,419
easy entry point to start with THC or

325
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:21,600
CBD

326
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:23,578
so CBD and THC have for the most part

327
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,320
the end of the biosynthetic pathway so

328
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:27,059
there's not that many things you can

329
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,680
convert these cannabinoids and so

330
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:30,899
there's a few degradation products and

331
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:32,819
things like that the first

332
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:35,639
um sort of common intermediate is is

333
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:38,399
either hexanoic acid or in the case of

334
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:40,439
producing them the kind of big three THC

335
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:44,639
CBDs and

336
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:46,740
CBD CBG THC then all of italic acid is

337
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,320
is kind of the starting point wherever

338
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:51,379
you start there is a cost factor to

339
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,579
consider right glucose is cheapest

340
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:55,919
hexanoic acid is more expensive Olive

341
00:12:53,578 --> 00:12:58,078
italic acid is more expensive again so

342
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:00,958
it really determines where your cost of

343
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:03,899
goods comes from I think the the goal of

344
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:06,239
synthetic biology is always to produce

345
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:09,600
complex molecules from very very simple

346
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,579
starting substrates so any synthetic

347
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,379
biologist always prefers to start from

348
00:13:11,578 --> 00:13:15,059
glucose or something similar like that

349
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:16,679
as the starting point because that's

350
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:18,778
that's always going to be the cheapest

351
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:20,759
process but if there are difficulties

352
00:13:18,778 --> 00:13:22,860
with the biosynthetic pathway like in

353
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:24,539
the case of cannabinoids then an

354
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,220
alternative could be something like one

355
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:28,139
of the intermediates

356
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,820
would we be right in saying that the

357
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:31,500
future especially in Europe at the

358
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:33,180
ingredient side of whether it's food and

359
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:35,458
beverage in cannabis or beauty and

360
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:37,439
makeup or Discovery development is going

361
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:39,838
to be led by the biotechnology companies

362
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,760
that the scalability and ability to just

363
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,380
extract extract from plant matter won't

364
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,179
be able to compete

365
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:47,578
I think it really has to be taken on a

366
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:50,278
case-by-case basis you know

367
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:51,539
again as a synthetic biologist we wished

368
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:54,659
we lived in a world where we could

369
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:56,699
out-compete every other process but

370
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:58,860
there are many examples where plants are

371
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:00,480
just cheaper and so I don't think you

372
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,100
can just apply a one-size-fits-all

373
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,800
approach you really have to look at the

374
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,360
individual compound you have to look at

375
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,578
the market that it's being applied to

376
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,740
and really holistically look at the best

377
00:14:08,578 --> 00:14:13,078
way of of bringing that product to

378
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:15,539
Market in many cases the plant wins and

379
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:17,638
that that's okay we we believe that for

380
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:20,338
cannabis that the plant is going to win

381
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:21,419
over any other technique but there are

382
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:23,760
many other cases where different

383
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:25,259
molecules that makes uh Financial sense

384
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:26,879
to go for something like yeast

385
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:28,679
fermentation

386
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:30,360
it's been absolutely fascinating talking

387
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:32,159
to you Nick I wish we could have a

388
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,899
longer episode but we're nearly our 15

389
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:35,458
minutes time now for anybody who hasn't

390
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:37,019
ever checked out after in I highly

391
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,939
recommend it the website is below and

392
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:40,198
it'll be in all the descriptions but for

393
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,940
now Nick thank you very much for your

394
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:43,740
time it's very much appreciated

395
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:46,060
yeah thanks a lot nice to talk to you

396
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:49,539
until next episode everybody

397
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:49,539
