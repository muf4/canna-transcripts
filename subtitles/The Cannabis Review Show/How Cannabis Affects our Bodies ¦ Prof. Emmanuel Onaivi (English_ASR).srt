in puerto vallarta in mexico on the

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,719
international

20
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,719
behavioral neuroscience society and of

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,280
course my symposium would follow that

22
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,879
from japan from mexico and from spain

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,800
we are all going to be talking about the

24
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:53,119
advances in

25
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:54,799
the especially the exhibit to receptor

26
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:56,320
research

27
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,320
well that's i'm delighted to have you on

28
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,719
the show to talk about these topics

29
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,238
do you want to give people briefly uh a

30
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,679
little overview on your work in the

31
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:06,959
cannabis industry so far

32
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:08,959
and how you ended up in william

33
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:10,798
patterson university

34
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:13,039
it's a long story but i'll try to cut it

35
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,240
short so i finished my phd from the

36
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,640
university of bradford in england in

37
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:18,719
neuropharmacology

38
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,879
i moved directly to the united states to

39
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:23,679
do my postdoctoral fellowship

40
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:26,000
in that in the laboratory of the very

41
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,920
prominent scientist his name is dr

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,200
billy martin of unfortunately he's

43
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,600
diseased

44
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,439
and we worked especially on the

45
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:36,239
cannabinoid system

46
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:38,559
and for 30 years now i've been hooked on

47
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,719
this cannabinoid system research

48
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,960
and it has led to a number of numerous

49
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:44,798
discoveries not just by my group

50
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,798
but by others i've worked with in the

51
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,960
past including

52
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,600
the cloning of the cb1 receptors the

53
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:54,319
identification

54
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:56,399
of different systems that are involved

55
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:58,478
in the effect of cannabis that has shed

56
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,920
a lot of light

57
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:03,519
in the mechanism of action of cannabis

58
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,920
and the fact that the body the human

59
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:07,438
body makes its own natural

60
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,280
marijuana-like substances that are

61
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:12,318
called endocannabinoids

62
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,598
and i would um and um

63
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:17,598
i would and during this presentation i

64
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:22,318
will make more

65
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:24,560
addition to this endocannabinoid system

66
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:26,958
brilliant i'm delighted to have you on

67
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,560
the show as i said i've done research on

68
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,680
your work so far and as i said you're

69
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,959
one of the gentlemen that i've been

70
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,599
looking forward to chatting to

71
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,959
uh by having the show so i'm basically

72
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:36,479
gonna get i just wanna ask you a quick

73
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,439
question before we kick off

74
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,399
over in ireland we had this uh lobbying

75
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,120
group who are

76
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,039
anti-um cannabis who basically came out

77
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,920
saying that cannabis is the biggest

78
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,719
danger

79
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:50,799
to children's mental health of the next

80
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:51,359
10 years do you think this is a rubbish

81
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,280
statement

82
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,120
somebody with the level of education

83
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,158
that you have

84
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,280
it's a very good question because yes

85
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:00,799
why marijuana

86
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,318
the science as you are going to hear me

87
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,680
talk about today

88
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:06,958
and has exploded and we have significant

89
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,439
new knowledge

90
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,680
and some of these myths and stigma that

91
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:14,079
still revolve around marijuana because

92
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,200
of prejudice and prohibition

93
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,200
that cautionary statement is correct

94
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:21,119
and that is children should not be

95
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,958
exposed or pregnant women should not be

96
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,480
exposed to cannabis

97
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,759
why because the brain is still

98
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:30,798
developing but for adult use

99
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:32,079
the current explosion of cannabis use

100
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,599
across the globe

101
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,239
and it is very important for those

102
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:38,959
advocates to know that no one

103
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,080
anymore can stop the use of cannabis as

104
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,280
medicine

105
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,400
and as recreational use however

106
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,199
you must also add that this is not for

107
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,120
children

108
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:50,798
because their brain is still developing

109
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,280
this is not for pregnant women

110
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,480
at this time but but paradoxically i

111
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,799
will show you

112
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,598
that even in the the the marijuana

113
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,280
system

114
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:00,719
or the cannabis system called

115
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,840
endocannabinoids is

116
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:06,318
intricately involved in reproduction is

117
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,438
intricately involved in growth of the

118
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:10,079
newborn

119
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:10,959
and therefore this current knowledge new

120
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,920
knowledge

121
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,000
allows there's no medicine without side

122
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:18,959
effect so it allows the use

123
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,079
of cannabis but with stipulation that

124
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,680
this is not for

125
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,918
for children and this is not for

126
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,519
pregnant women

127
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,680
okay brilliant thank you very much for

128
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:28,959
clearing that up can you tell the

129
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,120
audience a little bit about the

130
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:32,879
advantages in cannabis research

131
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,759
things seem to be going on leaps and

132
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:37,918
bounds as new or indeed happens

133
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,759
in the industry so as somebody's at the

134
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:41,918
tip of the sphere of this sector

135
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,319
what would you see is the new advances

136
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:46,319
that we can look forward to seeing

137
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:47,599
there's a lot of advances in fact is

138
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,759
explosive

139
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,479
the reason for this is that this

140
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,759
advances in cannabis research had lagged

141
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:56,478
behind

142
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,560
other natural abuse drugs like morphine

143
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:01,758
like cocaine like tobacco

144
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,120
because of years years of prejudice and

145
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,360
prohibition

146
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,319
now there has been an explosion as we

147
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,560
said earlier

148
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:10,879
of new knowledge on cannabis research

149
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,360
and it has been transformed

150
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:14,959
into mainstream science not just

151
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,759
mainstream science but also in main

152
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:17,599
street

153
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,720
and the stigma is being shared as i

154
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,800
mentioned earlier at breathtaking speed

155
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,320
this new knowledge these new advances

156
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,240
include one

157
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:27,519
the decoding of the cannabis plant

158
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,319
genome with

159
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:32,079
the coding of the cannabis plant genome

160
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:33,360
what that means is that you can now be

161
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:36,000
able to

162
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,360
to to cultivate cannabis depending on

163
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,800
what you want to use it for

164
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,560
of course i'll talk a little bit about

165
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,560
cbd also

166
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,399
the second major discovery apart from

167
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,959
the human genome that is also been

168
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:49,279
decoded and mapped

169
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:51,038
the next major discovery which is almost

170
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:53,839
10 years old now or more

171
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:54,639
is the discovery of that the human body

172
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:57,038
makes its own

173
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,120
natural cannabis-like substances that

174
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:00,800
are referred to as

175
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,759
endocannabinoids first discovered in

176
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,439
israel

177
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,038
and undermined was first of these

178
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:07,839
substances discovered

179
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:10,478
and undermined is a sanskrit word

180
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:13,918
meaning eternal beliefs

181
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:15,038
and furthermore two ag two arachidonic

182
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:17,680
glycerol another

183
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:19,839
cannabis-like substance was also

184
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,240
discovered in the human body

185
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:23,918
and it became very clear that there is

186
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,639
no cell in your body

187
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:27,439
there is no system in the human biology

188
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,478
that does not

189
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:30,959
involve this natural endocannabinoid

190
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:34,240
system

191
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:36,638
even um even you and me

192
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,879
so let me give you the first example one

193
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,759
during fertilization

194
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,719
for the sperm to fertilize the egg you

195
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,160
require this

196
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,039
natural endocannabinoid to pierce

197
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,919
through the egg

198
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:50,879
and fertilize the egg once that egg is

199
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:52,719
fertilized

200
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,120
that egg travels through the fallopian

201
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,080
tube and anchors in the uterus

202
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,160
and the cell starts to divide in biology

203
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:02,399
for that cell to implant an

204
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,520
anchor in the uterus you require this

205
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,239
natural

206
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:07,038
marijuana-like substances this

207
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,960
endocannabinoids okay

208
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:11,519
at that critical time as i mentioned

209
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:14,159
already during implantation

210
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:15,359
if a woman smokes marijuana there might

211
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,720
be

212
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,160
the propensity for miscarriage so what

213
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,440
i'm telling you right now is that an

214
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:26,160
appropriate level a balanced level a

215
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,680
homeostatic level of this natural

216
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,520
marijuana-like substances

217
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,840
is very important for appropriate

218
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,038
pregnancy for you to be born or for me

219
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,439
to be born

220
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:36,079
and when that baby is finally born guess

221
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:39,120
what

222
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:41,439
the breast milk is now loaded

223
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,879
with this natural cannabis-like

224
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:45,839
substances to do what

225
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:47,038
to give the baby appetite appetite to

226
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,198
feed and grow

227
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:50,560
in summary what i just told you is that

228
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,240
this new discovery of this

229
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,519
endocannabinoids that is

230
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,199
important and involving all types of

231
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:59,439
cellular components is very very

232
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:03,680
important

233
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:06,240
yes please continue

234
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,360
do you want more the cloning cannot be

235
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,960
no receptors you can go

236
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,199
to that next yeah hit us up

237
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:16,079
right so the next one in terms of

238
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,080
cannabinoid receptors is the cloning

239
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:20,560
and the characterizations of cannabinoid

240
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:22,000
receptors this is another significant

241
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,639
advancement because

242
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,759
it became clear that the receptors that

243
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:30,720
are activated that are turned on by this

244
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:33,200
cannabis-like substances and the

245
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,959
exogenous the marijuana-like substances

246
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,759
because the marijuana-like substances

247
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,359
include

248
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:40,000
i mean cannabis-like substance you can

249
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,800
exchange exchange the two the

250
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,080
cannabinoid

251
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:46,000
the cannabis plant contains over

252
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,720
a hundred let's just put it over a

253
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,519
hundred chemicals including the terpenes

254
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,160
including the flavonoids and this has

255
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,240
been

256
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:55,278
now well studied because the major

257
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,320
psychoactive

258
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:59,919
component of cannabis is called thc they

259
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,519
are called cannabinoids

260
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:04,240
and that is why the one made by the

261
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,320
human body is called endocannabinoids

262
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,240
and then many of these compounds have

263
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,839
been characterized and classified

264
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,000
including cbd

265
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,680
cbd is referred to as cannabidiol which

266
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,958
is now gaining a lot of attention across

267
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:17,120
the globe

268
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:18,719
however these receptors the major ones

269
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,080
that have been characterized so fast

270
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,320
referred to as cb1

271
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,320
cannabinol receptors it turned out that

272
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,720
the cb1 cannabinoid receptors is the

273
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,839
most

274
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,680
abundant binding site the most

275
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,920
abundant protein producing the human

276
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:33,679
brain and testis and the uterus

277
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:35,519
and therefore they play very significant

278
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:36,958
physiological role

279
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,039
what has been controversial was the

280
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,000
discovery of the cb2 where i became very

281
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:42,879
prominent

282
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,600
the cb2 receptor was pre previously

283
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:45,759
cloned

284
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,080
by monroe in england and when they

285
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:50,319
cloned the cb2 cannabinoid receptors

286
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,360
it was not found in the brain and

287
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,200
therefore

288
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,720
it for many years it was thought that it

289
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,120
was not in neurons

290
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,959
neurons in the brain but here was my

291
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,320
major discovery that yes

292
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:04,559
this cb2 receptors is also in neurons

293
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,480
and it's also in microglial cells the

294
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:08,399
immune cells of the brain

295
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,000
and therefore this has changed now that

296
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,958
controversy that cannot be not

297
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,320
controversy

298
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,838
and this is why i'm very happy to be

299
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,519
involved in any type of controversy at

300
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,079
all in the globe especially if you

301
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,600
consider that you are correct otherwise

302
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:21,120
one more point about cannabinoid

303
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,480
receptors because there are many now

304
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,200
that we are discovering they are called

305
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,079
them

306
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,959
putative cannabinoid receptors perhaps

307
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:31,439
there will be cb3c4 cb5

308
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:32,799
but between the cb1 and cb2 they are

309
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,959
subtypes

310
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,319
subtypes of cannabinoid receptor one a

311
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:38,399
one b one c

312
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,079
one d depending on the species depending

313
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,399
on which animal

314
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:43,278
and the cp2 also in mice and humans that

315
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,879
we use for

316
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:49,838
studies is also cb1a and cb1d

317
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:51,759
and for that characterization one more

318
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,959
advancement that is surprising to me is

319
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:56,240
that you know yeast

320
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:58,799
right yeast is used to make bread right

321
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,320
yeast is used to make beer that a lot of

322
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:04,240
people like to consume

323
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:07,278
guess what now years can be used to make

324
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:10,560
to genetically engineer cannabinoids for

325
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:12,240
cannabis based medicine for the future

326
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:14,239
that's another significant advancement

327
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,519
an exciting science actually

328
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,600
wow amazing wealth full of information

329
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,959
so far yeah we're meant to do 15 minutes

330
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,200
of a funny feeling we'll be going longer

331
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:24,879
than this with you

332
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,399
i think we'll move on to the next topic

333
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:28,078
is basically something that i'm sure a

334
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:31,120
lot of people think they know about

335
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:33,278
but how does cannabis affect our bodies

336
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,560
this is a very good and this is this is

337
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:36,879
one of the significant

338
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:38,719
advances that has led for cannabis now

339
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:40,958
that has unraveled

340
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,000
our eyes for cannabis to be used not

341
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:46,078
just for medicine

342
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,240
but also for recreation medically

343
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:50,319
as i said there's no part of the human

344
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,000
biology and physiology that does not

345
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,399
have this cannabis system

346
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,078
this endocannabinoid system and

347
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,360
therefore when the level is too high

348
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:02,239
or too low especially in psychiatric

349
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,440
issues you can see the involvement of

350
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,919
this system

351
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,000
whether it is too low or too high that

352
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:10,399
the it needs to be

353
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,320
brought to a homeostatic level and

354
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,759
therefore you can see that there's a lot

355
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,959
a lot of application in the way it

356
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:19,439
affects the human body for medicinal use

357
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:20,000
whether it is for anxiety whether it is

358
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,360
for

359
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,240
depression for example and one of the

360
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,240
other

361
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,680
major issues and the discovery is the

362
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,480
what we call mix

363
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:31,359
and stigma that surrounds the use of

364
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,120
cannabis

365
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:37,680
one prominent one is the fact that men

366
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,240
that who use marijuana or who use

367
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:42,719
cannabis bound to stick with cannabis

368
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,519
they have low sperm count what we now

369
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,519
know

370
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,078
anecdotally and from many other

371
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,839
scientific research in the united states

372
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:51,519
is that actually sperm count is

373
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,240
increased

374
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,480
in men that use cannabis and i just went

375
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,240
over also how

376
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,480
fundamentally it is very involved in

377
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,360
reproduction in our bodies reproduction

378
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,000
between the sperm

379
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,919
is called acrosome reaction in the body

380
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,320
when the sperm fertilizes the egg as i

381
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,199
said

382
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,200
earlier it is called acrosome reaction

383
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,920
the head of the sperm

384
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,720
the sperm is carrying like a helmet and

385
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:19,360
then when it pierces through the egg

386
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,639
it's faster like it it delivers the

387
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,680
genetic material

388
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:26,320
from the sperm to the egg

389
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:28,000
and then that fusion that fertilization

390
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,120
when it occurs

391
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,440
indicates the the undeniable

392
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,519
use of canna of cannabis for

393
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:39,279
reproduction by the human body

394
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,278
and that is why when there is some

395
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:42,799
homostatic imbalance homeostatic

396
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,958
imbalance

397
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:45,919
then there could be miscarriage there

398
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,719
are other

399
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:49,599
uses including bone for example in bone

400
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,720
health

401
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,278
including um skin and now as you're

402
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,440
going to see

403
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:57,600
in the future the recreational use is

404
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,360
beyond anyone to stop

405
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,278
especially i think maybe this is the

406
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,000
most important component

407
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:05,198
in the legalization for recreational use

408
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,278
as well as

409
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:12,799
as well as medicinal use one

410
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:15,759
there will be a quality control

411
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:16,559
in canada the whole of canada marijuana

412
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:20,000
is now legal

413
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:22,000
even in in the in supermarkets

414
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,278
where you can go to get whatever type of

415
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,879
cannabis because there are different

416
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:25,759
types right there are different types of

417
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:27,439
cannabis

418
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:30,240
it cannot be sativa they cannot be

419
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,639
syndica and they are subspecies

420
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,278
so so the care that is important is that

421
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:38,000
when there is quality control

422
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:39,759
then you cannot just be using cannabis

423
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,919
that is illegal

424
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:44,399
because if you go out to the streets to

425
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:46,639
just get any type of cannabis now

426
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,639
you don't know what is left with it what

427
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,600
is accompanying that cannabis

428
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:54,000
so that means the regulation and the

429
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,040
quality control is very important

430
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,159
for the medicinal as well as

431
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:59,599
recreational use

432
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:01,360
one other example is that there's

433
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,320
something called epileptic cesius in

434
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,800
children

435
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,000
in epileptic cesius there's the dravet

436
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:09,359
syndrome

437
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,600
the linux dash test syndrome and in this

438
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,159
syndrome in children two years old

439
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,159
the united states of america the fda has

440
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:19,120
approved epidiolex

441
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:21,519
or the cbd in particular for the use in

442
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,519
childhood epileptic seizures

443
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,078
yet the federal government of the united

444
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:30,240
states it is still illegal

445
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:31,679
to use cannabis and for anything

446
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,919
but different states now have now

447
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:37,439
legalized the use of cannabis

448
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:41,198
and recreationally about 33 or 36

449
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:44,240
and maybe about 11 or 12 inclusive

450
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:46,639
for recreational use so yes

451
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,399
cannabis is very very promiscuous

452
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,399
cannabis-like substances in the human

453
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,639
body is very promiscuous

454
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,958
mexico just also approved that

455
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,120
netherlands has been used in netherlands

456
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:59,599
for different purposes for many many

457
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,440
years over 40 years

458
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,040
and yet the whole world is now waking up

459
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,160
that this is real good medicine this

460
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:06,838
natural medicine

461
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:08,319
is important in all of our daily

462
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,680
function yeah

463
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,120
well i couldn't agree with you more it's

464
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:13,198
going to be a green wave that just

465
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,839
sweeps the globe over the course of time

466
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:15,599
so

467
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,959
i can't thank you enough for coming on

i'm sure everybody got a huge amount of

471
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,000
knowledge from that show as much
