this as brief as we possibly can i just

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,679
want to give the audience an overview on

14
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:31,919
what's happening in the cannabis lending

15
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:34,558
space at the moment and can you maybe

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,719
give it everybody an overview of at the

17
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:37,839
polaris fund that you've set up to deal

18
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,960
with specifically with the cannabis

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:44,239
industry sure so poor's equity group was

20
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,320
the first us-based domestic lender in

21
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:49,119
the country um we

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,520
entered the space in about 2016

23
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:54,238
and since that time we've done about 69

24
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,199
deals for about 430 million

25
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:59,759
and we're taking that lending platform

26
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:01,759
and we're starting our initial

27
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:04,558
due diligence to look at the european

28
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:07,759
market um in other markets to bring that

29
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:09,840
same lending platform to provide gut to

30
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,359
cannabis use property owners across

31
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,040
across the country and

32
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:14,959
basically now in in europe and some

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,799
other countries as well

34
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:18,079
okay incredible so basically bringing a

35
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,640
state of finance to the european

36
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:22,798
industry as well can you maybe i was

37
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,359
reading about your java's 11.8 billion

38
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,280
round of funding that you recently did

39
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:29,920
what are the metrics you look for in a

40
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,599
good uh investment opportunity what are

41
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,359
the top two things that you at the

42
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:36,478
pollures fund would look for

43
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,920
great so regardless of what country that

44
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:38,959
we're landing in we're always going to

45
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,840
look for

46
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:43,919
a very experienced cannabis operator

47
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,399
who may or may not be the owner of the

48
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,240
building typically they are what we call

49
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,320
a owner user

50
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,640
the next most important thing is we want

51
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,959
a strong sponsor

52
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,280
to support that transaction

53
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:59,679
most of the transactions that we do

54
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,599
are uh value-add meaning that we are

55
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,399
providing the capital to acquire and

56
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:05,599
build the facility as a bridge loan and

57
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,680
then from there they're going to

58
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:09,919
refinance that loan with a lower cost

59
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,239
lender once it's fully built and in that

60
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,719
model we need an extremely strong

61
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,840
sponsor that has the personal balance

62
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:19,598
sheet uh income and credit to support

63
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,719
the size of the loan that they're

64
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:22,799
borrowing so

65
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:24,719
if it's somebody that's trying to borrow

66
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,560
you know like that 11.8 million dollar

67
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:28,239
transaction we need to have somebody

68
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,560
that can support that whether it's an

69
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,800
individual or a corporate guarantee um

70
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,039
to do that transaction so the other

71
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,120
thing is is that we require a commercial

72
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:39,840
piece of real estate meaning that we'll

73
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:43,280
do commercial buildings and or

74
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,680
greenhouses but no agricultural deals so

75
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,519
sometimes there is land tied up with the

76
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,120
commercial buildings but we're giving

77
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,879
our value to the buildings not to the

78
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,640
land

79
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:55,199
okay amazing and you guys have seen i

80
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:57,439
see you're at the icbc in berlin next

81
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,518
week um are you seeing germany as the

82
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:01,680
kind of first step into europe for you

83
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,080
guys or have you been in discussions in

84
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,760
malta or denmark or other territories in

85
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,640
this side of the world

86
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:08,799
it's

87
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:12,079
so preliminary right now and we just

88
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,760
returned from the icbc in london a

89
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,280
couple of weeks ago

90
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:18,799
and what we're trying to get comfortable

91
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,318
with is how does any of the european

92
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,879
market work

93
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:25,119
if you can import from other countries

94
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:27,039
that don't have to go through the the

95
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,959
same ultra high

96
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,759
building compliance and employee

97
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,598
expenses and electric expenses and all

98
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:36,158
the other expenses that are

99
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:38,238
so high in these in the european union

100
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:40,719
let's just say and you can have

101
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,158
countries that are able to import

102
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:44,719
we're trying to get our arms wrapped

103
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:46,639
around how this is going to work for

104
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:47,680
those uh for these countries if they're

105
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:49,518
going to

106
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,439
build their own facilities within their

107
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,719
own country or within the european union

108
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,639
so this is the first thing that we're

109
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:56,239
trying to really get our arms wrapped

110
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:58,639
around to make us feel comfortable if

111
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,039
we're going to do any lending in

112
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:04,079
the european union or in europe if you

113
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:05,519
could import at a lower cost

114
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,799
yeah what i think what will happen over

115
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,640
in europe you're obviously going to have

116
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,159
the low cost import options that are

117
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:13,119
going to be available but we're renowned

118
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:14,959
for farming over here and i see genetics

119
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,560
and different strains being created in

120
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,560
each different country over here that's

121
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,879
going to be unique to this part of the

122
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,519
world that'll almost be like wine to a

123
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,719
degree that especially special farmers

124
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:26,399
are going to be able to create specific

125
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,919
genetics that make their industry that

126
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,439
little bit better and i think we're just

127
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:31,519
a couple of years away from that you see

128
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:32,800
germany obviously at the moment it's now

129
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:34,799
a raise to who can get the cheapest

130
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,160
flower in like it kind of does in in a

131
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,160
lot of the industries but i think you're

132
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,479
going to start to see once the the

133
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,560
agriculture and farming grounds or

134
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:44,240
bodies allow this you'll start to see a

135
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,319
huge amount of talent flow into this

136
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,519
industry then

137
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,959
yeah we're anxious to see that um i had

138
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:53,120
the same

139
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,879
type i had the same

140
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,959
thought process as you

141
00:04:54,879 --> 00:05:00,560
comparing california markets which has

142
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:01,918
the brand name and the the strains um

143
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,478
and for the rest of the country and

144
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:06,799
thinking that those those other states

145
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:08,560
across the country um would not be able

146
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,360
to compete with strains and things like

147
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,959
that

148
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,680
and i've had to evolve that that

149
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:15,439
thinking process after i've uh toured

150
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,000
many facilities that are in emerging

151
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:21,360
states that now already have

152
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,600
uh the caliber and quality of high

153
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,919
high end product that would compete

154
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,639
easily head to head with california and

155
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:28,560
so

156
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,720
we have to understand is this going to

157
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,038
happen here in uh the you know the

158
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,880
european union and so we have to think

159
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:37,439
about okay how long does it take to

160
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:39,279
start the importation process

161
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:41,279
when you're importing into germany or

162
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:43,119
wherever it might be from the day that

163
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:46,159
paperwork is submitted until that

164
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,918
product lands um in the european union

165
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,160
is that product going to be able to

166
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:52,000
compete directly with something that is

167
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,600
uh grown domestically within the

168
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,478
european union so these are the things

169
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,479
i'm i'm trying to to learn myself about

170
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:00,399
while we'll be uh well we'll be there

171
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:01,758
and we'll be touring some facilities and

172
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:03,679
looking at what's happening there and

173
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,439
trying to understand the pros and cons

174
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,918
of what might happen and when the

175
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:10,079
legislation is still not decided it's

176
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:12,000
it's difficult to start making big uh

177
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:13,758
you know making bets and and trying to

178
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,160
see how it's going to go

179
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,520
um in the united states uh nothing has

180
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,240
really happened for quite some time

181
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,918
since since our the most consequential

182
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,759
legislation passed there which was the

183
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:25,439
roebuck or blumen hour amendment that

184
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,520
defunded our department of justice for

185
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:29,038
prosecution and the hemp act which

186
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:30,560
doesn't really apply exactly to what

187
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:32,399
we're doing

188
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,079
yeah now i think you said at the start

189
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:35,839
of the show as well operators are one of

190
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:37,519
the things that you look for in an

191
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:39,439
investment i think that's going to be

192
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:41,439
the case over here realistically

193
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:43,439
california's got amazing flower due to

194
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:44,879
climate colombia and some of the south

195
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:47,038
american territories and portugal to a

196
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:49,038
degree can compete with that but

197
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:51,519
if you understand hvac systems

198
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:54,318
environmental control systems you really

199
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:55,680
just need an amazing operator and uh i

200
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,759
think you're going to be able to compete

201
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,478
because realistically when you're when

202
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,240
you're comparing 24 percent thc to 26

203
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:04,318
thc the consumer doesn't really know

204
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,680
that they understand that the flavonoids

205
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,039
and the terpenes and the flavors and

206
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,720
smells that they're going to get out of

207
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:11,918
the plant and what it's going to look

208
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:15,520
like compared to the strength i think

209
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:18,318
yeah um we agree um it it's a it's a

210
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:20,318
process for the consumers um typically

211
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,400
as new markets emerge they're willing to

212
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,879
take uh inferior products because

213
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:26,799
they're available um and what's

214
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:29,038
interesting about that is that typically

215
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,000
the illegal products are superior in

216
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:33,199
quality so eventually hopefully those uh

217
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,120
those legal

218
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,160
products will get to the same quality

219
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,560
that the uh domestic consumers are going

220
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,800
to appreciate and look for those premium

221
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,360
high-end brands that make sense to grow

222
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,478
them domestically yeah another market

223
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,038
i'm looking forward to seeing as new

224
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:50,959
york come on board in september now

225
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:53,120
some of the genetics that the hipsters

226
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:56,159
in brooklyn are going to be producing i

227
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,720
think is going to be pretty amazing

228
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,280
yeah um you know each of these genetics

229
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,759
are um it's one thing to have one that's

230
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:05,918
an amazing brand but you have to have it

231
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,639
to be a consistent genetic that can

232
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:11,038
continually reproduce and and that's

233
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,720
there's more to it than just having a

234
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:14,878
one-off product that you can say look at

235
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,639
this this this amazing strain if you to

236
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,879
produce that consistently

237
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,280
is a a challenge that every brand is

238
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,479
going goes through to to to make chairs

239
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:24,000
that they have a consistent quality of

240
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:25,758
product at all times

241
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,120
yeah that's why you see denmark are

242
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,199
probably the leaders in europe at the

243
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,720
moment when it comes to cannabis flare

244
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,919
just from their ornamental flower

245
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,158
industry and the fact that they have

246
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:35,918
government back in in finance as well

247
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:38,000
i'm gonna just jump on to the next topic

248
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:40,079
uh before i let you go and it's how to

249
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,839
value a cannabis company now everybody's

250
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,919
kind of seen the canadian nightmare

251
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,680
that's happened over the past six to

252
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:47,120
seven years with the billions of dollars

253
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:49,599
that have been wasted

254
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,600
what are the core metrics for evaluating

255
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,519
a cannabis company let's say that's a

256
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,320
year in business is does it have to have

257
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:59,360
iep is it an ipta rating is it what is

258
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:02,480
the core metrics for a man of your level

259
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,159
sure so us um unfortunately it's a

260
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,879
case-by-case scenario for every

261
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:09,759
transaction that we're looking at but

262
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:11,200
the first part for us is that we're not

263
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:14,399
valuing

264
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,399
per se the the value of the company um

265
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,559
for the cannabis operator that's not our

266
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,639
job because we're not utilizing

267
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:22,399
the cannabis company or the enterprise

268
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,639
value of the cannabis company

269
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,559
as our lending basis we're purely

270
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:29,039
evaluating the cannabis operator on

271
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:30,879
their level of experience and typically

272
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:33,759
that might shake out in their

273
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,480
performance of how they've done thus far

274
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:36,480
but

275
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,800
not always necessarily we want to see

276
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,120
that that cannabis operator has the

277
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:42,479
experience and capability to to they

278
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,080
don't they're not trying to learn how to

279
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,320
cultivate already they've already

280
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,160
figured that part out and so for us when

281
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,240
we're looking at a facility we're

282
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:52,799
looking at we establish our lending

283
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,240
basis off of the value of the facility

284
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:55,439
the tenant improvements and the

285
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,000
equipment that are going into that

286
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,160
facility so for us it's a lot more

287
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,440
easy to extrapolate what the value is

288
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:03,439
because we're only lending off with the

289
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,839
real estate basis and not off the

290
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,760
enterprise value of the company

291
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,680
okay so pretty much anybody in the

292
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,200
manufacturing edibles can fit into this

293
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:12,559
category because the equipment and the

294
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,440
the property they're going to have is

295
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:16,159
going to be

296
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,240
of value same way as pre-roll machines

297
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:20,799
and facilities so you kind of fit into

298
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,480
every facility or facet of the industry

299
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:24,799
yeah most of the time people are going

300
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,800
to come to us for larger builds is

301
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:27,759
what's happened in the our domestic

302
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:30,639
program

303
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:32,799
um and uh you know being that cannabis

304
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:35,039
is going to be is legal in each of these

305
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,479
states federally the banks will be able

306
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:38,159
to lend there and so when you have a

307
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,079
smaller facility that's that's

308
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:41,360
extraction or something like that

309
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:43,519
the bet you might be able to get a

310
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,879
traditional loan on that um we'll have

311
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,879
to see how that plays out too but

312
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:49,679
typically the banks are not going to

313
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:51,519
value these properties the same way you

314
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:54,319
would a commercial typical commercial

315
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,560
facility and so that's usually where we

316
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,399
become a lending advantage we understand

317
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:59,919
the cannabis market we understand how to

318
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,120
build these we understand how to process

319
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:02,799
the draws we've got all that

320
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,959
infrastructure in place and we've

321
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:07,278
competed in the in the us against banks

322
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:09,518
for 30 years and it's it's there's no

323
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:12,000
way they can compete with us on a uh

324
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,000
value add or construction type loan once

325
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,440
that facility is fully stabilized

326
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,600
meaning that it's cash flowing on its

327
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,720
own then you can start looking to uh

328
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,079
traditional banks to refinance that debt

329
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,680
okay amazing it's a wealth of

330
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:25,759
information i know you're a very busy

331
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:26,958
man so i won't take up too much more

332
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:28,399
time i look forward to seeing you at

333
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:29,679
