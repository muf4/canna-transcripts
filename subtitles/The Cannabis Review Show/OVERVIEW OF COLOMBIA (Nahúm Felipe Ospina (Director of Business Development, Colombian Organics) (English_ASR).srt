thank you very much for taking your time

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,018
to do this

8
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,400
no thank you for you for the invitation

9
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:31,259
um can you maybe give everybody a little

10
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:32,759
overview of your history in the Cannabis

11
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,260
industry today and your position at

12
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,359
Colombian Organics

13
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:39,718
yeah right now I've been working in the

14
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:42,200
Cannabis industry for five years I've

15
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:46,200
been working in commercials in projects

16
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:48,120
in the production instruction but right

17
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,180
now I'm making the commercial part since

18
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:53,038
like three four years ago working in

19
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:55,259
this difficult industry that's not easy

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,539
and especially here in Colombia because

21
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:59,519
you know you have all the laws you have

22
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,320
the government and everything else but

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,539
my experience goes especially to

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,079
commercialize and the marketing

25
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:09,000
advertising of the Cannabis industry and

26
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:12,900
of course helping all the companies to

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,438
sell their products Airway flowers

28
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:19,680
instructions whatever they have

29
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:21,839
okay very interesting and first topic I

30
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,420
wanted to jump up was basically an

31
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,219
overview of Colombia can you maybe give

32
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,340
everybody I know we had it was Medical

33
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:31,019
in 2016 Industrial in 2019 and then

34
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,900
potentially an adult use market now in

35
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:35,399
2023. can you maybe tell everybody how

36
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,439
expansive is the medical program

37
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,359
currently and do you know a rough number

38
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:41,819
of patients that are on it

39
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:44,700
yeah right now the problem uh with the

40
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:46,798
medical programs is that it's not really

41
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,600
together they are not working together

42
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,960
with the companies and the government

43
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:54,059
and they have their companies here uh

44
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:57,719
the access is still really difficult to

45
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:59,579
the patients they need a long process

46
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,920
it's really bureaucratic for that reason

47
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:05,399
so medical cannabis right now in

48
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,500
Colombia is specialized in cosmetics and

49
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:11,280
other kind of products that are not like

50
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:13,979
medical like the pharmaceutical products

51
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,340
we were waiting for uh obviously

52
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:20,219
especially for the for the technology we

53
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,140
have here also we don't have like all

54
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:24,500
the stuff and all the people for the

55
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:27,958
kind of products that we need for

56
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:31,080
pharmaceutical product to the medical

57
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:34,020
patients uh talking about the industrial

58
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:37,080
the industrial hemp for example we don't

59
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,879
have so developed the market for for

60
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,660
this kind of products because they don't

61
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:41,939
have

62
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:44,219
we don't have the extensions in Colombia

63
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:45,959
we have like like all the land and it's

64
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:48,419
really good and Colombia has really good

65
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:51,420
conditions all year round but the

66
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:53,339
problem is the extensions and the

67
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:56,039
Machinery that you need for this

68
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:58,439
extraction for the hemp that is really

69
00:02:56,039 --> 00:03:01,739
different from the USA that they have so

70
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:04,500
big volume of this production

71
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:07,319
and right now that you tell it uh last

72
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,959
week we lost the chance to have the

73
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:13,079
approval of the adult use in Colombia

74
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:15,300
because they because in the Congress it

75
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,840
didn't pass it didn't pass the the bill

76
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:21,719
from the Congress we just miss it for

77
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,000
five boats of the Congress but you know

78
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:26,098
they have time this year they are going

79
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,560
to present it again so maybe next year

80
00:03:26,098 --> 00:03:30,299
we have the good news for the auto use

81
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,219
in Colombia

82
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,580
okay and can you tell me what makes

83
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:37,800
Colombian organic so special in the the

84
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:41,340
expertise areas that they have

85
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:43,319
yeah the best part from Colombia is uh

86
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,259
the experience that we have in flowers

87
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:47,699
that we have in flowers and genetics we

88
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:50,759
have really good experience because we

89
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:56,639
we will be working with flowers like uh

90
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:59,939
70 years ago uh when we started from uh

91
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:02,339
different kind of flowers like roses uh

92
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:04,680
sunflowers tulip ones those kind of

93
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:08,640
flowers and other experience were

94
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:12,840
translated to the Cannabis industry and

95
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:14,839
we have these uh low-cost uh jobs for

96
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,819
the for the people it's really low cost

97
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:20,519
uh it's really good for us the land is

98
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:23,939
really good it's really 30 for us the

99
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:26,280
procedures we are used to agricultural

100
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:29,040
procedures but the only thing that we

101
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:32,059
are missing right now is like the the

102
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:37,199
company over bu or the company

103
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:40,439
uh we see like Farmers farming but not a

104
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,900
company it's cells a big Enterprise we

105
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:44,519
need to understand hus Farmers has a

106
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:47,519
company

107
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:49,258
okay you see a lot of talk in Europe and

108
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:51,240
I'm sure a lot of investors talking

109
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:53,220
about Colombia are going to be a future

110
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,120
supplier for the European side of the

111
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:59,160
industry is the is it the lack of

112
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,899
technological equipment is this is the

113
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,699
thing that's hindering large-scale

114
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:04,918
export from Colombia

115
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:07,500
yeah kind of kind of the lack of

116
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:09,719
Technology as always because you know uh

117
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,399
we are always talking about Colombia and

118
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,380
Latin America has the raw material

119
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:16,739
suppliers but that's what we need to

120
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:19,319
transform here we need to focus on high

121
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,060
technology products added value products

122
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,159
not just the raw material what's

123
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:26,339
happening right now we are we are being

124
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:29,039
or we are seeing in Europe has the raw

125
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:31,978
material in the case of dry flour for

126
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:35,399
example that is just the first step in

127
00:05:31,978 --> 00:05:37,500
the process of the cultivation you know

128
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:39,959
um but what's happening right now we are

129
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:42,418
just stopping in that time of the moment

130
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:45,299
the same that happened with coffee with

131
00:05:42,418 --> 00:05:47,639
coffee a couple of years were like just

132
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,978
making raw material raw material and

133
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:52,079
exploring the raw material to bring back

134
00:05:49,978 --> 00:05:54,240
a final product you know that's what we

135
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:57,418
need to do with the Cannabis but right

136
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,538
now we not too many years making the

137
00:05:57,418 --> 00:06:02,698
final product here but the lack of you

138
00:06:00,538 --> 00:06:05,819
know of technology is is something that

139
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:08,639
is really difficult here and also their

140
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:09,959
certifications uh I I totally in

141
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,879
conversations before that the

142
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:15,060
certifications it's really important for

143
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:18,060
us because we are uh a company or we are

144
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,639
a country from Farmers you know Farmers

145
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,918
don't have

146
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:24,538
the they don't they don't they don't not

147
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:27,478
used to

148
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:29,399
work with big companies big procedures

149
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:31,199
uh big Enterprises so they don't

150
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:33,478
understand this about the certification

151
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,360
if you talk with uh some Farmers here

152
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:38,879
about the ACP they don't even know and

153
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:41,759
imagine that we we need to make some

154
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:44,459
final products with the GMP for example

155
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,500
they don't know what is GMP and they

156
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:48,599
don't know what it means that that's

157
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,399
part of the problem also and we

158
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,439
discussed before I think it's truly

159
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:54,899
we're the only company with the GMP

160
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:57,418
certification is it in Colombia the rest

161
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:59,399
are the model is to export to somewhere

162
00:06:57,418 --> 00:07:01,859
like Malta and then that facility in

163
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:03,899
multi will have EU GMP certification

164
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,280
exactly that's the only solution that we

165
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:08,939
have right now there's only one company

166
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:12,119
here with the GMP and they even had to

167
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:13,918
bring someone from Germany to get that

168
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,079
certification and that's that's a big

169
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:18,180
problem and that says a lot uh from a

170
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:19,918
country that it's it's a post that is

171
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:23,459
specializing in the economics industry

172
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:26,159
that we don't have uh dnp certifications

173
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:28,379
here yeah uh what are making the other

174
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,360
companies they get the gacp

175
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:33,360
certification from National companies

176
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:36,660
from natural institutes and uh taking

177
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,160
abroad to Portugal where they transform

178
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,319
into GMP

179
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,180
and is there a certain certification

180
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,160
that's required for export into the

181
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,800
United States and Canada

182
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,979
uh right now not because you know the

183
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,199
USA Market is just opening the doors to

184
00:07:49,978 --> 00:07:54,360
the Latin American Market they are just

185
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:58,699
waiting uh they're just asking for the

186
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:01,400
total panel the quality panel of the

187
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:05,098
policy for example heavy metal

188
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:07,079
pesticides microbiology all that panel

189
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:09,000
of the laboratory but they are not

190
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:12,418
asking right now for certifications

191
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,418
Canada it's a difficult country but then

192
00:08:12,418 --> 00:08:17,839
they are just asking for jacp it's the

193
00:08:15,418 --> 00:08:17,839
minimum

194
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:22,079
I saw recently one of your posts and it

195
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,519
was a good question that I wanted to ask

196
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:26,159
you one of the kind of successful

197
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:29,038
countries in Latin South America has

198
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,379
been Uruguay so far can you tell me what

199
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:32,158
Colombia can learn from the Uruguayan

200
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:36,300
model

201
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:39,899
yeah I I think I I tell it in the in the

202
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:41,579
past uh but is the

203
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:44,158
they were really close with the

204
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:47,160
institute in Uruguay you know Uruguay is

205
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:48,549
uh 3 million population country so it's

206
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:49,799
really easy to them

207
00:08:48,549 --> 00:08:51,719
[Music]

208
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:53,059
to work with the companies really close

209
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,899
with the Institute with the National

210
00:08:53,059 --> 00:08:56,759
Institute for City International

211
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:59,759
Institute that is regulating right now

212
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:02,580
to cannabis and that's a missing

213
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:05,879
we don't have that relation so close

214
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:09,000
with The Regulators for example we had

215
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:11,519
here we have many institutes that is uh

216
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,980
in charge of the procedures and you need

217
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,659
to make a procedure here uh procedure in

218
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:18,240
another Institute but they are not

219
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:20,039
connected between them so it's really

220
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,839
difficult disconnection with the

221
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:24,778
Institutes of the government

222
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:28,560
I think that's one and the other one is

223
00:09:24,778 --> 00:09:30,860
the they they specialize in the first

224
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:33,919
moment or in the first year

225
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:37,139
understanding the needs of the market

226
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:39,479
they really understood that since the

227
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:41,639
first moment and that implies for

228
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,519
example that they brought the generics

229
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:46,439
from Switzerland from Europe and they

230
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:48,778
are cultivating the genetics why because

231
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:52,019
they understood that they if you want to

232
00:09:48,778 --> 00:09:54,179
export to if you want to export to to

233
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:56,100
Europe you need the genetics from Europe

234
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:58,559
you need the genetics that you like from

235
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:01,139
Europe so that's really good point for

236
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:03,659
from to learn from your wife

237
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:06,000
and when it comes to Colombia on the

238
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:07,679
extraction side of things we obviously

239
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,360
know that you guys are world class at

240
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:12,120
the farming cultivation side of things

241
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,278
how many extraction facilities exist in

242
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:17,419
Colombia and do they excel at the same

243
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:17,419
level as the cultivation

244
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:23,100
uh they are not at the same level of the

245
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:25,559
cultivation uh you're missing a lot of

246
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,899
companies making construction here but

247
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:30,539
what happens for example the cost of

248
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:32,519
extraction here is really high it's

249
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:35,939
really really high because of the volume

250
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:38,339
because of the technology for example uh

251
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:40,980
because of the relationship between the

252
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:43,200
between the companies as I told you more

253
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,899
or less right now that I can remember uh

254
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,180
maybe more than

255
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:51,059
400 license for extraction for 100

256
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:54,179
license for extraction but from those

257
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:59,159
400 just operating really really

258
00:10:54,179 --> 00:11:01,319
operating no more than 50 companies so

259
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:03,179
it's it's really difficult for

260
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,180
Destruction companies here

261
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:08,958
because the same the volume is not

262
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:11,699
really good for the expensive that it

263
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:13,799
represents to extract here different

264
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:16,740
from the USA you know from the USA you

265
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:19,019
have a big company a big factory making

266
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:21,778
structure because they have a lot of

267
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:23,039
hemp for those destruction you know the

268
00:11:21,778 --> 00:11:25,259
instruction for the extraction for

269
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:28,559
example here the full spectrum our broad

270
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:31,259
spectrum is more expensive here even if

271
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:33,958
the flower is cheaper but the process of

272
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:36,179
Destruction is really expensive

273
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:38,518
okay and the company you work for

274
00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:41,219
Colombian Organics you have more than 25

275
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:43,259
years experience in this sector can you

276
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,940
maybe explain what sets of Colombian

277
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:47,100
Organics differently from the other

278
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:49,440
companies that are in Colombia and what

279
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,759
the future Ambitions for the company may

280
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,820
be

281
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:57,360
I I can assume it uh I can't resume it

282
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:59,760
really well in two word genetics on

283
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,379
flowers the experiencing flowers from

284
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:03,659
the company because this is a familiar

285
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:07,679
company and the family is been working

286
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:09,480
with flowers from 50 years ago from a

287
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:12,659
recognized company here in Bogota and

288
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:15,420
Colombia but uh genetics genetics is

289
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:19,199
like the the main point from for them

290
00:12:15,419 --> 00:12:22,199
because they specialize in making that

291
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:25,079
final hunting uh taking the best

292
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:27,060
genetics to the cultivation taking the

293
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:28,919
best procedures for this reproduction of

294
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:33,119
the genetics and that's why we have

295
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:33,958
right now seeds in UK in Thailand

296
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,078
um

297
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:39,239
soon in Switzerland United States we

298
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:42,120
have also the the seeds and soon in

299
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:45,120
Argentina for the same so that's why we

300
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:46,980
know or we are recognized in Europe and

301
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,720
in the market because of the experience

302
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,940
and the trustable that is the company

303
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,800
working with genetics because you know

304
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:54,660
it's not easy working with genetics

305
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:56,219
because it's not the the final product

306
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:59,039
it's a product that you are going to

307
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:00,720
have after the cultivation but the trust

308
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:02,278
that the companies are the owners of the

309
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,820
company have been making with this

310
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:08,338
company with all the commercial fares

311
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:11,700
it's really good and they trust people

312
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:13,760
Trust on them and in the experience from

313
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:16,139
the company

314
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:18,240
and when it comes to the political

315
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:20,459
overview in Colombia we we see around

316
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,039
the world that it's generally the

317
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:24,838
Democratic side of the politics are are

318
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:26,699
leaning towards an adult use market and

319
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:28,560
the conservatives are more one just a

320
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,420
medical Market is that the same in

321
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:34,439
Colombia

322
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:37,259
yeah it it happens the same in some ways

323
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:39,360
that's why uh last week we lost the

324
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:42,659
opportunity to regulate the adult use

325
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:45,419
because of the conservative uh body they

326
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:48,838
were saying like no we denied that

327
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:51,479
option because they have all these kind

328
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:52,459
of tops that it's not for the Cannabis

329
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,039
industry

330
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:58,679
uh but in one way or another the world

331
00:13:56,039 --> 00:14:01,259
needs to regulation the regulation of

332
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:03,899
the of this plant you know it's it's

333
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:07,439
more the benefits than the but when you

334
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:10,259
make it and results uh show it you know

335
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,660
Canada is a good example or why is the

336
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:15,778
best example for example

337
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:17,819
um it's not perfect but it's better than

338
00:14:15,778 --> 00:14:21,480
having a black market

339
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:23,940
on streets with their kids with all

340
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:26,879
their bad on the negative part of the

341
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:28,860
black market in the cannabisi industry

342
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:30,659
yeah I agree with you I know you're a

343
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:32,579
very busy man so last question before I

344
00:14:30,659 --> 00:14:34,379
let you go what is the top two things

345
00:14:32,578 --> 00:14:36,179
that you look forward to seeing over the

346
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:38,458
next couple of years happening in

347
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:40,919
Colombia

348
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:44,219
the first thing is that the farmers

349
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:46,979
understand that they are working with

350
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:48,860
companies internationally that they need

351
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:52,699
to understand they need to see

352
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:55,259
themselves themselves to us uh

353
00:14:52,698 --> 00:14:58,919
Enterprises big companies with

354
00:14:55,259 --> 00:15:01,439
procedures uh with good Productions and

355
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:02,639
the second one understand the market if

356
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,660
you don't understand the market you

357
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:08,579
could have the best uh production the

358
00:15:06,659 --> 00:15:10,379
best production plants and the best

359
00:15:08,578 --> 00:15:13,799
production projects

360
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:15,480
but uh it's useful if you don't have the

361
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:17,819
market you know

362
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,199
