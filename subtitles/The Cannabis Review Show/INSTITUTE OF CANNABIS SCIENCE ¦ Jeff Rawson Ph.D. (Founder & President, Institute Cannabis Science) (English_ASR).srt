1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,480
foreign

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,638
to the next episode of the Cannabis

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,320
review I'm delighted to join this

4
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:14,699
episode by Jeff Ross and who's the

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,679
founder and president of the Institute

6
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:19,259
of karma science over in the U.S how are

7
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:21,118
you keeping today Jeff doing great how

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,560
are you I'm fantastic thank you very

9
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:23,698
much for taking the time to do this I

10
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:25,320
know you're a busy man at the moment

11
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:26,420
everybody coming at the left Writing

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,800
Center

13
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:31,439
a lot of interest right now in this

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,420
subject yeah there most certainly is can

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,280
you maybe give everybody in like under

16
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,780
60 seconds an overview of how you've

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,100
decided to set up the Institute of

18
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,780
cannabis science and what the main

19
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,679
objective that you're looking to achieve

20
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,439
is

21
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:46,079
yeah so the Institute of cannabis

22
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:49,320
science exists to do research that

23
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,480
benefits consumers in particular my

24
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,539
concern that led me to found the

25
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:56,939
Institute was the misinformation in

26
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:59,698
cannabis markets that is many products

27
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:02,039
are not labeled accurately and sometimes

28
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:04,618
safety tests haven't even been performed

29
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,618
properly and um all of this comes down

30
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:10,140
to the fact that third-party Labs

31
00:01:06,618 --> 00:01:12,180
provide the testing for the cultivators

32
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,640
and producers who then sell the products

33
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,580
but sometimes these third-party Labs

34
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,099
themselves can be dishonest and the

35
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:22,079
producers will shop for the lab that

36
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:25,319
gives them the best answer the producer

37
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:27,478
wants so that problem is called lab

38
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:30,239
shopping it's a common challenge in

39
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:33,539
regulatory science and we need

40
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:35,819
non-profits and other engagement in

41
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,380
order to get Regulators to fix the

42
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:39,539
problems and in order to bring the

43
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:43,379
scrutiny necessary so that we all have

44
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:46,020
honest data about weed

45
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:48,118
okay very interesting so can we give

46
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:50,578
everybody a quick little overview what

47
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:52,618
is science science is the measurement of

48
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:53,699
different elements in the universe is

49
00:01:52,618 --> 00:01:57,719
that correct

50
00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:01,079
yeah yeah I think that I agree science

51
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:04,200
always starts with a measurement yep so

52
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:07,618
science is about making measurements and

53
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:10,319
understanding a given property usually

54
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:12,180
we examine some physical property or

55
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,219
something that we notice around us in

56
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,620
the universe and then

57
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:18,300
um typically we try to measure it or

58
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:22,080
quantify it in some way that usually

59
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,760
involves making a number right and once

60
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,520
we figure out how to measure it and

61
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:29,579
observe it like say the brightness of

62
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:32,159
light in a room and put a number to it

63
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,920
um then we can use that information and

64
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:37,020
try to draw some insights that's really

65
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:38,119
the goal is to start with making a

66
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,980
measurement

67
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,659
interpret the information maybe make a

68
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:45,719
range of measurements over some space

69
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:47,340
and then come away with an Insight or

70
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:49,919
real understanding

71
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,959
amazing so what is the main way of

72
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:54,958
measuring cannabis

73
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:56,280
so the main way of measuring cannabis

74
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,620
and usually when we're measuring

75
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,479
cannabis what we're asking about is what

76
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,500
are the main compounds that are in there

77
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:07,500
I think a lot of us know that

78
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:09,840
tetrahydrocannabinol THC is sort of the

79
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,519
main drug-like compounding cannabis

80
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,340
although there are a lot of other active

81
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:18,180
compounds so

82
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:20,580
um if I want to know how much THC is in

83
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:23,099
my cannabis flour well I can't just look

84
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:26,340
at it right I need to actually take that

85
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:29,098
cannabis flower and soak it in some

86
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:31,979
liquid until all the THC comes out into

87
00:03:29,098 --> 00:03:35,219
the liquid and then I take up that

88
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:38,399
liquid and I measure it very carefully

89
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:42,239
to see exactly how much THC is dissolved

90
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,700
then if I know the mass of the flower

91
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,519
that I started with I know how much THC

92
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:49,500
was in that given mass and that's a

93
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,060
useful thing that usually comes out as a

94
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,039
percent

95
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,900
okay and some of the stuff that we're

96
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:57,658
seeing obviously in the moment is

97
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:00,239
basically the certain THC levels being

98
00:03:57,658 --> 00:04:02,699
stated at a certain number and it being

99
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,219
actually is a different number by the

100
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:07,738
time it gets to the shelves is the issue

101
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:09,598
happening at their testing the minute

102
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:10,799
it's cultivated and it then has to go

103
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:13,979
through a number of processes like

104
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:16,620
Machinery that's could devalue the THC

105
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:18,779
or the cannabinoid content or is it just

106
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,858
uh lazy management at a cultivation

107
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:22,138
level

108
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:24,000
that's a really good question because

109
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:27,780
actually

110
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,918
um you know this this one buzzword THC

111
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:31,319
inflation

112
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:34,978
is probably a couple of different

113
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:37,259
regulatory problems I believe that one

114
00:04:34,978 --> 00:04:40,199
thing that does happen is that some Labs

115
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:42,060
find they have an economic incentive to

116
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:45,060
provide numbers that are a little bit

117
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:46,620
larger than their competitors and so I

118
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:50,939
do believe that sometimes there is

119
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:52,800
deliberate fraud but also a lot of the

120
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:54,540
problem that we have specifically in

121
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,120
Massachusetts and this is also true in

122
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:59,400
other states but the regulations are

123
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,319
different in each one so the exact

124
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:04,198
nature of the problems vary but in

125
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:09,300
Massachusetts we have poor definitions

126
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:13,379
for what counts as cured flour or dried

127
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:15,540
flour and the reporting basis for

128
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:19,379
cannabinoid compounds and whether that's

129
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:20,879
by dry weight basis so what that comes

130
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:24,719
down to is

131
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:26,939
the amount of water in the Cannabis

132
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,360
flower at the time of testing is not

133
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:32,399
specified by the regulations and a

134
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,759
significant amount of the weight of the

135
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:38,579
Cannabis flower comes from water so if

136
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,939
the if if the flower could be wetter or

137
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:44,339
drier but the rules don't say exactly

138
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:47,339
what moisture content I'm testing at

139
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:49,019
then I actually don't I don't really

140
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:50,879
know what the concentration means

141
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:52,918
because I don't know the total weight of

142
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:55,259
the flower that was tested and how to

143
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:57,899
compare that with the flower I buy

144
00:05:55,259 --> 00:06:00,600
so some of the problem is bad

145
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:04,978
definitions another challenge is that

146
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:08,280
the THC in cannabis flower is not mostly

147
00:06:04,978 --> 00:06:12,199
actually the compound THC it's mostly

148
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:15,839
present as a precursor compound called

149
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:18,478
tetrahydrocannabinolic acid thca and

150
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:21,418
it's upon heating that compound that it

151
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:24,899
gets converted into THC in the process

152
00:06:21,418 --> 00:06:27,959
of smoking so the differences in

153
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:29,459
definitions of compounds make or the

154
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:33,560
differences in the actual compounds that

155
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:36,418
are present make it difficult to say

156
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,699
clearly what are the contents and if I

157
00:06:36,418 --> 00:06:40,978
look at a label that tells me a THC

158
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:43,500
percent I need more information to know

159
00:06:40,978 --> 00:06:46,379
what that number really signifies

160
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:49,139
so there are several problems I do

161
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:52,079
believe that also sometimes degradation

162
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:54,120
of cannabinoids can happen after

163
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:57,300
packaging but I don't believe that

164
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:00,240
that's often a big problem because most

165
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:02,939
packages of cannabis flower don't sit

166
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,579
around for years before they get sold

167
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:09,000
and it generally generally the flower

168
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:11,038
once it's packaged is in the darkness so

169
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,379
it's not exposed to light which tends to

170
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:15,060
catalyze these reactions and it's also

171
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:16,079
kept pretty cool like at room

172
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,300
temperature

173
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:20,579
so

174
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:22,800
um if there were significant

175
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:25,079
decomposition of cannabinoid compounds

176
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,579
we would see that in our testing because

177
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:28,918
we would see elevated levels of

178
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:30,959
cannabinol but we don't

179
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:32,698
yeah so despite in CBN would be able to

180
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:35,098
tell if the degradation has happened at

181
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:36,538
that level it tell me this in the

182
00:07:35,098 --> 00:07:39,659
compliance side of things that

183
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:42,779
third-party testing is this stuff in

184
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:45,180
force or are they more incentivized to

185
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:46,978
have the big client yes there are no sir

186
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,620
three bags full so we'll be able to get

187
00:07:46,978 --> 00:07:52,079
the the level that you want or is there

188
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,598
strict rules in any of the states where

189
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:56,758
it's legalized where the lab testing in

190
00:07:54,598 --> 00:07:59,819
the protocol is actually very regimented

191
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:01,379
and you can let's say boost it up by an

192
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:04,759
extra five percent to THC just because

193
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:04,759
you're going to get a 24 month contract

194
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,479
question um

195
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,099
um a better better structured

196
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:15,839
regulations are definitely more

197
00:08:14,098 --> 00:08:18,478
enforceable

198
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:21,839
um that's definitely true but to some

199
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:25,560
degree the problem that we have really

200
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:28,079
comes from dishonest Behavior right and

201
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,360
it's a behavior problem and a problem of

202
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:33,059
incentives right as you said right this

203
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:38,339
yes or no sir three bags full I mean

204
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:39,838
that lab that that lab is serving the

205
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:42,120
cultivator

206
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,640
and the cultivator is their client their

207
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,399
customer and in America at least we

208
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:51,059
always say the customer is always right

209
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:53,039
so the lab is doing good business if

210
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:55,559
they give their customer exactly what

211
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:58,319
their customer asks for and if their

212
00:08:55,559 --> 00:09:00,659
customer calls up the lab every time

213
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,120
they get a number they don't like and

214
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:05,639
say could you please retest that I know

215
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:09,000
there's more THC in my weed

216
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:11,819
then the lab has to do that retest right

217
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,879
so I understand the pressures that

218
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:16,500
people are under but we find that only

219
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:19,559
you know there's only there's usually

220
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:22,740
like two out of ten labs

221
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:25,500
that everyone knows in a given state are

222
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:28,200
producing bad results

223
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:31,200
um those Labs usually do pretty well

224
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,820
okay and is it okay so basically there's

225
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,620
no federal legalization so therefore

226
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,120
there's no standard testing agency like

227
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:38,399
an FDA or something like that that's

228
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,139
going around to everything or do they

229
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,620
already exist in the relative States

230
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:45,419
they just can't cope with the quality

231
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:47,759
yeah each state has been tasked with

232
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:50,099
coming up with its own Regulatory and

233
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:52,439
enforcement scheme and so that's why the

234
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,940
results are so different in each state I

235
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,040
do agree with you if there was a more

236
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,959
standardized approach usually the

237
00:09:56,039 --> 00:10:00,719
federal government and federal agencies

238
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:01,979
are much more proactive with stuff like

239
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,019
this

240
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:07,320
um and definitely in the state of

241
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:09,959
Massachusetts our regulatory agency has

242
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:13,019
struggled to figure out what constitutes

243
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:15,719
an effective action so

244
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:18,320
um definitely improvements in the rules

245
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,320
and regulations

246
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:29,639
that's why I founded the Institute of

247
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:30,240
cannabis science is because

248
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:34,860
um

249
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:36,959
a non-profit that what we do is we're a

250
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,639
non-profit and we we test products off

251
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:40,679
the shelves ourselves

252
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:43,259
and then provide information to people

253
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:46,019
about what happens so

254
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:47,759
um in a way we kind of short-circuit the

255
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:48,839
whole usual process that you would wait

256
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:52,259
for

257
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:54,300
and provide answers right away

258
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:57,120
um and fill some of that Gap that's left

259
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:59,879
by a lack of federal enforcement

260
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:03,060
okay moving on to the medical side of

261
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:05,519
the Cannabis industry is the future of

262
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:07,259
the over in Europe I think we have a lot

263
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,759
stricter rules the farmer companies are

264
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:10,559
ingrained in a lot of the kind of

265
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:13,919
cosmetic ingredients in food and

266
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:16,139
beverage type ingredients do you see in

267
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:18,179
within 10 years time that like 60 or 70

268
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:20,278
percent of this industry from Cosmetics

269
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:21,899
to food and beverage those molecule

270
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:24,179
ingredients are going to come from let's

271
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:27,299
say three or four major companies that

272
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:28,679
have either perfect biosynthesis or do

273
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:31,819
you always think that there's going to

274
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:33,719
be room for a cultivated flower and the

275
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:36,600
environmental impact and the capital

276
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:39,600
extensive outlay that goes with that

277
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,820
that is that is very interesting

278
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,339
um I I have a couple of different

279
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,180
thoughts about that actually so

280
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:49,140
um

281
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:52,559
in terms of Edibles and beverages right

282
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:55,799
those kinds of cannabis products are

283
00:11:52,559 --> 00:12:00,419
they fit a lot closer with standard

284
00:11:55,799 --> 00:12:02,458
consumer package goods and um

285
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:04,379
and the production of those it's

286
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:06,599
companies are finding pretty good

287
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:11,039
success at

288
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:13,379
at being national leaders so um in fact

289
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:17,278
you know there are now like a lot of

290
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:18,899
Beverage companies for cannabis that are

291
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,939
pretty new within the last couple of

292
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:23,940
years that are actually they're all

293
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:26,880
buying their cannabinoid

294
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:28,380
um their cannabinoid Emulsion right

295
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,539
because cannabinoid compounds actually

296
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:32,879
have terrible solubility in water so

297
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:35,278
just making an Emulsion that's dissolved

298
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:38,100
in water is a lot of work right well

299
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:40,679
there's a company called vertosa

300
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:43,200
that makes cannabinoid Emulsion in many

301
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:46,138
states and they sell their cannabinoid

302
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:49,680
Emulsion to many different beverage

303
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:51,720
makers so we're already seeing that some

304
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:54,479
parts of the supply chain the commodity

305
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:57,600
parts of the supply chain are firming up

306
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,339
and being dominated by individual brands

307
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,620
in some cases and I believe that that

308
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:05,279
will continue to happen with Beverages

309
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:07,200
and edibles but there is a large part of

310
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:09,659
the Cannabis consuming community that is

311
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,420
very partial to smoking flour and we're

312
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:14,519
not going to stop anytime soon and

313
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:17,099
growing flour is a totally different

314
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:19,740
process it's not like making Coca-Cola

315
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,899
it's not a not really as much of a

316
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:24,299
chemical process and there's more art

317
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:26,940
so I believe that there will continue to

318
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:29,219
be a robust sector

319
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,839
producing craft cannabis and I believe

320
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:33,540
that there will also be a few big

321
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:36,839
companies producing kind of commodity

322
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:38,879
cannabis flower mids you know I mean a

323
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:41,399
lot of people will probably dis as the

324
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:42,659
McDonald's of cannabis but like some

325
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:44,159
people will like it and it'll be

326
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:46,319
affordable

327
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:47,639
um but probably eventually most of that

328
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,920
you know eventually with Federal

329
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:52,259
legalization the other development that

330
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:54,778
will happen is interstate commerce and

331
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:58,078
then what you will find is that the most

332
00:13:54,778 --> 00:14:01,019
economical place in the world to produce

333
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:03,179
these mid-grade like this mid-grade

334
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:05,879
pretty decent commodity cannabis that's

335
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:07,739
not Super Craft all of it will come from

336
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:10,439
California

337
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:12,600
and it'll all be sun grown and that'll

338
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,600
be by far the best like the most cost

339
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:19,800
effective way to produce modestly decent

340
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:22,440
weed that's not absolute like top grade

341
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:24,000
right for a large consume for a large

342
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,740
Market the same way we produce all our

343
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,600
other produce in America

344
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,700
yeah it's going to be very interesting

345
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,440
to see how different the European and

346
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,660
the North American markets end up coming

347
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,300
over the next 10 to 20 years because I'm

348
00:14:33,659 --> 00:14:38,519
sure you saw the news of Germany opening

349
00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:41,039
up for the Social Clubs and a trial

350
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:42,240
period of five years so it's a diluted

351
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:44,099
version of what they were going to do

352
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,079
but in my opinion it was always

353
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,940
basically what was going to happen the

354
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:49,679
Pharma biotech companies are so strong

355
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:51,959
and powerful over here they see the

356
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:54,120
market of as value owners have been an

357
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:57,059
ingredient supplier and they're happy to

358
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:59,220
let the non-for-profit flower activist

359
00:14:57,059 --> 00:15:01,379
side of the industry have at it right

360
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:04,139
now but they want to protect and ring

361
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:05,879
fence that uh that big chunk of them at

362
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:07,680
the ingredient side industry it's going

363
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:09,539
to be interesting to see how those two

364
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:12,599
models end up coalescing because when

365
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:14,458
Federal legalization comes is comes we

366
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,320
all know how capitalism works and it's

367
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:17,399
the bigger and the stronger eat the

368
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,959
smaller and the little and then the

369
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:20,639
bigger the stronger one to expand their

370
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:22,198
words and it's going to be interesting

371
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,579
to see whether that model is available

372
00:15:22,198 --> 00:15:26,278
in Europe yet for the North American

373
00:15:23,578 --> 00:15:28,198
companies yeah I think that there's in a

374
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:31,078
little bit of a difference because

375
00:15:28,198 --> 00:15:34,198
um our um our Banking and business

376
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:36,419
environment makes it our has made it

377
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:38,039
extremely difficult for any established

378
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:39,360
company to dip its toe into this

379
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:43,439
industry

380
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,759
right so um that's really prevented a

381
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,560
lot of the

382
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:48,539
let's prevented a lot of tobacco

383
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:50,219
companies and pharmaceutical companies

384
00:15:48,539 --> 00:15:52,198
from immediately launching a bunch of

385
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,959
cannabis products

386
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:56,939
um but you're right

387
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,778
um and some the you know some of the

388
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,880
market

389
00:15:57,778 --> 00:16:02,338
analysis that you point to in Europe

390
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:03,958
also it stands to reason will be

391
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:07,199
replicated here

392
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:10,619
um people people aren't like Farmers

393
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:14,338
aren't famous for getting rich right so

394
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:16,078
the people growing cannabis like it's

395
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:18,600
not going to be such a ridiculous cash

396
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:20,338
crop as some people seem to have hoped

397
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,759
and

398
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:25,800
um if if the predictions come true and

399
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,899
10 years from now a really large

400
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:30,059
percentage of the Cannabis in America is

401
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:32,339
consumed in beverages then it is it's

402
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:35,039
going to be more like you said right

403
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:37,440
that's a chemical product it's going to

404
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:41,039
be made like Coca-Cola again right they

405
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:43,199
ship bags of concentrate to every to

406
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:45,659
different bottling plants in different

407
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:48,240
states right and then they assemble

408
00:16:45,659 --> 00:16:50,879
their product in bottling plants adding

409
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,100
carbonated water and it's going to be a

410
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:54,958
similar process of distribution right

411
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,940
that's a model that that's already been

412
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:58,739
scaled up so

413
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:00,959
um that will definitely be a big part of

414
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:04,019
the production and then yeah there will

415
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:07,558
be spaces for craft producers and some

416
00:17:04,019 --> 00:17:09,298
of them will be like fine wineries right

417
00:17:07,558 --> 00:17:11,639
they'll make plenty of money and they'll

418
00:17:09,298 --> 00:17:13,139
be plenty famous but that'll be a

419
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,720
competitive thing to get into and it'll

420
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:18,540
be a different kind of art than

421
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,640
what we see right now yeah well would

422
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:22,500
you believe I'm talking next to Anna

423
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,819
Schwab who basically we're going to

424
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,980
break down genetics and a few little

425
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:27,480
bits and pieces so uh I'm very lucky to

426
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,279
get to two two experts such as

427
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,779
yourselves you know back to back and see

428
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:33,720
both sides of this oh that's awesome

429
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:36,058
that's awesome yeah yeah say hi to her

430
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,220
well most certainly will work just over

431
00:17:36,058 --> 00:17:39,418
our time now jf7 fortune we've got to

432
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,400
wrap it up but I could talk to you well

433
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:43,140
David the chemical process in cannabis

434
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,059
hopefully we maybe get to touch base

435
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,919
again towards the end of the year and we

436
00:17:45,058 --> 00:17:48,240
can give each other an update on the

437
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:50,580
various territories and the medical

438
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,679
advancements and scientific advancements

439
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:55,918
that would be great

440
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:57,360
excellent super strong thank you for

441
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,259
your time thanks everybody for watching
