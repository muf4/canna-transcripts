tequila br

13

companies do you maybe want to start

15
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:38,878
with you entering into the Cannabis

16
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,239
industry in 2015 and what opportunities

17
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:44,359
you saw and how the journey has gone so

18
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:46,280
far yeah thank you for this uh chance to

19
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:48,600
kind of tell my story but yeah so as you

20
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,920
mentioned got into the Cannabis industry

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,719
back in 2015 there's a law firm called

22
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,480
viente cederberg uh really well known in

23
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:58,120
the US as they helped with the

24
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:59,679
legalization of cannabis in Colorado and

25
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:02,759
then they've been working with other

26
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:05,519
states but also private companies and um

27
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:07,959
so the three Partners I knew uh from

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,439
beforehand and they were trying to solve

29
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:12,478
you know one of the biggest hurdles as

30
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:14,679
as more licenses were being handed out

31
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,319
and that is the challenge of ensuring

32
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,360
operational compliance right because

33
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:20,798
every state in the US has different sets

34
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:24,239
of laws and even down to the

35
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:26,240
municipality level and so uh the idea

36
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:29,280
was to create some sort of software that

37
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:31,679
helped license operators streamline and

38
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,719
create aici icies to you know

39
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,840
essentially stay compliant to all those

40
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:38,879
changing regulations and so that was uh

41
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,040
my kind of entree into cannabis and that

42
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:42,679
was back in

43
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:46,360
2015 uh and that's you know we started

44
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:48,840
simplify it a year after that and then

45
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:50,920
having been in the space uh more

46
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,000
opportunities were popping up and and so

47
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,799
I you know turned into also an investor

48
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,039
and advisor and board member in

49
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,280
multitude of

50
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:02,159
companies yeah it's been a very

51
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,560
successful Journey for you so far I

52
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,079
wanted to kind of touch on the three big

53
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,479
companies that you've been a part on and

54
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:12,280
maybe we'll start with saleon Solutions

55
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,680
what is the offering that this company

56
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,519
brings to the Cannabis industry and why

57
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,080
has it been so successful today yeah so

58
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:21,200
San Solutions is actually one of my

59
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,560
oldest companies I found it back in 2005

60
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:27,119
officially in 2008 so it's a software uh

61
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,360
Dev company uh us-based but the

62
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,120
engineers are in Sri Lanka and so it you

63
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,319
know obvious it's been around for quite

64
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,560
some time helping startups but also

65
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:38,679
larger companies save costs on their on

66
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,080
their development software development

67
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:44,599
and when I got into the Cannabis

68
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:46,239
industry we saw a lot of need also uh

69
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:49,399
for new technologies that were being

70
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,039
built and so just by the fact that I'm

71
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,480
now the chairman of the company I don't

72
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:55,598
actively run it uh I started kind of

73
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:58,518
pointing out opportunities to the

74
00:02:55,598 --> 00:03:00,598
executive team at salon and you know in

75
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:02,560
short order all of a sudden they were

76
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:05,399
developing software products for some

77
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,799
really big uh Brands not Brands

78
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,319
companies um that are well known in the

79
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:11,799
Cannabis industry and they continue to

80
00:03:09,318 --> 00:03:13,598
do so today um and so that's that's

81
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:16,080
really what I think sets Salon apart

82
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:17,518
it's now in today's environment you know

83
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,879
when when you're whether you're a

84
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,480
startup or a season tech company and

85
00:03:19,878 --> 00:03:23,000
you're looking to build products that

86
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:25,719
serve the Cannabis industry there's a

87
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,199
lot of terminology and and nuances

88
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:29,799
that's you know very different in

89
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:31,518
cannabis versus other Industries and and

90
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:34,560
so this company and and the team behind

91
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,840
it has a lot of experience having built

92
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,438
products including simplifier uh you

93
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,598
know the compliance company that I run

94
00:03:38,438 --> 00:03:42,560
as a CEO um and so I think that's what's

95
00:03:40,598 --> 00:03:45,719
made it so successful so far and we're

96
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,199
opening up a uh you know an office in

97
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:51,039
Barcelona this month actually so just to

98
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:52,518
expand into Europe moving on to the next

99
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,798
company that I want to disc which is

100
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:57,519
simplifier which is the compliance and

101
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:00,040
regulation software provider which your

102
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,959
expertise in computer science this

103
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:04,120
seemed to be one of the most

104
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:05,640
advantageous uh sectors within the

105
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,920
Cannabis industry that people could

106
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:13,518
develop unique solutions for was that an

107
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:15,319
easy step from um Sal on Solutions and

108
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,918
how is everything going so

109
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:20,399
far yeah so simplify I have to say so in

110
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:22,719
all the companies I've started and

111
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,719
founded and and and run in the past this

112
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,520
has been probably the most challenging

113
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,320
uh primarily because I think the

114
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:30,519
Cannabis industry is still very early

115
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:32,360
right even in the US it's uh you know

116
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:34,599
there's 40 States that's not legal

117
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:37,000
there's obviously no federal it's not

118
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:40,120
legal on a federal level but because

119
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,519
it's so early just lots of challenges in

120
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,800
terms of creating product that helps not

121
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:48,279
only licensed operators but you know we

122
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,400
now have products for banks uh for

123
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:52,399
insurance companies for law firms even

124
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,319
government um and those are newer

125
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:56,399
products that we have but the initial

126
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:58,800
product was very challenging just trying

127
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,758
to understand the needs we knew what the

128
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,960
needs were going to be but really how do

129
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:06,240
you price it and because the industry

130
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:09,918
was changing so much Ian we had to keep

131
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:12,439
adapting in a very rapid pace so uh all

132
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:13,758
that to say you know simplify now is the

133
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:15,399
is the leader and the largest

134
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,639
operational compliance company in the

135
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:19,359
space we don't have anyone that competes

136
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:22,560
with us kind of the depth and breadth of

137
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,759
what we do um so we've finally found

138
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,639
kind of our firm footing and uh we

139
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:30,160
continue to grow and uh you know the

140
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:32,079
future looks quite optimistic and

141
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,560
uh you know we might even be coming into

142
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:36,038
Europe and other parts of the world as

143
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,439
they legalize uh you know as things

144
00:05:36,038 --> 00:05:40,639
go yeah now it's a incredible success

145
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:42,199
story um now moving on to the third

146
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,160
company I want to discat which is

147
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:46,879
leafwire it's a a global networking

148
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,479
platform for the Cannabis industry can

149
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:52,478
you maybe explain why you thought this

150
00:05:49,478 --> 00:05:54,159
was a great opportunity and the success

151
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:55,599
that the platform has having to date for

152
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,000
anybody who wants to check out more the

153
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:03,280
website is below yeah so leafire is what

154
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,600
we call the the LinkedIn of cannabis um

155
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:07,758
now again I think Leaf fire was founded

156
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,840
about four years ago and one thing that

157
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,840
we recognize was that traditional social

158
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:14,560
networks right so even so even on

159
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:17,519
LinkedIn now you can have a profile you

160
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,240
can post for the most part some uh

161
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,879
aspects of cannabis and it's not an

162
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,800
issue other social media as well but we

163
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:26,800
felt like the Cannabis industry uh and

164
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,639
when I say we as a board member and

165
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,120
investor felt like there was a need for

166
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:34,038
a vertical or social network that was

167
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,439
dedicated purely to cannabis right

168
00:06:34,038 --> 00:06:38,759
because it's constantly it's growing not

169
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:41,038
just in the US in Canada and and other

170
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:42,639
parts of the world uh we felt like

171
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:44,959
knowledge can be shared people can

172
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,478
connect with other people that are you

173
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:49,038
know very specific to cannabis and you

174
00:06:47,478 --> 00:06:49,918
know leafar at this point I think it's

175
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:52,439
about

176
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:54,198
75,000 uh users from around the world

177
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:57,000
you know primarily a lot in North

178
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:59,319
America but uh they certainly have uh

179
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,079
users from uh other parts of the world

180
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:03,520
and so it

181
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:06,000
encompasses not just people within the

182
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:07,878
industry like operators but also

183
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,918
investors and it's it's it's been a

184
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:13,439
great ecosystem and leafire continues to

185
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:14,839
evolve and add value I think uh they've

186
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,279
got a conference app that they're going

187
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:19,918
to be rolling out and and you know from

188
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:22,119
jobs to marketing just all those things

189
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:25,279
that you see on social media and sites

190
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,120
like LinkedIn so it's been very very

191
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:29,679
proud of what they've done at Le far as

192
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,478
well yeah now been able to incorporate

193
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,120
at all those multitude of options for

194
00:07:31,478 --> 00:07:35,598
the industry is definitely a great route

195
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,879
to be taken and definitely an

196
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:41,199
advantageous one I wanted to ask your

197
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:43,080
opinion on this proposed rescheduling to

198
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,199
schedule three in

199
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:46,478
America do you really think that this is

200
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,360
going to happen with the Biden

201
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:50,560
Administration and if so do you think

202
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,759
it's going to be a month or will it wait

203
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,120
till the end of the year when the

204
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:57,879
elections are on well that's that's the

205
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,240
billion doll question Ian right I think

206
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:02,080
know we've heard you know the government

207
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,199
and Capitol Hill say a lot of things

208
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:06,878
over the years and but I think this time

209
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:08,400
around it is very different uh for a

210
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,960
multitude of reasons one it's an

211
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:12,598
electioneer right and we're always

212
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:14,519
seeing a lot more activity coming out of

213
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:15,478
the White House and Capitol Hill in that

214
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:19,079
for that

215
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:22,199
matter Additionally you know the Biden

216
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:24,918
Administration asked HHS which is Health

217
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:26,919
and Human Services last year uh to take

218
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:28,918
a look at cannabis and they recommended

219
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:30,000
that cannabis be rescheduled to schedule

220
00:08:28,918 --> 00:08:33,360
three

221
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,440
and I think if I if I recall correctly

222
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,959
they made the recommendation to the DEA

223
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:42,360
now of course it lies with the DEA but

224
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:45,359
historically I don't think DEA has not

225
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:48,600
ever taken a recommendation from HHS

226
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:52,240
right and so there is a lot of optimism

227
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:54,040
uh because of that and I think from all

228
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,519
indications you know I I hear it's going

229
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:58,120
to happen in a month I hear it's going

230
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,078
to happen by end of the year I suspect

231
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,039
it's going to be somewhere in between

232
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:04,159
right I mean no one has the crystal ball

233
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:05,559
unfortunately Ian but and I think you

234
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:08,159
know many people in the industry are a

235
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:09,319
little uh you know tired of hearing like

236
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:12,480
hey this is going to happen it's going

237
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:15,360
to happen and it hasn't but um so far

238
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,159
all indications are that it is on track

239
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,159
and it will happen this year you know

240
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:23,039
when good question I I don't even want

241
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:26,480
to take a you know guess of that

242
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:28,958
because and you can feel the palpability

243
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,959
with h especially if you go on to let's

244
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:33,919
say some the MSO investor platforms or

245
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:35,919
some of the retail people that you can

246
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:37,639
tell that they're beaten down over a

247
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:39,319
number of years of promises and nobody

248
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:41,000
wants to get their hopes up but

249
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,360
hopefully it's coming around in April

250
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,759
from what we can hear as well yeah and

251
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,959
you know I'm seeing a lot more activity

252
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:50,360
picking up even not just from investors

253
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:52,439
but uh companies that have been on the

254
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:55,039
sidelines and that have been watching

255
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,279
the industry waiting for the right time

256
00:09:55,039 --> 00:10:00,078
and the opportunity right so uh I don't

257
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:01,838
know if you saw but uh one of the I

258
00:10:00,078 --> 00:10:04,719
think like the 10th largest bank in

259
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:07,399
America called uh First Citizens they

260
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,120
just announced about 2 3 weeks ago that

261
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:11,639
they're uh now going to start uh getting

262
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:15,679
into the Cannabis industry and that's a

263
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:18,199
$200 billion Bank um you know we've seen

264
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:21,439
we've had inquiries from all sorts of

265
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:23,879
different uh you know companies from

266
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,120
alcohol to you name it that are all

267
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:27,600
kicking the tires and and really start

268
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,879
starting to take the Cannabis industry

269
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,159
more seriously I think more so because

270
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:34,000
they're seeing that there is a path to

271
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:36,120
legalization that's starting to happen

272
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,799
and that of course has gotten everyone

273
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,879
very excited and and for us that

274
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:41,639
simplifier you know some of the biggest

275
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:44,039
private Equity names you can think of

276
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:47,079
you know they've we feel we're feeling a

277
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:49,000
lot of inbounds right now just uh people

278
00:10:47,078 --> 00:10:50,719
wanting to understand where we're going

279
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,559
and where the industry is going because

280
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,040
you know there's a lot of money sitting

281
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:56,239
in the sidelines trying to waiting to

282
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:58,559
get in so it should be very

283
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,079
exciting well to finish off I've got a

284
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:04,439
bit of a for question for you multiple

285
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:07,359
choice answer H as you're an investor

286
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,639
let's say we give you $50 million and

287
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,639
you've got a choice of Investments

288
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:13,560
you've got a biotech company that uses

289
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:16,240
fermentation engineering to be able to

290
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:19,479
produce the cannaboids as apis applied

291
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,839
pharmaceutical ingredients you've got a

292
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,879
nationwide chain of retail stores that

293
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:27,240
you could develop out you've got a

294
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:30,120
cultivation facility with Edibles and

295
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:32,839
drinks attached to it which of these

296
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,720
three options is getting near $50

297
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:38,720
million well I think if I had my way I

298
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,480
would probably Place some money in all

299
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,920
three of them that's probably more not

300
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,440
the answer you're looking for and and

301
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:47,399
here's why because I think all three of

302
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:50,160
those uh companies are touching on some

303
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:52,399
really key areas for the industry as it

304
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:55,399
continues to evolve you know I I've got

305
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,039
an investment uh in a CBD company out of

306
00:11:55,399 --> 00:12:00,639
the UK you know that I did a few years

307
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:03,919
ago Canary um you know so I've I've

308
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:06,879
invested in in plant touching to CBD to

309
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:09,719
tech companies and and I think uh it all

310
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:12,078
comes down to execution and you know I

311
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,920
think all all these different areas have

312
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:17,399
to coexist to make the industry Blossom

313
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:19,000
so uh I wouldn't I'm more of a person

314
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:20,958
that kind of think Hedges the vets and

315
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,919
and puts it in in multiple areas so

316
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:24,919
that's how I would do it probably but

317
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:27,198
you know Smart M that's probably the

318
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:28,439
best answer because they're definitely

319
00:12:27,198 --> 00:12:29,719
in different sectors going to have

320
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,320
different uh

321
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,440
launch strategies that look like they

322
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,959
could all be successful I know you're a

323
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,360
very busy man and I'm not going to keep

324
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:37,799
it too much longer I just want to say

325
