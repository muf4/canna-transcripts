company called bioharvest so bioharvest

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,278
basically our

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,519
bio harvest sciences inc should i say

11
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:32,079
are the first and only fully validated

12
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:34,719
industrial scale plant cell technology

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,880
platform for the production of plant

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,120
metabolites if i'm correct they've

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,200
recently created cannabis trichomes in

16
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:44,320
their proprietary reactors that have

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,640
resulted in 100 to 200 x times greater

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,960
density of trichomes than grown in a

19
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,399
plant so a big player in the world at

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,079
the moment ill and i'm delighted to have

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,558
you on the show today

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,679
it's an absolute pleasure owen to be

23
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:58,959
here on your first show of

24
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:01,119
but this is it maybe we have to start

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,480
with a bang last year seemed to be the

26
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:04,959
kind of

27
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:07,200
a big movement of pharma industry into

28
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:09,679
the kind of cannabis space and for all

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,680
the die-hard cannabis players out there

30
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,200
who are vermont in pharmacy getting into

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,200
this this is what's happening

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,520
recreational would be the genetics

33
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,040
growers the tenders the bud tenders it's

34
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,118
a separate industry now and

35
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,439
pharmaceuticals will create and create

36
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:26,159
bespoke medicines for bespoke diseases

37
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:27,919
that can't be replicated with a plan so

38
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,200
we might as well get used to it and get

39
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,439
talking to the biggest players in the

40
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,960
game at the moment alan so basically can

41
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:35,039
you maybe give everybody an overview of

42
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:37,118
how you came from coca-cola into bio

43
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,600
harvest sciences inc

44
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:43,280

45
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:45,519

i

51

i think my experience actually set me up

52
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:03,118
beautifully

53
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,759

employee of the coca-cola company um

57
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:16,878
having spent that across multiple

i had a really good understanding of the

65
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,439
food and beverage business um and then i

moved to israel in 2014

67
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,759
and and went into the startup world and

together with two partners built a big

69
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:45,598
data iot and software business

70
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,360
um in the beer industry and after

building a business with all the major

72
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,000
beer players as our customers with

73
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:54,479
heineken carlsberg and halsey bush inbev

74
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,080
we were very fortunate to actually do a

75
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:58,639
significant exit and we sold the

76
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,120
business to anheuser-busch inbev

77
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:02,079
and became a major big data analytics

78
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,719
player

79
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,159
for the announcer bush in bev system so

80
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:07,919
you know with that background and

81
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:09,439
industry and knowledge in the food and

82
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:11,679
beverage industry

83
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:15,039
and also having worked at my time in

84
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,280
coca-cola um in really building a number

85
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:19,840
of health and wellness brands i actually

86
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,878
came to buy harvest sciences as an

87
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,000
investor

88
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:25,840
and after uh you know completing a a

89
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,080
very intensive due diligence on the

90
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,799
company i realized wow this company is

91
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,840
amazing it's like a gold mine it's it's

92
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,680
got technology uh which is like a needle

93
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,158
in a haystack which is you know super

94
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,599
unique is able to bring the power of the

95
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:43,840
plant uh to the people with a

96
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:46,399
a very unique proprietary platform

97
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,598
technology which has the ability

98
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:53,680
to grow any primary metabolites so any

99
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:53,679
protein or any secondary metabolite

100
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,598
such as a polyphenol anti antioxidant or

101
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,640
in fact we're going to talk about today

102
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:02,079
cannabinoids and we're able to grow any

103
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,479
primary metabolite or secondary

104
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,560
metabolite from the plant so any

105
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:09,840
essential active ingredient

106
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,360
that plants have we're able to grow in

107
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,360
cells

108
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,160
and then over time we grow these cells

109
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:20,000
in bioreactors to give us a an amazingly

110
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:23,199
soluble and bioavailable um end product

111
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,680
with with fantastic efficacy so when i

112
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,160
came in as an investor i thought wow

113
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,720
this company is really unique

114
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,160
and i invested and

115
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,800
i drove the

116
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,439
the existing ceo who's now the chairman

117
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,840
so crazy during my due diligence process

118
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:42,079
that once my check had actually passed

119
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:43,359
through the bank he called me back up

120
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:45,120
and said listen

121
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,080
i realized through this process you put

122
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,918
us through

123
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:49,758
that i need a professional ceo to come

124
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:51,599
and run this business and to bring the

125
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,280
the power of our technology to the

126
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,360
market

127
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:57,039
and i'd like i'd like you to be that

128
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,759
professional ceo to come and run the

129
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,759
business so here i am 18 months later

130
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,800
owen it's been amazing we've achieved so

131
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:08,879
much where we're certainly creating

132
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:11,840
history um as it relates to um

133
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:14,478
the cannabis world um at its core we're

134
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:18,000
a biotech company we are the leaders in

135
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:21,199
plant cell technology uh we're unlocking

136
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,918
the secrets of cellular plant biology

137
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,160
every single day uh bringing unique

138
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:28,799
health and wellness and therapeutic

139
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,560
solutions to thousands of consumers out

140
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,560
there

141
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,360
yeah amazing it seems like a very

142
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,000
exciting company to be a part of both uh

143
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,319
in both aspects now through my research

144
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,519
i realized you guys got started in 2008

145
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:46,800
and 2017 you got your r d license from

146
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:49,359
the israeli government 2018 is when you

147
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,918
do sales to grow and produce trichomes

148
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,600
what was the big milestone that happened

149
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:55,359
last year that all the press was about

150
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,360
if you could break it down simply for

151
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,360
the audience that uh you were able to

152
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,280
create strike on biomass obviously in a

153
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,680
reactor but what does that mean for uh

154
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:05,839
the regular consumer and industry

155
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,639
yeah look so there were a number of

156
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:10,719
historical milestones that happened

157
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,478
in the last 12 months and like i like to

158
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,919
say we we pretty much

159
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:18,079
climbed mount everest and back six times

160
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:20,959
just given the fact that um

161
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:23,758
we've been pioneers in in in this area

162
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:25,519
and we've gone where no person has gone

163
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,600
before because you know right now

164
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:30,399
there's absolutely there's no literature

165
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:35,120
out there um as it relates to actually

166
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:38,799
growing um growing cells cannabis cells

167
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,560
in in bioreactors um there's no academic

168
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,478
institution out there

169
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,079
that has or other business that's been

170
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:47,199
able to do what we've been able to do

171
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:49,439
and i guess the the major milestone that

172
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,560
we were able to demonstrate was the

173
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:54,719
ability to actually grow the trichomes

174
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,598
in bioreactors and as many of the

175
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,919
audience obviously know the trichome is

176
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:02,478
the mini factory that produces the

177
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:05,120
cannabinoids flavonoids and terpenes

178
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:07,598
and and actually stores um those

179
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,720
critical active ingredients and we were

180
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:11,759
able to figure out how we take the plant

181
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,639
once

182
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,720
we then grow cells from that plant and

183
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,199
as we actually take those cells and put

184
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,880
those cells into liquid media i.e

185
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,280
bioreactors

186
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:26,399
we were able to actually grow from each

187
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:29,119
of our cells those very unique trichomes

188
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:31,439
so this was a was a major feat

189
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,959
it created you know biotech history as

190
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:35,680
well as you know cannabis history

191
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:40,000
because no other company has been able

192
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,360
to grow trichomes in liquid media

193
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,959
we then

194
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,960
had a another

195
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:47,598
major breakthrough and obviously this is

196
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:49,758
all part of our unique ip

197
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:53,439
is that we were able to actually grow

198
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,560
our trichomes in a very very unique

199
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:58,160
structure

200
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:01,759
which we call a amalgamated trichome

201
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,840
coral structure this was a real you know

202
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:08,319
genius breakthrough from a science

203
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:09,119
perspective because as you are growing

204
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,879
um

205
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,918
as you are scaling

206
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,840
uh in bioreactors

207
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:18,000
and as your bioreactors get larger and

208
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:19,198
larger you have what they call shear

209
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
forces

210
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,439
and without amalgamated trichome coral

211
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,120
structures what actually landed

212
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:28,959
happening is that we were able to get

213
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,959
the actual trichomes to all amalgamate

214
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:32,399
closely together

215
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:34,000
to create

216
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,080
somewhat what you can see when you look

217
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,320
at it like a coral structure which

218
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,839
actually protects the trichome and this

219
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,479
was a real breakthrough because it

220
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,959
allows us to actually go from you know

221
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,200
small bioreactors to medium bioreactors

222
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:50,639
to you know really industrial scale

223
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:53,519
bioreactors in a way that protects

224
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:55,120
the unique integrity of that trichome

225
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,919
which is so important because it's the

226
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,759
the it's the mini factory so this is the

227
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:02,639
second breakthrough and with this

228
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:03,519
breakthrough we announced to the markets

229
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:05,360
um

230
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,919
at the end of the at the end of last

231
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:11,200
year on december 8th that we actually

232
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:13,519
have now been able to grow kilos of

233
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,278
final finished biomass and i think it's

234
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,240
important owen for you and the audience

235
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:19,679
to understand that what we are growing

236
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,120
is full

237
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:23,278
spectrum

238
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,679
non-gmo

239
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:27,120
biomass and that you know that was again

240
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:28,799
another major milestone that we

241
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,360
announced the marketplace that we're the

242
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:33,919
first company in the world to be able to

243
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:37,680
grow full spectrum

244
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:39,199
non-gmo cannabis biomass at specifically

245
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:41,039
at the quantities that we're able to

246
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,800
grow and we announced that we had

247
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:46,958
grown roughly 10 kilos of the biomass

248
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:49,199
and this is something that no other

249
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:52,079
company or institution has been able to

250
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:55,040
do and and what's important about this

251
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,879
is that as a result of our technology

252
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:58,399
this allows us to be able to bring a

253
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:00,000
unique grade of cannabis to the

254
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,600
marketplace which we will be bringing in

255
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,159
2022

256
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,240
and the uniqueness is derived by you

257
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,159
know a number of different areas

258
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,799
the first area is it's finger brick

259
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,399
consistency so which is so important in

260
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:14,240
the cannabis world specifically from a

261
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,480
medicinal perspective

262
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,879
we have a level of cleanliness which is

263
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:22,240
unique to the marketplace because we we

264
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:24,240
literally we started the plant once okay

265
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,560
so therefore and we're growing cells so

266
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,959
there's no need for pesticides

267
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:32,399
there's no need for fertilizer there's

268
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:35,199
no heavy metals there are no solvents so

269
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,278
we have a very unique clean product and

270
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,278
i'll tell you now our receptors in our

271
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:41,200
bodies they understand the difference

272
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:42,240
between clean product and unclean

273
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,839
product

274
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,560
and then thirdly

275
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,279
sustainability is at the core of our

276
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:52,479
platform technology that we're utilizing

277
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:55,120
to grow our cannabis and as a result

278
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,278
obviously we're able to grow cannabis at

279
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,839
it with a fraction of the of the actual

280
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:01,519
amount of land that's required

281
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,160
even compared to

282
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,078
indoor indoor growing we're also able to

283
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:08,639
do it much more efficiently we're in a

284
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:10,639
perpetual flowering process

285
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:13,439
and importantly because we're not

286
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:16,639
utilizing

287
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:19,120
any pesticides there's no fertilizers uh

288
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:22,480
there's no solvent all of the water that

289
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,879
we use is actually biodegradable so

290
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,200
from an environmental perspective this

291
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:30,000
is a very unique platform technology

292
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:33,120
which gives us i would say best-in-class

293
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,639
credentials from a sustainability uh

294
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,200
perspective as it relates to the

295
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:39,120
cannabis world so some major major

296
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,519
milestones that obviously we're excited

297
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,600
now to build on as we start to scale for

298
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,000
2022

299
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,320
well it all sounds incredible can you

300
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,958
tell me do you guys get to set let's say

301
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,440
the recipe for the cannabinoids that are

302
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:55,359
grown within the trichomes and the

303
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,839
secondary question do those trichomes

304
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,759
grow into actual flour or are they kept

305
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,680
in the lab and used as a as an

306
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:03,360
ingredient just to clarify for the other

307
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,519
so obviously we start with the plant and

308
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,600
based on the genetics of the plant we're

309
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,839
obviously growing those same genetics of

310
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,600
the plant from an overall cannabinoid

311
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,560
profile perspective

312
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,320
um

313
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:16,799
as it relates to the actual final you

314
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,440
know biomass we're growing trichomes

315
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:20,879
right so in fact it's a great question

316
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,920
93

317
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:25,919
of our biomass is trichomes and you know

318
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:29,439
i talked about the density how we're

319
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:32,159
actually able to grow um trichomes with

320
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,959
uh on average between 100 and 2 200

321
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:37,278
times more density than what actually

322
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:38,879
grown on a regular plant

323
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:40,159
part of that is because of the structure

324
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:42,559
that we have and just unique

325
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:45,600
confirmation but it also

326
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:48,319
drives significant overall efficiencies

327
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,040
for us and as a result we have you know

328
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,160
as part of our biomass you have roughly

329
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:56,240
a ratio of 93 trichome which is really

330
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:58,399
unique the other seven percent is the

331
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,560
cell which is uh the starting point to

332
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,120
grow the trichome and then with that

333
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:05,119
biomass we can take that and utilize

334
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,039
that biomass just like you can typically

335
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,120
utilize any type of flower we can decide

336
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:11,199
to take it and do extraction and go into

337
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,440
oils we can decide to actually take it

338
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,759
in itself and go into edibles it can be

339
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,000
utilized you know basically

340
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:20,000
as a regular cannabis to be consumed

341
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,200
from a medicinal perspective with

342
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,759
different types of of formats so

343
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:28,160
um it has exact same versatility that

344
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:29,679
exists in cannabis flower but obviously

345
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:34,399
what's important to understand is that

346
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:36,719
we're all all trichome or 93 trichome

347
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,639
and that's where all the the factory of

348
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,839
production of cannabinoids are happening

349
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:44,399
so in terms of synthetic versus the

350
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,160
methodology that you guys are using is

351
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,799
it chalk and cheese or is it just you

352
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:50,159
guys are far more purified when it comes

353
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:51,599
to the actual ingredient that's going

354
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:53,439
into products look i think it's

355
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,040
important that for your viewers they

356
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,160
understand that you know the differences

357
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:59,838
between a biosynthesis right which is

358
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:02,639
obviously you know but you have

359
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,320
synthetic you have biosynthesis which is

360
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,039
you know basically utilizing you know

361
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,160
mold or fungi to grow the kind of the

362
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:10,639
actual

363
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:12,000
singular cannabinoids versus ourselves

364
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,720
you know obviously you can group

365
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,639
synthetic and biosynthesis together

366
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,639
largely driven by the fact that these

367
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:22,079
are you know obviously genetically

368
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:24,399
modified okay we are non-gmo so this is

369
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:26,479
like the first like major difference the

370
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,720
second major difference between let's

371
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,480
say these two groups is you know

372
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,480
biosynthesis and synthetic

373
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,278
are always going to be using singular

374
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,560
isolates okay so it's you know cbd or

375
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:40,000
cbg

376
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:42,399
we are full spectrum okay and this is

377
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,198
really a critical component of our

378
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:47,679
technology platform is around its

379
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:50,240
ability to be able to grow

380
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:52,000
full spectrum of the different active

381
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,278
ingredients and this is really important

382
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,480
because you know

383
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:56,879
when you look at

384
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:00,000
a number of different scientific studies

385
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:01,919
the human body always reacts better to

386
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,600
what they call the entourage effect or

387
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:06,078
the systematic effect where you have

388
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,079
multiple you know multiple polyphenols

389
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:09,919
as in the case of our vineyard product

390
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:11,599
that we already where we already have

391
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:12,719
strong validation of our platform

392
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,879
technology

393
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,040
with uh selling our red grape cell

394
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:19,360
product in the cardiovascular health

395
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:21,679
space with with vineyard we actually

396
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,720
have pisces resveratrol with only

397
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:25,120
company in the world that actually

398
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,278
produces passed resveratrol from the

399
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,759
skin of the red grape which has

400
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:32,799
glucoside which has amazing solubility

401
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:35,039
but it works in unison together with

402
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:37,519
other critical polyphenols like catagen

403
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:39,679
coercitin anthocyanins and tannins and

404
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,919
it's that harmonious effect which

405
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:43,439
creates the best outcome from an overall

406
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:45,759
health and wellness perspective

407
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,839
similarly with cannabis there's a lot of

408
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,759
research on the entourage effect some

409
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,279
people call it the synergistic effect

410
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,759
which talks about the importance of the

411
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:55,838
different cannabinoids working together

412
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,159
with the terpenes and flavonoids in

413
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,800
order to give you the best possible

414
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:02,958
outcome from an overall um

415
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:04,479
effectiveness perspective and it's like

416
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:06,559
simple i like to think about it like an

417
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,639
orchestra you know you have multiple

418
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:10,479
different components of the orchestra

419
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,198
working together to give you the best

420
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,600
overall experience it's the same thing

421
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:18,240
in the plant world you need to have all

422
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,159
the different active ingredients working

423
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,480
together and that's the way that god

424
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:24,639
gave us the plant as well so this is a

425
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,360
this is a major major factor and i

426
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,759
actually you know you opened the

427
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,839
discussion talking about um the pharma

428
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,000
world and the farmer world you know

429
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,320
having woken up with pfizer you know

430
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,399
purchasing 6.7 billion dollars

431
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,399
purchasing a company that has strong you

432
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,720
know cannabis um

433
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,039
cannabis you know knowledge base this is

434
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,519
a major move from pharma who've gone

435
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:49,599
from the synthetic world right and

436
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:52,879
actually they're coming back full circle

437
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,839
now to the plant world and realizing you

438
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:59,198
know obviously the power of botanicals

439
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:01,519
in in in its full spectrum in its full

440
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:04,959
spectrum composition

441
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:07,519
in order to help solve some of the major

442
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,318
palliative diseases

443
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:10,000
and

444
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:11,759
and indications

445
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,279
that today

446
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:17,519
specific synthesized pharma drugs are

447
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:19,439
very are very challenged and that's a

448
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:21,439
very challenging helping to solve and

449
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,679
that's why today in the u.s you have

450
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,720
between 45 million people at least that

451
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,839
are

452
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,240
today

453
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:30,960
consuming medicinal cannabis

454
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,759
as either total substitutes or in

455
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,160
addition to their current you know

456
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:38,038
i guess pharma grade synthesized

457
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,759
medication for anything from

458
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:41,119
fibromyalgia

459
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:43,599
als

460
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:46,639
cancer medication epilepsy medication

461
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:50,319
etc so it's really really interesting

462
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,120
times pfizer i think took a a bold

463
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:54,000
you know

464
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:55,599
audacious decision to actually start to

465
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,839
kind of come back

466
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:59,759
to the original

467
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:01,519
source of where the former world started

468
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:03,038
which is the plant and back to

469
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:05,279
botanicals

470
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:06,839
yeah i think i recently saw that as they

471
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:09,359
have a medicine that specializes in

472
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:11,119
cardiovascular disease i think was the

473
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:12,879
the cherry on the cake for fish or

474
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:14,719
acquire in that company

475
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,039
and i could talk to you all day alone i

476
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,120
swear to god i'm absolutely sold on and

477
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:20,879
everything you guys are doing and it's

478
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:22,399
been an enthralling shout out and i hope

479
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,240
we get to chat again before the end of

480
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,519
the year and get an update on everything

481
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,359

to know more check out the website for

483
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:31,279
bio harvest sciences below i highly

484
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:33,119
recommend doing some research on them

485
