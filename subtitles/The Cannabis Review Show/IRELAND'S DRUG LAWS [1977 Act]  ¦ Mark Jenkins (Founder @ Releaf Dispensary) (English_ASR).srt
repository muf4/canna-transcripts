the cannabis review i'm delighted to be

00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:14,959
joined this episode by fellow irishman

mark jenkins who's the founder of relief

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,719
dispensaries down in waterford and

great

10
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:24,640
thanks for coming on the show i know uh

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,160
something that you're in the middle of

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,679
as a has huge implications for the

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,839
cannabis industry i thought it'd be best

14
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:31,920
to get you on and get the the story from

15
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:34,719
the horse's mouth as it were i'm going

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,480
to basically jump straight in to uh the

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,079
first topic which is the overview of

18
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:39,759
your relief case that's going on at the

19
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,359
moment i'm basically just going to

20
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:42,399
summarize it up for everybody and then

21
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:43,439
i'm going to ask you one or two

22
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,200
questions

23
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,280
to make sure that we've got the exact

24
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,120
information based on this so

25
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,960
from my understanding and reading is

26
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:53,119
that you had three cases that were

27
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,840
brought against you separate incidents

28
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:57,439
where you were caught with cbd products

29
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,000
one of them has been tested and proved

30
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:02,479
to have under 0.2 percent two of them

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,159
are still independent results pending

32
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:06,319
but the judge when you brought the court

33
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,640
said we're going to pause these three

34
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:10,639
personal cases because he has a bigger

35
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,478
case that's coming to the high court

36
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,680
that's going to basically challenge

37
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:17,679
the 1977 drug act and the cannabis laws

38
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,640
or the drug laws in ireland is all that

39
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,200
correct

40
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,320
yeah um yeah

41
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,478
perfect

42
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:27,199
so basically what i want to kind of ask

43
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:29,840
you is your your recent cases were

44
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,719
against the dpp and not against the d ho

45
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,439
h

46
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:33,280
so

47
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:35,199
the the main case that you're bringing

48
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,560
that will be challenging the drug laws

49
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:41,040
and especially the 1977 act is that

50
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,280
against the doh or is that still against

51
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,079
the dpp as well it's still against the

52
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,200
dpp but like that it's the department of

53
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:50,319
health that are kind of holding the

54
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,799
cards for everyone basically like

55
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,398
it's unsafe for humans is what they're

56
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,079
kind of going on with the

57
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,879
misuse of drugs act

58
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:58,319
so

59
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:00,718
i would think there's there's more

60
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:03,118
trials coming up in july

61
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,399
that or would be against the dpp which

62
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:05,759
were which would be against the

63
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,000
department of health

64
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,038
which i would say will kind of dictate a

65
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,639
lot of it to us for this industry

66
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,399
okay yeah because basically the way if

67
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,399
you look at it sensibly the department

68
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,640
of health have to tell the dpp that

69
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,360
something is now safe to be used and the

70
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:23,439
dpp passed it down to the guards then so

71
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,560
that's kind of the stream of information

72
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:27,120
and knowledge that's happening at the

73
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,360
moment so based on the case that you had

74
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,039
recently what exactly did the judge say

75
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,879
did she let you just go right time out

76
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,400
in these three cases let's wait until

77
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,399
the bigger case has been brought to the

78
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,400
high court or was there any

79
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,599
nuanced opinion that the judge might

80
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,959
have said here guys what are you doing

81
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:43,439
wasting the court's time with this kind

82
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,400
of stuff it was like she she told him to

83
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:46,479
kind of

84
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,400
think logically lads with the rest of

85
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:49,679
these because i've seven other cases to

86
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,959
come up as well

87
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,439
that she was kind of saying like think

88
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,039
logically before he even bring charge

89
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:57,120
against and same with the district court

90
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:59,439
judge because the district court judge

91
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,759
in clamel and in dungarvan

92
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:04,479
was bought the same judge and he was

93
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:06,079
seeing me coming up every second week

94
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:08,158
and one or two and he even said let's

95
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,840
you need some joint up thinking here you

96
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:11,280
can't keep coming into

97
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,800
this man's house and bringing these

98
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,158
cases against him into my court when

99
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,959
there seems to be something going on

100
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:20,719
here and again the judge above in dublin

101
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,120
said the same thing

102
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:25,199
okay and so she was she kind of more or

103
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,280
less like the state had no evidence what

104
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,839
they were going on she said you haven't

105
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,640
given me any evidence here today

106
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,400
to say either way for the case

107
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:35,759
yeah so what i've what i understand as

108
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,760
well especially with the dpp the

109
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:39,598
director of public prosecution she's

110
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,039
based in dublin in the court cases that

111
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:43,598
are happening there but the individual

112
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:45,919
counties then they employ and contract

113
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:48,639
legal companies or legal firms to

114
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:51,039
represent the dpp in court in each

115
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:53,839
individual county so realistically the

116
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:55,759
guy who was a prosecutor knew had very

117
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,598
little to no clue about this industry

118
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:59,759
whatsoever and was following basically

119
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:01,518
whatever the blueprint and the templates

120
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,598
that had been enacted up in dublin at

121
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,599
that time

122
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:06,798
well like that we the attorney general

123
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:09,199
would have been part of that the

124
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,680
attorney general wanted to remain

125
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:13,839
neutral on it which the judge asked to

126
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,280
it to be confirmed which she did come

127
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,120
back and which he thought was very

128
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,319
strange that the attorney general wants

129
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,000
to remain neutral in this case

130
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:23,120
yeah if they're not trying to push the

131
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,639
whole thing down you want to be

132
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,720
questioning something i'm going to jump

133
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,439
on to the next thing and it's the 1977

134
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,720
drug act so the drug laws in ireland as

135
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:34,719
we know are pretty archaic the 1977 drug

136
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,880
act can you maybe give everybody a quick

137
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,880
overview of how that imp impacts the

138
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:41,120
freedom and movement with the european

139
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:43,279
uh agreement that we've already got in

140
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,560
place and how likely are we to be able

141
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:48,239
to have that drug altered or

142
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,560
taken off completely

143
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,519
so the drug act is kind is holding us

144
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,399
because the irs drug act means zero

145
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:58,639
percent thc anything cannabis related in

146
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:59,758
their eyes like even down to the hemp

147
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,240
farmers

148
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,000
they can't market the product

149
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,918
so

150
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,918
anything anything cannabis related is

151
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:11,198
kind of held under misuse of drugs act

152
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:12,959
regardless of thc percentage or not

153
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,639
and that's kind of what we're arguing on

154
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:17,198
with the european

155
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:20,478
european freedom of movement

156
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,478
um of trade and goods

157
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,680
it's kind of what's holding us and

158
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,519
that's again the department of health is

159
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,120
what's holding any of that for the

160
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:29,519
farmers or for

161
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,680
the shops

162
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:33,680
okay so it's basically

163
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,360
what what seems to need to happen is

164
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,519
that we need to have validation and

165
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,160
studies completed in this country first

166
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:42,799
and foremost for the do h to be able to

167
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,400
uh say okay this isn't exactly what we

168
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,840
were saying that it was do you know of

169
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:47,519
any of these tests that are currently

170
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:50,000
going on at the moment or are they

171
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:51,359
literally just sticking to this act and

172
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,639
there's been no advancement from the

173
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,160
government side of things in terms of

174
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,160
research and development

175
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,400
as far as i know there's not like they

176
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,720
are trying with the hemp but it's more

177
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,318
our side like that it's not the stakes

178
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,840
kind of coming to always asking us for

179
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,840
info it's more we're pushing on

180
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:09,839
them yeah well i think in fairness as

181
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:12,239
much as we're all in one we know so much

182
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:14,159
about this industry i think like 99.9

183
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,918
percent of politicians have literally

184
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,600
zero clue about even uh the smallest bit

185
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:21,918
of information when it comes to cannabis

186
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,160
even some articles i was reading based

187
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:25,758
on your cases the the media publication

188
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,319
we're saying that thc is the main

189
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,960
constituent in cannabis which we all

190
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,199
know is completely incorrect statement

191
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:35,599
but as i said i think it's our job as an

192
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,840
industry to help educate and to bring

193
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,439
these uh matters to the front so people

194
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:41,679
can understand exactly what it is that

195
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:44,800
we're all debating over that it's not a

196
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,079
case of uh this isn't a random challenge

197
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,759
that we're trying to make it's actually

198
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:52,478
a valid and a business oriented one

199
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,800
yeah 100

200
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:57,360
education is key in this like people

201
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,520
still have the stigma that it's

202
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,598
a drug and you're going around high off

203
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,839
your head like we even have with the

204
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:05,918
coffee shop people coming in you ask me

205
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:07,679
do you want a cbd or a regular coffee oh

206
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:08,879
no no junior you'll have me asleep on

207
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,038
the ground

208
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,800
it doesn't work that way and then like

209
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:14,478
that we educate him inside or we tell

210
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,199
him the difference and right i'll come

211
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:19,120
back i'll have the cbd the next day and

212
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,560
then they start drinking the cbd coffee

213
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,840
because they know it doesn't make a

214
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,160
difference but

215
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:25,598
in the in the taste so

216
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,439
they seeking they get the benefits from

217
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:29,038
it

218
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:30,800
yeah and i think another part of this

219
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:32,318
stream is medical professionals being

220
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,000
educated as well and that's a whole

221
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,160
other conversation i think that needs to

222
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,160
be had that uh

223
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,080
people listening to somebody in a store

224
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,880
doesn't have the same weight as a doctor

225
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:45,519
maybe given some advice saying yeah this

226
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,879
is part of your and your weekly diet

227
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:48,878
that you should be having

228
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,879
we'd be very restricted in what we could

229
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,039
say like you know we know it could help

230
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,599
you do this or it could help you we

231
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:58,240
can't say it because of regulation again

232
00:07:55,598 --> 00:08:00,959
we're not allowed to make any claims but

233
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,639
it's there's a lot of restrictions in

234
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,560
this industry and i think a lot of them

235
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,560
kind of need to be sorted out now even

236
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,199
this novel food

237
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,759
seems to be very

238
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,120
higgly pickly at the minute now again

239
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,400
yeah well that's the next thing i wanted

240
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,720
to jump on because i know you've got a

241
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:18,000
food background and it's something i'm

242
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,199
sure you've been keeping up today

243
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,918
because you've got a number of products

244
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,520
in this space so again for everybody the

245
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,878
novel food application that's currently

246
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:27,519
going on at the moment has happened in

247
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,120
the uk only the uk were part of the

248
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:31,038
european union when they started this

249
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,719
whole process so they took the uf the

250
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:34,799
novel food application that the eu

251
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,399
generally use they've just moved it

252
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,399
further along since brexit because

253
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,639
they've had no red tape to get through

254
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:44,158
where do you see the eu normal food

255
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:46,000
application lying at the moment

256
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:47,759
i would think they nearly follow suit

257
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,958
now with the uk

258
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:51,278
do you think you're going to take them

259
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:52,479
all off okay you got in the uk come over

260
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:54,639
here and apply and we're just going to

261
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,080
give it straight to oh you would hope i

262
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:58,159
would hope so

263
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,160
like that a lot of products i would have

264
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:02,559
would have the novel food so i would

265
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:05,039
hope that it will just transition over

266
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:06,958
from the uk over to europe or wherever

267
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:08,559
america

268
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:10,239
okay yeah well

269
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:12,000
brexit might have changed altered that

270
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,320
to a tiny degree but let's fingers

271
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,240
crossed that uh the companies that do go

272
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,920
through the process over in the uk don't

273
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,200
have to reapply and go through another

274
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:21,120
two-year waiting process for the

275
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,200
european union

276
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,600
most of them would have businesses

277
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,200
outside of europe now that brexit would

278
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,480
have kind of pushed all them to kind of

279
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,879
move to other european countries

280
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,800
okay i get you and who do you see is

281
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:36,320
like across europe where do you see the

282
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:38,000
territories that people are able to

283
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,800
access the products the best are the

284
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,679
most superior products as a as a

285
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:45,359
a buyer yourself for your stores where

286
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,278
are you looking at gown is it holland is

287
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,959
it switzerland is it denmark is it mall

288
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:50,879
to germany

289
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:52,559
switzerland

290
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:54,559
it kind of opened up it kind of warms

291
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:56,000
for us with the with the court cases

292
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,399
like that was one thing that we were

293
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,080
questioned on because europe and is it

294
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,958
europe isn't it europe

295
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,360
did

296
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:05,759
the transactions what way come into

297
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,519
europe kind of comes into account so i

298
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:10,958
try to stay away from that now and kind

299
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,959
of more so italy and spain

300
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,078
okay italy and spain and do you see

301
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,919
in terms of the cbd flower market that

302
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:19,039
you guys have you guys been selling cbd

303
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:21,360
flour like some of the other

304
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:22,879
dispensaries or have you yeah you have

305
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,959
and do you see

306
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:26,799
that the quality of that flour getting

307
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,879
better year on year is there one

308
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:31,679
dominant cultivator that you see in

309
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:33,439
europe or do you see this over the next

310
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:34,879
five years this once we get this

311
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,079
approved that this will come a massive

312
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,439
industry and you'll start to see

313
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:39,838
different cultivars with their own

314
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,000
genetics and their own flavors

315
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,680
like that it's getting better year on

316
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,958
year because more people are coming into

317
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:46,639
the industry

318
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:48,239
like that people are seeing that they

319
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:49,519
would have been good growers before and

320
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,600
now they're kind of really gone into

321
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:56,000
industrial production of it now but

322
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,759
it's kind of twix in between italy and

323
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,159
italy and spain at the minute i would

324
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:02,480
move from different suppliers

325
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,199
like that people like different flavors

326
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,879
so

327
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,040
you kind of once supplier kind of might

328
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:08,639
only stay to the same same strains the

329
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:11,599
whole time so

330
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:13,039
it's nice to kind of move around

331
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,480
yeah well i think that's one of the

332
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:16,799
great things about the cannabis industry

333
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,079
is the the selection and the choice of

334
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:20,159
product that you can actually get your

335
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:22,159
hands on is uh one of the things

336
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:24,480
everybody loves a new flavor or

337
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:26,319
a new special every week

338
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,560
yeah and like that every farmer has a

339
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,399
different like white widow from one guy

340
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,639
is a totally different from the next guy

341
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,799
it's it's down to the growers

342
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,879

343
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:38,559

380
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,320
industry has got a bit more clarity and

so the first one in for judicial review

389
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:11,278

390
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,560

391
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:13,838

392
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:15,919

this is the hem shop

394
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:19,439
do you have

395
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:21,278
a case for judicial review

396
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,040
against the department of health they

397
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:24,559
have brought a civil case

398
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:26,559
not a criminal so they have had no

399
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:28,559
charges brought against them

400
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:30,958
okay and then there's another case on

401
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:32,958
the 14th of july which is another

402
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:35,518
company in dublin

403
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:36,958
for importation of oils so they're both

404
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,639
taking on civil cases against the

405
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:40,399
department of health and what's the name

406
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,159
of that import company

407
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,480
oh

408
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:48,159
it's not easy to find i'm not sure is it

409
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:50,800
fine as aragon or i'm not 100 sure the

410
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:52,399
name is there online so basically the d

411
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:55,359
hemp store that's the one challenge in

412
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,919
the 1977 act and that there'll be a good

413
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,120
bit of clarity based on the end of that

414
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:00,159
case

415
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,159
yeah

416
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:04,399
i would think that the panda held all

417
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:06,879
the cards for everybody for the farmers

418
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,799
for the cbd store so

419
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,879
i would hope we get some bit of good

420
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:12,639
clarification from that and then

421
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:14,720
from my case alone with the tubing

422
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,480
together i think whoever goes into court

423
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,639
next

424
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,159

425
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,519

426
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,039
