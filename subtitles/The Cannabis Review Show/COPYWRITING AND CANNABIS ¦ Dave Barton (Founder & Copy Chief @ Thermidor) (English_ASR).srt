towards the end of the episode but for

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,119
now you maybe want to give everybody an

23
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,280
overview of how you got into the

24
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:51,919
cannabis industry how you came to set up

25
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,600
termidor and the objectives of terminal

26
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,000
sure well we call ourselves a sort of

27
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,520
content led creative agency so i've been

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,878
a copywriter for

29
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,359
more years than i care to remember

30
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:03,679
probably more like sort of 17. um

31
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,118
started out in sort of b2b pr um my

32
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:07,118
background is very much kind of arts and

33
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:09,599
writing and drama and things like that

34
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:11,599
but in terms of finding a way into

35
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:13,438
writing his career it all became like oh

36
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:15,438
well you know what is this pr thing you

37
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:16,798
know i found myself working for an

38
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:18,239
agency doing

39
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,920
lots of uh

40
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:22,399
writing around obscure things like

41
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,320
construction equipment and uh work with

42
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,600
other agencies and everything from like

43
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:28,239
you know

44
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:30,239
engineering works to uh uh energy

45
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:31,839
efficient leds so really sort of sexy

46
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,920
stuff all food service mustn't forget

47
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,439
that that's mercenary if you ever get

48
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,359
the chance

49
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:39,199
but for me it was always okay so there's

50
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:41,920
a business objective lots of technical

51
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,280
jargon and how do we kind of find the

52
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,159
story thread through that so that's

53
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,759
something that's been consistent

54
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,840
throughout my career i set up as a

55
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,159
freelancer freelance copywriter about

56
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,680
five years ago um still her business

57
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,840
doing sort of tech writing and things

58
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,840
like that but about a year a year and a

59
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,359
half ago i started to see just more and

60
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,359
more stuff happening in the cannabis

61
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:00,959
sector and something i've always been

62
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:02,799
interested in anyway

63
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,879
and it was really an opportunity to take

64
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,040
that sort of skill set from you know

65
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:09,280
writing about complex or stigmatized

66
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,120
things and trying to find human stories

67
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,719
or find you know ways about you know

68
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,080
what does this mean or you know how are

69
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,159
things operating and the more you kind

70
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,160
of get into the cannabis sector the more

71
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:19,919
you find that you have to kind of do

72
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:23,039
some sort of advocacy to kind of raise

73
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,399
the industry uh for everyone so that's

74
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:25,759
kind of what we're trying to do trying

75
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,760
to work with more and more companies to

76
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,759
help tell those stories we're doing some

77
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:32,560
work with the cic here in the uk the

78
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:33,840
cannabis industry council um telling

79
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,360
everything from blogs helping with

80
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,959
websites

81
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,360
social media and we're doing our own

82
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,560
podcast as well the lobster pot and i'm

83
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,080
just trying to get different

84
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,000
perspectives from people all over the

85
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,840
world on what's happening

86
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,598
in their niche whether it be the niche

87
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,519
being a country or a particular part of

88
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:51,518
the industry i'm just trying to find

89
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:55,120
those stories so that's kind of what

90
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:57,039
we're about thermador um yeah so that's

91
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,599
copywriting is very much a core part of

92
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:01,598
that and like i say content driven

93
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:04,399
creativity and that really stems back to

94
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:06,959
words or anything else for me

95
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,480
yeah it's a great uh amount of con or

96
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,158
knowledge to have behind the topic that

97
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,318
we're talking about today because it's

98
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:14,079
the one thing i start to notice is that

99
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:16,560
for as the industry advances and gets

100
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,040
more mature the level of uh

101
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,239
let's say content or intellect in the

102
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:24,798
content needs to start upgrading towards

103
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,480
the likes of sportswear brands or retail

104
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,400
brands that are put in the amount of

105
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:29,598
effort

106
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,200
yeah

107
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:32,959
sorry i think it's definitely a symptom

108
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:34,158
of that i think absolutely the more

109
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,598
interest there is the more you need to

110
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:36,959
kind of stand out the more you need to

111
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:38,798
kind of communicate and i think there's

112
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,400
still a big education piece in cannabis

113
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,000
as well that's what i see i mean it's

114
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,000
very different from technology in many

115
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,919
respects but whereas in tech you have

116
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,439
kind of like taking smart people's ideas

117
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:49,119
and kind of making them palatable to a

118
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:51,120
business audience here you know there's

119
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,319
that stigma times 10 you know we're

120
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,759
talking about something that people a

121
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:55,679
lot of people regard as you know bad

122
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:57,039
drugs you know and things like that or

123
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,920
you know and then you've got other

124
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:59,759
people saying well actually it's

125
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:01,598
medicine like well how can same thing be

126
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,359
okay drugs medicine but you know there's

127
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:06,158
a lot of stigmas to overcome and a lot

128
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,599
of different ways that you know people

129
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:09,359
engage with cannabis and i think you

130
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:11,119
know there's that's on the job to be

131
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,720
done but lots of people i speak to

132
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,799
always have a very

133
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,079
touching often personal story about why

134
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,918
cannabis matters to them how it's

135
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,040
improved their lives or the lives of a

136
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,879
loved one

137
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,560
and i think that's you know it's hearing

138
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,800
those stories and helping that's the

139
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,319
anecdotal evidence that helps to educate

140
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,560
people and i think that's what content

141
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:30,800
is really good at doing

142
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,478
yeah and this is basically the first

143
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,400
topic i wanted to talk about now for

144
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:36,879
entrepreneurs getting into this industry

145
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,239
or looking to set up their own business

146
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:40,240
first and foremost start off with

147
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,160
everybody what is copyrighting and why

148
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,160
is it important for a brand regardless

149
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,560
whether it's cannabis or not

150
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,040
well i copyrighting essentially is you

151
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,639
know the written word and marketing so i

152
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,960
mean you have you know people who write

153
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,560
ads for tv might write scripts i mean

154
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,879
for me i guess more and more over the

155
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,360
last sort of well in my career

156
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,879
i sort of got into it at a time when

157
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,038
there was an opportunity you know there

158
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,800
was more and more digital communications

159
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:07,279
and as you start to see things like

160
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,439
websites and blogs people using content

161
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:11,839
marketing to differentiate their brand

162
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,439
to really you know

163
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:15,519
differentiate you know their kind of

164
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:17,279
tone of voice to kind of stand out and

165
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:19,038
then there's a whole industry around seo

166
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:20,719
i mean i'm gonna get into that but again

167
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:23,279
he's like trying to increase your

168
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,400
presence online as a brand

169
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:28,879
using content as a way to establish

170
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,719
your expertise your tone of voice how

171
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,000
you want to engage with your customers

172
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,280
and i think you always have to have that

173
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,639
customer in mind who's going to read

174
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:36,079
your content how are they going to find

175
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,840
it useful and those are a lot of

176
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:40,079
questions i think we try to ask our

177
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:41,519
clients and people we work with you know

178
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:42,879
it's not just about writing you know

179
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:45,198
something for your website it's thinking

180
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:46,079
about you know who are your customers

181
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,840
why they're going to find this

182
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,599
interesting what value does this deliver

183
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:51,038
it's not about you know our website we

184
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,560
do this this is great you know we do all

185
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:54,959
these wonderful things as a company you

186
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,240
know we sell you know zebras to you know

187
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:57,599
and things like okay well that's fine

188
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,199
but what's the point why do people want

189
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,720
to buy zebras what's important about the

190
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,800
zebra industry i'm just you know being

191
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,639
facetious um but again it's that whole

192
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,199
thing it's like who are you talking to

193
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,199
why is what you can do a solution to

194
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,960
their problem and there's so many

195
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,160
different ways you can kind of spin that

196
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:13,359
you know whether it be through web

197
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,960
content

198
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,000
and there's so many different ways that

199
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:17,839
you know

200
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,120
that becomes relevant through different

201
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,519
channels i mean you know talk about

202
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,600
social media as well as websites as well

203
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:25,599
as you know through i guess conventional

204
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,680
media as well i mean so much of it's

205
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,520
online and so many opportunities to use

206
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,759
content to your advantage that any

207
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:34,799
business isn't is really missing a trick

208
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,479
really um and i think they say in b2b

209
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,400
something like you need seven different

210
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:40,000
brand engagements

211
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:41,038
for someone to start buying products i

212
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,160
mean it's different from you know if

213
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:43,120
you're selling a chocolate bar or

214
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,479
something like that but if you're

215
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,560
selling something like a piece of

216
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:47,839
technology for example people gonna need

217
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,280
to know that they could you know you

218
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:50,799
know what you're talking about that

219
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:53,359
they're buying into something that is

220
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,800
interesting and will actually help them

221
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,319
you know do everything from you know

222
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,960
save them money it will increase their

223
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,160
efficiency all those sorts of things and

224
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,839
you know

225
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,520
that is what is at the heart of content

226
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:05,279
and similarly same with cannabis as well

227
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:07,038
you know i guess if you

228
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:08,159
uh in a kind of b2b environment if

229
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:09,839
you're selling a piece of machinery or

230
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,759
something like that you need to not only

231
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:13,439
talk about its features and benefits but

232
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,439
you know what's the impact you're gonna

233
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:16,879
have for your customer is it gonna you

234
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:19,038
know make them more money is it gonna

235
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:20,079
help them improve efficiencies and put

236
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:22,000
more you know

237
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:24,318
pre-rolls through per hour or whatever

238
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,759
it might be so and that was not

239
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,520
necessarily the interesting things the

240
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,680
interesting thing is that you know the

241
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:31,680
impact something like that will have and

242
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,120
that's where the story aspect comes in

243
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,959
so there's a lot of elements i see

244
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,879
caught up in it i mean you know it's

245
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:39,839
like journalism but it's more of a kind

246
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:41,680
of slant towards you know selling stuff

247
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:43,758
and you've got to be as authentic as you

248
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,759
can in order to be thought of as

249
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,520
credible and i think that's a big part

250
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,598
of well it's important for any business

251
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:51,680
to be thought of as credible

252
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:53,120
and i think content particularly in the

253
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,598
cannabis industry where you've got so

254
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,840
many restrictions around advertising and

255
00:07:55,598 --> 00:08:00,159
marketing and things like that

256
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:01,598
using content to actually tell those

257
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,160
anecdotal stories could be a very

258
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:04,159
powerful thing

259
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:10,400
incredibly yes so do you see over in

260
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:12,800
north america any agencies that seem to

261
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:15,120
be excelling at this or is is there a

262
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,520
massive limit on what the company

263
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,319
agencies can currently do on the market

264
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:20,560
or

265
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,560
what do you see so far i mean it's not

266
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,079
something i'm hugely

267
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,759
you know aware of what happening in the

268
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:27,839
us in terms of their restrictions but

269
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,439
you look at you know the way in which

270
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:30,719
for example

271
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:32,399
in canada

272
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,839
sort of companies you know cannabis

273
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,679
companies you know you can't have a kind

274
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,440
of big fancy kind of uh

275
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,478
packaging on the shelves you know you

276
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,039
need to have you know you have to have

277
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,719
that big kind of uh has to be sort of

278
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:44,399
black it has to have a big yellow thc

279
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,000
sticker on or something like that so

280
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,360
that you know how do you build a brand

281
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,879
with those sort of restrictions when you

282
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,039
can't go on instagram for example you

283
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:53,120
can't sort of and openly advertise on

284
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:54,480
facebook how do you navigate those sort

285
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,560
of restrictions i think that's something

286
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,560
that a lot of cannabis brands in

287
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:59,679
well in north america and and beyond you

288
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,319
know if you're trying to build something

289
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:04,479
you're in danger of being basically shut

290
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,000
down from you know

291
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,080
to a larger part of your audience so

292
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,519
that puts pressure on needing to use

293
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,600
other channels to

294
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:15,360
you know demonstrate what your brand's

295
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,720
about or you know and i think again

296
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,000
it's trying to substantiate kind of

297
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,759
health claims and things like that well

298
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,039
that you know that's a whole different

299
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,319
kettle of fish but if you're talking

300
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:24,480
about that you just need to be very

301
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,399
mindful and i think again if you can

302
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,800
tell stories around it and use that kind

303
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,399
of anecdotal rather than cast iron

304
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:31,919
evidence that you know and again there's

305
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,240
there's problems around research and

306
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:35,838
things like that how can you demonstrate

307
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,159
statistics or demonstrate that something

308
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,560
has a specific impact when you you know

309
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:42,079
when there's no research happening or i

310
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:44,639
mean i'm just kind of speculating to a

311
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,959
large extent here i'm no expert in that

312
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:47,759
side of things but for me it comes back

313
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:49,919
to

314
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:52,399
even if you kind of think about the

315
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:53,838
wider perspective on those sorts of

316
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,039
restrictions from a marketing

317
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,560
perspective

318
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:59,599
you know you can still do more with

319
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:01,039
content than you can in

320
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,320
written content you know as a kind of

321
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:04,958
share of voice

322
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,800
uh play than using something visual and

323
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:08,559
putting on a social media post and sort

324
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:11,359
of you know because

325
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:12,479
you know like again i think you really

326
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,000
when you think about the broader

327
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,920
perspective of

328
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,240
a brand or marketing and things like

329
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:19,679
that it's you know it's about that full

330
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,799
impact the full spectrum you know i

331
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:21,838
think there's a lot of parallels in

332
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,519
there

333
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,399
in so many different sectors and i

334
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,240
always love how cannabis seems to be you

335
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,879
know 15 different sectors just coming

336
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,720
together and just clashing together and

337
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:34,240
you know there's a little bit of war is

338
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,079
it can we advertise it in the same way

339
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,519
as we can pharma or is it like uh

340
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:39,919
alcoholic beverages or is it like

341
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:42,240
fast-moving consumer goods or is it you

342
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:43,519
know is it medicine there's so many kind

343
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,480
of

344
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,560
thing you know ways in which people

345
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,079
understand it or don't understand it and

346
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:52,319
i think it's just about you know

347
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:54,000
reassuring your customers whatever it is

348
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,760
whether you're selling flower oils or

349
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,639
you know vaping devices or something

350
00:10:55,759 --> 00:11:00,480
like that there has to be a way to

351
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:02,480
illustrate that

352
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,320
differentiate your brand and i think

353
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,000
through content you know i'm you know

354
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,240
i'm an advocate for it i think i just

355
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,679
think there are so many ways to leverage

356
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,278
it

357
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:13,199
don't have to answer the question but it

358
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:15,439
gave me a sense of feeling like i know

359
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,278
what i'm talking about so yes i know

360
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,880
indeed for sure and i actually it

361
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:20,879
incorporated what i wanted to move on to

362
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:23,120
is how to build a brand new cannabis and

363
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:24,720
as you said con copywriting is an

364
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,440
essential part of your brand building

365
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,360
book we started to see over in america

366
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,000
especially the west coast seem to have a

367
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,000
lot of golf events uh lemon haze of

368
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,839
their events and i've started to hear

369
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,440
already about new york

370
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,240
and where they're like the rooftop

371
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,959
cannabis parties uh sample parties are

372
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,839
already starting to happen so do you see

373
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:46,239
uh

374
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,760
when it happens in the uk a mix of

375
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,919
events like this or do you always think

376
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:52,399
the written word is gonna outdo any

377
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:54,879
in-person event that can be held

378
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,559
i'd you know i think you need that you

379
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:58,480
you need a kind of uh

380
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:00,239
just broader approach as possible i

381
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,159
think you know one of the things that

382
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,039
i'm always constantly thinking about is

383
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:04,639
you know

384
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:06,240
where's the kind of there needs to be

385
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,320
some creativity in what you're doing and

386
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,560
i think having restrictions sometimes

387
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,040
can really help to focus how

388
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,399
you attack something i think that's how

389
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:15,679
you can be creative in marketing

390
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,679
sometimes it comes from having those

391
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:19,679
restrictions here in the uk i think

392
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:22,159
because we have you know a medical

393
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:24,239
market you know it feels a long way from

394
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:26,078
having a recreational market there's

395
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,720
still that kind of like i say the

396
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,479
stigmas to overcome to convince people

397
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,360
that this is medicine you know people

398
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,039
will

399
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,360
have cannabis you know recreationally

400
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:37,120
illegally that that's something that's

401
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,278
going to happen regardless

402
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,600
but what in order to kind of give him

403
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:44,240
more legitimacy we need to be able to

404
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,720
demonstrate to to patients or potential

405
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,079
patients as well as doctors that this is

406
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,120
medicine and that there are different

407
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:50,719
ways to

408
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,480
you know we need to have that education

409
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,079
piece and i think again content is

410
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,600
perfect for that education piece and i

411
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:57,679
think that's the kind of first piece of

412
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,200
the puzzle we need to address over here

413
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:01,599
and i think you know organizations like

414
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,600
the mccs uh professor mike barnes hannah

415
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,440
deacon doing making great strides and

416
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,480
doing that they're going around the uk

417
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,079
and uh

418
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,680
talking to doctors directly and we've

419
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:11,039
been to one of their events and you know

420
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:13,278
they're giving these really intelligent

421
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:14,958
doctors cannabis 101 not because they

422
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:16,480
you know it's not talking down to them

423
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:18,879
it's because the knowledge just isn't

424
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,639
there so you know telling stories is

425
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:22,958
about you know understand you know i

426
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,519
think the work of you know organizations

427
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:27,679
like glee you know getting people out

428
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,039
there you know it's still storytelling

429
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,359
it's the same thing you know whether

430
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:32,799
it's you know written content

431
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,000
in-person events you know you need to

432
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,519
have those stories certain i think

433
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,519
that's the important thing and i think

434
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,720
that's something all kinds of brands can

435
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,879
have a

436
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,959
you know have a hand in and you know

437
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:44,799
like i say i feel like every

438
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:47,119
company that

439
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:49,278
engages in in the sector almost has to

440
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,120
do that advocacy piece and that those

441
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:53,278
storytelling aspects is is a key part of

442
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,320
that so i think it's it's one of the

443
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:58,720
same thing events written content social

444
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,240
media it's all part of the same effort

445
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,360
and you know there's that story aspect

446
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,799
that has to come through and i think

447
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,199
it's how do we tell those stories how do

448
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:06,958
we manifest them and what are we up

449
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:09,198
against how what again we have the

450
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:11,278
different context in which we can

451
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:13,359
do that and that varies depending on on

452
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:14,879
the country but yeah that's kind of

453
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,560
what's at the cross we need everything

454
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:18,480
basically i think

455
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:20,559
super stuff has been a very informative

456
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,199
episode so far before we finish up with

457
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:25,439
the time we've got um the election over

458
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:26,958
the uk who's going to win it and who's

459
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,120
going to legalize cannabis is it going

460
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,119
to be

461
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,600
you know personally i mean i think we

462
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:37,519
need to we need to change at the top for

463
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,159
anything meaningful to happen from

464
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:43,600
cannabis perspective but you know

465
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:44,879
politicians are in my opinion

466
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,199
you never know what's going to happen

467
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:48,320
next so you know maybe the tory player

468
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:50,159
will come along and say all right we

469
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,040
need to kind of you know get the economy

470
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:54,799
back on track let's legalize cannabis

471
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:56,559
recreationally let's tax it and let's

472
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:59,278
let's make a load of money from it

473
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:01,278
hopefully that's what is happening um
