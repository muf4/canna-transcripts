good things moving forward in ireland

24
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,719
and my background

25
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,640
i mean i'm from born and brought up in

26
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,719
england and actually moved to israel

27
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,399
about 15 years ago

28
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,558
my professional backgrounds marketing

29
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,359
marketing and entrepreneurship

30
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,000
and i found myself involved in cannabis

31
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,558
it was about

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,599
six years ago now and as a medical

33
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:09,359
cannabis was kind of

34
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:12,559
beginning to to explode in in israel

35
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:13,840
um and what we saw back then was uh i

36
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,200
think we're gonna talk about it soon but

37
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,000
one of the things we saw back then was a

38
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,118
big

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,640
delta big lack of entrepreneurs um

40
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:23,200
not enough companies not enough young

41
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,799
people with innovative ideas or business

42
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,880
plans or technologies

43
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,080
to drive the industry forward and still

44
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,000
back then

45
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:31,438
and there was very much it was it was a

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,719
taboo you know the entrepreneurs that we

47
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:34,478
would meet

48
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:35,599
many times hadn't told their family and

49
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:37,438
friends what they were doing because

50
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:39,759
there was still this stigma

51
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:40,798
around around cannabis so what we did

52
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,319
was you know we we

53
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,079
began by launching an event called

54
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:45,839
canatec and the idea of canada tech was

55
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:47,199
to bring together entrepreneurs and

56
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,960
investors and

57
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,280
try and create discussion around the

58
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:52,879
industry and so my first couple of years

59
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,399
was really based around that kind of

60
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,319
building ecosystems

61
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,599
and raising awareness and some

62
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:00,959
government lobbying

63
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:04,478
to try and move everything forward um

64
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:06,239
then about four years ago i i came to a

65
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:08,719
painful conclusion

66
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,840
that the medical cannabis side of things

67
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:12,560
or the thc

68
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,000
or the doctor prescribed cannabis which

69
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,800
having recalled it

70
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,159
um is fraught with so many obstacles so

71
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,439
many problems

72
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:23,680
um what they can and are being overcome

73
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:25,039
in the short term it's it's consumers

74
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,360
that are missing out

75
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:30,079
uh whether it be regulatory or

76
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,800
entrepreneurs or product availability

77
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,959
um so i moved from the thc side of

78
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,400
things to the cbd side because

79
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,519
in 2016 the uk began to recognize the

80
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,519
mhra

81
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,519
recognize that cbd has medicinal

82
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,200
benefits and then from there

83
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,439
you know the awareness and the education

84
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:50,399
of what cbd is and what it can do

85
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:51,759
just began to blossom and that's why i

86
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,360
said the business offices scitec was

87
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:56,878
formed four years ago

88
00:02:53,360 --> 00:03:00,560
the idea is to bring medical cannabis

89
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:01,840
quality products to the cbd market

90
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,920
and that's what we did we launched

91
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,158
profican and proficans are flagship

92
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:07,759
brands we launched that four years ago

93
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:10,239
and we now won the market leaders in the

94
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:11,679
uk and and it's exactly that it's

95
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,158
there's no cannabis leaf there's no

96
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,280
green coloring it looks like

97
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:16,840
it's something the doctor would

98
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,158
prescribe but your pharmacist would

99
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,920
dispense um

100
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:21,598
in short it's something that as a

101
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:22,479
consumer that when you look at the

102
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,039
products

103
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:26,479
feel it and use it that it immediately

104
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:28,158
elicits trust

105
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:30,479
and it's going to work and trust in the

106
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:32,639
company just a little bit about how i

107
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,878
came to where we are today

108
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:35,839
okay excellent and could you give a

109
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:37,518
little bit of a

110
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,000
background on your products are

111
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,280
developed in israel with the leading

112
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,598
scientists that they've got over there

113
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,039
can you explain to the audience how long

114
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,399
israel have been in the research and

115
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:48,000
development part of the cannabis

116
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,239
industry and why they're considered the

117
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,120
world leaders at this

118
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,438
sure um well i think we've been in the

119
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,799
research and science side since day one

120
00:03:55,438 --> 00:04:00,560
and actually professor rafael muschilan

121
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,120
who's often referred to as the the

122
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,920
grandfather of of cannabis medicine

123
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,680
and it was him in the late 1950s that

124
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:08,798
began to research cannabis and he and

125
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,599
his team

126
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,680
throughout the 60s um discovered an

127
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:15,759
isolated thc

128
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,358
and they coined the phrase the entourage

129
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:19,279
effect and the whole

130
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,959
plethora of other cannabinoids were

131
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,078
discovered by them and they began to

132
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,040
research and

133
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,319
really uncover um the medicinal benefits

134
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,199
of the plants because up until that

135
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:29,360
point

136
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,919
and all we knew about the plant was it

137
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,439
gets you high and it's and it's illegal

138
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:35,439
and on top of that was built the

139
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,040
propaganda of everything we've known in

140
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:39,040
the last 40 50 years

141
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,720
so really is in the 60s that we began to

142
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,400
kind of break through those molds

143
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,720
it wasn't really until about the late

144
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:46,560
1990s

145
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,479
california was already beginning to move

146
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,959
towards medical cannabis

147
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:52,719
and we'd reached a point where we were

148
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,478
not just researching you know from the

149
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,280
scientific side but we're going to move

150
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:58,478
that

151
00:04:55,279 --> 00:05:01,119
investigatory intuition into the

152
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:02,719
medical so into the clinical study world

153
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,399
of things so

154
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,160
by the late 1990s we're already

155
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:07,918
beginning to research

156
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,080
and understand and uncover what it can

157
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:11,038
do everything from you know epilepsy to

158
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,399
autism

159
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:14,800
ptsd um there's a number of indications

160
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:16,159
that

161
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,879
wouldn't have been known about had it

162
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,520
not been for um hospitals and

163
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:23,600
indeed patients over here in israel and

164
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:26,000
we've continued that path so we

165
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,800
we we do we do have this this amazing

166
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,879
perception

167
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,478
um and it is true and there's more

168
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,639
clinical studies here for cannabis

169
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:35,279
that's going on in this country than

170
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,879
um all of the world combined um there's

171
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,799
hundreds of studies going on right now

172
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,079
everything from pre-clinicals in in

173
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,879
little petri dishes

174
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:44,639
through to fill on uh human studies

175
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:46,639
double-blind placebos

176
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,918
almost every hospital in the country has

177
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,960
some kind of

178
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:52,560
cannabis clinical study going on um and

179
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:54,959
and to the point that you know even

180
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,759
in the last two or three years um the

181
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:57,758
stigma

182
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,960
the stigma of cannabis has all but

183
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,720
disappeared

184
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:02,000
um the final stretch will be when we

185
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,759
actually legalize

186
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,279
in in government and we hope that's

187
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,639
going to happen in the next year or two

188
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:09,198
or 18 months

189
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,960
but certainly um it's very rare now that

190
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,240
you would find anyone that would speak

191
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:14,879
out against

192
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,680
cannabis because almost everybody knows

193
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:19,279
someone who's benefited from it

194
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,918
and so we're in a good position over

195
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:23,758
here yeah now and i think that leads me

196
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:25,599
perfectly on to the next topic which i

197
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,759
hope we're both was there we're going to

198
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,400
start to see more of which is incur

199
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,080
encouraging more startups what do you

200
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:33,279
see being the hinder block here is it

201
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:34,879
the actual fact that

202
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:36,879
it's still illegal and a lot of people

203
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:38,879
frown upon it and their floodgates of

204
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:40,879
entrepreneurs creating startups will

205
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,560
happen once there's that kind of full

206
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:44,000
open legalization do you see that

207
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,280
happening

208
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,279
um unfortunately yes um

209
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:50,799
i mean there is there is some innovation

210
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:52,719
there is some entrepreneurs going on it

211
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,598
has been for a number of years but

212
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,919
certainly um it's the regulatory you

213
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:59,279
know

214
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:01,598
the doors that are closed because thc is

215
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:02,559
psychoactive and in almost every country

216
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:04,719
it's still

217
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,680
illegal it's still a a controlled

218
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,680
substance

219
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,918
so yeah you know from everything from

220
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,720
you know just getting a license to

221
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:13,359
research the product let alone you know

222
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,080
use

223
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,800
data or any kind of you know innovative

224
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:18,560
technology

225
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,199
where you need to touch the plant to

226
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,598
develop it it becomes a problem

227
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,360
um now we we've all thought we all hoped

228
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:27,680
that just the medical cannabis

229
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,520
regulations that have been rolling out

230
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,240
would open up the market enough to allow

231
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:32,959
entrepreneurs

232
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,759
in um unfortunately that hasn't been the

233
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:36,478
case and

234
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,639
i mean i believe that's mostly down sir

235
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:41,360
until the banks until the financial

236
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,800
institutions can involve themselves in

237
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,879
the in the industry

238
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,478
then everything gets blocked um

239
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,960
entrepreneurs

240
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:49,758
need investors and investors while

241
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:52,638
investment

242
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,240
is growing significantly it still lags

243
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,560
way behind other industries

244
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,598
at this stage in their growth by now we

245
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,240
should be looking at you know there

246
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:01,279
should be

247
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,280
vc funds and family offices and

248
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:05,198
all manner of investment coming in in

249
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:06,959
the uk i mean even i think this week

250
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,639
there's two companies that are

251
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:11,198
listing on the stock market in the uk

252
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,439
this week it's fantastic news

253
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,560
um two or three years behind where it

254
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:16,639
should be

255
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,160
um but we're hoping now that you know

256
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,918
now that's happening the floodgates will

257
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,080
open and over the next

258
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:23,680
i hope over the next year there will be

259
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:24,839
a lot more investment coming in which is

260
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,439
going to encourage

261
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:28,560
startups um there's nothing more

262
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:30,399
disparaging

263
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,158
i know this myself nothing more

264
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:33,918
disparaging for an entrepreneur than

265
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:35,519
knowing that there's nowhere to raise

266
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:37,918
money from yeah banks aren't giving the

267
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,759
loans because it's still illegal

268
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:42,399
um so really yes this is what we need to

269
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:43,918
do a free market's required to develop

270
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,440
the industry we know the exciting

271
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:47,919
products come from

272
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,360
creative minds and this is what we need

273
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:49,919
so we need to push this through and it's

274
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,480
coming

275
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,079
it's coming slowly but it's coming yeah

276
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,320
now i agree totally with you what do you

277
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,759
think of the headlines of the sale of gw

278
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,600
pharma there recently

279
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:02,639
is uh is that a good thing for the

280
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,879
industry or a bad thing

281
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,720
um well look it can only it can only be

282
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:10,480
a good thing anytime that cannabis

283
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,800
is is normalized i use this word a lot

284
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,920
that the sooner we can normalize

285
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:16,079
cannabis

286
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:17,278
the sooner that all normal things will

287
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,879
happen you know including

288
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:22,080
entrepreneurs and good products and good

289
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:24,320
regulation and we we need that to happen

290
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,959
um and i said again as i say i i think

291
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,040
it's i think it's happening now

292
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:30,559
yeah no i agree with you as well kind of

293
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:31,759
leads me on to the last thing i wanted

294
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:33,518
to talk to you about here a man who

295
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:34,958
knows how to build a brand between the

296
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,399
stuff you've got with james haskell and

297
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,838
the various other

298
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,200
products that you've got out what are

299
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,720
the three tips that you'd give to

300
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,480
somebody who's starting in the cannabis

301
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,480
industry on how to build their brand up

302
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:50,079
um three tips um i'll give you one tip

303
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,039
because i think it all starts with one

304
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,080
thing um

305
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:56,240
and that's trust um how do you then

306
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,680
you know dismantle and deconstruct the

307
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,200
word trust

308
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:01,199
but you know i mean so my background's

309
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,320
marketing i'm not a science or a medical

310
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,000
professional

311
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,320
and so i come at the industry from that

312
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,879
marketing and brands building side and i

313
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,240
know from

314
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:10,399
my years in the industry and other

315
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,440
industries in brands building

316
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,919
you've got one target your bullseye the

317
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,560
target

318
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:17,360
every single time is to build trust

319
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:18,000
because you know when you've got

320
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,278
consumers

321
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,278
who are choosing between different

322
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:23,278
brands it's

323
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:24,720
again what's the one thing that makes

324
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:26,078
them decide one over the other it's

325
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,879
which one they

326
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:30,479
trust is going to work better they trust

327
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:31,759
is going to be more than the branding

328
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,480
the brand language

329
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:36,078
is affiliated to them they trust that

330
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,759
when they tell other people about it

331
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:38,479
that they're gonna get a good reception

332
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:41,679
it's it's

333
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:45,360
it's trust trust trust um and that

334
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:46,879
in the cbd or cannabis industry is is

335
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,919
not an easy task

336
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:51,439
and we're talking about fundamentally um

337
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:53,838
healthcare products something that

338
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,640
people are using either as

339
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,680
um in replacement of regular medicines

340
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,278
or alongside

341
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:00,879
regular medicines this is not something

342
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:02,879
that's for fun

343
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:04,480
so to build trust in something that

344
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:05,439
people are using for their health is not

345
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,800
easy

346
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,440
um what we did um i guess this is this

347
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:12,078
is that my

348
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,800
my single biggest takeaway is we we

349
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:15,439
identified

350
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:17,359
where the trust is right or wrong the

351
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,160
trust is in medical cannabis

352
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,399
over cbd and certainly if you look at

353
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:24,319
the the markets in america

354
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,399
and actually over here in israel there

355
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,278
is a perception in the marketplace and

356
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,078
again

357
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:31,039
it's wrong but it's how it's evolved but

358
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:33,439
if you want

359
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:35,120
um if you want efficacy from cannabis

360
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,240
then you need medical cannabis you need

361
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,278
thc

362
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,440
and the cbd doesn't do a good enough job

363
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:43,679
now we know that's not right because

364
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,200
arguably it's the other way around cbd

365
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:48,719
is the anti-inflammatory

366
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,920
cbd is the anti-anxiety cbd does so many

367
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,800
good things

368
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:54,838
um thc does some good things but from a

369
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:56,240
therapeutic perspective it really is the

370
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,399
cbd and

371
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,759
so what we did is now we have to ask

372
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,839
ourselves how do we

373
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:03,039
how do we bring the credibility of

374
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,040
medical cannabis

375
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:06,639
into a cbd product into a wellness

376
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:08,319
product because again

377
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,720
medical cannabis you'll see it's being

378
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,160
sold in a specific strain is good for

379
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:16,639
autism or a strain is good for cancer

380
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:18,000
there's a very close indication specific

381
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,159
strains which

382
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,519
without the clinical studies you know

383
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:23,278
it's it's not it's not

384
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,278
it's not a legal position to take and

385
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:27,039
certainly in the cbd world

386
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:28,720
we do not make claims we sell it as a

387
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:29,679
food supplement there's no doctors so

388
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,879
there's no

389
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:36,000
we cannot say that our cbd is good for

390
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:38,720
ptsd although this one is good for pain

391
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,360
all we can say is our cbd is good so to

392
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,120
build that

393
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:46,079
trust is is quite complex um what we did

394
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,440
is from day one uh alongside the

395
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:48,799
development of the products that we do

396
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,279
over here in israel

397
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:52,000
and we began investing in and working

398
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:53,838
with a lot of

399
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,120
universities and hospitals on the

400
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,279
clinical studies

401
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,720
so we've involved us and we funded a

402
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:00,000
number of them but we've involved

403
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,160
ourselves in

404
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,440
cannabis studies to look at potential to

405
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:05,039
treat asthma

406
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,120
the potential to treat fatty liver

407
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:09,120
disease diabetes

408
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,720
and we've partnered with the medical

409
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,240
cannabis nurses association in israel to

410
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,800
share knowledge because you know we've

411
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,720
got tens of thousands of customers

412
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,799
who feedback you know what they use what

413
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,480
they use it for how they use it

414
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,159
and we can't use that for marketing

415
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,639
because there'll be a claim

416
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:28,159
but we can feed that back to our to the

417
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,399
nurses that we work with and they feed

418
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:30,799
us

419
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,759
information we can kind of work with our

420
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:33,679
customers

421
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:35,360
so it's kind of a symbiotic relationship

422
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:37,679
so if you look at

423
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,278
our company scitec yeah the background

424
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:43,039
is you know we're positioned as

425
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:44,799
a a biotech or a an r d company that

426
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:48,000
just happens to produce

427
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:49,599
good quality cbd products as opposed

428
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,360
to what we see in the marketplace which

429
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,399
is companies that begin

430
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,800
as a cbd brand with not much behind them

431
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,399
and then move on to try and establish

432
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:00,319
trust and establish credibility

433
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,000
we took it that that's first and

434
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,680
foremost first and foremost

435
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,440
you can have an ugly brand you can have

436
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:07,439
a very ugly logo

437
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,680
you can do all those things wrong but as

438
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,480
long as the essence behind the brand

439
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:13,838
is strong then in the healthcare world

440
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,159
that's going to work

441
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,000
because people will people will forgive

442
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:20,399
a bad tasting product

443
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,360
people will forgive a badly packaged

444
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,839
product

445
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,879
if it works if they can sleep if their

446
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,720
pain is gone

447
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:28,000
if their anxiety is gone they'll forgive

448
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,160
all these things

449
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,240
as long as they trust it works so that's

450
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:33,919
what we did we built trust based on

451
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,360
involving ourselves in the science and

452
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:36,879
the medicine

453
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,440
and it's also a very interesting side of

454
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:41,198
the industry it's very exciting

455
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,040
okay yeah that's a great little note to

456
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:44,240
finish on trust out there everybody for

457
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:45,120
acceptable business that's the

458
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,879
fundamental

459
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,159
pillar that you need to put in place

460
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:49,919
actually as you're speaking i could

461
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:51,919
think of a ton of cbd companies that are

462
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:53,679
let you know trying to pivot in to make

463
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:55,360
every pharmaceutical thing and become

464
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:56,399
lab testers and all this kind of stuff

465
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,919
whereas uh

466
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,679
yeah as i said if you get all those

467
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:01,360
pillars in in the place

468
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:02,719
in the right place at the first time is

469
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,240
where the aim should be

470
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,480
clifton thank you very much for coming

471
