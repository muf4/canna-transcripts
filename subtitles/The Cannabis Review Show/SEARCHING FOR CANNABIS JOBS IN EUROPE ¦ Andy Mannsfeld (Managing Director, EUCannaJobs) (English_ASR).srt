11
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:30,660
overview of why you guys set up EU kind

12
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:31,800
of jobs in your position in the industry

13
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,859
up to date

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,859
yeah be glad to so we started eukana

15
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:39,960
jobs because we noticed a couple of

16
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:42,420
years ago that it was really difficult

17
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,579
to find talent in the industry we were

18
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,559
working on a separate uh cannabis

19
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:49,020
project here in Europe and we're looking

20
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,699
for staff and just found it difficult so

21
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,460
we ended up having to go through indeed

22
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,199
in other places like that and you know

23
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,259
it just didn't work

24
00:00:55,198 --> 00:01:00,718
um the the talent was you know spread

25
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:05,158
out all over the place and then when we

26
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:07,799
tried listing jobs uh also it was not

27
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:11,280
really working finding people uh that

28
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:13,740
that were familiar with cannabis and

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,219
um yeah just decided that that needed to

30
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:19,500
be changed we also know that or knew

31
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:21,298
from back in the U.S that there are a

32
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,000
lot of different types of cannabis

33
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:26,759
specific or cannabis industry specific

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,438
jobs platforms there they seem to work

35
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,840
really well

36
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:33,658
um and so we decided that that was a

37
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,340
good way to go here and just try and

38
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,140
help the industry and help individuals

39
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,540
trying to get into the industry

40
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,920
yeah it seems to be an opportune time

41
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,600
that you guys have set up with the

42
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,159
industry grow and that the rate it's

43
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:46,798
going to grow over the next five to ten

44
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,479
years and hiring Talent is is a

45
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,479
specialty in any industry whether it's

46
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:53,219
cannabis or not can you maybe uh give

47
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:54,978
everybody an overview when it comes to

48
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:57,599
searching for cannabis jobs in Europe

49
00:01:54,978 --> 00:02:00,239
how do you guys partner up with the

50
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:03,419
various Brands and how do you guys find

51
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:05,879
the employees looking to find these jobs

52
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,740
yeah so you know initially for

53
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:10,318
partnering up with the companies it was

54
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:11,939
good old-fashioned uh you know sales

55
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,859
calls reaching out to the companies

56
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:15,959
explaining what we're doing and we're

57
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,099
lucky to find some big companies and a

58
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:18,840
lot of small companies who are

59
00:02:17,098 --> 00:02:21,719
interested in partnering with us early

60
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,000
on now of course at Mary Jane we found a

61
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:26,340
lot more companies that want to join the

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,080
platform but for the company that was

63
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,080
just you know reaching out explaining

64
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,120
what we're doing and and if uh for the

65
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,379
most part almost everyone said yeah we

66
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,780
definitely need something like that

67
00:02:34,378 --> 00:02:38,878
which also helped encourage us to keep

68
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,560
pushing forward uh which you know

69
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:42,120
sometimes it can be when you face

70
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,860
challenges it's always easy to want to

71
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,620
give up it's a matter of just you know

72
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,780
seeing the vision and pushing forward

73
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:50,459
the uh finding the candidates is of

74
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,800
course a little bit more challenging you

75
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:55,319
know you can't just reach out to the

76
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,700
hundreds of companies or reach out to

77
00:02:55,318 --> 00:03:00,299
candidates like we do to the hundreds of

78
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:01,919
companies so we're using social media

79
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,780
um you know whether it be through the

80
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,359
meta platforms or LinkedIn

81
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,280
and also going to

82
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,920
um events like Mary Jane we've been to

83
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,419
several others over the last year so to

84
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:14,039
really just reach those people who are

85
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:16,139
at these events since they're obviously

86
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:17,878
interested in the industry

87
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:19,859
um Mary Jane it was interesting to see

88
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:21,840
how many candidates or potential

89
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,000
candidates were like oh this is a great

90
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,979
idea or I can work in the Cannabis

91
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,840
industry and very surprised it's like

92
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:30,719
well of course they need workers it

93
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,580
doesn't come from any from nowhere so uh

94
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,199
very good response and so we're

95
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:37,260
continuing with just the social media

96
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:39,658
strategy trying to reach out and get the

97
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:41,519
word out to those candidates

98
00:03:39,658 --> 00:03:44,039
I could imagine the amount of interest

99
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,599
that there would be from regular people

100
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:46,739
just wanting to get jobs in this

101
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:49,079
industry especially if you've got to

102
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:50,640
look for cannabis already when it comes

103
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,099
to the current jobs that are around at

104
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:55,500
the moment does it seem to be marketing

105
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:57,359
and cultivation or kind of at the

106
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,400
Forefront of this at the moment or as a

107
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,840
business development and advertising

108
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,640
what are you seeing as the most popular

109
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,459
jobs currently in the industry because

110
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:07,679
the the runway for growth is not exactly

111
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:09,120
clear yet for a lot of companies so what

112
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,438
do you see is the most advantageous

113
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,878
route for people to get into this

114
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:14,938
industry right now

115
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:16,680
yeah so you know the three top uh kind

116
00:04:14,938 --> 00:04:19,738
of categories that we're seeing right

117
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,120
now are Marketing sales and I.T

118
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:23,000
um which kind of makes sense you know

119
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,500
obviously I.T is involved in everything

120
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,139
nowadays and Marketing sales you know

121
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,759
regardless of what your product is

122
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:31,439
um if you're not selling it we're

123
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,240
getting people interested in it then

124
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:35,219
there's no point being in business so

125
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,460
those are the three biggest categories

126
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:41,100
uh cultivation is actually fairly fairly

127
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:42,599
small part of it uh which also kind of

128
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,939
makes sense

129
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,500
um so but in the end it's really

130
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:48,180
important that people just see what

131
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,860
they're interested in

132
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,780
um you know and not necessarily say well

133
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,879
there's a lot of marketing so now I need

134
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:55,978
to become an expert in marketing and

135
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:57,899
change what my interest is with any

136
00:04:55,978 --> 00:05:00,418
career it's really important to think

137
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:02,698
about what you want to do and then try

138
00:05:00,418 --> 00:05:05,579
and see if that what your interests are

139
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:06,780
fits with the jobs that are out there

140
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:08,519
um you know for a lot of people who are

141
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:10,258
just starting off you know maybe they're

142
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:13,319
young and maybe they're still in school

143
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:15,240
a good way to go is by doing internships

144
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:18,418
so that they can actually go work at

145
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,439
some of these companies and uh get to

146
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:21,060
learn a little bit more about the

147
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:23,939
business and then they might be able to

148
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:26,038
find uh they're their path in the

149
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:27,719
industry that way because you know a lot

150
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:29,579
of times we just don't know exactly what

151
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,620
we want to do until we start

152
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,879
kind of doing things and then we kind of

153
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,038
find our way

154
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:37,560
and is there a certain territory out at

155
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:39,839
the moment that is kind of posting a lot

156
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,280
of the main jobs is it Germany or are

157
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,379
there other territories around Europe

158
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:45,119
and what do you see like let's say in

159
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:47,519
the next five years has been the most

160
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,560
advantageous territory

161
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:51,779
yeah right now definitely the majority

162
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,780
of the jobs are in Germany Germany

163
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:56,279
currently has the biggest Medical Market

164
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:58,138
um all the medical markets of course

165
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:00,659
have their issues with patient access

166
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:02,579
and insurance reimbursement so there's

167
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,800
always issues in and they're different

168
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:06,418
in each country but Germany still has

169
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,120
the biggest medical market right now so

170
00:06:06,418 --> 00:06:12,060
it's the it's where the most jobs are

171
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,399
um that would probably continue uh over

172
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:17,339
the next five years or so Germany is

173
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:19,560
kind of pushing the legalization uh

174
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:21,899
envelope right now the most and they

175
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,300
expect to have cannabis Social Clubs and

176
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:27,659
home growing in the next year or two and

177
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:29,879
after that also have different types of

178
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,960
um research projects they're calling

179
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:33,959
them where you'll be able to have

180
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:35,758
legalized sales in individual cities how

181
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:37,318
those details will work that no one

182
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,720
knows right now but the point being

183
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:43,199
Germany's probably going to continue to

184
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:45,060
be the most uh the biggest Market

185
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,939
um as other countries like the Czech

186
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:50,399
Republic are looking at legalization of

187
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:52,740
course those types of things can change

188
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:54,560
the Dynamics very quickly if the Czech

189
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:57,000
Republic were to do full legalization

190
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,620
before driver then of course that's

191
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,439
going to increase jobs there

192
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:04,978
dramatically but you also have you know

193
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:06,839
Portugal Spain France the UK everyone's

194
00:07:04,978 --> 00:07:08,519
discussing it all the bigger countries

195
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:11,758
and smaller countries are discussing

196
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:14,099
different types of legalization Pathways

197
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,800
and all that can change with politics so

198
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,300
quickly so you know what what who will

199
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,520
really be the biggest Mark in five or

200
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,960
ten years we can't really say

201
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:24,418
for now looks like it's going to be

202
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:25,918
Germany when it comes to the job Zone do

203
00:07:24,418 --> 00:07:27,779
you see the UK as being a bit of an

204
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:30,538
outlier with brexit happening I would

205
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:33,538
imagine that the X-ray

206
00:07:30,538 --> 00:07:35,339
certification or the extra immigration

207
00:07:33,538 --> 00:07:36,719
level that's going to be involved for

208
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:39,119
employees let's say if you're in the

209
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,340
European continent going to the UK and

210
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,079
surely being taxed and all the other

211
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:45,899
different hurdles that are coming to

212
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:47,159
fruition from brexit do you see the UK

213
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:49,138
as one of the markets that's actually

214
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,539
going to be lacking when it comes to

215
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:53,400
people applying for jobs because if

216
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:55,860
there's an option between Portugal and

217
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:57,060
Spain and the UK I think you're going to

218
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,800
have a lot of people choosing the

219
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,500
European continent

220
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,840
yeah I mean I think there's two sides to

221
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,699
that you know on the one side

222
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,519
um sure if you know if someone's in

223
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:11,280
Czech Republic or Germany and they see a

224
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:14,098
grow a grow opportunity or whatever type

225
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:15,779
of uh you know uh career opportunity in

226
00:08:14,098 --> 00:08:17,879
Portugal it's super easy for them to

227
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:19,739
just go down there and start working so

228
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:22,439
for the European continent that's going

229
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:25,019
to be easier but what it does allow the

230
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:28,139
the advantage for the UK might be that

231
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:29,758
everyone in the UK then uh kind of their

232
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:31,199
jobs are somewhat protected because it's

233
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,839
more difficult for someone from the

234
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,120
European continent to come over uh and

235
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,440
and take those jobs so and you know that

236
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,839
was part of the brexit argument I think

237
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:43,080
all along so in some sense that might

238
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,520
actually help the UK Market develop on

239
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,740
its own and be a little bit more

240
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:48,838
self-sufficient and stronger

241
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,299
um and the UK is you know it does have a

242
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:53,339
medical Market already and they're

243
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:55,079
working on their different uh are having

244
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:58,019
their discussions about what

245
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,620
legalization could potentially look like

246
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:01,080
um

247
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:02,700
but it's really difficult to say once

248
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,220
again it all depends on those politics

249
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,620
and what really happens with with those

250
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,620
legalization discussions if the UK works

251
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:13,620
with somehow all sudden due legalization

252
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:15,360
then the market would explode there

253
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,459
um and you would probably see a lot of

254
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,480
people trying to move over there to be a

255
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:20,759
part of that

256
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,500
yeah I don't think with the politicians

257
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:24,419
currently in the UK that there's any

258
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:27,179
sign of legalization coming in the next

259
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:28,860
World I agree when it comes when it

260
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:30,719
comes to the certain territories around

261
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,039
Europe one of the things we see in

262
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,778
Ireland that Ireland is very well

263
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:36,120
positioned for is being the entry point

264
00:09:33,778 --> 00:09:38,879
into Europe and offering services such

265
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,560
as law and finance and Taxation you've

266
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,059
obviously then got the likes of Portugal

267
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:43,919
and Spain you've got the climate for

268
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:46,500
cultivation and then you've obviously

269
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:49,139
got places to like North Macedonia and

270
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:51,059
Romania doing extraction and other areas

271
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:52,919
do you see the Europe is going to be

272
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:55,199
broken up into those little segments

273
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:57,179
where this territory excels at this and

274
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,420
this territory excels at that and it all

275
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:02,579
then gets moved around Europe or do you

276
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:03,778
see each individual territory having

277
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,839
their own extraction their own

278
00:10:03,778 --> 00:10:09,480
cultivation their own finance and what

279
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:10,740
is your outlook on the European uh

280
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,120
industry when it comes to those

281
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,459
segmentations

282
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:17,220
yeah I think in the short run you're

283
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:18,838
going to see individual countries kind

284
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,940
of like you have the US with individual

285
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:22,080
states having to do it have their own

286
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,580
Industries I think you're going to see

287
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,399
that in the short term in Europe too

288
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:28,500
because right now

289
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,740
um for medical purposes you can do

290
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:33,299
Import and Export but when for a

291
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,820
recreational purposes you're not going

292
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:37,559
to be able to do any type of import

293
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:41,640
export it looks like based on the

294
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:44,518
current uh EU regulations and and the

295
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:47,338
way the EU is is kind of sticking to

296
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:50,820
those regulations I think in the long

297
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:52,380
term medium to long term five to ten

298
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:55,160
years you're going to see those

299
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:57,600
regulations be changed or

300
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:59,578
reinterpreted or something to where

301
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,920
you're going to see regular import

302
00:10:59,578 --> 00:11:04,379
export between the countries even for

303
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:05,699
recreational purposes

304
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:08,278
um but until we get to that point

305
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:11,040
probably you're going to see a lot of uh

306
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:13,500
industry homegrown type Industries for

307
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:15,419
at least for the recreational side of it

308
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,159
and when it comes to the Homegrown side

309
00:11:15,419 --> 00:11:18,958
of things we look in Europe it seems to

310
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:21,419
be breaking into a pretty clear and

311
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:22,799
concise industry that pharmaceutical and

312
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:24,539
biotech are going to be taking care of

313
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:27,120
drug development and potential

314
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:28,740
ingredients for cosmetics and beauty and

315
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,839
various other things and then you're

316
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:33,539
going to have a homegirl Rule and the

317
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:36,839
Cannabis Social Club model do you see

318
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:39,120
the the the cultivation expertise in

319
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:40,860
Europe being able to grow from one of

320
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,139
the benefits of the homegirl Rule and

321
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:45,300
the the social club model or do you

322
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:47,458
think that the likes of low-cost flower

323
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:50,219
from Colombia and other destinations are

324
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:53,159
still going to be imported into you

325
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:55,259
yeah I mean I think that's really hard

326
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:57,539
to say you already have Imports

327
00:11:55,259 --> 00:12:00,838
happening from all over the world into

328
00:11:57,539 --> 00:12:03,599
the EU uh fully legally you know through

329
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:06,060
some a few different uh Distributors

330
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,459
importers uh who kind of found some

331
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:11,039
interesting uh

332
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:13,919
ways to interpret the the import rules

333
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:16,078
uh and that's that's a benefit but I

334
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:18,539
think in the long term

335
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:22,500
um you're going to see people watching

336
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:24,120
uh certain quality and also people many

337
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,860
times prefer something that's more

338
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,240
locally grown

339
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,800
um you know whether it be for

340
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:33,899
environmental reasons or uh

341
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:35,458
nationalistic or Pride reasons you know

342
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:38,100
they want something that was grown here

343
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:39,239
at home so you always have some imports

344
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,579
but I think there's always going to be

345
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,778
room for good quality products grown

346
00:12:41,578 --> 00:12:44,879
right here in Europe

347
00:12:42,778 --> 00:12:46,919
yeah I think kind of it Canada seems to

348
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:49,799
be a good model that not everybody wants

349
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:52,259
the low-cost huge MSO production of

350
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:54,299
cannabis they the the small cultivars

351
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:56,578
and the craft Growers seem to be taking

352
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:57,838
a large market share there and I would

353
00:12:56,578 --> 00:12:59,099
imagine that if you live in France or

354
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,480
you live in Ireland or you live in

355
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,980
Germany or Czech Republic that they're

356
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,200
going to be a little bit of national

357
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:06,839
pride towards choosing the product that

358
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:09,600
gets made in your own individual country

359
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:11,220
exactly and you saw that you know uh you

360
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,899
saw that with craft beer craft

361
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,720
distilleries and all these other type

362
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:18,360
these other Industries where you you

363
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,860
always have the big players who have a

364
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,720
huge part of the market share but

365
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:25,019
there's room for those smaller Growers

366
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:27,180
or smaller suppliers for those products

367
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:29,459
where uh you know like you said it's

368
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:31,500
quality it's interesting cultivars it's

369
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:33,479
it's

370
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,919
playing on the national pride different

371
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,659
things like that there will always be

372
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:38,219
room for that

373
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:39,480
um and I think you'll see that also with

374
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,100
cannabis here like you said you're

375
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,379
seeing it in Canada and the US now

376
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,820
already and I think

377
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:46,320
um you know it took a long time for the

378
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,120
craft beer and craft Distillery

379
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,920
Industries to develop from the bigger

380
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,778
Industries but I think with cannabis

381
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:54,599
you're seeing that kind of accelerated

382
00:13:51,778 --> 00:13:56,399
much more quickly just because of the

383
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,019
um you know the pre the other industries

384
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,200
that have already kind of spawned those

385
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:02,700
types of craft movements yeah now I know

386
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,860
you're a very busy man so one last

387
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,240
question before we go what are you

388
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:08,700
looking forward to seeing the most

389
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,680
happen in Europe over the next 18 to 24

390
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,778
months is there one thing that you think

391
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:14,338
will be a domino effect or is there one

392
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:16,200
personal thing that you would love to

393
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:19,380
see happen

394
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:23,278
either if we could see uh the

395
00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:25,019
legalization in Germany uh continue

396
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:26,399
forward

397
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:29,159
um and I think that's going to be

398
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,860
through the uh you know the individual

399
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:34,458
cities doing research projects if that

400
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:36,600
could get kind of ironed out uh

401
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:39,419
including which I think is going to be

402
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,159
extremely important having the import uh

403
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:43,439
allowed somehow for these research

404
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:45,659
projects which should be allowed under

405
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,959
the current rules that I think you will

406
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:52,019
see a huge development of of those

407
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:54,119
individual City Markets and that will of

408
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:57,179
course then I think really start to

409
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:59,759
change the public perception

410
00:14:57,179 --> 00:15:02,399
um of of cannabis even for recreational

411
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,860
purposes and we'll show people just like

412
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,159
it did in the US and Canada that it is

413
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:10,259
not evil uh the recreational uh or

414
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:12,778
legalization for adult use is not going

415
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:14,639
to bring all these horrible uh

416
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:16,740
consequences and actually brings a lot

417
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,320
of positive consequences so hopefully

418
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:21,959
that can get kind of uh reported

419
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,480
somewhat in the next 18 to 24 months and

420
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:27,239
and start to see some data come out of

421
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,639
that to start changing uh public opinion

422
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,079
further and political opinion in the

423
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:32,879
right direction

424
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:33,958
Andy it's been actually great to happen

425
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:35,578
to you hopefully we can touch base

426
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:38,219
towards the end of the year and we've

427
00:15:35,578 --> 00:15:40,379
got a some sort of advancement in the EU

428
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:42,300
for any company or employee who's

429
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:44,159
looking to get into the industry I

430
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:46,979
highly recommend going to EU cannabis

431
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:48,838
jobs find them on our social media on

432
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,039
LinkedIn and on Twitter and give them a

433
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:52,320
follow because they're going to be at

434
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:54,059
the Forefront of employment in this

435
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,160
multi-billion dollar industry over the

436
00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:57,539
