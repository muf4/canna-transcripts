you ended up coming to found agam and

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,799
what your uh position in the industry is

17
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:41,558
please sure so so um I've been in the

18
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:43,919
medical cannabis I mean I've been in the

19
00:00:41,558 --> 00:00:46,119
medical advertising industry for about

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,640
25 30 years always on the pharmaceutical

21
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:49,558
side of the house I've worked for the

22
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,719
British Medical Association the American

23
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:54,000
College of Physicians um a lot of

24
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,600
for-profits not for profits meded

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,320
companies you know always with the the

26
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,640
uh the doctor as our as our Target um I

27
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,599
guess it was around 2018 I started to

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,079
notice that you know people that I knew

29
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:10,640
um were being helped by medical cannabis

30
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:13,280
either with with u sleep disorder

31
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,079
problems chronic pain problems around

32
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,759
the same time I stumbled upon video of

33
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:21,798
of children who are having their

34
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,319
seizures arrested by by cannabis oil and

35
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:24,920
I think that was the Catalyst that

36
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:26,798
really got me interested to at least

37
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,680
investigate a little bit more and see if

38
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,880
there was anything to uh you know

39
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,720
medical cannabis and you utility I had

40
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:34,798
already been involved with um

41
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:36,200
traditional Chinese medicine and ironic

42
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,280
medicine so this just seemed like a

43
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,520
natural Next Step um once I was

44
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,920
convinced that medical cannabis was in

45
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:46,640
fact medicine I felt uh a need almost to

46
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,599
legitimize it and I thought the best way

47
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,960
to do that was uh with a traditional

48
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:54,478
peer-reviewed medical

49
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:56,599
journal yeah and had a fantastic job

50
00:01:54,478 --> 00:02:00,118
you've done so far you guys have become

51
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:02,199
a a real top leading source of

52
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:04,159
information on the ECS for the medical

53
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,399
professionals in this industry was that

54
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,520
the main targeted outset and if so how

55
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:11,439
do you come to the process of validating

56
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,680
what papers get published and what don't

57
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,400
because an apple and an orange are two

58
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,879
different things as we know there's know

59
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,680
thousands of Publications that have

60
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:22,759
happened how do you guys choose the best

61
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:24,159
ones to publish sure so so um we have

62
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:26,000
somebody that's been with the the

63
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:28,719
publication from the very beginning her

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,919
name is Megan rolloff and all content

65
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:34,080
all studies um all research flows

66
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:36,839
through her and she puts it through a a

67
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,840
rigorous peer review um process with the

68
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,479
folks on our editorial board just to

69
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,439
make sure that you know everything is

70
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:45,598
factually accurate and scientifically

71
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:47,079
accurate and you know different times

72
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:49,719
we'll have a conversation with our

73
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,879
editor and chief Dr Leslie atbar Megan

74
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:54,479
Roloff and myself and we'll you know

75
00:02:51,878 --> 00:02:56,439
we'll have pretty detailed conversations

76
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:59,759
about which studies should be included

77
00:02:56,439 --> 00:03:01,759
and um you know even a lot of the anot

78
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:03,479
total studies and case studies we're

79
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:06,318
including now as

80
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:08,679
well very interesting you recently had a

81
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:09,839
great deal with hey Market Media Group

82
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,000
do you

83
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,479
see the merger and Acquisitions of

84
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,318
cannabis media outlets and information

85
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:19,079
outlets in the industry being a more

86
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:20,839
valuable asset for people to Target in

87
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,159
the coming future obviously you guys are

88
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,560
kind of at the top of the food chain

89
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:25,798
with the most formost medical

90
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,920
information but do you see that

91
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:31,640
trickling down across the sector I hope

92
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:33,119
so you know I do hope so because I think

93
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:35,479
I think that the science and the

94
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,759
research should be everybody's Northstar

95
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:38,798
at least on the medical side of the

96
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:41,878
house right I think that's what's going

97
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:44,560
to you know inform doctor's decisions

98
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:47,798
and lead us to better patient outcomes I

99
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,199
also think the doctor is in a difficult

100
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:51,080
position right now you know they're

101
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:53,238
being asked about medical cannabis and

102
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,760
CBD and all these other things by their

103
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:57,079
patients well at the same time um

104
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:59,318
they're at a disadvantage because they

105
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:01,040
were never trained on the ECS and that's

106
00:03:59,318 --> 00:04:03,560
kind of you know one of the things that

107
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:05,798
we're hoping to help out a little bit at

108
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,120
least to to show doctors like yes you

109
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:09,719
know inside each one of us just like we

110
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,438
have a cardiovascular system just we

111
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:14,560
have a nervous system we have an endoc

112
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:17,079
canabo system and you know let's start

113
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,519
there right let's establish that that

114
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:21,040
Foundation there and then from there we

115
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,280
can go

116
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,639
anywhere when it comes to the future of

117
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:27,879
the drug Discovery and development side

118
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:29,800
of things the actual molecule that's

119
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:31,918
going to be the ingredient for these

120
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,600
will have to be registered as an API

121
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:38,478
either with Emer or with the FDA do you

122
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:40,840
see fermentation engineering being the

123
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:42,800
conduit to create these molecules as

124
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:45,038
pure and as replicable as safe as going

125
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,840
to be required for large scale drug

126
00:04:45,038 --> 00:04:50,000
Discovery and development I do I do and

127
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:52,758
I'm hearing a I'm hearing a lot about uh

128
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,918
you know different ways to to um

129
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:58,038
synthesize and and present these

130
00:04:54,918 --> 00:05:00,319
molecules for um FDA approval I'm also

131
00:04:58,038 --> 00:05:04,000
reading a lot about something I I wasn't

132
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:06,879
too um schooled up on but the Botanical

133
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,240
um drug pathway that the FDA already has

134
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:11,319
in place um is something that again I

135
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,000
don't know a lot about but the more I

136
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:14,839
read about it the more that looks like

137
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,478
it could be a viable option as

138
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:19,879
well and not just for cannabis for any

139
00:05:17,478 --> 00:05:21,560
plant-based medicine when you're

140
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:25,199
publishing these papers do you see a

141
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:27,478
heavy lean towards neuropathic pain

142
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,960
inflammation um are they kind of the two

143
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:30,879
main ailments that everybody's going

144
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,159
after because we have seen some

145
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,120
companies that have developed

146
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,840
gastrointestinal information products

147
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,079
and cardiovascular inflammation products

148
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:40,839
is the ability to Target these

149
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:43,639
inflammation receptors do you think

150
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:46,198
where the main capital expenditure is

151
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:48,280
going to go in the coming years I think

152
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,038
so I I think there there are companies

153
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:52,559
out there that are already targeting

154
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:55,120
specific conditions and disease states

155
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,879
with um one molecule synthesized

156
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:02,639
compounds and listen that's one path to

157
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:05,159
go and if a patient meets with success

158
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,680
with that why would we why would we have

159
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,599
a problem with that right um I know

160
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,120
there's a there's a faction of of folks

161
00:06:09,598 --> 00:06:14,719
out there that are 100% against the the

162
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,519
synthesized cannabinoids listen at the

163
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,000
end of the day if it helps people if it

164
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:21,918
helps patients I'm 100% for it and and I

165
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,478
think the journal is as

166
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:26,918
well yeah and it seems to be whatever is

167
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:29,478
the safest and most regulated and

168
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:31,279
effectively replicable solution is what

169
00:06:29,478 --> 00:06:33,598
politicians who have no vested interest

170
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:35,638
or policy makers who have no V vested

171
00:06:33,598 --> 00:06:37,719
interest want to see whether it's in

172
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:40,439
medical cannabis or across a multitude

173
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,560
of the pharmaceutical sector which makes

174
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:44,959
sense you know of course you want the

175
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,720
the the safest possible Delivery Systems

176
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:49,159
of course you have to be cognizant about

177
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,120
drug drug interactions and you know

178
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,479
there cannabis a lot of people think

179
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,280
it's it's because it's natural because

180
00:06:53,478 --> 00:06:58,038
it's a plant it's completely safe and

181
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:59,878
for the most part it's very very safe

182
00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:01,680
but there are things you do have to keep

183
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:04,599
your eye out for you know and Drug drag

184
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:08,439
interactions is is definitely one of

185
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:10,959
them do you see the potential IP and

186
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:13,038
patent ability for people to create

187
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:15,519
their own Entourage effect from blending

188
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:16,719
turbines with cannaboids and flavonoids

189
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:18,918
to be able to make these new

190
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:23,360
formulations that can deliver for

191
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:25,959
patients across H ailm ABC is that kind

192
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,280
of again one of the the main targets

193
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:29,399
that a lot of these companies should be

194
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:31,000
going after because surely if the

195
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:33,000
Entourage effect is what everybody goes

196
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,839
on about and a biotech company can

197
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,800
actually make their own perfect

198
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:39,638
formulation of these uh molecules it

199
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,439
seems like a very advantageous route to

200
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:44,199
take that is one route that I'm hearing

201
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:45,680
that pharmaceutical companies and non-

202
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:47,439
pharmaceutical companies you know health

203
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,120
and wellness companies are are actually

204
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:51,038
taking you know we're what they're

205
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,519
looking at is with all these different

206
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:55,719
canabo that are in the plant can we

207
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:57,478
extract them synthesize them and then

208
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,840
bring them kind of back together along

209
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:01,839
with the Turpin and the flavonoids and

210
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:03,839
and kind of recreate

211
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:06,038
synthetically um you know what what God

212
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:07,560
created in in the plan and then of

213
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:09,478
course the people that push back on that

214
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,199
are saying why not just use the plant

215
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:14,839
it's already there it's functioning it's

216
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:16,598
and again it doesn't the reason why we

217
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:20,198
we can't or might not be able to is it

218
00:08:16,598 --> 00:08:22,038
doesn't fit nicely into the FDA approval

219
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:24,120
process but again that's where I I've

220
00:08:22,038 --> 00:08:26,839
been learning more about that you know

221
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:30,360
the plant um the plant-based approval

222
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:31,878
process and uh that might be an option

223
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,320
you guys have published some recent

224
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:36,360
research on psychedelic research that

225
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,320
seems to be another uh pretty

226
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,560
advantageous roote from mental health

227
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:44,240
and depression and ptsd's potential uh

228
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:46,278
Solutions is psilocybin going to be the

229
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,320
key molecule within that industry like

230
00:08:46,278 --> 00:08:50,879
we've seen CBD and THC in the Cannabis

231
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,040
industry it looks like that's going to

232
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:55,838
be the case right CBD looked like it was

233
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:57,719
the Gateway molecule you know into the

234
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,399
into the cannabis plant it was it was

235
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,120
the molecule that everybody kind of

236
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:03,879
learned about at the same time got very

237
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,839
popular at the same time and and we can

238
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:07,360
thank CBD because it made people curious

239
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,760
about what the other cannaboids are in

240
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,039
the plant and what they can do um I I

241
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:13,759
probably should have said this at the

242
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:16,919
beginning but we are not uh specifically

243
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:18,838
a cannabis Journal we study the the ECS

244
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:22,278
the endoc canabo system as a therapeutic

245
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:24,760
Target so psychedelic medicine anything

246
00:09:22,278 --> 00:09:26,879
that engages with the ECS we is is what

247
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:28,799
we want to report on and you know it

248
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:31,559
seems like every every month that goes

249
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:33,679
by finding something else that we didn't

250
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:35,278
know engage with the indoc cannabinoid

251
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:37,919
system that in fact

252
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:39,480
does if you look at the pathway to get

253
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:41,199
to cocy and there's a number of

254
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,519
intermediates along the way to get there

255
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,399
and it seems to be a much longer process

256
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:49,200
a more Capital intensive process to to

257
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,600
to do this do you really see that the

258
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,600
only way a a full Global Market for

259
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,079
these drugs are going to become

260
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,560
available again if somebody could

261
00:09:54,078 --> 00:09:58,479
produce these in 20,000 ler batches

262
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:00,719
every week because realistically

263
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,120
cultivating psilocybin for mushrooms for

264
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:07,079
a a global population is not much of a

265
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:09,519
realistic option no I I I think again I

266
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:11,799
think you're right I think that's the

267
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,879
direction that this is going into if we

268
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:16,439
are going to make this uh medicine

269
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:19,078
available to as many people as

270
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,920
possible I would think that it would

271
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:23,120
have to be synthesized in order for it

272
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:25,879
to be distributed to that many

273
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:29,200
people and it seems as well the the kind

274
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:30,958
of big big topics at the moment in are

275
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,600
big future potential gains that can

276
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:37,119
happen in pharmaceutical it's going to

277
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:39,959
be therapies cell therapies uh microbal

278
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,159
antibodies you see the psilocybin and

279
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:43,838
mental health side of the issue being a

280
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:45,480
dominant player in the next five to 10

281
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,079
years because as much as there's been

282
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,480
lwh hanging fruit for biotech and

283
00:10:47,078 --> 00:10:50,599
pharmaceutical companies over the last

284
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,399
couple of decades it's all about what's

285
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,959
new and what's potentially upcoming

286
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,159
that's coming around the corner do you

287
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:57,879
think the big large pharmaceutical drug

288
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:59,600
manufacturers are looking at it like

289
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:01,360
this and are waiting for biotech

290
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,000
companies to do the heavy lifting and

291
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:07,159
then come in and acquire as uh as may be

292
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,600
yeah typical typical forer right we're

293
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:10,399
they're going to wait I think for the

294
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,800
smaller companies to develop these drugs

295
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,519
and then you know the big boys will come

296
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:16,359
in and just buy up the the smaller fish

297
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:18,720
um which is fine you know that that it's

298
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,519
a system that has worked for years and I

299
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,879
think to your point it will probably

300
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:26,600
continue to go down that road

301
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:29,159
yeah what other exciting topics and and

302
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,959
areas are you starting to see and are

303
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:32,759
you expecting to see over the coming 12

304
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,719
to 24 months do you reckon the

305
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:35,958
scheduling from 1 to three will have a

306
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,519
big impact on the research and

307
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:40,559
development side of the industry I do I

308
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:42,600
I do and it's it's one of the um the

309
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:44,799
biggest things that I hope comes out of

310
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,879
uh the rescheduling the schedule 3 is

311
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:49,439
you know hopefully this Avalanche of

312
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:51,759
research um and and hopefully that

313
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,880
Avalanche happens here in America you

314
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:56,120
know once once we uh we have access to

315
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:58,439
the plant to study I'm thinking that you

316
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,879
know every you know every University in

317
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,200
the country should be studying it and

318
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:04,078
you know what we're seeing now is

319
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,360
there's great work coming from you know

320
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:08,239
great research coming from Israel coming

321
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,639
from Canada coming from all over the

322
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,440
world and you know America just has to

323
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,480
jump in there and you know with both

324
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,800
feet and and do what it does best right

325
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,039
be a leader in in science and

326
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:20,559
research yeah little old Ireland here

327
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:22,078
with all the home of all the

328
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:23,838
pharmaceutical companies I don't think

329
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:26,078
it'll be too far behind everybody

330
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,279
there's a yeah some very interesting

331
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,519
things I'm sure will happen here over

332
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:32,679
the coming years as well 100%

333
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:34,839
yeah what are your thoughts in the

334
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:37,159
industry over the next 12 to 24 months

335
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:39,600
do you see the stocks jumping do you see

336
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:44,480
this Des scheduling happen is save back

337
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:46,278
coming to H to to reality I I think so

338
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,639
right I think this is you know I don't

339
00:12:46,278 --> 00:12:49,519
want to say it's the moment everybody

340
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:52,919
has been waiting for because as you are

341
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:55,399
probably well aware um there's a big

342
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:57,399
push against schedule three you know not

343
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:59,720
not just here in America but throughout

344
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:01,120
the world and and I I think um some of

345
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,199
those fears are real you know good

346
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,320
people and Quality Companies I think are

347
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:09,078
going to be negatively impacted by by

348
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,920
schedule three but I think you know far

349
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:13,000
more people and far more companies are

350
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:14,278
going to benefit by schedule three I

351
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,679
mean if we just took what we were

352
00:13:14,278 --> 00:13:18,639
talking about you know the research you

353
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:20,319
know that's going to be released because

354
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,959
of schedule three and then you add on

355
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,399
things like self B safe banking you know

356
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:26,239
and some of the other things that are

357
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:30,159
going to come along with schedule

358
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:32,079
3 I think it's a really good

359
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:33,719
strong step in the right direction and I

360
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:37,198
think it's going to free up a lot of a

361
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,399
lot of capital A lot of energy and um

362
00:13:37,198 --> 00:13:41,000
you know what we're going to see come

363
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,078
from it is research and then products

364
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
from that research and I'm excited about

365
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:48,198
all of that you know and we hope to be

366
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,958
there in um in an educational arm and

367
00:13:48,198 --> 00:13:52,879
also in a marketing

368
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:54,518
arm it seems to be as well if to the

369
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:56,000
scheduling happens that as much as some

370
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:57,399
of the companies are going to end up

371
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,799
getting butchered in the industry the

372
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:02,000
big winner is going to be the patient

373
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:04,120
years down the road that patients will

374
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,879
have access to more refined drugs that

375
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,919
deliver a non-addictive and maybe a

376
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:11,679
better solution than current market

377
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:13,439
methods 100% yeah and that's that's

378
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:15,159
where I get excited you know for me the

379
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,959
patient was always at the center of of

380
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:18,559
of of all of this right you know we

381
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:21,000
don't really get involved with the rec

382
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:22,479
side of the house our our gym is is 100%

383
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,240
medical and the patient is at the center

384
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,199
of that so yeah I look forward to a day

385
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,278
uh when patients are going to be able to

386
00:14:28,198 --> 00:14:31,799
access

387
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:33,240
medication that has less side effects so

388
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:35,679
they're not taking a pill and then three

389
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:38,000
pills for the for the side effects as we

390
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:39,679
know you know cannabis is is very

391
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,399
effective in certain conditions and

392
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:44,919
extremely safe at the same time so you

393
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,559
know that to me is the big payoff of of

394
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:49,599
medical cannabis and and plant-based

395
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:51,479
medicine in general couldn't agree more
