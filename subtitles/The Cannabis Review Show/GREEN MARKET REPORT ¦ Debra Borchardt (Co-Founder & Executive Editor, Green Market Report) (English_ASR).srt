the Cannabis industry is the green

00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:32,839
market report so I'm delighted to get

14
00:00:30,278 --> 00:00:34,200
the CH uh chance to talk to you can we

15
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,559
maybe start with giving everybody a

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,440
little overview of your position in the

17
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:40,519
industry and how you came to be there

18
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:43,119
sure so my background is actually Wall

19
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,399
Street um I worked on Wall Street for

20
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:48,119
over 15 years and had several Securities

21
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:50,719
licenses um but I I got really burned

22
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:52,038
out on the business and um one of the

23
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,399
things that I did enjoy when I was

24
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:55,960
working on Wall Street was talking about

25
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,000
companies and so I went to New York

26
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,120
University and got my master's degree in

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,518
business and economic reporting and from

28
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:03,238
there I went to work at the street with

29
00:01:01,518 --> 00:01:05,399
Jim Kramer and while I was there was

30
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:09,319
really when um we started to see

31
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,560
cannabis stocks uh come to fruition uh

32
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,879
but it was really sketchy back then it

33
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,680
was a lot of companies that would just

34
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:16,438
put the word marijuana in the title of

35
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,759
the company and change the ticker make

36
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:21,000
it look like it was this cannabis

37
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:24,239
company when it when it really wasn't um

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,239
so it was great news picking lots of

39
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:29,560
drama lots of shady characters uh lots

40
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:32,359
of stock fraud uh so I started covering

41
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,840
cannabis back then and then I went out

42
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:37,599
on my own was freelancing but I just

43
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,399
wasn't the places I was working for I

44
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:41,399
wasn't really seeing the kind of

45
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:42,759
coverage that I wanted to do so I felt

46
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:46,320
like there was this opening in the

47
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:48,519
market to have a website that really

48
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,718
targeted financial news for the Cannabis

49
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:53,640
industry and really treated it like any

50
00:01:50,718 --> 00:01:55,718
other industry um most of the stuff we

51
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,478
saw at that time was really cultural and

52
00:01:55,718 --> 00:02:00,679
lifestyle types of Publications for

53
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:02,359
cannabis not so much business news

54
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,079
that was really focused on the financial

55
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:05,718
world and that's why I started Green

56
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:08,679
Market report and we've been online for

57
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:10,038
seven years uh this summer so that's

58
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:12,439
very exciting I can't believe we're

59
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:14,399
still um online for seven years just

60
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:16,759
because it's tough in media it's really

61
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,080
hard place to be and I always like to

62
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:21,479
joke with people like I don't know

63
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,719
what's harder cannabis or media and then

64
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:26,479
uh crane Communications acquired Us in

65
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:28,318

66
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,238

00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:32,000
they've been great partners and and

68
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,680
really invested in us and really wants

69
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,039
us to succeed in the long

70
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,439
term yeah you guys are definitely one of

71
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:41,878
the most uh H highly revered sources of

72
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:43,959
information in the market especially

73
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:46,280
when as you said there's amount of uh

74
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:47,560
misinformation and fibs that get told in

75
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,519
this industry over the last couple of

76
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,400
years having that North Star like green

77
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,120
marker report has always been

78
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,280
advantageous for real entrepreneurs and

79
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,000
business people the actual story behind

80
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,719
the green market report who was it that

81
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,639
co-founded you with it um were there the

82
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:03,759
the the first couple of years at at T

83
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:06,598
slug what's the exact trajectory for the

84
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:08,759
green marker report thank you uh so my

85
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:12,439
partners were Cynthia Sal rizada and

86
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:15,000
Vince petti and um they they left the

87
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:18,639
company when we were acquired by Crane

88
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,120
and so right now um our Focus has been

89
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:23,919
on events and digital advertising we've

90
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,080
got uh some plans to do some different

91
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:28,359
types of things uh hopefully by the end

92
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,159
of this year uh we really feel like

93
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,840
there's an opportunity to present more

94
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:34,719
information on these cannabis companies

95
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,000
um whereas right now it's it's kind of

96
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,598
broken up when you're looking for

97
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,719
information financial information on

98
00:03:38,598 --> 00:03:43,679
these companies it's really hard to find

99
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:46,039
um there's different websites that focus

100
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,840
on different pieces uh maybe

101
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:51,000
Acquisitions and Deals and another one

102
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,878
might focus on you know something more

103
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,360
like uh you know the the legal news so

104
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:58,120
we're going to hopefully try to create

105
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,400
some kind of research center where we

106
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,120
can pull all these things together

107
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,200
uh just because we feel like it's it's

108
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,879
really fragmented and um thank you for

109
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:09,560
the the the comment on the journalism

110
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:11,959
because that's that's really been our uh

111
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,878
Northstar our our our main mission is to

112
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:16,918
deliver good journalism and you know

113
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:18,798
it's it's it's hard to do that and and

114
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:20,439
you're right there's a lot of cannabis

115
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,799
companies that would prefer to just have

116
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:25,399
us take the press releases and run with

117
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,400
it uh but we do a little bit of a deeper

118
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:30,679
dive um into the earnings we we always

119
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:31,959
go into the filings and and see what's

120
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,600
really there because the earnings

121
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:37,839
announcements themselves tend to be a

122
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:40,000
lot of very positive spin um which is

123
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:41,719
understandable but to your point I think

124
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,680
the investors and people within the

125
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,360
industry want to hear the truth and and

126
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,319
whether it's good or

127
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,000
bad yeah and I think one of the

128
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:52,199
cornerstones of your guys operation is

129
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,399
the open- source insights and Analysis

130
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:57,038
and how important that is from as I said

131
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:58,519
an investor and an entrepreneurs point

132
00:04:57,038 --> 00:05:00,439
of view to be able to actually have real

133
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:02,478
and correct information because we've

134
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:04,560
seen whether it's productss being lab

135
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:07,360
tested and the THC content being

136
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,079
inflated or whether it's a financial

137
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,120
returns and people basically just trying

138
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:12,918
to pump and up the stock even to a

139
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,160
degree reports being generated by

140
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:17,399
so-called consultancy companies that are

141
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,520
given these valuations of $50 billion do

142
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:21,799
a year for this market and 20 for this

143
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,680
Market having you guys provide this open

144
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,800
source insights and Analysis is so

145
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,000
important was that the core objective

146
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,720
from the outset is to ensure okay we're

147
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,079
going to provide the most up toate

148
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:35,360
correct information for everybody

149
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:37,079
absolutely um you know you do take a

150
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,800
little bit of criticism for doing this

151
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:42,120
type of work um because you know and

152
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,600
when I first started doing this I was

153
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,038
considered negative and I wasn't an

154
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,240
advocate for the industry and I don't

155
00:05:46,038 --> 00:05:51,680
consider myself an advocate nor do we do

156
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,918
advocacy reporting we just do reporting

157
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,240
so um and I love the Cannabis industry I

158
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:57,918
think some of the best people I've met

159
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,319
have been in the industry it's been one

160
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:03,519
of my favorite beats to cover

161
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:06,039
um but having said that you're still

162
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,758
dealing with an industry that ultimately

163
00:06:06,038 --> 00:06:09,759
is federally illegal in the United

164
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,319
States so you do have a lot of shady

165
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,840
characters still roaming around the

166
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:16,400
Cannabis industry and to me that's

167
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:18,918
important um one of the things that that

168
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:21,159
struck me early on in my reporting was

169
00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:24,560
how many small investors retail

170
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:26,759
investors that lost um maybe all their

171
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,199
savings investing in cannabis companies

172
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:30,919
because they read something that they

173
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:33,038
thought was true when it really wasn't

174
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:35,680
and I really felt for these people and

175
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:38,759
and so the thing is is that that

176
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,598
investor that invests $500 ,000 maybe

177
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:43,080
even

178
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:46,439
$10,000 they're just not given the same

179
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:47,879
attention by mainstream media because

180
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:50,120
they're not they're not big investors

181
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:52,639
these are penny stocks and so no one

182
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,000
really covers them and to me that was

183
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,720
something that kind of became my mission

184
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
was I want to make sure that if

185
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,280
companies are ripping people off that we

186
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,560
expose that so that they can't continue

187
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:07,638
to do this to other people and that's

188
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,560
been a real focus of mine and something

189
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:13,240
that you know we get emails all the time

190
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,959
from readers saying I'm so glad you

191
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,879
published that story I was about to work

192
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:18,598
with so and so and now I see they're not

193
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:22,160
paying their bills or and now I see that

194
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:24,878
they con people out of money um you know

195
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,080
thank you for letting me know that um so

196
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:30,160
that that's been something that makes us

197
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:33,000
feel good about what we're doing

198
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,439
yeah for sure the investors especially a

199
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,680
lot of them if you're a consumer of

200
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:39,680
cannabis you're in the culture of

201
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,680
cannabis it's a very distinct Market

202
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,199
that if you're in the culture of

203
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,360
cannabis you want to be part of the

204
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:45,919
success so you do see these smaller

205
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,240
retail investors putting a couple of

206
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:48,598
hundred Euro a couple of thousand Euro

207
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,759
that might be a huge chunk of their

208
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:54,000
savings and ensuring that those people

209
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:55,639
are protected is H is definitely a bonus

210
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,319
for everybody in the industry I think

211
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:00,158
because nobody wants to burn the small

212
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:02,080
retail retail investors I don't think

213
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:04,399
right right and and to be fair there are

214
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:07,198
some companies that are performing very

215
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:09,560
well um and and we do highlight those

216
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,639
too so we we try to do that we also

217
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,439
really focus heavily on female owned

218
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:15,199
companies you know because that's

219
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:17,000
important to me so so we try to make

220
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,560
sure that the female Executives and

221
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,158
female owned companies also get their

222
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,280
Fair Shake in the

223
00:08:21,158 --> 00:08:25,158
media yeah well that's that having an

224
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,038
equal balance in any industry is very

225
00:08:25,158 --> 00:08:29,120
important neveress sell the Cannabis

226
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:30,878
industry because it shouldn't be just a

227
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,360
select few get the profit off this

228
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,879
industry when the culture is so wide and

229
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:39,479
diverse and touches every demographic

230
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:41,799
and every Nuance of the the human race

231
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:43,519
absolutely moving on to the next thing I

232
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,879
want to talk about which is big news for

233
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,560
everybody it seems to be that there's

234
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:49,000
these three big things in America it's

235
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:51,079
the rescheduling it's the safe Banking

236
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,639
Act and the third one was the Florida

237
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,519
recreational ballot we heard yesterday

238
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:57,838
that this was successful and that a vote

239
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,399
will happen in December if I'm not

240
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,680
mistaken actually November it'll be in

241
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,000
November when we have our big

242
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:05,399
presidential election so it'll be a so

243
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
do you want to tell us all about what's

244
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:08,480
happening in Florida why there's reason

245
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,559
to be positive and what the

246
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,039
ramifications could be for the the

247
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:15,000
Nationwide industry in America sure so

248
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:17,838
Florida right now is a medical only

249
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,720
state so medical cannabis is legal in

250
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:23,800
the state and there's some some big

251
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,120
players like true leave has over 130

252
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:29,679
stores and it's it's a pretty

253
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:31,399
wellestablished Medical Market but um

254
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:34,879
they have been wanting

255
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:37,000
to transition to an adult youth legal

256
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:38,519
Market as well so fully legal and

257
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,919
they've really kind of struggled with

258
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:43,600
getting there and this time they have

259
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:45,479
done it uh the Supreme Court in that

260
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,959
state said yes it can go on the ballot

261
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,440
for the voters to decide the caveat

262
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:52,919
though is that they have to get 60% of

263
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,360
the voters to approve this and that's a

264
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:57,759
pretty big number um it'll be

265
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,639
interesting to see what happens um this

266
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:03,278
Market is anticipated to be a $ 6

267
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:06,240
billion Market it's already at 1.8

268
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:09,039
billion uh for medical only so three

269
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,519
times that puts it at about six billion

270
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:13,360
and um so it's it's considered a fairly

271
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,240
large market now while people think

272
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,079
there are quite a few stores already uh

273
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,200
compared to

274
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:24,199
Michigan and Massachusetts it's actually

275
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,440
underst stored so we could see continued

276
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,560
expansion in that state and maybe even a

277
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:32,320
lot of uh mergers and Acquisitions so

278
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:34,078
it's there's a lot of focus on it um

279
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,639
there's also a lot of focus on it not

280
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:38,799
just from the business aspect but also

281
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:42,159
the cultural aspect this is a state

282
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:44,399
that's gone heavily into conservative

283
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:48,919
politics um they have gone heavily into

284
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:53,639
culture wars and so we're curious to see

285
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:54,719
what happens here so will these mostly

286
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:57,959
Republican

287
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,040
voters vote for cannabis or will it

288
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:02,958
drive more democratic voters to The

289
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:05,360
Ballot Box to vote for C it's a toss-up

290
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:08,119
no one really knows so it's it that's

291
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,440
there's a lot of focus on this to see

292
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,278
what really happens with this vote I

293
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,519
mean obviously in addition to the

294
00:11:12,278 --> 00:11:16,679
presidential

295
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,200
vote but uh yeah it's it's it's a it's a

296
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:20,278
big

297
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:23,278
deal yeah let's not mention the

298
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:25,559
presidential vote now we got do a whole

299
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:28,720
new discussion there's a lot of earnings

300
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:31,359
reports have been out and are still due

301
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,920
are we seen the upward trajectory of the

302
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,560
Cannabis industry now because we know a

303
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:37,599
lot of investors got in two three years

304
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:38,838
ago at the highs and those earning or

305
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,839
those Investments would be down

306
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:42,680
substantially they seem to be around

307
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,959
plateauing or getting close to what the

308
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:47,919
original values that people invested are

309
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:50,159
do you see what do you think think think

310
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:51,519
is going to be the biggest Catalyst for

311
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:53,919
cannabis stocks is it going to be

312
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,600
schedule three reschedule will it be

313
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:58,360
safe Banking Act is it going to be

314
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,000
positions that let's say North American

315
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,480
companies have taken Europe obviously

316
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,919
the likes of canopy have seen their

317
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,759
growth happen with Germany's news lately

318
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:08,759
what do you think is the Catalyst that

319
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:10,759
retail investors could look for I think

320
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:13,240
it will really focus on the the

321
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:14,958
descheduling so moving cannabis from a

322
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,278
schedule one drug which in the United

323
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:20,599
States right now um makes it as

324
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:22,399
dangerous as heroin um which is insane

325
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,639
and also makes it federally illegal if

326
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,919
it bumps down to three that takes all of

327
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:31,600
that away it opens the companies up to

328
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:34,759
uh better funding and it also takes away

329
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:37,399
the tax hit that they've had lately with

330
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:39,799
280e which means they can't take

331
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:41,360
business expenses as a deduction so it's

332
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:44,439
really hard for them to make a profit

333
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,480
with that um safer

334
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:49,000
banking uh is another piece of

335
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:52,120
legislation that would basically tell

336
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,120
the big Banks hey you can you can bank

337
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:57,440
with these companies um and and we won't

338
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,639
go after you for dealing in an illegal

339
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,000
substance um

340
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:04,480
that looked like it had a lot of promise

341
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,480
but we're hearing more out of Washington

342
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,519
that again Republicans are starting to

343
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,079
push back on that safer banking so

344
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:16,278
that's looking less secure than the D

345
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:19,039
scheduling um yeah I think that we are

346
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:21,720
starting to see valuations pick back up

347
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:24,159
we've been in a two-year bare market and

348
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:29,399
I think between the hope for schedule

349
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:32,639
three which which she seems much more uh

350
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:35,799
doable than the safer banking um the

351
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:38,079
hopes for that are are building so maybe

352
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:40,198
this summer we'll see something there um

353
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:42,000
we've also seen a lot of companies

354
00:13:40,198 --> 00:13:44,399
really get their houses in order so

355
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,559
you're seeing out of this earning cycle

356
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,759
more companies paying down debt more

357
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:51,599
companies cutting back on expenses

358
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:53,600
really getting their house in order

359
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,000
versus just hinging on this whole

360
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,560
schedule three thing uh which is

361
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,799
important to see so that they're really

362
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:04,078
fixing balance sheets and making sure

363
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:06,479
that they're taking the right steps to

364
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:08,198
clean up these balance sheets so that's

365
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,759
that's been a really nice thing to see

366
00:14:08,198 --> 00:14:12,319
to and I think that the investment

367
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:14,199
Community is starting to reward those

368
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,959
companies that are getting their house

369
00:14:14,198 --> 00:14:19,319
in order one quick Last Thing Before I

370
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:21,399
Let You Go does schedule three mean that

371
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,240
we're going to see a lot of Biotech and

372
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:25,320
Pharma money come into drug Discovery

373
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:27,600
and development and actually flesh out a

374
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:30,759
range of products because that surely is

375
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:33,120
the big opport Unity for large

376
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:34,519
corporations is these formulations and

377
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,278
the drug Discovery and being able to

378
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:37,839
create these products that are on

379
00:14:36,278 --> 00:14:40,000
through clinical trials and could be

380
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,639
prescribed by a doctor seems to be the

381
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,759
big huge opportunity in the industry for

382
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,799
people who aren't already established I

383
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:49,560
think for sure you'll see that I think

384
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:52,240
you'll also see a lot of interest from

385
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:54,559
beverage companies um and I think you'll

386
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,639
see a lot of interest from Big tobacco

387
00:14:54,559 --> 00:15:01,078
so big tobacco has been losing customers

388
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:03,278
for years um um this isn't a dissimilar

389
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:06,758
product it's a leaf product that gets

390
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:08,519
often rolled into paper and smoked um

391
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:10,240
their business has been going down

392
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:13,519
they've had to stay out of it because of

393
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,600
the legal situation then you look at the

394
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,320
alcoholic beverage side of the business

395
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,560
in the states where cannabis has been

396
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:23,160
legalized alcoholic beverage sales drop

397
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:25,838
so they certainly would be happy to have

398
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:27,519
those that clientele or those sales so I

399
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:30,680
think you're going to see a little bit

400
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:34,039
more on that side side I think that the

401
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:35,318
biotech side yes will be interested I

402
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:37,318
also think that they've kind of got

403
00:15:35,318 --> 00:15:39,838
their sight set more on the Psychedelic

404
00:15:37,318 --> 00:15:41,719
side of the world at this point um while

405
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,519
we're still continuing to see advances

406
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:48,079
in cannabis uh medicinal cannabis for

407
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:51,120
sure um in different areas um I think

408
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:54,039
that the the excitement there is not as

409
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,440
strong as it once was U which is

410
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:59,120
unfortunate um but yeah it will

411
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:01,399
definitely open up that side of the

412
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,480
business for more research and hopefully

413
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:06,720
more um medicinal uses for

414
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,879
cannabis it's been phenomenal talking to

415
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,519
