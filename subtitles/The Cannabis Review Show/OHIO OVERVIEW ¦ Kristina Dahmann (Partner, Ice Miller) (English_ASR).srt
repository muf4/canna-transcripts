very well it's a pleasure to be here and

00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,880
thanks for having me delighted to have

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,359
you on Ohio is a Hot Topic in the global

11
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:30,799
world of cannabis at the moment so I

12
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,280
thought what better to get the top law

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,920
form on to give us their perspective on

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,320
one or two different issues do you maybe

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,480
want to give everybody a quick overview

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,600
in 60 seconds of your position at your

17
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:42,839
firm and how you guys end up touching

18
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,600
against the Cannabis legislation

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,719
certainly thanks so much I'm a partner

20
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,359
in our how in our litigation group but I

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,120
have a crossover practice that works

22
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:52,399
very very closely with our regulatory

23
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:55,439
attorneys and our firm first got

24
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,039
involved with cannabis law RIT large uh

25
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,320
here in Columbus Ohio when Ohio

26
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,679
legalized medical cannabis we worked

27
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,558
with a number of of early operators to

28
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:04,838
apply for those licenses and secure

29
00:01:03,558 --> 00:01:07,200
those licenses either through the

30
00:01:04,838 --> 00:01:09,478
regulatory process or through eventual

31
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,560
litigation which is where I played a

32
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:13,879
prominent role with respect to it and

33
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:17,040
then it's been Off to the Races ever

34
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:18,640
since okay incredible so we're based

35
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,759
over here in Ireland and as I'm sure

36
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,920
you've seen over in your fa the social

37
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,759
media activity around Ohio and what

38
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,680
happened over there seems to be uh the

39
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,439
message is definitely not the same

40
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,640
across all platforms can you maybe give

41
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:33,118
everybody overie what happened in Ohio

42
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,719
what's the reason to celebrate and what

43
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:37,519
does it mean for the future absolutely

44
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:39,200
so as I'm sure everyone is aware this is

45
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:41,840
probably an easy fact to confirm that

46
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,920
Ohio has legalized medical cannabis

47
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,399
sales uh and it's only accessible to

48
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,840
patients that receive recommendations

49
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:50,799
from doctors for the use of medical

50
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,478
cannabis pursuant to uh a qualifying

51
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,200
condition that's been the case for

52
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:55,679
several years and it's become a mature

53
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,478
market and there's a series of

54
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,240
dispensaries that are coming online as

55
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:03,158
we speak over the next few months there

56
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,599
most recently the legislature combined

57
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:06,920
uh what was an over the several

58
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:08,758
oversight agencies to have the oversight

59
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,560
agency be under the Ohio Department of

60
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:14,199
Commerce so now all of Ohio is regulated

61
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:17,159
through one regulator which sets us up

62
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:19,399
well for our current stage so as

63
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:22,039
everyone that is listening here I'm sure

64
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,280
has heard Ohio has legalized adult youth

65
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:27,120
but what does that actually mean right

66
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,919
um and so as of last Tuesday after the

67
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,200
election on what was called issue two

68
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:36,119
Ohio uh passed what was an initiated

69
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:39,199
statute an initiated statute is a unique

70
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,319
feature here in Ohio that allows for

71
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:44,719
citizens to put together an entire

72
00:02:41,318 --> 00:02:47,560
chapter of what is the Ohio Revised Code

73
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:49,479
and so it is a literal chapter of the

74
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,280
Ohio virus code that sets out all the

75
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:54,799
legal parameters concerning adult use so

76
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,280
it's extremely detailed it includes the

77
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,040
licensing process it includes certain

78
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,719
prohibitions concerning the program it

79
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:04,519
includes certain protections concerning

80
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:06,878
the program as well as safe harbors for

81
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:09,400
financial institutions and employers to

82
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:11,120
make certain decisions so why I I I kind

83
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,840
of get into that detail right away is

84
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,158
because this was not a RIT large we've

85
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,640
legalized cannabis and anyone can sell

86
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:22,560
anyone can buy anyone can consume today

87
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:25,279
it is it is part of a regulated

88
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,280
structure and as it stands today it

89
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,719
actually isn't even effective under the

90
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,360
Ohio Constitution an initiated statute

91
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:34,400
comes effective in 30 days so as it

92
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,799
stands today it is still technically not

93
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,158
legal to possess and use cannabis in

94
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:42,080
Ohio the effective date of the statute

95
00:03:39,158 --> 00:03:45,039
is December 7 and so it's at that point

96
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:48,120
when uh consumption and use becomes

97
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:50,639
legalized um but you yet will be able to

98
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,640
purchase any Adult Ed cannabis so happy

99
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,798
to talk about that but uh wanted to just

100
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:56,958
give you that quick overview as to the

101
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,760
exact snapshot on where we are right

102
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,719
now very much appreciated always like

103
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:04,000
get into the facts of any issue and not

104
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:06,318
listen to Just people who have a vested

105
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,079
interest can you maybe tell me when it

106
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:10,839
comes to the 7th of December the is

107
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:12,519
there an application process that's

108
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,280
going to start from the 7th of December

109
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:17,040
for the cultivation Logistics and the

110
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,519
various different ancillary businesses

111
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,280
that are going to serve this sector to

112
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:24,040
apply for licenses that would cover them

113
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:27,478
under this absolutely so as it stands um

114
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,080
under the current structure uh the new

115
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:31,079
division of Campus control which is

116
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:33,599
created by this statute that is under

117
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:36,359
the Department of Commerce it will have

118
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,879
to create what are the regulations that

119
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,680
govern the statutory Provisions that are

120
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:43,519
in the initiated statute so first step

121
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,680
in fact before even a license process

122
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:47,839
can commence is the regulations have to

123
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,959
be published they have to go through the

124
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:53,279
Nos and comment period and then be

125
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:56,038
adopted before they can proceed with the

126
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:59,559
applications there are set parameters

127
00:04:56,038 --> 00:05:01,759
within the statute that requires um the

128
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:05,600
division of cannabis control to prepare

129
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:08,000
those in short order and to uh in short

130
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,000
order thereafter begin accepting

131
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,199
applications and then as it relates to

132
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,720
those applications because this is I

133
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:16,520
think is a key component the way that

134
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,560
this the current statute is structured

135
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:20,560
is that it contemplates that all of the

136
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,918
current medical operators that are

137
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,639
licensed will have the right to secure

138
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:29,799
an adult use license for the like

139
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:32,800
operation so Ohio has four major types

140
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:35,960
of licenses the cultivation license the

141
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,120
processing license the lab license and

142
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:40,159
the dispensary license and so as it

143
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,079
stands under the current statute each of

144
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,720
those license holders will have the

145
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:47,198
right to secure in addition to their

146
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,479
medical candidates license an adult use

147
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,080
cannabis license and so right then the

148
00:05:49,478 --> 00:05:53,680
cultivators can sell to the processors

149
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:56,680
and the processors can sell to the

150
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,840
dispensaries um in the adult use

151
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,280
market and then there is also a

152
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:02,758
component that contemplates an

153
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:04,638
additional round of licenses that's

154
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:07,520
specifically geared towards social

155
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:10,000
Equity candidates and that program will

156
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:12,519
be run initially through a through

157
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,639
what's a certification process under

158
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:15,519
what is the Ohio Department of

159
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:18,120
development which oversees all of

160
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:20,399
business certifications along those same

161
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,800
lines like a minority business

162
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:23,758
Enterprise for example or a women uh

163
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,120
business

164
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,598
Enterprise and once that certification

165
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,918
process is created and businesses are

166
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:33,719
certified then the application process

167
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:36,758
can commence as to those applicants as

168
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,199
well and then one final piece on this is

169
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:41,598
every two years under the medical

170
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:43,680
program the regulatory body is is told

171
00:06:41,598 --> 00:06:44,800
to review and assess whether there needs

172
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,519
to be additional

173
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,319
licenses that same concept is employed

174
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:53,120
here in the adult youth program so every

175
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:56,759
two years the program is intended to

176
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:59,079
analyze whether the market is um being

177
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:01,240
Market needs are being met or if the

178
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:03,758
market are not being met and if it's the

179
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:06,319
latter then the and this has actually

180
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,720
occurred in the medical cannabis program

181
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,639
open up they'll open up the licenses for

182
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,360
additional applications and additional

183
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,840
entry into the market so with the

184
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,000
medical program for example I I

185
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:18,560
mentioned just a few minutes ago that

186
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,240
there are dispensaries that are turning

187
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,079
online those are from that two-year

188
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,800
review determining that their patient

189
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:27,719
population could support additional

190
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,520
dispensaries throughout the state of

191
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,240
Ohio okay incred detail thank you very

192
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:34,918
much for that next topic I wanted to

193
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:39,038
move on to was what can we expect in the

194
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:41,918
United States newest adult use Market is

195
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:44,038
the ability to sell Beverages and food

196
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:47,359
products within the realm of the

197
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:49,279
legislation that they proposed or do you

198
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,840
see which side of the industry you see

199
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:53,959
being the dominant player in the Future

200
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:56,878
Part of the Ohio sector certainly so

201
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:58,359
Ohio is a control state it is a control

202
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,199
State as it relates to the medical

203
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,120
cannabis program

204
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:04,879
it will be similarly controlled as it

205
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:07,680
relates to the adult youth program so as

206
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,960
it stands and as it's contemplated today

207
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,639
the program does not have for example a

208
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:14,519
feature like a consumption Lounge like

209
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:16,000
we've seen in other states it is limited

210
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:18,639
to sale at

211
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
dispensaries there are pro provisors

212
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,879
within the statute that allow land

213
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,680
owners to prohibit consumption within

214
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:28,639
their premises um as well as as it

215
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,800
relates to the residential land owners

216
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,240
to prohibit what is a hom grow component

217
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,759
of the program which is a feature that

218
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,719
we haven't yet chatted about because we

219
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:39,200
focused on the the licensing but hom

220
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:42,000
grow is just exactly as it sounds it

221
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,759
allows for grow of cannabis plants in

222
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,240
any individual's home um across the

223
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:48,600
board with the program you have to be 21

224
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,959
and older including with the home grower

225
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,240
component of the program and you are

226
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:56,039
permitted to have each adult within a

227
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:59,600
household to grow up to six plants and

228
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:02,199
each household can have up to 12 plants

229
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,959
and this this isn't just your you know

230
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,399
home Garden where you're planting your

231
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:07,958
cannabis plants it has to be in a

232
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:10,440
security area whether inside or outside

233
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:12,359
of the home and it has to be secure such

234
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,959
that it cannot be accessible to children

235
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,919
or anyone who is not of age of of the

236
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:21,838
age of

237
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:24,240
21 okay um are there brands that already

238
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,680
exist in Ohio when it comes to let's say

239
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,440
the hhc and the Delta a side of the

240
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:31,159
industry that are going to be able to

241
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:34,079
translate into this adult use Market or

242
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:36,319
do you see the big brands from other

243
00:09:34,078 --> 00:09:37,078
larger States coming in and influencing

244
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,399
the

245
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:41,479
market it's a great question because

246
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:43,480
Ohio right it has a separate hemp

247
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,879
program and so I'll kind of set that

248
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:48,879
aside I great topic for a separate

249
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:52,200
webinar to go through um large United

250
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:53,879
States on that but also in Ohio um the

251
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,000
way that the statute is written is it's

252
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:58,600
an attempt to be comprehensive regarding

253
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,399
the sale of any product that may contain

254
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:05,320
th she whether it be Delta 8 Delta 9

255
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:08,200
Delta 10 any of the um variations

256
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:10,720
thereof as well as the cannaboid profile

257
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,600
of the plant so the intent is is that

258
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,600
any sale would be through one of these

259
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,480
licensed

260
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,839
dispensaries and within the state of

261
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,440
Ohio right now we have a number of kind

262
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,000
of

263
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,959
Marquee uh companies that are you know

264
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,320
being that are very successful some of

265
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:26,439
which are Ohio kind of homegrown some of

266
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,120
which are in Partnerships with companies

267
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,040
that are successful in other states and

268
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,000
then some of them are other um companies

269
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:35,159
in other states that have come into the

270
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,120
Ohio market um to participate here so it

271
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:40,799
really is the Gambit at the end of the

272
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,240
day which is exciting right um and

273
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:45,120
because it's a control State there's in

274
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,720
fact a cap on the number of licenses so

275
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,519
it's a cap on um the number of licenses

276
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,680
you can hold within kind of those four

277
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,480
categories I was talking about obviously

278
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:55,838
Labs need to be independent right they

279
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,480
cannot also be affiliated with a company

280
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,480
um in Ohio has um one of the best uh

281
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,879
testing progr programs in the nation

282
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,759
it's gotten extremely positive reviews

283
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,519
um across the board which is very

284
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:08,039
exciting and something that I I

285
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:08,759
personally very proud of with respect to

286
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:10,879
the

287
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:13,360
program and then as it relates to the

288
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:16,120
cultivators you can only own one as a

289
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,839
company same with processors and then as

290
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,159
it relates to the dispensaries currently

291
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,760
you can only own up to five with the

292
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:23,360
adult use proposal you can have up to

293
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:25,159
eight which makes sense because the

294
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,879
Market's growing and there'll be a

295
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:29,519
bigger um demand when you factor in the

296
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:31,480
adult use Market in addition to the

297
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,879
medical

298
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,399
Market we recently had a citizen

299
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:38,838
assembly here in Ireland where we missed

300
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:40,559
out on legal adult's Market by one vote

301
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:42,639
if there was a piece of advice that you

302
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:45,559
could give to territories that are

303
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:47,120
looking to open up this Market from the

304
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:48,599
activism side of the thing all the way

305
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,240
up to the legal side of the thing what

306
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,040
is the one lesson that you think could

307
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,639
be learned from the Ohio process that

308
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:56,039
everybody else could take away that is

309
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,039
an excellent question I'm really glad

310
00:11:56,039 --> 00:12:01,199
that you've asked it putting together

311
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:03,599
the statute was not a simple task and it

312
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,720
was not done by one person it was done

313
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:11,240
by listening to interest groups to

314
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:13,480
operators to Regulators to Ohioans to

315
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:16,120
understand what makes sense for what is

316
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,399
Ohio today and so my piece of advice

317
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,240
would be to understand you can't have

318
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,519
everything and that's where the initia

319
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,560
statute was very beautiful because you

320
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,278
could integrate lots of different

321
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:28,198
components um but in the end at the end

322
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:29,559
of the day it did did not integrate

323
00:12:28,198 --> 00:12:32,479
every single component that you've seen

324
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:34,559
in every single market right um and so

325
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:38,278
there was a balancing act that went in

326
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:40,000
in order to address each of the voices

327
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:42,198
and make sure that Ohioans when they

328
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,679
went to vote on Tuesday felt confident

329
00:12:42,198 --> 00:12:45,599
that this was something that that would

330
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,638
be um something that they would like to

331
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,240
see in their

332
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,919
state yeah it seems to be regardless of

333
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,879
the territory it's the political

334
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:55,439
persuasion of the voter that needs to be

335
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:57,159
appealed to and it has to be palatable

336
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,800
for that voter whether they swing

337
00:12:57,159 --> 00:13:01,639
whichever way left or right yeah that's

338
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:03,838
right in part but we've seen really an

339
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:05,440
interesting Dynamic with the vote this

340
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,920
last week in that there's a lot of

341
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,480
bipartisan support with respect to adult

342
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:11,679
youth cannabis in Ohio um and that

343
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,839
actually was one of the instigating

344
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:16,399
pieces to even go down this path which

345
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,279
by the way started over two years ago as

346
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,919
it related to this specific initiated

347
00:13:18,278 --> 00:13:22,360
statute was that Ohio's just

348
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:23,958
overwhelmingly supported it and that

349
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,919
would have had to have been something

350
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:28,039
that crossed party lines because of the

351
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:29,919
current um affiliation structure or

352
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:30,919
affiliated kind of dynamic we have here

353
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:34,000
in

354
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:35,479
Ohio it's been in incredibly fascinating

355
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,440
talking to Christina you're a wealth of

356
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,480

00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:44,799
12 months in the Ohio industry come to

360
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:46,359
fruition yeah I'm hoping I'm really

361
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:48,359
looking forward to seeing its continued

362
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,600
growth um I think it's been a slow and

363
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:53,079
steady growth and these next 12 months

364
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,959
are going to be critical to that um so

365
