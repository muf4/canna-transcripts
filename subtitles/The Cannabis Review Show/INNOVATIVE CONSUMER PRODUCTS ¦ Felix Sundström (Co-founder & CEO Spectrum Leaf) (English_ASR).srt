yeah so so my background is from tobacco

20
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:47,099
I've been working with uh with snooze

for 15 years by to coming on board here

23
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:56,698
uh so and and uh we came across

24
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:58,919
um a brand called candidates which we

25
00:00:56,698 --> 00:01:03,238
found very interesting uh it's a humble

26
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,879
based uh brand uh and and uh my mission

27
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:08,640
was then to as with my background from

28
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:10,618
the smokeless tobacco in in the

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,819
Scandinavian European markets to to to

30
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:17,938
to bring that product into into Europe

31
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:21,059
so we founded Spectrum leaf

32
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:23,399
and and on on that note we we also

33
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,640
launched candidates we started with uh

34
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,920
uh with some uh some markets the main

35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,780

Switzerland Austria

39
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:40,859
try to build a distribution Network and

40
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:44,159
which yeah has grown ever since so we

41
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:46,319
have 15 markets from from uh as of today

42
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,020
we're selling the products in and then

43
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,719
we try to extend the portfolio but the

44
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:54,118
main mission for for spectrum Leaf is is

45
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:57,239
really to bring in new novel type

46
00:01:54,118 --> 00:02:00,359
products with a functional Focus so

47
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:03,060
we're focusing on on functional uh

48
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:05,640
delivery mechanism especially uh within

49
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,920
uh oral absorption

50
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,959
yeah so and then from there we we

51
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,959
launched a brand called elabor and then

52
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,878
and then boom it's our latest brand

53
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,560
okay so you've got a couple of Brands

54
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:19,560
Under the Umbrella I was reading about

55
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,598
the Voom uh Innovation lab can you maybe

56
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,979
give everybody that's the r d function

57
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:24,119
of the company and that's where you're

58
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:27,419
coming up with the most Innovative

59
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:30,659
products is that correct yeah so so that

60
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:33,479
is a brand or actually an r d company

61
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:37,318
that was founded between myself and

62
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:40,738
Spectrum leaf and uh and and uh um a

63
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:43,500
team of Swedish news entrepreneurs uh

64
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:45,980
Frank s London who's the CEO he has a

65
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,180
quite a substantial

66
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:51,780
experience from both the production

67
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:54,360
sales and also sell uh Distributing

68
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:57,539
nicotine pouches but together we found

69
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:00,000
it then the Boon Innovation which is an

70
00:02:57,539 --> 00:03:02,699
r d company based in southern Sweden

71
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,360
which really focusing on how to increase

72
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:10,439
and uh make the the absorption in the

73
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:12,060
oral cavity uh more effectively

74
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:13,979
okay interesting because it's great to

75
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,959
see a lot of the time you see um people

76
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:17,579
setting up businesses who are just kind

77
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:18,959
of as focused I think some of the most

78
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,459
successful brands that are going to come

79
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,560
to from this industry of people who have

80
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:24,840
already been established in other areas

81
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,699
as you said like tobacco and they're

82
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,098
able to translate either the the

83
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:31,139
consumer want and need into the Cannabis

84
00:03:29,098 --> 00:03:32,878
industry or utilize the innovation in

85
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:35,219
the Cannabis industry for a new product

86
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:38,639
creation are you saying that yourself

87
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:40,739
yeah for sure for sure and uh my as I

88
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,598
said my background is with the oral

89
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:44,340
pouches and we're always seeing that on

90
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:47,280
my view has always been that that is a

91
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,620
it's a very effective way of of

92
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,019
providing consumers with a smokeless

93
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,299
alternative uh

94
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:56,519
um the the oral cavity is it's a

95
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:59,040
fantastic place to to absorb different

96
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:01,620
very various different types of

97
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:04,079
uh Collective substances not only

98
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:06,360
nicotine but in this case uh different

99
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,219
cannabinoids and other other types of

100
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,260
active substances

101
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:13,500
okay can you maybe give everybody a

102
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:15,000
preview for what is and why is it going

103
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,019
to be effective in the cannabinoid

104
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,680
industry

105
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:21,660
uh so snooze is basically uh tobacco

106
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,579
moist tobacco which you put on your lip

107
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,939
and instead of hailing the tobacco or

108
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:29,399
the nicotine uh you you absorbed it in

109
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:31,259
the oral cavity uh so it goes through

110
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:33,839
the mucous membrane and then directly

111
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:36,540
into your bloodstream uh and and you can

112
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:39,539
apply that technology to to other types

113
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:43,259
of substances in our case we believe

114
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:47,699
that you know with by providing a

115
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:49,740
a a pouch type product we we can we

116
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:52,978
don't have to eat and swallow and digest

117
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:55,500
the the substance that you that you

118
00:04:52,978 --> 00:04:57,978
that you that you take uh it doesn't

119
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,899
have to go through the liver and and and

120
00:04:57,978 --> 00:05:03,240
then it gets more effective with the

121
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:06,000
absorption in the in in the in the in

122
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,860
the in the in the lower cavity but it

123
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,139
also it's a very safe and better

124
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,479
alternative to smoking because smoking

125
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:14,939
of today everyone knows how dangerous it

126
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,019
is and and the downsides that comes with

127
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:19,379
it

128
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:21,240
excellent do you see for stuff like snow

129
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:23,279
snow obviously CBD is the big

130
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,019
cannabinoid that everybody uses on the

131
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,179
market but do you see companies starting

132
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:29,758
to blend and formulate different

133
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,500
cannabinoids and terpenes to bring new

134
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,600
ingredients shall we say because I think

135
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,100
that's where a lot of the big innovation

136
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,800
will come over the next five to ten

137
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:41,220
years who's built the perfect recipe for

138
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:43,620
the perfect consumption method I I for

139
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,900
sure and Rooney Innovation is looking at

140
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:48,240
it every day we have a team that is

141
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:51,060
that's very well dedicated to to not

142
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,340
only at look at CBD as you mentioned the

143
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,379
terpene profiles are of course super

144
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:58,439
important but but more than that

145
00:05:55,379 --> 00:06:01,279
different markets across the globe has

146
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:04,319
different uh regulatory you know

147
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:06,959
opportunities so to speak uh so for the

148
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,960
US for example you can look at a various

149
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:13,138
different range of cannabinoids to add

150
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:14,060
to the formulation but also looking at

151
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:17,519
Europe

152
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:20,459
with uh with many big markets opening up

153
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:23,579
for recreational use and medical use so

154
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:25,198
so I I think this is only the beginning

155
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:27,258
for sure

156
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,220
yeah I think a lot of the future will be

157
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:31,259
biosynthesized companies being able to

158
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,479
create large-scale clean pure

159
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:36,419
ingredients that will be utilized in the

160
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:38,639
cpg and the API side of the industries

161
00:06:36,418 --> 00:06:40,859
and tell me this the novel food

162
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,379
application that you guys have managed

163
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:46,139
to get on the list and be approved how

164
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:48,839
uh tiresome and painstaking was that

165
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:50,879
process and is it over now that you're

166
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:52,679
on the list or is it just one hurdle has

167
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,060
been completed and there's still a bit

168
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,699
of the Journey To Go

169
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,740
uh I wish I could say that it's over but

170
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:02,460
it's of course not uh and this is of

171
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:05,098
course only for the UK Market uh uh but

172
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:07,680
uh but but it's also very promising to

173
00:07:05,098 --> 00:07:10,019
see uh how the FSA has approached this

174
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,360
although it's taken a lot of time we're

175
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:14,339
still making some progress uh you can

176
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:18,180
say uh you know because in the European

177
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:20,519
or in the EU it's quite different uh but

178
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:23,840
but so this is as I would view with the

179
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:26,818
first step for us uh we're on the list

180
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:30,359
uh but we're still not fully approved

181
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:33,120
but but I think this um could at least

182
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:36,000
guide guy the consumer in terms of of

183
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:40,560
these products or are being reviewed and

184
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:43,379
also uh are uh are hopefully when they

185
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,978
are approved will be you know

186
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:48,719
safer to use from a consumer perspective

187
00:07:46,978 --> 00:07:50,038
yeah and I think you're you're right

188
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,720
there it all boils back again to the

189
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:53,038
biotechnology companies been able to get

190
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,319
up to speed and make these ingredients

191
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:57,240
because I think they'll get approved so

192
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:59,039
quickly because the the technology

193
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,960
involved behind it where at the moment

194
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:02,699
the ingredients that people are using

195
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:05,339
the people who are giving the license

196
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:07,139
are still not crystal clear on the uh

197
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:09,959
the exact Purity and strength of each

198
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:12,960
individual uh motion

199
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:12,959
attaching

200
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,519
so with another food application as I

201
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:18,719
said that's just the UK we see a lot of

202
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:20,339
people getting carried away thinking

203
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,800
that the novel food gives them the geek

204
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:24,959
get the key to the Golden Gate or

205
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,500
whatever it may be so the UK Market you

206
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:30,598
guys see has been a a home for for uh

207
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,099
your products or you guys a global

208
00:08:30,598 --> 00:08:35,218
company where this is just the first

209
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:37,320
step in the stage for you guys uh this

210
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:41,159
is for sure the first step uh this is

211
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:43,260
also a UK the FSA who has been uh

212
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:46,740
pushing this agenda

213
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:49,019
and and also uh been very clear on

214
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,839
towards us as a company what to do and

215
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:54,839
what is required of us uh EU has not

216
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,420
really reached that point yet uh but we

217
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:59,399
are will of course be looking into to or

218
00:08:57,419 --> 00:09:02,399
we have submitted an application for the

219
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:05,759
EU but but still no feedback and and now

220
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:08,580
no results so far uh but but we would of

221
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:10,919
course like to to get our product uh

222
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:13,860
registered and and tested

223
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:16,679
as much as possible in order to to avoid

224
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:19,019
the consumers that are safe to use

225
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:21,299
okay and speaking of testing there do

226
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:24,179
you see there is an ample amount of

227
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:25,740
testing facilities in the UK or in

228
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:28,319
Europe or do you think that's where

229
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:31,379
there's still a lack of real capital and

230
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,839
real technology is in the the labs that

231
00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:35,700
are able to actually test products at a

232
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,380
pretty high speed uh compared to let's

233
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,879
say the government agencies and Labs

234
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:41,000
that are currently doing it

235
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:43,559
yeah for sure and and and

236
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,339
what one of course could wish for is

237
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:49,979
it's a universal standard the SOP for

238
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:52,519
all the labs so we always get the same

239
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:55,560
results because as of today

240
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:57,179
uh the bigger more established labs they

241
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:59,759
don't have that much experience in

242
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:01,679
testing cannabinoids and also then you

243
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:05,759
have the in parallel you have smaller

244
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:08,039
more cannabis driven labs and they they

245
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:10,139
maybe don't in all cases have the same

246
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:12,240
Sops and testing in the same ways and if

247
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:14,578
you don't pass in the same ways you will

248
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,200
not be able to compare the results so so

249
00:10:14,578 --> 00:10:19,199
I think this is something that is very

250
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:21,420
very important for the future

251
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,920
not only for the consumer safety but

252
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:25,019
also from a regulatory perspective

253
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:26,699
because when you're looking at TC levels

254
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:28,679
you need to ensure that there's no teach

255
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:31,680
in the products

256
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:34,199
yeah well I think that's it that THC

257
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:36,000
trade seems to be the the Handcuff

258
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,320
that's holding a lot of Brands back and

259
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,659
I think that comes from as you said

260
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,480
different labs are testing at different

261
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:45,059
capabilities and that doesn't give

262
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,399
Clarity to the brands and products do

263
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:51,119
you see the election over in Great

264
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:53,100
Britain having any sway on the end

265
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,620
result of the novel food we see your man

266
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,480
rushy sonak coming out and saying he's

267
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,980
against all drugs he's got to punish

268
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,079
everybody used them but your own lives

269
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:04,200
trust seems to be more open to a

270
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:07,859
cannabis industry grown in the UK

271
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:10,680
yeah I do think though that that the UK

272
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:13,800
has shown until now that they are

273
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:16,620
progressive liberal Market uh and open

274
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:18,838
to to have safe and regulated products

275
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:21,120
but uh but when it comes to politics

276
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:23,399
it's of course impossible to to foresee

277
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,919
and we we just have to to to to to to

278
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:28,200
monitor the situation and see what comes

279
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:30,659
out and then we have to to apply by by

280
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,879
the the guidelines that are are for the

281
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:36,539
future

282
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:39,720
do you see uh brexit as a hindrance to

283
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:41,639
the UK Market grout or do you think it's

284
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,440
been a good thing for them that the the

285
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:44,819
cannabis companies in Britain will

286
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,380
actually be able to supply the British

287
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,240
industry that there won't be much

288
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:49,799
competition because if you own companies

289
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,180
that deal business with the UK at the

290
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:53,759
moment in Europe it's a

291
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:56,278
nightmare things take like twice as long

292
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:57,720
the tax on top of all the the orders

293
00:11:56,278 --> 00:11:59,278
that come with it do you think that's

294
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,139
going to end up hindering the industry

295
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:03,059
long term or do you think it's going to

296
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:04,200
cocoon us and allow the UK companies to

297
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:06,000
be able to dominate their own home

298
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,100
territory

299
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,320
to be honest I'm not an expert in this

300
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,420
field but but but but but but my view

301
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,839
would be that because what we saw when

302
00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:17,819
brexit happened uh is that it created a

303
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,220
lot of issues and and you know many

304
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:22,560
companies had to basically cut down or

305
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,540
wasn't able to to sell to the UK at all

306
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,338
because of the complexity and also that

307
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:28,620
you didn't really know what rules

308
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:30,600
applied but I think we have seen at

309
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:33,659
least an improvement over the last years

310
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:36,120
and then over a long time

311
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:39,299
of course the UK will be a huge business

312
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,820
partner to the EU so I think they will

313
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:44,819
find ways to to smoothen this out but of

314
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:46,800
course it would be much easier if if

315
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:49,320
broad brexit wouldn't have occurred to

316
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:51,659
be honest yeah and a quick jump around

317
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,820
Europe now obviously you're from the

318
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:55,860
Nordic area of Europe do you see the

319
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,060
Nordic still being pretty severe on CBD

320
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,680
we talked to a couple of guys from

321
00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:01,138
Finland and different areas where it's

322
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:03,479
it almost seems like CBD is considered a

323
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:05,700
class a narcotic do you see that uh

324
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,079
loosening over degree or is there a

325
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:10,019
separate strategy in all the different

326
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:14,120
states in that part of Europe

327
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:16,980
yeah I I I think we will see a different

328
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,959
regulatory Frameworks for different from

329
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:21,778
the different countries Finland Norway

330
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:24,838
uh but also Sweden to some extent they

331
00:13:21,778 --> 00:13:27,179
have had a fairly The View has been that

332
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:28,920
simply is maybe not a narcotic but more

333
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:31,078
a medical type product and it should be

334
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:32,879
regulated on the from the medical side

335
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:33,539
uh there's been a few

336
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:36,000
um

337
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:39,419
uh verdicts also from from the from the

338
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,720
from the courts in Sweden for example uh

339
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:45,659
but uh but I think over time when we see

340
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,120
markets like Germany uh and and bigger

341
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:48,958
trademark trade trade

342
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,240
um

343
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:53,698
and countries uh for for the

344
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:57,959
Scandinavian markets opening up an EU

345
00:13:53,698 --> 00:14:00,078
also being very open and the same you

346
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:02,819
know with the same similar type of

347
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:04,879
regulatory framework so so I think over

348
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:07,079
time this will change but I think

349
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:10,198
Scandinavia is more conservative for

350
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:12,179
sure than than the southern um European

351
00:14:10,198 --> 00:14:15,419
market so

352
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:18,838
um it will take time to get a clear uh

353
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:21,838
framework in place but but long term uh

354
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:22,800
cannabis and CBD for sure is here to

355
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,600
stay

356
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:26,939
yeah I think we all got our fingers

357
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,100
crossed that Germany executes their new

358
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:31,500
industry perfectly and that the capital

359
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:33,060
generated from tax and whatnot is

360
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,440
actually an example to the rest of the

361
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:37,739
European countries and that we can

362
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:40,800
hopefully ride in the jet stream of how

363
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:44,639
the German industry takes off

364
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:46,559
I agree fully uh and uh and but but it

365
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,139
will take time we all need to be patient

366
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:50,819
yeah well this is it it's not a it's not

367
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:53,159
a Sprint by any stretchy the imagination

368
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:55,740
you want to have thick skin uh the

369
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:57,778
ability to learn all sorts of topics in

370
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,220
this industry if you got into kind of

371
00:14:57,778 --> 00:15:01,198
mistake and it's got to be fun you'll

372
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:03,360
end up with a degree in biotechnology or

373
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:06,059
in physics or in chemistry or something

374
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,919
