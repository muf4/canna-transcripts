industry at the moment

12
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:44,218
yeah I'm I worked as advisor in um yeah

13
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:45,799
the European Industrial Hemp Association

14

Italian National Association has uh as

18
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:04,259
develop their business here in Europe

19
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:06,599
okay very interesting and you maybe want

20
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,100
to jump onto the first topic and we've

21
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:10,259
had a number of guests from around

22
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:11,759
Europe and we've been able to piece

23
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,859
together a picture of various different

24
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,719
countries but can you maybe give us an

25
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:17,938
overview of what's happening in Italy

26
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:21,739
when it regards to the Cannabis industry

27
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:25,919
both medical and adult use

28
00:01:21,739 --> 00:01:29,099
yeah uh I think that the situation in

29
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:33,379
Italy is a little bit complicated as

30
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:37,500
everything in this country and but

31
00:01:33,379 --> 00:01:40,280
especially uh in the hemp sector we are

32
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:43,920
making progress in two directions

33
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:47,400
first the Ministry of Agriculture is

34
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,460
defining the sector plan for hamper with

35
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:53,399
the trade associations this is an

36
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:56,759
important step because it will be based

37
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,399
on the concept of the wall plant as an

38
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,799
Agricultural Product

39
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:04,019
it will allow Farmers to grow and

40
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:08,640
process the whole plant for legal

41
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:11,579
purpose and lower two for two or 2016

42
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:15,359
and this is very important because it

43
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:17,879
guarantees the agricultural part and is

44
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:22,260
in line with the concept of the wall

45
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:23,699
plant approach also promote by the the

46
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:27,179
United Nations

47
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:29,939
and second we are waiting for the

48
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:34,200
consequence of the tarlacio the Italian

49
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:36,539
Minister the Court ruling Vietnam the

50
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:40,439
part of the ministry decree of medicinal

51
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:44,899
plant that limit its use to seeds and

52
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:48,120
derivatives only this called Ola for the

53
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:52,080
development of the sector for the

54
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:54,800
farmers who who cultivate the ngaecp

55
00:02:52,080 --> 00:03:00,180
according the European

56
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:03,660
procedure who will first be able to grow

57
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:07,379
them and transform them into until

58
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:10,620
essential oils and then Supply the

59
00:03:07,378 --> 00:03:12,780
product to herpes and pharmacies who

60
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,420
will be able to make galenic

61
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:19,560
preparations I think that the minister

62
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:23,939
of health will not agree on this on this

63
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:27,000
scenario but All That Remains is to wait

64
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:32,219
for the ruling to become final next

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:35,639
September for adult use is a question of

66
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:39,419
political choice and political will and

67
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:43,318
now in Italy I think there is not a real

68
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:45,719
political will to proceed in the way of

69
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:50,699
the regulation of the adult use of

70
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:55,620
cannabis and the medical cannabis is a

71
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:59,759
question who don't present real problem

72
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:03,959
under the regulatory law aspect is a

73
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:09,318
real problem of Supply because here in

74
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:13,920
Italy the possibility the growing it's

75
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:17,579
our law just for the Army and now we are

76
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:21,659
waiting for uh a partnership between

77
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:23,960
Army and private companies but the way

78
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:28,500
is

79
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:30,198
fun to uh to because we need to

80
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:35,279
work

81
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:37,500
and on the training of the doctors uh

82
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:40,258
because if the doctors don't prescribe

83
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:43,918
cannabis the pharmacy don't sell and

84
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:48,540
there is not a real business so this is

85
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:50,060
a situation is uh moving forward for we

86
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:54,660
we're making

87
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:58,620
important steps for hemp not for animal

88
00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:01,680
to use not really for medical cannabis

89
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,899
okay very very informative and is there

90
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,139
a territory or does Spain have a large

91
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:08,519
output of hemp grown every year is it

92
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:11,579
one of the biggest producers in Europe

93
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:15,060
or is it still a small industry

94
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:19,258
yeah I I I think so

95
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:23,339
um Italy is a country with a big

96
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:26,220
possibilities but we need to take an

97
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:30,239
example in my opinion from the North

98
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:33,780
American for example market for the

99
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:38,160
um less bureaucratic liberalist approach

100
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:41,339
to the Innovative sector we we are

101
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:44,160
fighting again in this situation here in

102
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:45,019
Italy but we are step by step moving

103
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,520
forward

104
00:05:45,019 --> 00:05:53,399
especially to to avoid a situation of

105
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:56,579
overproduction in a sector as in another

106
00:05:53,399 --> 00:06:02,339
country and we are work in progress too

107
00:05:56,579 --> 00:06:06,839
and as other countries in the in in the

108
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:10,439
Hampton cannabis sector we are sold some

109
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:12,918
problems through the court and through

110
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:16,139
the state or in the court

111
00:06:12,918 --> 00:06:18,478
okay and in over in Italy do they have

112
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:22,319
we see around Europe there's lots of uh

113
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:24,719
CBD stores that sell CBD flower and hhc

114
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,419
and and some of them were Delta are they

115
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,819
available in Italy or are they uh just

116
00:06:27,418 --> 00:06:31,139
not around at all

117
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:34,500
okay good question

118
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:37,439
and uh because it's the other end of the

119
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:42,478
discussion now in the one hand we are

120
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:45,079
talking about the step forward but in

121
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:49,560
the other end there are still gray areas

122
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:53,639
for CBD flowers here in Italy so-called

123
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:55,579
cannabis light now uh where there is a

124
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:58,680
sector where there are different

125
00:06:55,579 --> 00:07:03,359
interpretations from case to Case and

126
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:05,220
from iRead wire so in uh from a

127
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,340
municipality

128
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,340
um

129
00:07:07,978 --> 00:07:15,959
um near closure uh

130
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:18,359
can be happiness that in in a town there

131
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:21,418
is a criminal trial and another cow

132
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:24,960
there is not a criminal trial I believe

133
00:07:21,418 --> 00:07:27,779
that the outcome of the criminal trial

134
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:30,719
in Parma against Mr Luca marola the

135
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:33,959
founder of his joint will be decisive

136
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:37,680
for media attention and the political

137
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:41,839
weight of this trial of course I think

138
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:47,639
that this outcome

139
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:50,459
uh could be uh could help us uh the CDD

140
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:53,280
flowers regression because the CBD

141
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:57,659
flowers must be must find a clear

142
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:59,698
position as an election product as in

143
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:02,759
Belgium a Luxembourg or in the street

144
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:07,439
Center because I don't think that the

145
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:11,098
Italy can continue to sell this product

146
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:14,339
as a horizontal product or for just for

147
00:08:11,098 --> 00:08:18,378
collecting because this is not a big

148
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:21,359
business is a business just for uh

149
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:23,759
for a little companies and not for

150
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:28,199
bigger companies not good for investment

151
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:30,419
there is not Clarity and certain are

152
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:33,778
certainly low

153
00:08:30,418 --> 00:08:36,478
and do they have any rough estimates of

154
00:08:33,778 --> 00:08:38,820
what the medical cannabis Market size is

155
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,278
how many people in the country are open

156
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,620
to possibly subscribe and then is there

157
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:45,059
is there Market data for the adult use

158
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,339
Market is it five percent of the

159
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:49,079
population or or do you have a rough

160
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:53,160
idea on that figure

161
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:54,980
yeah I you're right because uh because I

162
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:59,458
think that

163
00:08:54,980 --> 00:09:02,220
we need to create this Market too in the

164
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:07,079
Cannabis dismissed this business we need

165
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:10,860
to start uh and began from the training

166
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:14,220
of the doctors and for pharmacies

167
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:18,120
because if these doctors prescribes very

168
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:20,879
few yet cannabis Pharmacy don't sell if

169
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:24,000
a pharmacy don't sell don't buy and the

170
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:29,700
pharmacy don't buy there is not a real a

171
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:33,958
real market so we need work on uh on

172
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:36,540
home training of doctors to training and

173
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:38,278
distribution because without training

174
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:41,639
there is not a real distribution in

175
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:45,019
Italy now in the in in one end but in

176
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:49,080
other hand we I I

177
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:53,039
see this is my personal opinion that we

178
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:57,560
can start to to import some API some

179
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:59,299
product because we have yes yet sunlit

180
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:04,919
regulatory

181
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:08,759
problems who limit the possibility to uh

182
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:11,299
create a vertical facility from the

183
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:14,179
plants until the final product

184
00:10:11,299 --> 00:10:18,059
especially for the extra

185
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:19,439
gtmpx set for pharmaceutical use so care

186
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:24,179
could be

187
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:29,040
um an intermediate situation where some

188
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:35,039
API are import from other member states

189
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:36,778
in because we need the u a u GMP Sor are

190
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:40,139
working on it too

191
00:10:36,778 --> 00:10:41,879
and do you find that there's any reports

192
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:44,179
and

193
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:47,519
um data sets in Europe that actually

194
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:51,239
realistically have projected the size of

195
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:53,220
both the CBD side and the hhc and the

196
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,980
medical Size Market and gotten a roof

197
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:58,980
valuation on a country by country basis

198
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:01,519
or do you think that it's all

199
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:06,240
the information is not exact

200
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:09,299
yeah I I think that uh as I also

201
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,000
explained and uh in in the working

202
00:11:09,299 --> 00:11:15,000
groups European and National level where

203
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,240
I participate the solution must be

204
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,720
unified uh European level we need a

205
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:24,600
simple a single room sorry a single a

206
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:27,540
single approach and we must avoid a

207
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:31,820
two-speed Europe uh where some countries

208
00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:35,819
can freely produce and sell a wall plant

209
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:39,240
of cannabis and CBD products and other

210
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:41,640
countries where the same products cannot

211
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:44,399
be produced and sell it because this

212
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:48,000
situation only creates damage to the

213
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:50,399
business and Distortion of the common

214
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,339
market organization and the market

215
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:57,059
competition because the countries as

216
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:59,880
military accounts as Italian Spain with

217
00:11:57,059 --> 00:12:03,119
a restrictive regulations we find

218
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:05,639
themselves in their position of being

219
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:09,839
subject to the import of the same binary

220
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:12,899
products due to the due to the aspect of

221
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:15,620
the free Monument of goods uh with the

222
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:21,059
damage only for the to the National

223
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:25,200
producers for example if in Italy you

224
00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:27,599
can't produce a tea with leaves but you

225
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:31,259
can import the same products from

226
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:35,820
Austria or from Croatia this is a

227
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:39,000
situation we need to resolve it to avoid

228
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:43,200
a true speed Europe this is our problem

229
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:46,379
in Europe but at the same time

230
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:49,680
at the European level the work is

231
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:53,059
spending and the main and the relevant

232
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:53,059
direction generalities

233
00:12:53,419 --> 00:13:01,379
are working on their respective papers

234
00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:05,820
on Cosmetics on feed on the food and we

235
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:09,059
are working on on the human use and the

236
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:12,839
human destination because the real the

237
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:16,919
real game is played in Europe not in the

238
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:20,639
single member states because we know

239
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:24,778
there are member states with a extensive

240
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:26,159
interpretation with temporary framework

241
00:13:24,778 --> 00:13:29,879
uh

242
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:34,139
a vet already although uh producing sell

243
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:37,278
it for CBD products as uh France Poland

244
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:41,159
but there is a

245
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:44,879
complicated and particular situation

246
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:48,000
where it's not possible obtain a real

247
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:51,179
registration at as food sampling metal

248
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:55,339
but we're we're there is a similar

249
00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:59,819
procedure of notifying procedure

250
00:13:55,339 --> 00:14:02,459
that are allowed to say there's some

251
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:04,980
there's the CBD products in some

252
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:07,859
countries so we need to avoid this

253
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:10,159
situation where some countries can

254
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:12,980
freely produce other

255
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:15,000
where the same products cannot be

256
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:17,339
produced and safe

257
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,839
and One Last Thing Before I Let You Go

258
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:20,639
you mentioned the Core case that's

259
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:22,440
happening in Italy and Parma that's

260
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,060
basically going to determine the next

261
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,399
kind of stage of what the industry looks

262
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:28,379
like we've got one in Ireland as well as

263
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,179
I'm sure you're aware that some of the

264
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:32,879
companies have core K course there are

265
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:35,159
court cases against uh our government

266
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:37,500
and that case is going to determine how

267
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:39,240
the industry in Ireland is it a case of

268
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:42,179
all these different single layer

269
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:45,419
countries in the European Union will

270
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:47,039
they have their laws overruled by the

271
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:49,198
Euro Community European commission no

272
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:51,838
matter what they do or is there always

273
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:53,578
going to be this fragmented framework if

274
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,459
everybody doesn't get inside with the

275
00:14:53,578 --> 00:14:59,159
exact same laws

276
00:14:56,458 --> 00:15:03,119
uh they

277
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:06,600
um is a matter very very important that

278
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:09,299
the national courts are applying the

279
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,778
European law the Italy the third last

280
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:16,198
Italian administrative Court the French

281
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:19,320
State Council are stated that the

282
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:24,379
European law prevails on National rules

283
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:25,639
because the national rules that are

284
00:15:24,379 --> 00:15:29,639
[Music]

285
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:33,060
that card against the European the

286
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:36,799
European law for example against the use

287
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:40,859
of the world plan are against the

288
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:43,578
produce a quantitative quantitative

289
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,579
restriction

290
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:50,519
that is it's forbidden and this

291
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:52,799
principle are stated uh is as already

292
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:56,459
stated from the European Capital Justice

293
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:59,939
in 2003 the first time against Sweden in

294
00:15:56,458 --> 00:16:03,299
the Hammerstein case in recently in 2020

295
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:06,000
in the carnival place the statement of

296
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:09,120
the European court of justice are the

297
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,458
the point of reference of the national

298
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:15,899
court and for European commission too

299
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:19,619
and the that's working this paper the

300
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:23,399
European commission are working on a

301
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:27,179
line at the single destination of use

302
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:29,578
regulation with the interpretation uh

303
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:32,338
stated by the European Capital Justice

304
00:16:29,578 --> 00:16:35,899
on the uh

305
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:38,820
this is this is the situation now Europe

306
