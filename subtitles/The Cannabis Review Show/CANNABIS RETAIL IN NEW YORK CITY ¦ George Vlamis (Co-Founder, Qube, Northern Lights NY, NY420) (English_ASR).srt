but you know still moving forward here

18
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,378
that's it we're talking to John perro

19
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,539
one of the legal experts from New York

20
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:50,579
on that topic exactly today as well so

21
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,920
hopefully we get some insights from a

22
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,600
legal perspective yeah that'll be nice

23
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,059
that will be nice to see what's going on

24
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,739
here yeah tell me this can you maybe

25
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:00,659
give everybody a quick overview of how

26
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:03,119
you ended up in the Cannabis Indian boy

27
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:05,579
and what companies you decided to create

28
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,500
in that space I've been in the Cannabis

29
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:09,500
industry on the other side for many

30
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:13,400
years and then when Massachusetts

31
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:16,799
legalized I moved there and we started a

32
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:19,200
cultivation situation to learn the legal

33
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,180
landscape and then we waited for New

34
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,799
York to open and then when New York

35
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:26,100
opened we really hit the ground running

36
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,740
we secured several Prime real estate

37
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:31,079
locations early on before any of the

38
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:32,759
rules were even released and positioned

39
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:35,879
ourselves to really enter this space

40
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:38,759
across the state so we are positioned

41
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:41,158
now in multiple locations

42
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:44,579
from the state's capital Albany New York

43
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:46,079
all the way down to Manhattan and we

44
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:49,559
have a big presence in the Mid-Hudson

45
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:51,839
Valley so we have Cube where I'm

46
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,299
partners with Quan Liddell in Manhattan

47
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,118
then we have Northern Lights and why

48
00:01:54,299 --> 00:02:00,060
where I am partners with Joe Kelly in

49
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:02,938
Albany then we have another site coming

50
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:06,899
online in Fishkill New York New Paltz

51
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:09,538
New York and Newburgh New York at the

52
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:12,000
moment so uh those are the three brands

53
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:14,579
and then we created uh Quan and I we

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,919
founded NY 420 where we put up a website

55
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:19,560
where we allow anybody in the Cannabis

56
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:22,318
space in New York that's participating

57
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,180
to have free advertising and showcase

58
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:25,738
their brand

59
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,599
um everything that they're doing a link

60
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:30,120
to where they want to drive traffic and

61
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:32,699
it's a website where people entering the

62
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,340
space can come and basically find every

63
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:37,560
service you need to open up a dispensary

64
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,959
in this state

65
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,000
okay very interesting I might start off

66
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,219
with Cube as our first topic of

67
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,719
discussion and this chain of

68
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:47,699
dispensaries that you're going to have

69
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:50,818
throughout New York City or New York

70
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:52,919
State and what is the purchasing process

71
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:55,619
when you're deciding what kind of flower

72
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:58,139
and what kind of products are cute

73
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,539
well we we have a good relationship with

74
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:02,458
a lot of the cultivators and processors

75
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:04,679
now for the last couple years since they

76
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:06,539
started coming online and we inspect

77
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,459
everybody's product we sit down with

78
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:10,799
them and we see you know what they have

79
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:13,439
available at the moment and what they

80
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,879
have coming online and we for all the

81
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:18,359
sites that I work with all the partners

82
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:21,060
that I have we really want to let the

83
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,920
public know that we want to push Fresh

84
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,378
Products so if you're coming and you're

85
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:26,939
buying flower from one of our sites it's

86
00:03:25,378 --> 00:03:28,439
going to be fresh flowers not going to

87
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:29,939
be a year old

88
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:32,158
um so that's that's how we work with the

89
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:34,378
cultivators is we try to

90
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:36,419
tell them look you want you know you

91
00:03:34,378 --> 00:03:38,579
want to have space on the Shelf we want

92
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:40,378
to support you we just want to have

93
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:43,200
fresh product we're not looking to take

94
00:03:40,378 --> 00:03:44,939
in last year's crop and we want that to

95
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:47,399
transpire go with the customer coming in

96
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:49,919
so we're always looking to try and bring

97
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,420
in new and exciting products as fresh as

98
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:54,119
possible

99
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:55,378
and when it comes to the cultivation of

100
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,120
flour and the products that you're

101
00:03:55,378 --> 00:03:59,219
accessing and is it all to recommend

102
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,500
from New York Farms

103
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:03,919
it has to be yeah we have to purchase

104
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,780
from New York cultivators and processors

105
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:08,518
and is there specific companies that are

106
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,459
standing in the rest when it seems to be

107
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:12,959
the cultivation in New York or uh is it

108
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,580
a case while we're in Canada we're going

109
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,500
to see the smaller operators the more

110
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,180
craft operators produced a better

111
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,298
quality flower

112
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:23,400
I mean it's very early on now so I don't

113
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:25,019
know how comfortable I feel calling

114
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:26,758
everybody out and saying who's better

115
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:28,918
than who but listen there are definitely

116
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:30,479
some companies that are much larger than

117
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:32,399
others

118
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:34,680
um and there are people who have very

119
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:36,418
small craft operations so

120
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,040
you're gonna have a mix of both right

121
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:40,680
you're going to have people that can

122
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,300
supply you know two three hundred skus

123
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,280
for your dispensary you're going to have

124
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,319
people that that specialize in two or

125
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:48,779
three that have a supremium quality

126
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:51,959
compared to everybody else so it'll be a

127
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:54,059
healthy mix still very early but you

128
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:56,279
know there are a handful of companies

129
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,439
that I think are going to survive

130
00:04:56,279 --> 00:05:01,138
a long time

131
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:03,360
now when it comes to the current Retail

132
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:05,759
Landscape in New York we obviously have

133
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,199
seen a lot of illegal operations opened

134
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,120
up but then some

135
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,560
tomorrow policy work by the Cannabis

136
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,699
Commission in New York looking to try

137
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,500
and close these down what does the

138
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:15,720
current Retail Landscape look like in

139
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,339
Manhattan at the moment compared to the

140
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,680
rest of the state

141
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:21,839
I mean listen the the office of cannabis

142
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,459
management the governor all the powers

143
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:24,839
that may be in New York state they're

144
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:27,478
going to do the best they can to

145
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:29,399
minimize these illegal shops

146
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:31,740
you know unfortunately at the moment

147
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:34,379
Manhattan is flooded with them wherever

148
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,660
you go you know if you pick a spot you

149
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:38,399
pick a street you know within a couple

150
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:40,800
of feet couple of minutes you know you

151
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:43,560
you can find plenty of places to

152
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,660
purchase all kinds of cannabis products

153
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:48,180
24 7 here

154
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,020
you know that are not licensed operators

155
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,660
so

156
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:53,939
it is what it is right now we have we

157
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,900
with the licenses have to trust that the

158
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:56,819
customer

159
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:59,159
is going to want to shop

160
00:05:56,819 --> 00:06:01,199
to purchase a product that New York

161
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,120
state has tested

162
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,639
and has confirmed there are no other

163
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,819
narcotics in the mix and it is a safe

164
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:12,060
product to consume so that is what we

165
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:13,259
have to really tell the public who's

166
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,839
shopping

167
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:19,620
buy from a licensed operator we have

168
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:21,000
tested product it's safe to consume the

169
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,740
illegal shops they're doing what they

170
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,300
got to do to survive I can't speak on

171
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,100
what they're doing I don't own one of

172
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,439
them you know I wish them the best of

173
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:30,900
luck in making the transition I wish New

174
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:33,839
York State the best of luck in you know

175
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:35,939
minimizing their exposure and collecting

176
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:38,339
tax revenue so

177
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:41,160
interesting interesting landscape in

178
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:42,538
Manhattan yeah for sure as I said I was

179
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,340
there last year and it was pretty

180
00:06:42,538 --> 00:06:47,038
comical to see the explosion the

181
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:48,779
proliferation of these sort of is it a

182
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:50,818
case of it's currently just whack-a-mole

183
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:52,439
the police are closing down and they're

184
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:53,340
just finding a new retail outlet and

185
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:54,600
they're going to make the money as

186
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:56,638
quickly as they can until they get

187
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,199
closed down again I mean listen the show

188
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,418
what's going down in Manhattan you need

189
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,340
nothing short of the National Guard you

190
00:07:00,418 --> 00:07:04,859
know you got to close the streets you

191
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:07,198
need a couple of military units and you

192
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:09,479
have to attack Manhattan for a good two

193
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,340
three days and shut down thousands of

194
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:13,079
stores shutting down two or three here

195
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:15,599
or there by the time you're done doing

196
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:17,519

204
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,519
applications when it comes to the

205
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:34,139
licensing in New York what does the

206
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:36,120
current landscape look like for the

207
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:38,759
recipients that are already opened up

208
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,439

the next 12 to 24 months yeah listen

212
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:48,180
from what I understand the licensed

213
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:50,098
operators that have been open making

214
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:52,740
sales they're doing very well they're

215
00:07:50,098 --> 00:07:55,139

216
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:58,379
stores loving the products it's a very

217
00:07:55,139 --> 00:08:00,240
fun business so you know we're moving as

218
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:02,759
fast as we can to become one of them and

219
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,680
start sales and we think that you know

220
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:06,120
for the next three to five years New

221
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,519
York is going to become what everybody

222
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,439
thinks it is one of the largest markets

223
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:12,418
in the world and we're very excited to

224
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:14,519
see the sales and to interact with all

225
00:08:12,418 --> 00:08:16,019
the people and the brands it's a very

226
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:18,779
fun space

227
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:20,339
very excited for what's coming and I can

228
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:21,779
only imagine one of the places that I

229
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:24,478
was stuck at me though when it comes to

230
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:25,878
the consumption lounges or even bars

231
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:28,620
that are now

232
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:31,500
licensed towards cannabis consumption I

233
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:33,658
spoke to Alex Alexander racing who owns

234
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,639
the first cannabis Hotel the Lexi in Las

235
00:08:33,658 --> 00:08:37,620
Vegas and the one thing in the back of

236
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:39,958
my mind was I was if you combine the

237
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,820
culture and the music with a consumption

238
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:44,458
Lounge in New York surely that's going

239
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:46,560
to be the next big wave of cannabis

240
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:48,599
businesses who can marry those two

241
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:50,278
sectors together

242
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,519
it's going to be great I mean from what

243
00:08:50,278 --> 00:08:56,939
I understand now our card license allows

244
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,919
for limited on-site consumption so a lot

245
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,480
of the sites that I have we are

246
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:02,939
preparing them to have an Indus

247
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,800
independent space where you can come and

248
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,720
consume and then we're waiting on

249
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:09,179
further regulation from the office of

250
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,000
cannabis management to really explain

251
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:13,679
what that entails and what limits we

252
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,958
have to follow here but

253
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:17,458
you know New York is going to be a very

254
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:20,039
exciting Market I mean to go into

255
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:22,079
Manhattan purchase a product and then go

256
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:24,539
into somebody's creative space where

257
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,519
there it was designed to entertain you

258
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:27,659
while you're consuming cannabis that's

259
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:29,278
going to be something that's going to be

260
00:09:27,659 --> 00:09:30,838
developing over the next five ten years

261
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:32,458
and I think it's going to be amazing to

262
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:34,920
watch happen

263
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:36,659
yeah and I think from this side of the

264
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:38,399
pond it's one of those if New York

265
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:40,620
didn't already have enough unique

266
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,480
selling points that have been able to go

267
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:45,240
to Manhattan and as I said go to one of

268
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,159
these Lounge whatever part of the scale

269
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,379
that ends up being on and being able to

270
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:50,939
enjoy that product and the consumption

271
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:53,220
mixed with the media over there I think

272
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,500
is going to be very advantageous for for

273
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,540
Holiday makers and for tourism for the

274
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,860
sector as well a hundred percent it's

275
00:09:57,539 --> 00:10:00,299
going to be a huge Market people are

276
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,278
going to come from all over the world to

277
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:05,519
participate

278
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:07,620
do you see no because it's legal is Tom

279
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,899
Dick and Harry's got sort of a name

280
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:12,240
trying to get their foot in the door of

281
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:13,980
this sector now or is it still got a

282
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,560
high enough barrier to entry

283
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,899
I mean the the barrier to entry really

284
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:20,399
is is the money that's what it comes

285
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:21,659
down to I mean you know if you're an

286
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,480
entrepreneur you should be able to

287
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:25,919
navigate any business you want to enter

288
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,500
so a lot of people want to enter the

289
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,879
space that haven't been in the space I

290
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:33,059
mean this is my first time in the space

291
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:35,580
but it's you know it's easy in my

292
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:36,778
opinion right the the state issues

293
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,060
regulation

294
00:10:36,778 --> 00:10:41,338
your father [ __ ] rules if you know

295
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:42,778
how to read you can operate that's what

296
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:44,339
it comes down to you know your average

297
00:10:42,778 --> 00:10:46,078
person they want to talk or even people

298
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:47,459
in the space they tell you oh it's a

299
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:49,259
hard business you've never been in

300
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:51,539
cannabis get the [ __ ] out of here this

301
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:54,120
is easy [ __ ] man you follow what the

302
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:56,338
state says you raise some money and you

303
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,919
open a business like it's anything else

304
00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:01,140
so anybody who wants to enter the space

305
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:04,019
finds your money read the regulation

306
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:05,819
have a creative session come up with

307
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:07,440
what you're gonna do and at the end of

308
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,360
the day we're selling weed follow the

309
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,600
rules and keep your license

310
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:15,480
yeah when it comes today

311
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,879
the actual retail locations in Manhattan

312
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,639
I was reading up at a number of rules of

313
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:23,338
it has x amount of meters or distance

314
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:25,139
away from each other it is that

315
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:27,060
something that people have been very

316
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:29,039
picking the retail locations known what

317
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:32,879
the parameters were for these really

318
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:35,578
retail locations in advance what is your

319
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:38,600
input on choosing a retail location in

320
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:42,120
Manhattan I mean I think the rules are

321
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:45,540
500 feet from any school and the school

322
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:48,240
I think it's defined K through 12. uh

323
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:50,519
200 feet from any house of Warship

324
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,039
that's the main factors and a thousand

325
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:55,740
feet at least for Manhattan a thousand

326
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:58,078
feet from any other licensed dispensary

327
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:00,778
so you follow those parameters the state

328
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:02,699
put out a new search tool

329
00:12:00,778 --> 00:12:04,980
to give you a heads up if the location

330
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:08,579
is compliant and then you can proceed

331
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:10,200
forward to go to their survey tool and

332
00:12:08,578 --> 00:12:12,958
actually submit the site if you have a

333
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:15,180
license but in terms of the race for

334
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:17,939
Real Estate in Manhattan

335
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:21,059
it's expensive I mean once again it

336
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:24,180
comes down to to money I mean you know

337
00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:27,059
you knock on somebody's door before you

338
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:29,099
buy a hot dog to stand across the street

339
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:32,518
and look and envision where you could be

340
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:34,500
you may need you know 200 000 to a

341
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:36,600
million dollars just for a security

342
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,159
deposit you know you're going to need a

343
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,360
high net worth individual to sign for

344
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:42,659
the real estate

345
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,339
and that is really the issue finding the

346
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:45,899
locations they're available they're

347
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:47,760
there

348
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:50,159
um the office issued a lot of licenses

349
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:51,299
from Manhattan so and the Manhattan has

350
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:54,719
a huge Market

351
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:57,838
so once again it comes down to finding

352
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,060
the right partners for your business or

353
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,980
just being an individual that is already

354
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:03,778
self-sufficient when it comes to the

355
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,759
Real Estate in Manhattan you've got to

356

be able to write a check if you can't

357
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:10,139
write a check whether it's your money or

358
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:12,600
someone else's money then

359
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:14,579

360
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,220
that that that's it you've got to secure

361

see them stabilize their situation our

380

Farmers need stores to sell to in order

381
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:06,799
to get back the investment and be able

382
