industry and how you got into the

18
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,320
cannabis sector

19
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,159
sure absolutely so i'll start with my

20
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,960
background i'm a finance person to the

21
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:43,199
bone

22
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,239
i've worked in various different

23
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,239
companies

24
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:48,238
uh in the financial industry here in the

25
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:50,000
us uh based out of new york

26
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:52,878
i've worked at firms like merrill lynch

27
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,799
morgan stanley i've done everything from

28
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:57,039
managing assets for high net worth

29
00:00:54,799 --> 00:01:00,159
individuals to managing risk

30
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:03,039
uh for uh for morgan stanley um and

31
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:04,798
and in that period um as i was doing my

32
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,760
corporate career i was also in parallel

33
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,920
investing in

34
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,799
startups uh and small and micro cap

35
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,600
companies

36
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,080
in certain uh sectors what i realized as

37
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:14,319
i was doing

38
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,840
that is there's a lot of value when you

39
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:17,758
have a specialty

40
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,280
uh and you have a deep dive into a

41
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,759
vertical and

42
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,439
uh what what started to happen was i

43
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,000
realized that cannabis

44
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:27,599
was all of those things with a

45
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,319
completely

46
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,039
new and nascent industry where it could

47
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:32,798
be shaped

48
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,640
and you know knowing the right people

49
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,880
and connecting with the right folks and

50
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,560
investing in the right companies could

51
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:39,438
literally make an impact on people's

52
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,240
daily lives

53
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,519
and as a as a personal purpose you know

54
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:45,519
i made sure that

55
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:47,599
everybody who joins bar capital knows

56
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:51,599
that our purpose is to

57
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:54,719
make cannabis as culturally accepted

58
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:56,559
and common as aspirin or alcohol or

59
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,399
paracetamol and alcohol i guess in this

60
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,879
case uh and uh

61
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,599
and so that purpose drives me every

62
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:03,438
morning

63
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:04,879
i get up early i go to bed late night i

64
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:08,799
talk to people in europe

65
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:10,239
u.s china mexico i am very much looked

66
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,280
into what's happening

67
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,039
behind the scenes in particular and um

68
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,719
and so that's how var capital has come

69
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:17,519
around and we have been doing outreach

70
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,000
to europe

71
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,560
and i'm very glad to meet folks like

72
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,120
yourself

73
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,479
and and your program uh because we think

74
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,319
it's a global industry

75
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,238
uh that's going to only get bigger and

76
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:31,518
bigger as the years come by

77
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,878
right now okay perfect that kind of

78
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,000
gives everybody a little overview i'm

79
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:35,359
going to jump straight into the first

80
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,199
topic and i think it's

81
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,400
i'd love to get somebody like you to be

82
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,518
able to maybe clear some of the muddy

83
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,360
water so far

84
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,959
in terms of the overview of the kermit

85
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,080
the current investment landscape of the

86
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,319
world you've got

87
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,519
north america let's say the us have

88
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:50,000
state by state

89
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,159
only investment you can't invest across

90
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,400
or have companies compete across states

91
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:56,239
the the canadian companies seem to have

92
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,800
burned through so much money now that

93
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,000
it's

94
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,000
almost a fool's errand and

95
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,759
buyer beware when it comes to a canadian

96
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,239
llp an investment

97
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:08,079
europe seems to be technically leading

98
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,878
towards the medical side first and

99
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,760
foremost

100
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:13,679
how are you looking at in terms of

101
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,878
investment strategies for bar capital do

102
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,879
you have a separate

103
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:18,560
uh strategy for europe that you do for

104
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:21,199
north america or do you see it all

105
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,120
assimilating into one industry over time

106
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:25,518
that's a great question you know there

107
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,080
this this industry is so fractured you

108
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,120
know

109
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,040
if you're in new jersey uh as a company

110
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,319
involved in cannabis or massachusetts

111
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:33,359
here in the united states or any of

112
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:35,119
these individual states

113
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,640
you might as well be in europe if you're

114
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,480
trying to interact with another company

115
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:41,439
right you can't cross the border

116
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:41,919
and so what that creates is um some

117
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:43,680
unique

118
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,280
investment opportunities that are

119
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,000
interstate plays or in you know

120
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,719
geographical

121
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,878
plays but what we focus on is the

122
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:54,158
scalable businesses and the brands

123
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:56,079
so we wrote a short white paper and a

124
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:57,759
year ago actually when covid was hitting

125
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,879
and the cannabis industry was in a lot

126
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:01,120
of trouble and you know

127
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:03,759
a lot of stocks have kind of crashed and

128
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,920
we had other issues from before that but

129
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:07,359
we wrote a paper called the bold shall

130
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:09,839
conquer cannabis

131
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,920
and what we argued for was that you you

132
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,878
want to focus on businesses that can

133
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:16,319
be effective in new jersey or ireland or

134
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:19,120
uk or wherever

135
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:19,759
and be able to scale at a very fast

136
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,800
level

137
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,360
and become a global presence and so that

138
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,240
involves a few key aspects number one is

139
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,080
you have to have the

140
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,918
right kind of management and the right

141
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,599
kind of uh vision

142
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:32,879
uh number two is you need connectivity

143
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,479
in relationships that's where bar

144
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:37,918
capital comes in you know we we do

145
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:39,199
help uh uh we invest in we advise and we

146
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:40,879
do help raise funding for

147
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,400
startups and and companies that are

148
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:45,040
growing in the cannabis space

149
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:46,719
but our consulting side and our

150
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,240
strategic advisory side

151
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,960
which is connected with players in the

152
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,160
in the uk as well and in europe as well

153
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:56,239
is all about supply chain and um and off

154
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,160
take agreements and connecting the right

155
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,639
kind of companies to each other

156
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,320
so that they can scale together and and

157
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,280
they can scale up into

158
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:06,639
uh geographies that uh you know they

159
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:08,478
haven't entered before

160
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,478
that's going to be pertinent in north

161
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:11,599
america especially in the u.s

162
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:13,918
it's going to be pertinent for

163
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,720
transatlantic um communications and

164
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:16,079
deals

165
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,000
uh and so we're we're really

166
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:18,719
differentiating ourselves on that front

167
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
because this

168
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,919
like i was saying before this is a

169
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,800
global story and people are not

170
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:24,478
understanding that

171
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,160
this is going to be ubiquitous in our

172
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:28,079
lives people are going to be taking

173
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,080
different cannabinoids uh different

174
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:32,959
formulations both for

175
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:34,879
medicinal purposes and for recreational

176
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:36,000
purposes and i'll give one quick example

177
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,399
you had a

178
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,918
relative who had surgery and was

179
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:42,239
prescribed opioids

180
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:43,279
and uh and i i suggested they get a

181
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,439
medicinal

182
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:46,959
uh cannabis license and use that instead

183
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:48,560
and then so they did they were able to

184
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:49,120
get that uh prior to the surgery they

185
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,519
used it

186
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,280
afterwards and potentially avoided an

187
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:54,478
addiction to opioids you know and then

188
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,719
that's the kind of

189
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:57,599
difference that's already been made in

190
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,520
in places where

191
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:04,080
it is legalized okay that's a

192
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:04,799
a very concise and informative piece to

193
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:06,639
that uh

194
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,639
question the next one is a pretty

195
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,560
straightforward question but a difficult

196
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,160
answer i'm sure how do you spot a good

197
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,959
investment opportunity in the cannabis

198
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,800
industry

199
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,239
bearing in mind that there are so many

200
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,840
rules and regulations in different

201
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,519
territories and

202
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,359
everything is so much different in every

203
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:21,758
different uh territory that you're going

204
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,280
to want

205
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,600
or what's the best way for you to spot

206
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:26,079
an investment that's a great question

207
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,479
you know

208
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:30,159
it's um spotting a great investment is

209
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:32,478
like finding your future

210
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,280
partner right it's uh there's a first

211
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:35,038
date

212
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:36,478
and depending on how that goes you might

213
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:39,680
get a second date but

214
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:42,478
you you start to get a sense right away

215
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,600
if there is a click and the click comes

216
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:46,719
with management

217
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,560
and and how passionate they are about

218
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,080
what they're doing and sometimes it's

219
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,680
easy to tell because

220
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:53,680
their lives have been changed you know

221
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,800
their child might have had epileptic

222
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,160
epileptic fits all day long uh prior and

223
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,079
all medication had been tried and

224
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,759
nothing had worked and then cannabis

225
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:03,120
came along and made a difference in that

226
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,160
executive's life

227
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,519
and was able to shape how they wanted to

228
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,520
participate in the space

229
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,279
that's one example now there's other key

230
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:13,758
things we look for in management

231
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:15,279
which is can they handle the hockey

232
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,120
stick moment

233
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:18,559
can they handle a pivot in the business

234
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,360
because they were trying to build

235
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,038
a big capex project and instead now the

236
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,439
the market has shifted and they should

237
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:26,879
instead focus on on their brand and

238
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,478
launching products

239
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,240
that uh make more sense in the current

240
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:32,800
market what you'll see and you mentioned

241
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,879
this earlier in the canadian story is

242
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,079
a lot of companies went public too soon

243
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:38,000
because that was the only way

244
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:39,359
for them to get funded they weren't able

245
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,038
to create brands because the canadian

246
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,479
government is overly involved

247
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:44,079
and therefore they're going to suffer

248
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:45,758
and they're going to be you know

249
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:47,199
there's going to we're kind of shorting

250
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,759
that market uh

251
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,400
and looking at managers that short that

252
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,319
market

253
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:54,079
the u.s story is just beginning i mean

254
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,639
the multi-state operators are

255
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:58,318
very very attractively valued even today

256
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,759
we think legislation is going to change

257
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,120
and really change the landscape

258
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,120
but going back to the company and

259
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,598
spotting investments you you have to do

260
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,439
a set of due diligence you know getting

261
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:08,240
to know the family part of the dating

262
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:10,478
scenario

263
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,000
analogy i was giving you uh you know

264
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:14,000
making sure the values line

265
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,439
up making sure you know all of those

266
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,560
things check out and their backgrounds

267
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:19,038
are solid

268
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,079
but also getting a real sense for do

269
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:22,399
these folks have

270
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:23,519
legitimate backgrounds uh early days in

271
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:24,719
cannabis

272
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:26,878
there was a lot of black market

273
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,879
participants that you know moved the the

274
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,479
cannabis space to what it is today and

275
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,399
and helped it get legalized in a number

276
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:35,439
of geographies but they weren't

277
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,799
management they weren't you know quality

278
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,479
operators in the space

279
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,478
but what's shifted now is veterans from

280
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,440
other industries have entered and so we

281
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,440
also look for

282
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,920
uh folks that you know utilize that

283
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,880
talent pool that's coming in from pharma

284
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:49,439
from finance from the uh legal world and

285
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:51,679
that's

286
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,120
that that kind of dream team situation

287
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:55,039
is what we look for where

288
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,560
the pieces are lined up the messaging

289
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,879
the vision the mission

290
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:01,039
is is being talked about by each of

291
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,799
those members of the executive team

292
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:04,879
and when that happens it's it's you know

293
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:05,679
it's a it's a magical moment and then we

294
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:07,439
usually

295
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:09,120
then proceed with with getting to know

296
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,040
the company even deeper and making an

297
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,278
investment

298
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:15,679
okay brilliant i think it's definitely a

299
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:17,439
very exciting time at the us for sure i

300
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:18,958
think you've got a couple of the brands

301
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,640
we all know that at some stage you're

302
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,679
going to have a burger king and a

303
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:23,439
coca-cola

304
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:25,278
come out of the cannabis industry and

305
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,560
it's who gets to those investments now

306
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:28,720
is such i think

307
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:30,159
a great place to be in as as a us

308
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,720
investor as you are

309
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:34,480
which of the brands in the us do you see

310
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,000
being some of the dominant ones we all

311
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,399
know about cookies and

312
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,839
we know about the bangs and kill cliffs

313
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,679
who do you see kind of

314
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,680
rising to the top of the market when it

315
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:46,159
comes to the us and then maybe being a

316
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:48,879
global brand within time

317
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:50,319
so there's two parts of that you know

318
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:52,639
one part is

319
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,080
um the u.s is often laid to the story

320
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:56,958
and then buys its way in

321
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,399
and then tries to become a leader so in

322
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:00,879
that interaction

323
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,759
uh between the different geographies

324
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:03,600
right now

325
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:05,519
europe has the medicinal program and

326
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,120
it's got great um you know r

327
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:11,919
d and i p and um other talent and other

328
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,200
uh valuable assets uh even on the

329
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:15,519
cultivation front

330
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,519
um so so the us is going to continue

331
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,000
looking to do that i know of several of

332
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,519
the people

333
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,200
you're mentioning and other big names

334
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,399
that are actively doing that and then we

335
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,399
all of course see

336
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,078
you know deals like the cure leaf emac

337
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,679
deal uh recently

338
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:29,838
so there's certainly folks that are well

339
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:31,838
capitalized and they're going out

340
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,920
and laying out the footprint that they

341
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:37,200
need to to continue scaling

342
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:38,078
their brands however it's such a nascent

343
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,160
market

344
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:42,078
new entrants that find the right

345
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:42,879
connections and find the right capital

346
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:45,599
flow

347
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:46,559
and really have that brand focus can do

348
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,759
very very well

349
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:51,359
so i can't predict uh coca-cola or or

350
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:52,639
the burger king of the of the space yet

351
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,079
um certainly i think

352
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:56,240
several of the people who are already

353
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:56,879
doing quite well are going to continue

354
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,480
to

355
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:01,519
but uh i wouldn't i wouldn't be

356
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,519
surprised if a european brand emerges or

357
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,480
an asian brand emerges eventually

358
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,240
as we uh mature more and can then start

359
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,680
you know capitalizing going public and

360
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,480
getting a lot of capital behind their

361
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:12,879
own growth

362
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,159
uh for for the next three to five years

363
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:16,958
i see it being a very

364
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:16,958
us-dominate

365
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:21,838
world in terms of the brand if you have

366
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:22,559
a focus on california and germany for

367
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,440
example

368
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:26,239
and now mexico you're in very good shape

369
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,079
so i think those

370
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,000
key geographies will continue to play a

371
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:33,278
big role in brand development

372
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,799
but it's anybody's game still

373
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:36,639
okay brilliant that kind of leads me on

374
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:37,838
to the last topic that i wanted to talk

375
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:39,278
about and you're saying

376
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,000
one of the european brands are going to

377
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:43,759
do it we're betting on that ireland

378
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,759
is going to be one of the countries that

379
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:47,120
delivers one of these global brands

380
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:49,200
and i'd like to maybe in this little

381
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,120
segment convince you as to why

382
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,200
ireland is going to be the european hub

383
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,679
for global cannabis companies

384
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,519
um i'm sure you'd agree that a lot of

385
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:58,799
the investment opportunities and the m

386
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,799
a's that are happening some of the

387
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:02,399
london stock exchange stuff is exciting

388
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:03,759
industry so

389
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,720
i think a lot of the north american

390
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:06,958
companies are definitely going to

391
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,200
position themselves for a european entry

392
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:11,599
at some stage would you agree

393
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,320
absolutely you know i have a a special

394
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,480
place in my

395
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,839
heart for ireland um i i was born in

396
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,360
india when i was eight

397
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,880
i actually moved to ireland my parents

398
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,639
are doctors and they they worked there

399
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:22,480
and i lived there for six years

400
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,079
uh and and you know i was educated

401
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,800
partly in ireland and then came to the

402
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:27,919
us

403
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:30,240
um and i can say you know given where

404
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:32,000
ireland has positioned itself the only

405
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,440
english-speaking member right now

406
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,240
of the eu being known for its tax

407
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,079
benefits to

408
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,360
large corporations that have already

409
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:41,919
from other industries

410
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,560
utilize it as such it's a natural

411
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:45,439
natural

412
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:46,159
landing pad for the larger companies for

413
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,360
innovation

414
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:52,958
around this area for brand creation for

415
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:56,079
interaction with between the u.s and

416
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:58,078
eu um so i'm very excited i you know i

417
00:12:56,078 --> 00:13:01,120
plan on making a business trip out there

418
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:03,199
and really getting a detailed sense of

419
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,799
of what the opportunities are but i

420
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,399
think you've already got a brand in that

421
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:08,078
space ireland already has a brand in

422
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,200
that space and so it's all about how do

423
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:11,519
you convert that

424
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,560
and how do you convince the regulators

425
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,639
to open up

426
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:15,599
more business around the cannabis space

427
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,600
and that by the way

428
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,600
is just a snowball effect happening

429
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,680
right now if you look at the us

430
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,879
and and you have any kind of doubt about

431
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:24,799
legalization in the u.s

432
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:27,120
just think of the fact that canada and

433
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:28,799
mexico are going to be legal federally

434
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,278
and the u.s is going to be sitting there

435
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:34,240
missing out on tax revenue dollars

436
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:35,360
in post covid everybody wants to address

437
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,039
deficits and

438
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,959
any kind of new source of revenue

439
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:40,799
generation is golden

440
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:42,319
so i i always you know people in the

441
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:42,799
industry complain that we get taxed too

442
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,240
much

443
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:45,519
i think it's a beautiful thing to get

444
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,639
taxed too much right now because

445
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,959
eventually

446
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,720
the as a lobbying continues as we go

447
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:52,159
towards legalization and beyond

448
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,839
everybody's then going to start looking

449
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:55,600
at tax efficiency and

450
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,279
ireland's going to be very much at the

451
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,879
nexus of that

452
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:00,159
yeah i couldn't agree with you more i

453
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,078
think there's going to be a lot of this

454
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:02,719
services will be based in ireland a lot

455
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:06,159
of the

456
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,360
kind of b2b business operations will be

457
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:09,039
based in ireland

458
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,120
granted there might be genetics in north

459
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:12,639
america but i'd still think it'll make

460
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,480
sense over time to have

461
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,000
greenhouses set up in ireland extraction

462
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,159
facility set up in ireland

463
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,480
logistic companies set up in ireland so

464
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:22,958
i think it's exciting future ahead for

465
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,879
ireland and north america and europe in

466
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:26,239
the next five to ten years and

467
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:27,600
hopefully we get to chat about this

468
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,079
again in the next few months and we've

469
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,159
got things to progress about

470
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:33,120
absolutely i hope your regulators in

471
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:34,958
ireland are watching

472
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,039
and they make a move in the right

473
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:40,078
direction and uh you know part of bar

474
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:40,639
capitals uh work is to promote and and

475
