opinion on the new york state as opposed

16
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:34,960
to just new york city can you maybe give

17
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:36,640
everybody a quick little overview of how

18
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,878
you got into the cannabis insider from

19
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,399
the industry that you're in

20
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:42,399
sure yeah i was an investigative

21
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,920
reporter and editor in san diego

22
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,679
california for the last 10 years and

23
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,079
relocated to new york

24
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:50,079
last year with my family to be closer to

25
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,039
the rest of my family and was looking

26
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,878
for

27
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,039
some kind of a position that would allow

28
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:57,519
me to dig deep into something really

29
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,160
interesting and boom cannabis is right

30
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,199
there waiting for me uh just timing was

31
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:05,359
perfect and we launched uh late last

32
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:06,560
year and hired our first reporter late

33
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:08,400
last year and started actually

34
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,240
publishing in february of this year so

35
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,400
just a few months and it's been going

36
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:14,478
really really well um this is a very

37
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,320
undercovered industry i think a lot of

38
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:17,759
major publications still aren't taking

39
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:20,639
it seriously yet which is very

40
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,640
surprising but also good news for us uh

41
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,879
but it's it's just a fascinating journey

42
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,200
so far and really fun to watch as this

43
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:28,560
market develops from the ground up

44
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,000
yeah i think new york is probably one of

45
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,478
the most interesting territories with

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,478
the amount of a capital that's available

47
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:36,239
to businesses that are over there that

48
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:37,679
it is surprising to see that none of the

49
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:39,199
big publications have been doing this

50
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,520
properly and the caliber you guys are

51
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,759
writing at is a is a

52
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:45,200
testimony to the challenge you guys have

53
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,439
i've got to jump into basically the

54
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,719
first topic and it's new york state

55
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:50,239
overview now we've already had a couple

56
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:51,920
of guests on to talk about new york city

57
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:54,399
and the five boroughs and whatnot but

58
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,879
from buffalo to rochester to the five

59
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,439
boroughs where do you see the

60
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:01,438
concentration of cultivation happening

61
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:03,519
in new york state

62
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:05,359
well yeah it's interesting because when

63
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:07,438
when people talk about this market they

64
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,199
only so far i really hear discussions

65
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,280
about retail and about cultivation

66
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,958
retail everyone seems to want to be in

67
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,439
new york city cultivation is happening

68
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,959
upstate that's where the vast expanses

69
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:18,639
of land are where the farms are where

70
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,239
the farmers already are where they've

71
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,359
been growing hemp for the last several

72
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,599
years

73
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,879
now can turn those into thc growing

74
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:26,878
farms

75
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,318
but from you know from western new york

76
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:29,840
i'm in central new york right now

77
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:31,518
syracuse area

78
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,120
if you go directly west from here you

79
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,200
hit buffalo right by the border you go

80
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,120
directly east you hit albany

81
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:39,280
all of all of those cities buffalo

82
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,159
rochester syracuse albany are all

83
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,919
prepping um for this market in in

84
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:45,598
different ways

85
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:47,280
you see some people yes looking for

86
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:48,639
retail locations but others really

87
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,479
looking to get their hand in the

88
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,079
cultivation the processing there's a lot

89
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:53,919
of talk about distribution up here and

90
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,040
how that's actually going to happen and

91
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:59,280
play out because this is a huge state

92
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,639
when people talk about new york new york

93
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,640
they usually think of new york city and

94
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,919
they don't think wow the rest of this

95
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,199
that goes all the way up to the canadian

96
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:07,598
border all the way west to the great

97
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:09,199
lakes there's a lot of land to cover so

98
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:10,399
um there's that's going to be an

99
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:13,359
interesting market to watch and how that

100
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,560
develops up here particularly uh but

101
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,560
yeah other than that i mean a lot of

102
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,640
politicians there's a politician a

103
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,400
senator in rochester who's been for uh

104
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:22,318
on the forefront of introducing new

105
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,200
legislation around the business

106
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:28,079
marketplace of cannabis um

107
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:30,158
and a lot of local politicians at least

108
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,080
uh here in syracuse who are still

109
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:34,399
navigating the waters of like how their

110
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,400
community feels toward this topic and

111
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,120
and whether they want to institute

112
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,519
zoning um you know laws to

113
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,799
keep these things separated so it's it's

114
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,959
playing out in a bunch of different ways

115
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,319
up here but it's all all interesting

116
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,400
amazing so we kind of know where the

117
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:50,719
cultivation retails happening in terms

118
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,879
of the extraction facilities and the lab

119
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:55,280
testing and then uh

120
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:57,598
the the manufacturing side of things are

121
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,719
these gonna be basically in cities that

122
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:00,158
are already open wondering what

123
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:01,519
manufacturing these facilities are

124
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:03,759
you're starting to see

125
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,200
new facilities being dropped up in

126
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,719
certain locations around the state

127
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:08,158
because obviously everybody can't be

128
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:09,199
setting up a facility around new york

129
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:11,919
there's only going to be so much

130
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:13,359
business that uh to go around

131
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,438
yeah so

132
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,560
right now i'm not an expert on this yet

133
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:18,238
because there hasn't been a lot of talk

134
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,160
of it i know for the lab side of things

135
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,000
there's only two labs in the entire

136
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,240
state of new york there's one relatively

137
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,079
new one i think down in

138
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,360
in the hudson valley

139
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:29,359
and i honestly don't know where the

140
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,240
other one is but that's that's all there

141
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,160
is um there is some talk of people

142
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,918
starting new labs but again everyone's

143
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,759
hesitant because the regulations aren't

144
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,120
out they have no idea

145
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,360
what this is going to look like so to

146
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,199
invest that amount of money uh a lot of

147
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,199
people are hesitant to do that uh

148
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,879
processing same thing there's been

149
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,240
some really interesting partnerships

150
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:51,199
especially with

151
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,160
private businesses and native american

152
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,600
nations

153
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,840
there's been some joint partnerships in

154
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,360
developing cultivation and processing

155
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:58,959
facilities uh in a couple parts of the

156
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,840
state which is really interesting to see

157
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:02,159
but

158
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:04,560
um no i i don't have any more info on

159
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,880
that because again the regs aren't even

160
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,319
aren't even out in draft form for those

161
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:10,879
so in terms of the regulations the

162
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:12,560
logistics laws shall we say haven't even

163
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:13,839
been drafted and put out to be because i

164
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,160
can imagine that's going to be one of

165
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:18,319
the areas of contention and

166
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,800
profitability with the size of new york

167
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:23,279
that uh having flower distributed at a

168
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,960
premium quality across the state is

169
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,038
going to be of a permanent importance

170
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:29,599
and keeping it safe from theft

171
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:32,560
yeah yeah exactly and it's it's a huge

172
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,160
missing piece of this puzzle and the

173
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,759
office of cannabis management and the

174
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,160
cannabis control board has said

175
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,120
repeatedly as as recently as just a

176
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:44,800
couple weekends ago that they expect

177
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:47,439
uh product on the shelves by this fall

178
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,879
and that's that's just you know uh four

179
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:51,120
months away falls in september that's

180
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:54,159
not that long and there's this huge

181
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,800
element of you got retail regulations

182
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,479
out you have conditional cultivation

183
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,639
regulations out but what about

184
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:02,800
everything in between and how does it

185
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,120
get from the cultivation facility to the

186
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,319
retail stores like if in new york if

187
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,879
you're transporting or you have more

188
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,560
than three ounces it's still illegal in

189
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:11,600
this state so

190
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,519
how are you going to transport that

191
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,199
stuff from the facility to the retail

192
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:16,639
shop if you don't have distributors

193
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,478
licensed or you don't have regulations

194
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,720
around it there's a lot of things that

195
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,599
are missing and a lot of people are

196
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,400
very

197
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,240
concerned for the timeline uh when this

198
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:28,000
stuff actually happens

199
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,519
yeah i seem to think that that's one of

200
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,038
the big huge things that everybody has

201
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:32,959
been missing so far it's okay to grow

202
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:36,478
and it's okay to sell it but getting it

203
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,758
from a to b hasn't really been foreign

204
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:39,439
as much yet

205
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,360
yeah yep

206
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:43,199
i've got to jump onto the next topic and

207
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,038
it's fifth avenue stores so i was over

208
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,280
new york last weekend as you know

209
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:49,439
yourself and while we were over there we

210
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:51,918
were seeing a lot of uh

211
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:54,000
mobile dispensaries around the place and

212
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:55,359
they were looked like these so these

213
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,639
were only pretty much on fifth and

214
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,038
seventh avenue it was in kind of the

215
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,680
touristy areas but they were selling thc

216
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:04,478
flower edibles vape cartridges all of

217
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,160
the cbd stores pretty much had the thc

218
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:09,038
stuff there already so

219
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,360
do you see these kind of places being

220
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:15,439
the future of purchases in new york or

221
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,360
do you see a fifth avenue apple sized

222
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:18,478
cannabis dispensaries happening over in

223
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,199
the city

224
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:22,800
that's a really really good question and

225
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,038
like you i was just in the city last

226
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,720
weekend and same experience walked into

227
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:28,240
a cbd store and just for fun said what

228
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,400
do you have by the way weed and you just

229
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,400
laid everything out all from california

230
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:33,519
no problems um

231
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:37,198
it's

232
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:39,279
i don't know i mean i'm not a uh

233
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,800
i'm not an expert in consumer behavior

234
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:42,318
in the state of new york or city of new

235
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,800
york i don't know what people are going

236
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,919
to value so the ocm and the ccb think

237
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,520
that

238
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:51,359
that the regulated market is going to

239
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:53,359
contain safe tested verifiable product

240
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,360
that people can trust and it's okay to

241
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,520
pay more it's okay to pay a premium for

242
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,520
that but there's got to be a level right

243
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:02,318
where people are saying if i can get an

244
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:04,639
eighth of california flower off this guy

245
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:07,280
on the street for 20 bucks and i but i

246
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,800
have to spend 75 at a retail location

247
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,918
there's going to be something a give and

248
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,400
take there where people just aren't

249
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:14,240
willing to go above and beyond um i

250
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:15,359
think that for the time being those gray

251
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,519
market

252
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,520
sellers and retailers are

253
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:21,439
going to dominate the new york city

254
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:23,198
landscape and the market i also think

255
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:24,800
it's you know it's going to be a while

256
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,120
before those fifth avenue stores and

257
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,840
retail chains are up and running they're

258
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,598
the the first round of retail licenses

259
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:34,240
in the state of new york are going to be

260
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:36,399
given to justice involved applicants and

261
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,959
the actual retail stores where they're

262
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:41,278
going to be selling from are already

263
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:43,918
predetermined and these are built out

264
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:45,360
using uh state and private equity funds

265
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:47,439
the 200 million dollar fund that the

266
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,120
governor has said she set aside for this

267
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,000
particular reason

268
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,759
so

269
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,200
i i highly doubt those stores are going

270
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:56,399
to be built to the caliber of like an

271
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,560
apple um or a saks fifth avenue and it's

272
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,159
going to be well after those stores are

273
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,239
established and have a foothold that i

274
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,399
think the ocm is going to now then allow

275
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,080
the big boys to come in the people with

276
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,480
the well-heeled interest the big pockets

277
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,240
to establish those that kind of presence

278
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,080
it may be i mean i would not be

279
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,879
surprised if it were two years from now

280
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,080
before those stories even opened um

281
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:18,799
so

282
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,040
i i think the next next year to two

283
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:23,759
years is really going to determine

284
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:25,199
what users uh get accustomed to what

285
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:27,439
they're willing to pay for the

286
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,959
experience that they are going for in

287
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,120
new york city um to to kind of habituate

288
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,479
themselves to like what what they're

289
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,480
after what they want to see in the new

290
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,159
york city retail market um and i think

291
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,600
that those people with the trucks and

292
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:42,319
the people with already with the cbd

293
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,560
stores definitely have a strong foothold

294
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,839
for the time being um

295
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:48,159
yeah

296
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,680
yeah no i think i i couldn't agree with

297
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:51,679
you more i think for the next few years

298
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:53,199
they've got a little pot of gold that's

299
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:55,359
going to be made there before the real

300
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,519
capital comes into the market and puts

301
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,959
the real legality in the laws up against

302
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,240
these stores and either shuts them down

303
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,719
or stops them selling the product that

304
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,159
they're going to make monetization from

305
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,920
one of the things you guys have a

306
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,159
conference on may the 20th if i'm not

307
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:09,838
mistaken as well anybody who's watching

308
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,000
this who's in new york at higher end

309
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,800
checking it out the website for a

310
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,120
cannabis insider is just below it's uh

311
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:18,399
i'm sure going to be a great event next

312
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,399
topic that i want to talk to you about

313
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,679
before we go is the current landscape

314
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,519
one of the things i was actually reading

315
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:25,838
about from yours on your site was the

316
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,000
acreage holdings court case

317
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,839
so in terms of the current landscape do

318
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,360
you see the big boys being able to get

319
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,160
away with a a

320
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,919
oligopoly over there or do you see that

321
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:38,480
that air court case is going to go in

322
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:41,039
favor of the the smaller

323
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,039
defendants

324
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,399
that case in particular i wouldn't feel

325
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:48,399
confident weighing in on it all i mean

326
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,039
you got it is it david versus goliath it

327
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,879
is a really interesting case to see um

328
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:54,799
to see how it plays out

329
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:56,639
but again you got acreage which is got

330
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:58,639
very deep pockets and i'm sure a team of

331
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,319
attorneys going up against a much

332
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:03,199
smaller plaintiff who's bringing these

333
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,480
charges so i i honestly i wouldn't feel

334
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,600
comfortable weighing in on that well

335
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,680
that's not a problem we'll jump on to

336
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,200
the next one so some of the job reports

337
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:11,039
and the job statistics that i was

338
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,680
looking at reading about is that within

339
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:16,719
the next five years new york looked at

340
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:19,120
50 000 jobs to the industry is that the

341
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,079
new york state as a whole or uh new york

342
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,639
city yeah no it's a state as well

343
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:26,399
are they solid numbers based on other

344
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:29,120
relative industries in the state like

345
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,639
alcohol or tobacco or anything like that

346
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,799
yeah and that's a really good question

347
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:34,879
because when we first saw those numbers

348
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:37,359
um i was

349
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:39,360
skeptical um and so had our reporter

350
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,278
sean teahan look into it and say hey can

351
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,320
you actually verify that this is real

352
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:43,600
that these they're not just pulling

353
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,278
these numbers out of nowhere and he did

354
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,879
a story on it uh just a few weeks ago

355
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:48,799
maybe a month ago where he talked to a

356
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:50,559
bunch of experts who said actually you

357
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:52,319
know what yeah these are legitimate

358
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:54,958
numbers and legitimate forecasts that we

359
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,639
can uh that we can kind of lean into and

360
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,078
i think it is it is based on other

361
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,159
states but they have seen play out over

362
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:01,919
time similar industries

363
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:04,480
um also the

364
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:07,120
the unionization kind of mandate that

365
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,360
all of these licensees um have some kind

366
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,320
of lay project labor agreement with um

367
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,240
with unions and unions are very strong

368
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,079
in new york and the entire northeast so

369
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,320
that's a a huge

370
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:19,838
job pool or applicant pool from which

371
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,440
they're going to be drawing from

372
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,200
and a lot of people a lot of people on

373
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,839
labor so i think

374
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,000
i think that those numbers are

375
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,160
at least legit if not being slightly

376
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,600
conservative um because there's as you

377
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:32,799
know there's so many ancillary

378
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,159
businesses and companies that are going

379
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:35,838
to spring up around there's some that

380
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:38,000
we've never even thought of things that

381
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,519
you just are outside the realm right now

382
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,559
that will make a lot of sense in a few

383
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,879
years

384
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:44,159
yeah i agree i think uh there's things

385
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,000
coming around the corner that people

386
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:47,199
can't see as of yet that might have

387
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,958
turned some of these parts of this

388
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,320
industry on its head we're coming up to

389
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:51,919
