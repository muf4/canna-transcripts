talk to us

14
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:32,399
do you want to basically give everybody

15
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:33,920
a little overview of how you got into

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,840
the industry and where you're at now

17
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,359
with these four cultivars

18
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,800
sure yeah so i got into

19
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:44,399
cannabis by accident i had enjoyed it

20
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:47,679
for years

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:51,280
but working in the industry is

22
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:52,640
new to most of us um really you know

23
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,920
just a few years old

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,679
in the legal states in the us and uh

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,440
and for canadians you know their whole

26
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:02,159
country but i just

27
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:03,599
chanced into um helping out some growers

28
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:07,118
locally who

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,640
needed uh licensing when we got our

30
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:10,879
you know our laws passed and they

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,000
changed we had a medical cannabis system

32
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:13,599
and then they were

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,239
moving everyone into the adult use

34
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:19,199
system and so

35
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:20,319
i just kind of got in in by accident and

36
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,079
then i found that

37
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:24,959
you know this is something i believe in

38
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:27,599
it's really meaningful work

39
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,640
and just kind of went from there

40
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,839
everything

41
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,400
you know sped up and got more involved

42
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,640
and

43
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,920
became more um public with my

44
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,320
involvement so

45
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,680
here we are brilliant excellent well

46
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:41,118
i'll kick things off with the first

47
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,360
topic which is

48
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:45,200
we both know that education is the tip

49
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:46,560
of the spear in the industry and

50
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,159
those people who are working in the

51
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,040
education sphere this are the ones

52
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,680
actually

53
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,880
moving the industry forward so can you

54
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,000
give everybody a little bit of

55
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,239
background for you

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,239
and your cbd certified the free

57
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:01,039
educational cbd program for the sensory

58
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:04,319
stuff that you guys do

59
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:07,360
definitely so with

60
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:09,359
with cannabis there's a lot of

61
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,360
myths that are passed around you know

62
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,560
whether on the internet or

63
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,040
word of mouth and a lot of personal

64
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,360
opinions that get mixed in there and so

65
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:20,239
we really wanted to offer as part of our

66
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,040
mission

67
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,560
a science-based education program that

68
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,479
would give people

69
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,560
a little bit firmer footing to kind of

70
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:31,598
base their their decisions

71
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,680
on about their health choices and so

72
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:35,439
we focused on cbd specifically because

73
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,200
that is what east fork

74
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,039
is known for you know we've always bred

75
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,759
for cbd rich

76
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:43,199
varieties whether that was in our adult

77
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:44,878
use cannabis side or

78
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,199
you know then later we we have a craft

79
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:50,159
hemp side of the farm as well

80
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:52,000
but um you know it's it's no good to

81
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,000
have access to all these products if you

82
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,639
don't know how to use them properly

83
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,840
and you don't understand why they work

84
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,238
how they work

85
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,640
you know to the best extent that we do

86
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,439
understand those things scientifically

87
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:07,518
right because there's a lot still to be

88
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:08,800
learned in cannabis science

89
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,560
but you know basically we really just

90
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,360
wanted to create this resource and make

91
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,360
it free

92
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,440
so that people could understand what cbd

93
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,640
is how it works with the rest of the

94
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:18,000
cannabis plant

95
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:20,238
and how those things are interacting

96
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,400
with our bodies

97
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,719
yeah no i think you'd agree there seemed

98
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,080
to be the first wave of cannabis was all

99
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:27,519
the people with loads of cash who were

100
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,760
invested in things you didn't really

101
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,920
care about learning too much about it

102
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,359
and you were kind of getting told four

103
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:35,359
stories of

104
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,799
one actual product from four different

105
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,159
people that's one of the reasons started

106
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,439
this is so i could get the answers

107
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:41,280
myself from

108
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:43,359
the leading experts around the world and

109
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,158
it's actually being highly informative

110
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,360
and being able to

111
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:46,878
cut through the [Â __Â ] and get

112
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,440
straight to the actual real honest

113
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:51,359
answers of things

114
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:52,799
it's so important because these are you

115
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,280
know people are using

116
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,159
this plant for medicine and whether

117
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,360
that's for

118
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:02,639
more serious conditions like epilepsy or

119
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,360
for things like ms and cancer or or even

120
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:06,238
just

121
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,480
the more common everyday ailments that

122
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,759
everyone deals with you know anxiety

123
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:13,359
inflammation pain insomnia those kinds

124
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,280
of things

125
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,680
yeah now on time there's a lot a lot

126
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,680
more research coming out on those

127
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,519
what seem to be small little ailments

128
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,879
but that are affecting such a huge

129
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,399
population that uh

130
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:26,079
we don't need to think along the lines

131
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:28,399
of the miracle drug it does enough good

132
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:30,319
things for a small couple of causes and

133
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:31,439
maybe focus on that and get more or

134
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:34,399
indeed on those

135
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:35,918
uh areas i'm going to move on to the

136
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,439
second topic which is

137
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,359
i couldn't help noticing what i was

138
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:40,879
looking to use for cultivars that every

139
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,160
single person there seems to be a very

140
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:44,319
happy individual

141
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,960
and uh enjoying their life can you give

142
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:46,959
us little people

143
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:52,000
a little bit of background that uh would

144
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,199
you agree that happy people grow happy

145
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,079
plants and is there

146
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,560
is there something to my madness there i

147
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:59,758
agree

148
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,600
absolutely i think there's a lot of

149
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,960
energy that passes between people and

150
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,160
plants you know anyone who's ever had

151
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:07,918
house plants

152
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:10,080
and cared for them you know that

153
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:11,839
you know they respond to their

154
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,800
environments and that's not just

155
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:15,918
sunlight and water or fertilizer but

156
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,918
it's also

157
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:21,519
music or um some of the other energy

158
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:23,599
and i think that's one of the things

159
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:26,959
that um

160
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,439
we as humans have maybe lost some of the

161
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:31,680
knowledge we used to have about

162
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:33,120
uh communicating with plants if i can

163
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,680
say it that way you know

164
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,759
um there's definitely living things we

165
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,400
have we have energy in us that passes

166
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:43,600
between us in all these different ways

167
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:45,918
and so i think that

168
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,800
you know emotions can definitely be part

169
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:48,719
of

170
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,000
um what you're feeding and nourishing

171
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,960
the plants with

172
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,360
you know and on our farm we do a lot of

173
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:56,799
the

174
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,560
um really regenerative methods for

175
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,240
for caring for the plants like we make

176
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,560
compost teas on site

177
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,918
that we use and we do um korean natural

178
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,399
farming where we ferment the

179
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:08,000
positive you know beneficial bacteria

180
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:11,120
and have those in the soil

181
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,959
um helping to keep the plants happy but

182
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,120
you know i think that caring for the

183
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,959
plants and appreciating them

184
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,840
and and loving them does make a

185
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:21,120
difference too

186
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:23,599
yeah no well i originally have a career

187
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,519
in music as a ranger for orchestras

188
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,439
and decades ago so i understand the

189
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,038
vibrations of everything and

190
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:30,160
it's one of the things that i think you

191
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:31,519
could actually do a little bit of

192
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,720
research and play a different couple of

193
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:34,879
styles of music and

194
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,360
maybe sell a couple of playlists to the

195
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:39,439
cultivars around the world

196
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,439
you should do that yeah because they're

197
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:44,079
all vibrations and you can already deal

198
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:45,839
with a baby being born in the womb that

199
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:47,199
they listen to a song when they're born

200
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,038
and when they listen to what they're

201
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,960
born they stop crying because

202
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:53,199
the vibrations put them back in the womb

203
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:55,519
mentality so they go quiet

204
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,319
that's so cool you should create that

205
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:58,799
playlist

206
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,000
i i would listen to it yeah i might just

207
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,160
have to do that

208
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,240
let me move on to the next topic which

209
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,160
is i'm sure a big one for everybody kind

210
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,680
of understands the stigma behind thc

211
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,759
does this date back to

212
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,038
harry j ainslie or back of the 30s with

213
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,280
his campaign is it

214
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:16,719
the 60s campaign or is it reagan in the

215
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:16,719
80s where's the where's the

216
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,879
it's all of those things you know but

217
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,240
really yeah anslinger back in the 30s

218
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,639
was

219
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,840
the big that was the big push you know

220
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,879
to really

221
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:31,598
um demonize criminalize and um and then

222
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:33,839
create prop

223
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:35,199
propaganda against the cannabis plant

224
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:38,399
before that you could buy it

225
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,240
tinctures in in pharmacies in the u.s

226
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:41,439
you know with cannabis tinctures and it

227
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,439
was commonly used

228
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:45,680
but that's when of course they created

229
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:47,038
or publicized using the word marijuana

230
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,160
they wanted to link

231
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:53,279
you know um the plant to

232
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,879
uh mexican uh people in the

233
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:58,318
southwest of the us who of course they

234
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:00,400
were painting as unsavory

235
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,360
yeah right and black people right just

236
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:05,359
just racist

237
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,840
um but you know even more than that the

238
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,319
us

239
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:09,918
is responsible for pushing that that

240
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,039
stigma and propaganda on the rest of the

241
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:13,439
world through our drug

242
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:14,800
treaties you know and that's the kind of

243
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:18,079
thing that we're starting to see

244
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,038
slowly getting undone um i love to see

245
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:22,240
canada

246
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:24,000
and uruguay you know legally federally

247
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,439
legalize cannabis

248
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,959
um it's you know

249
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:31,279
we're going to see more and more of that

250
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:32,478
and it's just such a shame that the us

251
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:35,278
has pushed that because it's

252
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,639
unscientific and thc is medically

253
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:38,080
beneficial for

254
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:40,080
numerous different conditions and we're

255
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,120
going to only be discovering

256
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,959
more of them as we are able to do more

257
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,560
research as these legal barriers start

258
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:49,039
to fall away

259
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:50,879
okay you actually as an education expert

260
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:51,278
might be able to help me ainslinger was

261
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:53,679
he

262
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:54,879
pushing the marijuana thing because they

263
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:56,639
owned

264
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:58,559
cotton farms and that hemp was going to

265
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:00,879
be replacing one of the fibers that they

266
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,799
were using or is they get that just

267
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:05,200
another addition to an article that's

268
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:07,439
chinese whispers over time

269
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,519
well you know there are a lot of those

270
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,080
uh different factors

271
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,679
i think you know it's hard to i don't

272
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,080
have particular knowledge about the

273
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:18,319
fiber side of things although

274
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,920
people do like to talk about those

275
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,200
industrial motivations

276
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:26,079
but we do know with anslinger there were

277
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,000
he had um you know he he saw it was

278
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,040
politically useful to demonize certain

279
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,919
groups

280
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:32,480
um but also he had personal animosity

281
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:34,799
towards

282
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,680
um you know racial animosity towards

283
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:38,319
other groups so

284
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:39,599
just some of the quotes that that are

285
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,640
set down historically

286
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:46,560
um make that really clear so it's just

287
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:49,679
you know a really a confluence of really

288
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:52,639
sad factors between you know

289
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:53,439
personal racism and then political

290
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:57,600
influence

291
00:09:53,440 --> 00:10:00,399
and um potentially you know industrial

292
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,519
gains or benefits an all-round [Â __Â ] i

293
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,120
can think we could just tag them

294
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,799
and as me this let's get on to something

295
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,200
happy how about some of the

296
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:10,719
brands that you're noticing understand

297
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,000
that it's still state by state over

298
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,519
there and you haven't had the kind of

299
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,879
cross competition in the murders and

300
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,560
emerges and acquisitions that will

301
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:18,559
happen over time but

302
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:20,000
is there any like cookies we've heard

303
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:21,679
about over here in europe

304
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,039
are there any big brands that you can

305
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:26,078
see that are making uh

306
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:29,679
good gains in any day infused beverages

307
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:33,199
edibles or the home grown flower

308
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:36,078
not the homegrown flower the here right

309
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,920
well you know as you pointed out um our

310
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:38,319
markets are all segregated state by

311
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:40,879
state

312
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,320
and it's illegal even if two states are

313
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:43,120
legal and they border each other you

314
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,360
still can't

315
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,440
import export from one to another so

316
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,399
that creates a situation where brands

317
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,519
are either

318
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:54,480
landlocked with their own state or

319
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,320
um they have to set up identical

320
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,839
separate companies to keep the same

321
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,600
brand in different states

322
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:05,040
so we do see some they call them msos

323
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,480
multi-state operators um and bigger

324
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,439
corporations that are building their

325
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,600
brands

326
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,959
personally i've been more impressed by

327
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,120
some of the

328
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:14,159
the smaller craft companies that have

329
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,440
grown

330
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:18,799
um and built themselves into having a

331
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,079
national

332
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:25,599
uh audience or or recognition

333
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:28,958
um but you know we do see some like um

334
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:32,000
canna craft in california and

335
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:33,518
um you know i i guess

336
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,039
i there's not too many i really want to

337
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,759
shout out because honestly i'm not that

338
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,919
impressed

339
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:39,360
with a lot of the bigger ones i really

340
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:40,799
think the small you know the smaller

341
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,320
companies where they are

342
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:44,240
people who've been doing this for a long

343
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,320
time before it was legal

344
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,320
and they have the deep knowledge of the

345
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,480
plant um in the products

346
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,160

um which is you know has become national

351
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,440
on the cbd side but

352
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,399
uh yeah there's going to be a lot of

353
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,760
shake-ups as

354
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,159
our laws continue changing and evolving

355
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:12,078

and it's trying to keep your finger on

359
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,240
the pulses like trying to hold the hot

360
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:19,600

agriculture is always uh you know

367
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,320
inherently risky because you never know

368
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:35,759
what's coming around the corner for the

369
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,920
