quick overview on

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,280
your background you've had a lot of

19
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:48,558
success in business so far to date what

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:51,679
drove what drew you into creo

21
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:53,839
yeah so um you know i've been in tech

22
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:56,479
all my life owen and

23
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,480
as i was looking at the next chapter of

24
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,799
my life i wanted to do something

25
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:02,398
completely different after having worked

26
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:04,719
for a series of

27
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,200
large companies in the tech space you

28
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:08,798
know i was looking for something that

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,040
um you know was

30
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,920
really creating something from scratch

31
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,080
and in a new industry where there was

32
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,640
true innovation disruption i was looking

33
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:21,039
at the opportunity of building uh

34
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,439
something that is purpose driven that i

35
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,880
feel could really help the planet help

36
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:30,319
humanity and in creo i kind of found

37
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:32,560
this opportunity it's a new industry um

38
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:35,438
it's in biotech something i had never

39
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:39,118
done um the technology is truly uh

40
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:42,719
disruptive and i feel the benefits of um

41
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:46,478
you know of uh this technology can help

42
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:48,640
um every household in the future

43
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:50,239
so that's why i joined it

44
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,759
no it is it's a very exciting new

45
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:53,359
industry and if you actually look at her

46
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,879
from a global kind of perspective and

47
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:57,359
take the cannabis flower out of the

48
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:59,359
whole game the new ingredient is going

49
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:00,799
to be the kind of huge component of this

50
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:02,879
factor and that's where the capital

51
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,960
markets will put their money because

52
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:07,199
politicians will back it and science

53
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:09,519
will be able to prove that it works so

54
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,759
can you maybe give everybody a little

55
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,120
overview of the new ingredient do you

56
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,759
see this being

57
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,599
a a multi

58
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,120
discipline disruptor do you see it going

59
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:21,119
across makeup and beauty health and

60
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,280
wellness food and beverage is it going

61
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,039
to have that much of a big reach

62
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,520
yes um i think that the beauty of you

63
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:31,598
know cbg and many of these other

64
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,319
ingredients especially cbg which is the

65
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:36,959
mother cannabinoid is the

66
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:39,598
extreme versatility in terms of the

67
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:43,519
benefits and the applications so primary

68
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:46,878
research indicates that um you know cbg

69
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,480
has lots of uh benefits not only in

70
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:51,598
terms of you know

71
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:55,199
skin care and it's already you know

72
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:56,318
called the skin cannabinoid but also um

73
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,518
you know

74
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:01,280
other industries like you know um health

75
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,158
and wellness you know giving you a

76
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,280
calming experience helping you with in

77
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:09,280
in foods and beverages and nutrition in

78
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,878
um you know pet food

79
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,360
or pet treats applications so um i think

80
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:18,560
because of the properties of this

81
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,760
ingredient um you know which are related

82
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,799
to either anti-inflammation or and you

83
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:27,759
know the rich moisturizing capabilities

84
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:30,080
the oxidation properties and many other

85
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:32,000
things that we are discovering every day

86
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,560
literally as more and more research is

87
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,080
coming in it's going to be here to stay

88
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,519
for the next

89
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,519
you know whatever you can predict the

90
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,840
next decade

91
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,560
yeah and i think we i've already talked

92
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,319
to ilan sobel who's the ceo of

93
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,400
bioharvest over in israel and they

94
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:51,679
managed to create glandular trichomes

95
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,680
from a bioreactor which is a a first for

96
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,640
the market and again another potential

97
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:59,200
ingredient you guys have a couple of iep

98
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:01,679
processes through the process of yeast

99
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:04,000
and i've also researched this algae and

100
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,080
a couple of others do you think the ip

101
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
process has been saturated so far in

102
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,560
this industry or is there still so much

103
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,400
room for growth that you see

104
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,920
and a couple of other operators entering

105
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:19,918
into the industry so we don't use yeast

106
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:22,319
we use another uh bacteria and i think

107
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:25,439
that one of the advantages that creo

108
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:28,800
really has is that because of that

109
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:31,040
we have a very what we call freedom to

110
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,360
operate our technology is slightly

111
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,600
different our ip is slightly different

112
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,319
from many of our competitors

113
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,800
for the reason that we don't use east

114
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:43,040
i do think this market is going to

115
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,120
attract more and more players and

116
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,600
investment i think if you look at the

117
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,918
larger picture oh and around what is

118
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,479
happening in bio manufacturing and

119
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:56,000
vertical farming and everybody trying to

120
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:58,639
you know do things that are um that are

121
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,199
more uh sustainable that are more

122
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,560
protecting nature that are more pure you

123
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,038
will find that

124
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,720
more and more people will get attracted

125
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:09,120
at some stage i'm sure there'll be

126
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,600
consolidation there'll be you know it'll

127
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,079
go through that whole maturity phase but

128
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,680
i think at this phase we are where more

129
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:17,279
and more people are going to come in and

130
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,199
get attracted

131
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:21,679
yeah and i think the possibilities for

132
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,478
blends and formulations of the multiple

133
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,319
different synthetic molecules is gonna

134
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:28,159
it's almost like a chef's recipe now at

135
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:31,519
this stage how many types of bread can

136
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:34,479
be made from flour correct

137
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:36,799
absolutely i think that in the next few

138
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:39,279
years you're going to see a lot of

139
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,038
combinations you know people combining

140
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:43,119
different kinds of cannabinoids people

141
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:45,439
combining different kinds of compounds

142
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,319
with cannabinoids other ingredients with

143
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:49,918
cannabinoids you'll see such a fusion

144
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:52,079
you know um

145
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:54,478
i don't know tomorrow you could think of

146
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:56,879
you know fish oil with cannabinoids or

147
00:05:54,478 --> 00:06:00,199
something else with cannabinoids so it's

148
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:03,120
going to be a lot of fusion a lot of

149
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:05,919
customization and personalization i

150
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,000
think you know more and more consumers

151
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:10,399
are wanting things that are

152
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,800
customized for them and so you know

153
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:15,679
variants and different kinds of new

154
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,759
innovations and formulations um that's

155
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,879
going to happen in the next few years i

156
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,919
think you

157
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:24,319
want some few big brands to take that

158
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:26,719
leap of faith and you know start

159
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,439
investing more in the research side of

160
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,759
this category as well and then it's all

161
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:33,360
ready to take off already

162
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,360
yeah agreed i think we're only at the

163
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,919
starting stones of what will actually be

164
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,919
the biggest uh generator of capital and

165
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:41,279
coming from the cannabis industry i want

166
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:43,120
to move on to the next topic and it's

167
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:46,159
something you're an actual

168
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:49,280
an expert on and it's marketing modern

169
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,840
day marketing for firms in this sector

170
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:54,159
do you find it restrictive or are there

171
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:56,799
specific innovative ways that you can

172
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,880
bring your brand to market that don't

173
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,879
cross over any let's say online digital

174
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:04,319
rules that are happening

175
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:07,360
yeah um i think for us because we don't

176
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:10,160
specifically do thc it's been a bit

177
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,319
easier it was an exercise to be honest i

178
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,439
mean when we started advertising you

179
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,360
know uh whatever it was all the social

180
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:20,079
platforms and channels were not very

181
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,639
open to you know us doing any kind of

182
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:25,519
content or paid especially

183
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,759
but i was able to leverage my contacts

184
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:30,799
from my previous roles and actually meet

185
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:33,439
with these um digital platforms and and

186
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,918
communicate to them how our process is

187
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:38,560
very different and that our products are

188
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:41,519
pure and because of which we were able

189
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:45,120
to actually get a lot of these brands to

190
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:48,799
allow our content and our um marketing

191
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:51,759
to run um on these um on their platforms

192
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,478
and i think there are ways um you know

193
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:57,680
to do this in a in a cost-effective

194
00:07:54,478 --> 00:08:00,159
manner uh to both not only educate your

195
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,560
prospective buyers as well as end

196
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,879
consumers on exactly what these products

197
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,360
are what they're going to do but also

198
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,759
use other ways right one is to use your

199
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,840
digital and social and search but the

200
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,639
other ways are you know webcasts and

201
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:16,638
podcasts and you know participating in

202
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,120
the right events where your consumers

203
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:23,038
are going to be industry specific events

204
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,800
you can also use other um

205
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:26,399
modern marketing

206
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,439
tools like you know

207
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:32,478
um using uh syndication of content i

208
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:35,120
think today any customer before making

209
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,519
any kind of decision especially in b2b

210
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,320
they tend to visit and look at a lot

211
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,959
more content so you know each of these

212
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,920
in the modern day customer journey and

213
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:48,719
content journey has a place be it your

214
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:52,559
social digital search content

215
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:55,278
syndication you know webcasts podcasts

216
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:57,679
being in the right events and really

217
00:08:55,278 --> 00:09:00,240
producing engaging content and putting

218
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:03,278
it where your customer is and would be

219
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,720
ready to consume this content

220
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:06,159
yeah now i agree which i think there's

221
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,440
definitely a lack of companies with

222
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:09,439
innovative

223
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,720
content campaigns

224
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,720
out there they seem to be all just

225
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,240
crying wolf over the lack of instagram

226
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,160
and facebook aren't allowing them to put

227
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,839
their stuff on board for it is a number

228
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:19,679
of different ways to market your product

229
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,519
in this modern day and age

230
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:22,399
this even for example i started this a

231
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,080
year ago

232
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,679
just with a curiosity to learn the

233
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,959
business side of the cannabis industry

234
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:28,719
and again

235
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:30,479
the media side of things i think is very

236
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,160
overlooked by the industry they don't

237
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,320
utilize the amount of information and

238
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:37,039
data that can actually be gathered by a

239
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,278
15-minute podcast once a week

240
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:41,039
yeah and you know i mean linkedin is

241
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:43,600
pretty open in terms of what we're

242
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:46,879
allowing and you know you have webinars

243
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,600
you have um you know linked to all of

244
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:51,439
these uh trade media as well as all the

245
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,240
big shows they have a big digital

246
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,720
footprint as well um you know you have

247
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,720
email marketing which of course because

248
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,440
of all the privacy rules you have to be

249
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:05,120
really smart about doing it and making

250
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:07,279
sure that you are optimizing keywords

251
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,759
and subject matters and you know things

252
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:12,240
that people are looking for but if you

253
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:15,360
invest in those things and make your

254
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,919
content you know um searchable and make

255
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,159
your content engaging you can't bore a

256
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:21,919
customer into reading what you want or

257
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:24,799
you know into watching what you want but

258
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:27,039
if you do create com content that is

259
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:29,599
compelling and meeting their needs and

260
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:32,240
is really mapped to the customer journey

261
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,639
i think you can you can do a lot in this

262
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,720
industry as well i think it's the world

263
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:38,399
is not only about facebook and instagram

264
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,079
as much as marketers might want to

265
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,919
believe that yeah i think that's the

266
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:43,599
easy option for them to be able to sell

267
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:45,120
to you whereas a bit of legwork and a

268
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,759
bit of elbow grease will get you a lot

269
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,320
further than a a couple hundred euro in

270
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:52,159
a ad campaign the last thing i want to

271
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,640
touch on is a

272
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:56,559
strong strategy and a clear vision in

273
00:10:54,639 --> 00:11:00,319
the industry specifically the durian the

274
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:02,799
kind of biotech synthetic industry it's

275
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,480
a permanent importance i would assume to

276
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:06,639
be able to create the individual

277
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,639
ingredient before brands start getting

278
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:11,120
created whereas in the cannabis industry

279
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:13,278
it might be more brand focused and brand

280
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,440
heavy would that be the strong strategy

281
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:17,360
and clear vision for that industry or is

282
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,079
there a different way that you recommend

283
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,639
companies not a territory set up

284
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:25,439
yeah i think that there is a dual role

285
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:29,278
here i think there is a role to

286
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:31,279
educate the customer and you know um

287
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:33,919
really build thought leadership and

288
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:35,759
awareness and then the brand so i think

289
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:38,078
whatever you're trying to do you need to

290
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:40,159
be very clear on how you're going to

291
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:43,120
achieve both these two purposes they're

292
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:46,958
not necessarily mutually exclusive

293
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:49,039
but you need to have a clear vision of

294
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:51,119
where you're trying to where the

295
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:53,519
category is going where the brand is

296
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,000
going what exactly are you trying to

297
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,240
achieve for us personally in creo our

298
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,200
vision really is to

299
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,440
bring cannabinoids to every household

300
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,079
partner with our customers we are an

301
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,920
enabler to help our customers create new

302
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:10,159
and innovative products that they can

303
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:13,519
bring to market across different

304
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:15,278
applications and um you know how we do

305
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,679
that while we're still protecting the

306
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:19,600
planet how do we do that in a manner

307
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:21,759
that is credible

308
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,240
that is something that our customers can

309
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:26,879
rely on for us

310
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,440
that is one huge task of making our

311
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:32,078
vision and and our brand pillars

312
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,600
communicated at the same time how do you

313
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:35,519
build thought leadership in this

314
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,639
category how do you really grow this

315
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,639
needle decent category you know when i

316
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,120
talk to people about cannabinoids all

317
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,120
they think is you know cannabis then

318
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,839
there's a whole exercise of telling them

319
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,600
this is not cannabis this is not thc

320
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,279
there's you know the plant has so many

321
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,800
different other

322
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:57,600
compounds that it can offer so i think

323
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:59,599
having that um you know having your

324
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,360
strategy and your vision clear of what

325
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,519
you're wanting to achieve but

326
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,360
recognizing that this is an emerging and

327
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,320
nascent technology which is also

328
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,720
stigmified to a certain extent and

329
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,959
crossing all those barriers in a manner

330
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:16,000
that you can really achieve

331
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:18,399
your goals is really important i think

332
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,240
yeah now i could agree to more it's been

333
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,078
absolutely brilliant talking to you

334
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,759
