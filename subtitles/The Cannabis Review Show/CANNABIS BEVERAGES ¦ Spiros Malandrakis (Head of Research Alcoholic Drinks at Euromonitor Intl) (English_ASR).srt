it's a beautiful day great to be here

thank you very much for joining me a man

with a a wealth of experience hopefully

9
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,400
we'll be able to shed some light on the

10
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:31,018
Canapolis drinks industry for the

11
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:32,699
viewers can you maybe give everybody a

12
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:34,259
little overview of how long you've been

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,899
researching the alcoholic drink market

14
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:38,820
and your period at your monitor

15
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:40,320
I've been um I've had the lack of

16
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,378
researching alcoholic drinks for the

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,719
last 17 years or so primarily focusing

18
00:00:43,378 --> 00:00:47,699
on branding um and kind of my my

19
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,140
beautiful job is predicting what people

20
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,460
will be drinking around the world so

21
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,259
essentially

22
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,000
all the great things from the bars to

23
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:56,159
the retailers in all categories from

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,179
wine to Spirits to what it is and

25
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:58,979
everything in between like the

26
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:00,719
categories like non-alcoholic adult

27
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:03,299
beverages that have been making

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,500
um waves in the last couple of years and

29
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:06,000
while I've been covering the university

30
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,500
for the last 17 years and has been

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,359
extremely exciting and continues to be

32
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,920
my alcohol is a you know it's an area

33
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:13,680
that I'm continue being very passionate

34
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,180
about about six or seven years ago we

35
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,040
started realizing that there is a new

36
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,840
kid in the block uh we started realizing

37
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,580
that the alcohol industry is on the

38
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,900
defensive um there has been a shift

39
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:23,219
primarily when it comes to Millennial

40
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,340
demographics and Generation Z

41
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:28,019
demographics moving away from uh the

42
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,000
alcohol consumption as we perceived it

43
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:32,399
in the last couple of decades and they

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,840
are focusing more or pivoting or

45
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,460
shifting more towards moderation

46
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,140
initiatives

47
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:37,798
um health and wellness

48
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,320
um

49
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,259
uh dry venues

50
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:45,298
um uh and non-alcoholic adult beverages

51
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,579
a category that a couple of years ago

52
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,380
would sound like an oxymoron and at that

53
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:50,938
stage when I realized that this is

54
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:52,859
happening regardless of cannabis and

55
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:54,539
anything cannabis related I also

56
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:56,459
realized that that could potentially be

57
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,799
the point of cross-pollination between

58
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:00,000
between the two industries so as the

59
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,200
alcohol industry is time find

60
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,218
alternatives to ethanol basically

61
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,680
ingredients that can provide some kind

62
00:02:05,218 --> 00:02:09,239
of high or some kind of social lubricant

63
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,560
effects without necessarily

64
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,599
incorporating alcohol in the process

65
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,060
cannabis could potentially provide

66
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:16,919
exactly that so that kind of brings me

67
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,319
to this conversation today

68
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:21,238
incredible and what do you believe are

69
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:24,419
the biggest challenges faced in the

70
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:26,219
Cannabis beverage market and uh how do

71
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:28,139
you see these evolving over the next few

72
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:30,539
years

73
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:31,919
the I mean alcohol is doing great

74
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:33,419
um it has been expanding for a number of

75
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,219
years now but when it comes to volume

76
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:37,139
and when it comes primarily to the

77
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:39,598
mature Western markets as we perceive

78
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:40,439
them uh like Western Europe North

79
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:42,060
America

80
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:43,680
um

81
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,420
um about even even increasingly other

82
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,000
places like Latin America or even Asia

83
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:50,579
to an extent I I think it has starting

84
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,019
to reach a point of saturation and

85
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,760
extreme maturity especially when it

86
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:56,039
comes to some of the major categories

87
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:58,620
and exactly because of reaching that

88
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:59,939
stage over the last 10 to 20 years the

89
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,340
transition in alcohol was has been

90
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:05,459
primarily towards what we call Value

91
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,560
creation or premiumization so since the

92
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:10,259
category could not really

93
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,959
um provide additional momentum in volume

94
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:16,139
it was focusing primarily on value now

95
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,180
that also cannot be infinite it has its

96
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:20,579
limitations especially in an era that we

97
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,200
live right now which is one of the the

98
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,180
greatest challenges when it comes to

99
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:25,378
macroeconomics and the cost of living

100
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,080
crisis

101
00:03:25,378 --> 00:03:29,939
um so any alternative of expansion

102
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,680
Beyond those Realms that we have been

103
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:33,959
exploring in alcohol for the last couple

104
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,519
of hundreds of years can provide amazing

105
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,319
opportunities moving forward and I think

106
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,580
this is what cannabis has the potential

107
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:40,738
to do

108
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,780
incredible and we've got new products

109
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:44,759
and new legislation kind of evolving

110
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,378
constantly around the world how do you

111
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:48,598
keep on top of all the information are

112
00:03:46,378 --> 00:03:50,518
there certain sources of go-to or is it

113
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:52,560
a broad spectrum of a little bit from

114
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,140
here a little bit from here

115
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,239
to monitor uh has analysts on about 100

116
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:59,279
markets around the world so we have kind

117
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,439
of boots on the grounds providing some

118
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,239
kind of unique perspectives on on the

119
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,579
latest when it comes to this

120
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:07,378
um Innovation latest kind of Trends on

121
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:09,000
the ground but at the same time I have

122
00:04:07,378 --> 00:04:10,259
the pleasure of having some very

123
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,979
interesting conversations with some of

124
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:13,259
the

125
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:15,119
biggest companies out there many of the

126
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:17,219
smaller cast producers as well and it's

127
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,739
an ongoing kind of evolving conversation

128
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,780
you know it's it never really ends it's

129
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:23,279
never gonna it's not supposed to end and

130
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:25,198
it can start sometimes from a little

131
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:27,959
walk down the street in my local East

132
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,060
London bar all the way to a conversation

133
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:31,258
to the analyst on on the ground in

134
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,360
Shanghai telling exactly what's

135
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:35,819
happening over there my my job is to

136
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,280
kind of combine all this information and

137
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:39,899
make it into actionable Trends or

138
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:42,239
predictions about how what the future

139
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:43,679
holds incredible and so what do you see

140
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,000
is the key trends that are going to

141
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,439
shape the Cannabis beverage industry

142
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,259
over the next few years and how are they

143
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:51,899
going to affect the producers and the

144
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:53,580
the suppliers of these drinks

145
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:55,198
I mean this is a beautiful question but

146
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:56,819
I think it can go in many different

147
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,900
directions when we talk about cannabis

148
00:04:56,819 --> 00:04:59,939
beverages

149
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:02,579
in practice we speak

150
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:04,800
um about two I mean more than two but

151
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:08,039
essentially the key kind of two bastions

152
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,120
of on one hand is the CBD side which has

153
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,259
been making interest for a number of

154
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,418
years now

155
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:14,580
um much more ubiquitous and THC drinks

156
00:05:12,418 --> 00:05:16,258
obviously uh much easier when it comes

157
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:17,758
to the legislative Frameworks to be

158
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:21,300
allowed and they have been making

159
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,919
successes in Europe and in in the US

160
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,478
and North America in general and

161
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:27,299
increasingly another place around the

162
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:30,360
planet as well as I said much easier to

163
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,978
democratize because the legislation is

164
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,500
much more likely to allow them to do so

165
00:05:31,978 --> 00:05:36,538
on the other side we have THC beverages

166
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,279
which is much more Niche

167
00:05:36,538 --> 00:05:40,319
um they they do incorporate the

168
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:42,000
psychoactive substance in cannabis

169
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:43,500
um they I personally see them as having

170
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,538
the most potential to actually replace

171
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,959
alcoholic drinks in the long term not

172
00:05:45,538 --> 00:05:51,240
immediately once the legislative

173
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:52,918
Frameworks allow them to do that

174
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,139
and these are the kind of if you wish

175
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:57,359
the two main sebastians um CBD I

176
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:59,639
couldn't I see it as continuing to grow

177
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,900
uh potentially with a little bit more

178
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,000
moderation

179
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:05,038
on the initial kind of stratospheric

180
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,620
expansion growth rates of the initial

181
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:08,459
years but definitely a lot of a Way

182
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,038
Forward

183
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:13,019
um as we move into

184
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:15,000
um CBD plus products like not just

185
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:17,339
containing CBD but also some minor

186
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,699
cannabinoids some adaptogens in some

187
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:22,978
cases some um uh vitamins energizing um

188
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:24,600
elements or molecules I think that the

189
00:06:22,978 --> 00:06:26,579
list will expand to create this kind of

190
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:30,240
added value CBD health and wellness

191
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:33,180
position products on the other hand THC

192
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,620
um unfortunately it's not really allowed

193
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:38,100
in the vast majority of markets at the

194
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:40,860
moment but we do see it very slowly

195
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,680
starting to make inroads in markets like

196
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:45,300
in the US or in Canada

197
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,978
the problem has been facing for until

198
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,660
now for a number of years has been

199
00:06:46,978 --> 00:06:51,000
primarily on the back of

200
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,319
of the fact that what we call the onset

201
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,379
of the effect so many of these

202
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,539
formulations because uh THC and cannabis

203
00:06:55,379 --> 00:07:00,120
is not water soluble but rather fat

204
00:06:57,538 --> 00:07:01,860
soluble we're not made in a way that

205
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,139
allowed consumers to drink it and have

206
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:06,000
an effect within 15-20 minutes uh in

207
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:07,620
many cases it actually ended up having

208
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,740
an effect on about two or three hours

209
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:13,459
after consumption and as you can imagine

210
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:17,280
if someone consumes any kind of drink

211
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:18,959
for the effect to then come in online in

212
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:20,399
about two or three hours as they're

213
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:22,439
about to get their car to go back home

214
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:24,478
that is not really

215
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:26,279
um supportive of a social experience of

216
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:29,300
any kind and obviously that didn't work

217
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:31,799
now with with new techniques like

218
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,240
nanomalification and increasingly new

219
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,280
kind of technological advances when it

220
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,620
comes to that many of these products

221
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:40,258
actually do have an effect of the onset

222
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:42,240
of the effect within 15 to 20 minutes so

223
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:44,639
they start replicating

224
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,918
the cycle of consumption of alcohol

225
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,360
drinks of a beer of a spirit of a

226
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:49,379
cocktail and I think that's where it

227
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,240
starts getting much more interesting

228
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:52,800
saying that

229
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,560
um THC beverages are still only

230
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,319
accounting for a very low single digits

231
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,720
of overall cannabis consumption rates so

232
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,240
that is really small at the moment and I

233
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,560
think where we will start really seeing

234
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,180
them making

235
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,860
um massive advantages in the future will

236
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:11,459
be primarily when they start appearing

237
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:14,580
in on trade so cannabis lounges

238
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:16,680
um when we start seeing many more of

239
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:19,918
them appearing in dispensaries and when

240
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,900
the legislative Frameworks allow them to

241
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:23,519
actually make the impact that I know

242
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:24,719
they can have in the next five to ten

243
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:26,818
years

244
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,860
okay and one of the challenges that are

245
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:32,580
facing the Cannabis beverage industry is

246
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:34,620
the dosage of CBD or THC and as you

247
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,479
mentioned Emulsion technology and the

248
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:39,000
the talk of carabinoids sticking to

249
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,038
aluminum cans how do you see that

250
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,200
problem being solved is it going to be a

251
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:45,299
technology solution a biotech company

252
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,540
creating a core ingredient that actually

253
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:51,059
is proven to have efficacy in a b and c

254
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:53,099
that allows a prono Ricard or a diagio

255
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:55,919
to go okay we're now going to make our

256
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:58,320
own uh line of these beverages

257
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:59,879
I think um it's a great question it's

258
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,100
more on the technical side rather than

259
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:05,278
The Branding side and I think

260
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:06,720
um some kind of um reliability when it

261
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,338
comes to mass production will definitely

262
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,720
need to be there and as we know all

263
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:12,720
these companies all the major alcohol

264
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,639
companies are not in control that they

265
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,399
don't approach alcohol consumption or

266
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:19,139
production via this kind of pain

267
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:20,759
cannabis approach of vertical

268
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:22,559
integration there's not really much

269
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:24,299
vertical integration alcohol drinks

270
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:26,399
alcohol players you know what they do

271
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:28,139
well and that is logistics and branding

272
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,000
and that's what they're focusing on in

273
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:32,519
some cases maturation as well but it's

274
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,899
not that necessarily the ebis or

275
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:37,139
Heinekens of the world will go out

276
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:40,440
having mass production of of their own

277
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:43,379
kind of hops or or basic ingredients for

278
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,820
for their drinks they kind of um they

279
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:46,799
take that from the outside but they need

280
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,560
to have reliable Partners to support it

281
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:51,240
in that and I think I agree with that

282
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:52,859
um there will be one side of the market

283
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,959
primarily the master of the market that

284
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,539
we'll need this kind of reliable inputs

285
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:59,458
that will be I mean an essential part of

286
00:09:57,539 --> 00:10:01,860
this kind of production equation at the

287
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:03,958
same time I think that we will shift

288
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,399
towards when it comes to the premium

289
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:06,838
side of these things and at the moment

290
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:07,919
they don't really exist there's only a

291
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:10,500
few of them

292
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:13,740
that will be more about specific

293
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,059
Geographic identification initiatives I

294
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,799
expect

295
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:19,679
something like in the context like

296
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:22,500
cognac or champagne so kind of is coming

297
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:24,838
from specific areas or regions around

298
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:27,839
the world be it the

299
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:30,000
um for example the uh the the the the

300
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,980
the Golden Triangle in California

301
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,839
midochino county

302
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,220
um places that have been intricately

303
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,440
connected with the wine industry for

304
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,300
example historically and they will have

305
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,700
this kind of added value even

306
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:43,620
potentially luxury potential almost like

307
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,720
champagne almost like Cognac and and

308
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,759
that would provide the inputs for the

309
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,980
higher end or more premium side of

310
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:53,159
alcohol of cannabis drinks in the future

311
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:55,320
but so but both the mass markets and the

312
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:57,240
premium or super premium sites both have

313
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,100
potential they will not be the same but

314
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,680
I would expect as the industry evolves

315
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:04,200
and becomes much bigger more Compass are

316
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:05,639
playing into this field I think we will

317
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,740
see very interesting developments in

318
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:09,899
Innovation technological advancements

319
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,820
and perceptions when it comes to

320
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:13,980
different kind of violence from

321
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:17,459
different areas around the planet

322
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:18,720
okay and so there's been the um the hype

323
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,278
around cannabis beverages has been

324
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,200
pretty big but the adoption rate has

325
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:23,879
been pretty low you mentioned there that

326
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,620
none of the alcohol beverages are fully

327
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:27,360
integrated companies like with chocolate

328
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,039
like with any large industry you stick

329
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,800
to your wheelhouse you become an expert

330
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:33,599
in that do you see that The Branding is

331
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:35,338
going to end up becoming the biggest

332
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,778
sale of the whole platform because the

333
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:38,160
the core ingredient is going to be

334
00:11:36,778 --> 00:11:40,259
pretty irrelevant to most people as it

335
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:42,299
is with beer as it is with a number of

336
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:44,458
or alcohol beverage so somebody like the

337
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:45,719
likes of guys Luke I can and the guys

338
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:47,399
over in America they seem to have got

339
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,980
The Branding perfect their target

340
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:52,379
audience is perfect do you see that The

341
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:54,360
Branding and the story behind the

342
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:56,039
beverage is going to be Paramount to the

343
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,600
success of any company

344
00:11:56,039 --> 00:12:00,000
two points on that

345
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,860
um as I as I've said in the past many

346
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,440
times and I continue saying it

347
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:06,720
in the alcohol industry

348
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,640
alcohol in general in alcohol offerings

349
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,220
are primarily Marketing in a bottle

350
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,319
branding in a bottle so the value of

351
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:16,019
branding in many cases is actually

352
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:18,180
higher or more important than the actual

353
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:21,720
liquid inside the can or inside the

354
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:23,639
bottle so we can never really overstate

355
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,160
the importance of of branding in some

356
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:27,240
cases unfortunately within cannabis

357
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:29,699
there has been this kind of

358
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,320
misunderstanding until now for many

359
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,940
companies that it was the idea that you

360
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,860
just stick some cannabis in a bottle and

361
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:37,140
that's just gonna sell itself I think

362
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,339
we're slowly moving away from that area

363
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:39,778
and people start realizing the

364
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:41,160
importance of

365
00:12:39,778 --> 00:12:43,259
um positioning

366
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:44,699
um demographic targeting occasion

367
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:47,519
targeting and obviously ultimately

368
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,839
granted and you mentioned Khan

369
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,480
um for our listeners that are not

370
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:54,959
familiar with Canon CA double n one of

371
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,579
the most um iconic cannabis THC infused

372
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:58,379
cannabis brands in the US at the moment

373
00:12:56,578 --> 00:13:00,419
appearing in many states and

374
00:12:58,379 --> 00:13:02,519
increasingly expanding having the

375
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:04,439
support of a number of uh Hollywood

376
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:07,320
celebrities and Hollywood royalty from

377
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,639
gunet Paltrow to Rosario Dawson to many

378
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:12,180
others that are increasingly coming into

379
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:14,759
the false supportive of lgbtq issues um

380
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:16,739
so much more open to these demographics

381
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:19,620
of generations that consumers that are

382
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:21,720
always very very interested in not just

383
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:23,639
the brand proposition but what what a

384
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,500
brand is supportive of what what are the

385
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:28,259
values of a brand and they're doing it

386
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,820
exactly right but I would also on top of

387
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:31,860
that I would stress

388
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:33,540
um another kind of differentiation

389
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:36,539
Factor as we're moving forward and that

390
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:38,278
would be the contents and can and

391
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:40,740
products like Khan are increasingly

392
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:41,879
creating this kind of um polarized

393
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:44,039
approach when it comes to cannabis

394
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:46,860
products and we have only one side

395
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:49,620
products I can that have a very low DHC

396
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:51,539
contents that allows for what we call

397
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,980
kind of curious consumers consumers that

398
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:54,778
are not very familiar with cannabis

399
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:57,778
potentially in some cases even

400
00:13:54,778 --> 00:13:59,700
intimidated but by cannabis drinks

401
00:13:57,778 --> 00:14:02,338
um allows them to try them because they

402
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:04,500
only contain two milligrams of THC in

403
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:06,899
every can essentially like a light beard

404
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:09,299
when it comes to alcohol if we made this

405
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:11,100
kind of parallel on the other hand on

406
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:13,139
the other side of this kind of polarized

407
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,778
approach we have the very very high

408
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:18,680
dosage cannabis beverages in the US like

409
00:14:15,778 --> 00:14:21,600
unclearness for example I have a hundred

410
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:24,120
micrograms in every bottle which again

411
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,459
they obviously do not Target anyone kind

412
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,679
of curious in any way they target the

413
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:30,179
Cannabis economics people that have been

414
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:31,559
consuming cannabis for a number of years

415
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:33,838
they know exactly what they're looking

416
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:37,559
for and they are looking for a very very

417
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:40,500
high dosage very high impact kind of um

418
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:42,059
products I think both have potential

419
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,799
moving forward and as the industry is

420
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:46,018
evolving and it's expanding I think

421
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:47,939
there is space in both cases in in some

422
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:49,620
cases even the high dosage products

423
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:51,720
might be even more relevant in the short

424
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:53,519
term because they are focusing on an

425
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,778
existing consumer base that is thinking

426
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,240
of it in terms of

427
00:14:54,778 --> 00:14:59,278
how much High I get for my buck that's

428
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:02,039
that's the approach but in the medium to

429
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:05,039
longer term I'm much more excited about

430
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:07,919
products like Khan low dosage allowing

431
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:09,899
for sessionable evenings essentially

432
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:11,159
allowing people to have a couple of

433
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:12,958
these cans

434
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:16,019
um around the group of friends without

435
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:18,479
the fear or intimidation that this kind

436
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:22,019
of really high strong products can offer

437
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:25,560
in both cases in high dosage products

438
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:27,720
and in low sessionable products in both

439
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:30,359
cases I think branding positioning

440
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,620
occasions demographic breakdowns all of

441
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,778
these things will become increasingly

442
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:35,278
more important as the industry is slowly

443
00:15:33,778 --> 00:15:37,019
coming of age

444
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:39,240
It One Last Thing Before I Let You Go

445
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:42,060
Europe obviously has a far more advanced

446
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:44,820
alcoholic beverage history than other

447
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:46,500
parts of of the world do you see once

448
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:48,839
the legislation and the regulations come

449
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:51,179
in that the ability for European Brands

450
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:53,339
to dominate this sector is going to be

451
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:54,899
quite enhanced that the the American

452
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:56,519
companies won't be able to keep up with

453
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:58,139
the technical know-how that the European

454
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:01,379
companies have or do you think America

455
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:03,240
already has too much of a head start

456
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:04,559
that's a great question I think America

457
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,659
definitely has a head start when it

458
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:09,659
comes to the technology and I think that

459
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:11,519
would be very very difficult to

460
00:16:09,659 --> 00:16:13,919
um to compete against in Europe simply

461
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,600
because we are currently running about a

462
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:19,198
decade behind and considering the latest

463
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,940
information uh about the very slow yet

464
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:22,979
steady steps of legalization when it

465
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:24,779
comes to European markets like the Czech

466
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:26,940
Republic or Germany or the Netherlands

467
00:16:24,778 --> 00:16:29,159
mostly still on an experimental stage

468
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:31,920
not allowing a fully-fledged kind of

469
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:33,419
cannabis Market or research and

470
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:35,458
development when it comes to all that I

471
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:37,259
think the American Commerce definitely

472
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:39,479
have a head start going on on that side

473
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:41,639
on the other hand I think there is a

474
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,680
massive misconception for for a number

475
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:46,379
of investors and our American friends

476
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:47,758
looking towards Europe thinking that you

477
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:50,278
can literally just take any American

478
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,560
brand and superimpose it in European

479
00:16:50,278 --> 00:16:54,059
markets and and I've seen that

480
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:55,859
um fallacy

481
00:16:54,059 --> 00:16:56,638
um taking shape in alcohol drinks in the

482
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,620
past

483
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,440
um I can use the latest example of the

484
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:03,959
attempt to superimpose hard seltzers to

485
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,360
European markets at a time that was not

486
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:07,859
even semantically translating in Europe

487
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,178
and obviously most European consumers

488
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:11,759
couldn't understand what they were and

489
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:14,040
they mostly flopped I can see a similar

490
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:16,318
mistake about to happen

491
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:19,139
when it comes to economics Beverages and

492
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:20,818
I think yes the tech know-how is there

493
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,380
The Passion of the for the industry is

494
00:17:20,818 --> 00:17:23,699
there um they have been doing for a

495
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,980
number of years they understand scale

496
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:27,720
you understand Logistics but they need

497
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:30,000
to also understand that first of all

498
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,380
Europe is not one country it's many many

499
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,599
countries that are very very different

500
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:35,580
between them and secondly that they have

501
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:38,579
to speak the language of the consumers

502
00:17:35,579 --> 00:17:40,740
on each individual even not just on a

503
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:42,779
country level but on a regional or even

504
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:46,259
