00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:51,919
cannabis industry and where you are and

25
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,359
what companies you're part of at the

26
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,039
moment

27
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:57,920
of course so i've joined the cannabis

28
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,520
industry about six years ago now um i

29
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,600
started out working for an extraction

30
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,440
facility uh very close to where i'm

31
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,519
actually living in environment in the

32
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:08,158
netherlands and lastly as people might

33
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,478
know is the agricultural capital of the

34
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,880
world the best agriculture university in

35
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:15,840
the world let me just

36
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:16,879
turn some of my thought off my apologies

37
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,320
so

38
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:19,438
we started out with an extraction

39
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:22,000
company they've developed drone

40
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:23,359
extraction technology and it's different

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,040
from

42
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:27,040
co2 but

43
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,439
uses basically

44
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,799
uh some some things are the same some

45
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:32,158
some parameters are the same so that's

46
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,840
where i started out six years ago

47
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,079
started working with different kind of

48
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,600
cannabis both medical cannabis from uh

49
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:39,839
from the dutch government better than

50
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:41,919
cannabis but also with

51
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,200
outdoor hemp so with him for cbd

52
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,879
extraction

53
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,759
enrolled into both markets food

54
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:49,519
supplement market and thc market

55
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,879
went on going from there and eventually

56
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:52,158
ended up

57
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:54,399
founding the institute for municipal

58
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,040
cannabis and working for a

59
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,879
lighting company where i do the strategy

60
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,439
so where we do provide

61
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:03,920
lighting to cultivation areas and my

62
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:05,599
expertise on cannabis and cannabinoids

63
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,600
makes the lighting and the cannabis a

64
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:09,758
very good fit

65
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:12,000
and we also founded the institute

66
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:14,958
officially last year in january the

67
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,959
january 1st 2021

68
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,800
a year before we started having round

69
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,520
tables and

70
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,319
just sort of organizing ourselves

71
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,879
and since last year now officially

72
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:28,958
in foundation

73
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:30,959
okay incredible yeah you seem to have

74
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,959
some great partners transvaal pharma

75
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,680
bedrock and fairground and a lot of

76
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,199
doctors and researchers so the objective

77
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,280
with the institute for medicinal

78
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,878
cannabis is to basically coalesce all

79
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,800
these uh

80
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:45,439
smart people with a lot of research and

81
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,280
data all in one centralized spot and is

82
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:49,039
the objective then to have software

83
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,080
where doctors around the country can

84
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:53,840
dial in or is this based on information

85
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,879
you're going to create papers and

86
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:00,400
distribute those papers around

87
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:01,199
a couple of things i think the main the

88
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,360
main

89
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:05,199
thing is what you said is cooperation so

90
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,879
we are trying to cooperate between all

91
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:09,280
fields of the medical cannabis so that's

92
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:11,919
doctors it's specialists it's

93
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,519
pharmacists it's academics but also

94
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:16,000
people from the industry it's the

95
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,080
government so we you need all of those

96
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,519
to create a good framework a good legal

97
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,519
framework but also a framework for

98
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,719
patients to actually get a product

99
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,719
um

100
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:27,439
one of the things we are doing now is

101
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:29,359
and we are only a relatively small

102
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:32,479
foundation it's not for profit so we

103
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,200
don't charge a lot of money

104
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:37,119
not at all even so it's it's it's a

105
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,878
we don't get paid anything as a board

106
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,360
member of the institute so we do this to

107
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:42,878
improve the industry and we don't

108
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,879
provide with thousands and thousands of

109
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:47,199
papers what we are doing is providing

110
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:48,878
fact sheets and we have the first two

111
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:50,639
ones available i think they're for

112
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:51,679
chronic pain and for

113
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:53,359
uh

114
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,400
epilepsy if i'm saying this correctly

115
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,319
and

116
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,680
what we're doing is we call the fact

117
00:03:56,318 --> 00:03:59,598
sheets and so it's basically a sort of

118
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,120
summary on what is available for doctors

119
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:03,438
and patients so what is currently the

120
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,519
state of research on chronic pain what

121
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:07,039
kind of products are being used uh

122
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,200
what's the current stage just a very

123
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,639
factual overview no no no you need to

124
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:12,399
use this or

125
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,399
this is something that this counts as

126
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,840
evidence is very good overview fact

127
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,160
shoulder

128
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,120
yeah observative overview so we're

129
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,959
currently

130
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,360
creating those and one of the other

131
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,800
things we just launched is a

132
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,199
i don't know how this translates but

133
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,800
it's uh you always have this sort of v

134
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,400
you also have this piece of paper with

135
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,680
your medicines right where it says okay

136
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:34,000
this is the list of side effects you

137
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,280
might experience if you use this product

138
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,040
so uh

139
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:39,039
what's the english word for it the

140
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,120
yeah just a piece of paper with the

141
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:45,039
instructions so but some people these

142
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,639
are all it's very tiny and very detailed

143
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,759
and it's hard for people detrimental

144
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,478
effects

145
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,639
yeah

146
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:52,800
yeah yeah exactly what we've now done is

147
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,800
we create a very simple video of it it's

148
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,879
like a generic thing in the netherlands

149
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,560
which is available for all pharmacies

150
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,038
it's not pregnant in any way not even by

151
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,038
us not anyone which is just short

152
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:06,800
three-minute videos explaining cannabis

153
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:08,319
cannabis floss flour and cannabis oil so

154
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,160
just very simple what is it where you

155
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:12,319
can get it what does it do and how do

156
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,479
you use it just very simple

157
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,639
uh simple animated videos for people to

158
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:19,439
use which they get a qr code from

159
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,960
pharmacy if they get a cannabis product

160
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:22,879
and they can just view it online how to

161
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,638
use it and what it is just very just

162
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:27,038
providing information to the patients

163
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,360
that's just our goal

164
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:31,680
okay so initial stepping stone of

165
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,759
information for a patient or a medical

166
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,280
practitioner who's looking at the first

167
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,960
level of information

168
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,799
is there another platform is there

169
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:40,079
another platform because the one thing

170
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,079
i'm starting to notice we're actually

171
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:44,240
doing an article on software and

172
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:45,439
cannabis now over the next week and it's

173
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,918
the one thing i'm starting to see

174
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:49,519
movement in the european space because

175
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:50,959
it's all well and good the companies who

176
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:52,719
are cultivating and growing but if the

177
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:54,799
doctors don't have access to be able to

178
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,120
track prescriptions and track the

179
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,759
medicines and track the behavior of each

180
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,439
patient uh i i see that's where the next

181
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,038
move is coming in so are you guys

182
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:04,959
planning on building some sort of

183
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:07,038
software that allows the doctor full

184
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:08,959
access or you guys initially just doing

185
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:11,360
this says look the industry needs to

186
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:13,198
move forward we we've all come together

187
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,038
to help this industry move forward and

188
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,038
the objective is not to turn this into a

189
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:18,719
large corporation it's basically to get

190
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:21,038
the industry up off the up off the

191
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,840
ground and help as much as we can

192
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:24,159
yeah

193
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:26,079
definitely the latter um i have also

194
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,680
seen on the scanners conferences i've

195
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:29,680
seen these parties providing software

196
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,600
and they're i think now on startup phase

197
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,959
even one of our partners

198
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,800
is trying to set

199
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,799
the institute's trying to set it up but

200
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,639
we are as an organization really want to

201
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:43,038
remain uh a neutral objective party uh

202
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,879
non-commercial so so we would if a

203
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:46,639
partner of us provides a good software

204
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:48,719
that's functional and where this kind of

205
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,639
data can be exchanged you would promote

206
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,479
we prove promote it for the partner like

207
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,918
if somebody would reach out or experts

208
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:55,598
would reach out to us or specialists

209
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:58,079
where can i find this they would

210
00:06:55,598 --> 00:07:00,240
redirect them to the party we would not

211
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:02,079
uh do this ourselves because we think

212
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,960
that's not our you're going to be a

213
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:07,359
facilitator and not some not a an actual

214
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:10,000
player in the industry

215
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,080
yeah no i think that the two uh the two

216
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,839
pillars there seem to can't cross either

217
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:16,000
have to be offering advice and be

218
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:18,239
willing to educate or you go for a

219
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,319
monetizational company i don't think the

220
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,439
two dollars can coalesce well they can't

221
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,120
go less but i don't think you'll get

222
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:24,160
taken seriously over the long term of

223
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,478
time i think

224
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,479
the way the route you guys are taking is

225
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:30,478
something that us in ireland can learn

226
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:32,159
from that look there needs to be a board

227
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:34,000
set up independent of everybody's

228
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,560
venture that basically helps the

229
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,120
industry move forward at no

230
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,439
cost and at no gain to any of the

231
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,240
members of the board

232
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:46,560
definitely i think oh look the gun

233
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,560
i think that's in some regards the same

234
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,319
as the netherlands it's not really big

235
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,639
there's not a lot of different parties

236
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,000
with a lot of interest i mean

237
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,439
it should be possible to set something

238
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,199
up there's a lot of common ground we

239
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:59,038
found the common ground here there's a

240
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,160
lot of common ground i'm sure in ireland

241
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:02,318
as well

242
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,000
we also did a

243
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,240
conference last year in denmark where

244
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,598
they invited us the institute also to

245
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,439
speak on what our initiative is this

246
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:11,598
year we were invited again to speak on

247
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:13,439
what we did in the first year

248
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:15,279
and

249
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:17,918
every i think every country can benefit

250
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:19,439
from such an initiative because there is

251
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:21,038
a lot of common ground and if you want

252
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,439
to be taken seriously also by your own

253
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:25,279
government by the by the healthcare then

254
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:27,519
you need to provide a neutral standpoint

255
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:28,478
if you come from it from a commercial

256
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:30,240
aspect

257
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:31,918
they always they just

258
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,599
very shortly will say okay you're just

259
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:34,639
out here to make money and egypt want to

260
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,560
make money

261
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,399
that's his own only goal and if you come

262
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,158
more from a patient perspective and more

263
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,479
from a common ground like we noticed

264
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:44,240
these things and and so for

265
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,639
a problem in the end was where

266
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,720
uh scientists had a hard time finding

267
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:50,080
a product or where do i get the product

268
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,240
where do you get it from we see that

269
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,680
pharmacists don't know what to prescribe

270
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,360
sorry doctors don't know what to

271
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:56,399
prescribe so they asked the pharmacist

272
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,320
and we just

273
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,559
i think every country can benefit from a

274
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,240
facilitating place who knows where all

275
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:04,319
the players are where the experts are we

276
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,399
have a lot of experts who are

277
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,560
affiliated with the institute we just if

278
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,159
they do cannabis research we ask them if

279
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:12,000
they want to be an expert

280
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:14,719
and if there's ever a topic like it's

281
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,278
chronic pain or ms or epilepsy we know

282
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,278
okay you can contact this specialist

283
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:21,439
ask his opinion maybe he can help you

284
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:24,080
setting up a research it's just really

285
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,839
facilitating i think any country in eu

286
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,360
could benefit from it

287
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,800
yeah no very much agreed i want to move

288
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,159
on now to just the netherlands i have a

289
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:32,799
couple of questions about the industry

290
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:34,719
over there do you guys produce enough

291
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:37,599
cannabis for your medical cannabis

292
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,680
program or do you import as well

293
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,000
no no we export about eighty percent i

294
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:44,319
think of the the cannabis so so baroque

295
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,240
has been export is the sole producer at

296
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,399
the moment and

297
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,799
there's a medical tender ongoing

298
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:54,799
to have two medical growers where

299
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:56,639
i mean better can is not 100 guaranteed

300
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:58,719
to be one of the two but it's very

301
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,240
likely there will be one of the two

302
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,040
growers and so there will be one new

303
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,440
party providing cannabis

304
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:07,759
uh but currently almost every all

305
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,200
cannabis is being exported uh our

306
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:10,958
cannabis is being

307
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,079
so officially the cannabis for the dutch

308
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:14,799
government we have the office of

309
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:17,120
medicinal cannabis who gives basic

310
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:19,278
basically what better can is as a

311
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,120
contract manufacturer they create

312
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:22,720
cultivated cannabis

313
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,959
for the government and they distribute

314
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,720
it and all the records of it are just

315
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,078
online findable

316
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,480
it's all transparent and most of our

317
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:33,199
cannabis goes to germany actually

318
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,879
and i think yeah germany seems to be

319
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,079
taken in cannabis from malta from

320
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:39,679
denmark from the netherlands

321
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:41,519
they basically have no cultivation

322
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:43,759
themselves i think they have like three

323
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,759
and three cultivators and they produce

324
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:46,399
a thousand or two thousand kilograms

325
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:48,879
each

326
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,120
another percent and uh that's not enough

327
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:52,559
to satisfy other patients so they have

328
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,078
to import it and they've been importing

329
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:55,359
it from the netherlands for quite uh

330
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:57,359
quite some time

331
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,600
yeah we previously talked to sony

332
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,759
murrenhout from the leather hands who

333
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,399
about cultivation and he gave us an

334
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:06,319
overview of a number of things so

335
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,559
when it comes to the product in the

336
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,079
netherlands the pharmacies are the ones

337
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:11,439
that distribute the medical cannabis

338
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:13,679
over there

339
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,279
yeah correct so you want to get

340
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:16,799
basically get a prescription from your

341
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:18,639
doctor from a specialist and then you

342
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:19,759
could go to pharmacists energy

343
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:21,600
pharmacists in the netherlands where you

344
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:23,519
can get the cannabis flower

345
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,079
and cannabis oil is a bit more difficult

346
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,919
because not all

347
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:29,838
pharmacists make the oil there's two

348
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:31,439
currently two who make the oil we are

349
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,880
also partners the transfal and the

350
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,760
clinical cannabis care where you get

351
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:37,838
your cannabis oil

352
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:39,200
okay very interesting so when it comes

353
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,880
to the pharmacies and let's say the

354
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,320
buyer for the pharmacies who are getting

355
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:44,480
the new products that are coming out

356
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,560
they really only have one company to

357
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,480
supply them with product at the moment

358
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,919
hopefully two within the next 12 months

359
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,720
is that correct

360
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:54,799
they only have one and they're not even

361
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,320
directly because because it's being

362
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:58,000
sourced from the government so it goes

363
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,839
from the cultivator to the government

364
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,839
from government to the distributor from

365
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,200
the distributor it goes to

366
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,560
the pharmacist

367
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,720
but uh

368
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:08,078
yeah basically one source

369
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,278
very interesting because i think over in

370
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:11,359
ireland we're going to have the exact

371
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:13,838
opposite scenario that whoever has the

372
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,839
class a import license will then be able

373
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,519
to source the best product for the

374
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,880
pharmacies to be able to sell i don't

375
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,799
think there'll be a cultivation

376
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:22,559
operation over in ireland that'll be

377
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:24,479
able to be big enough to feed the whole

378
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,559
industry over here

379
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,639
i can admit like it's not an ideal

380
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:30,479
situation where you only have one just

381
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,159
from a risk perspective you want to

382
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,360
differentiate i mean the cannabis

383
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:35,439
currently being provided by those

384
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,560
governments is

385
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,480
very good quality it's gmp qualified

386
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:42,638
flowers so it's not an issue in terms of

387
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,560
quality it's more of a you want a more

388
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,560
diversified portfolio you want more

389
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:47,838
producers to see what you can get maybe

390
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:49,679
some different strains there's all kinds

391
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,600
of you just want to see what's more

392
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:53,359
possible and if you think it doesn't

393
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,200
even necessarily need to be a better

394
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,800
product but if you think it's going to

395
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,120
be a better product from

396
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:00,078
any other producer you should be able to

397
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,000
uh

398
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:03,679
to get it i think that's something

399
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,839
how countries eventually will go to

400
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:07,199
where they also allow imports but for

401
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,200
the netherlands currently it's not

402
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,519
possible

403
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,879
yeah now very it's very interesting to

404
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,240
see what's going on in europe i

405
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:15,759
definitely think there's a lot of

406
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,240
movement i can see it over in ireland

407
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:20,799
over the last five to six months that uh

408
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,720
steam seems to be gathering behind the

409
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,639
germany leading the way with germany are

410
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,320
taking the headlines shall we say with

411
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,320
what's happening over there and it seems

412
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,839
to people are taking notice but i think

413
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,760
new york is going to be a massive one

414
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,519
for the irish people we look over to new

415
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:35,838
york and boston a good bit in new york

416
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,240
they go live i think in like six weeks

417
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,600
now or eight weeks with retail stores in

418
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,159
manhattan and if you've been over there

419
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,199
recently it's full of vans it's full of

420
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:47,120
cbd stores tic products so it's going to

421
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:49,039
be interesting to see now that the

422
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,480
cannabis tourism i think that happens

423
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:54,719
between north america and europe

424
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,120
yeah i mean amsterdam is obviously a

425
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,440
massive spot for for cannabis tourism

426
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,120
and there's still a lot coming

427
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,560
so that that's going to be interesting

428
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,159
you have the coffee shop experiments as

429
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:06,479
well in the netherlands

430
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:08,078
so there's there's a lot of things

431
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,480
we don't have time for to dive into but

432
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:12,159
it will be interesting how to develop i

433
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,920
just want to say that on the on the

434
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:15,759
german

435
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:18,240
possible legalization

436
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:20,879
that let's not all focus on just

437
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,320
germany and just the uh recreational

438
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:24,559
medicine is on the market is very

439
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,519
interesting it can be very big don't

440
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:29,439
forget that we have an approved

441
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,440
cannabis medicine with epitheliolex from

442
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,600
gw pharma which was one of the main

443
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,120
headlines of

444
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,759
2019-2018 which is currently almost like

445
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,278
it's forgotten by uh by the uh everybody

446
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:40,559
industry so medical says a lot of

447
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:42,078
potential so

448
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:43,838
i would really

449
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:45,120
anybody who's listening or even viewing

450
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,360
this like

451
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,799
it's not just possible legalization in

452
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,039
germany there are other things happening

453
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:52,879
in the street definitely as well

454
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:54,319
yeah i think any good medical cannabis

455
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:56,799
program that has chronic pain and

456
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,959
neuropathic pain on it is going to allow

457
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:00,719
for a huge chunk of the illegal market

458
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:02,958
to be turned legal and for a lot of

459
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,519
patients to be able to access a medicine

460
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:07,359
that is going to be beneficial to not

461
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,198
everybody but for some of the patients

462
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,039
it's definitely going to work so we've

463
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:12,559
hit 15 minutes already i could actually

464
