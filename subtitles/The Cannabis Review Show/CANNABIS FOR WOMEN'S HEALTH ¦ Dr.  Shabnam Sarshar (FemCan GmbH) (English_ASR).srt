00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,939
can you maybe give everybody a quick

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,960
little overview of your position in the

16
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:54,119
industry and your experience to date

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,939
uh so actually I started in cannabis

18
00:00:54,119 --> 00:01:00,179
industry uh I like to research cannabis

19
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:02,759
industry for ADHD that was basically the

20
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:05,280
my starting point about like getting to

21
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:08,579
know how cannabis can be used as a

22
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,978
medicine and uh upon that I moved to

23
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:14,340
Berlin I started to work in a sanity

24
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:16,920
group as a medical advisor and after

25
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,618
that we founded a new company the name

26
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:24,420
is femcan and actually in femcan we

27
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:27,959
focusing on let's say cannabis cannabis

28
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:30,799
contain functional cosmetics and uh like

29
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:34,139
hopefully near future functional

30
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:37,500
nutritions for female health

31
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,719
okay very interesting and can we start

32
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,819
on the first topic which is I know

33
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:43,560
there's a lot of female listeners and a

34
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:45,899
lot of powerful women in the Cannabis

35
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,579
industry already Anonymous for Women's

36
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,320
Health can you maybe give everybody an

37
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:51,298
overview of how cannabis is applicable

38
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:52,739
to women's health and what the potential

39
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,820
benefits are

40
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:55,819
yeah actually I

41
00:01:56,578 --> 00:02:01,319
mean or any living organism with

42
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:04,158
endocannabinoid system can eventually be

43
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:07,098
like cannabis can be potentially

44
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,979
beneficial for that organism

45
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:13,680
but for female health is especially

46
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:15,120
beneficial because uh endocannabinoid

47
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,819
system is ubiquitous in female

48
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,400
reproductive system and if you look at

49
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:22,019
many anecdotal and I have to open a

50
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,800
parenthesis here unfortunately

51
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:29,180
unfortunately there is very less uh good

52
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,980
quality uh clinical study out there to

53
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:34,800
analyze and examine the effect of

54
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:37,500
cannabis on female heads most of what we

55
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,300
know is that basically on old texts from

56
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:43,080
traditional herbal medicine from

57
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:45,540
different parts of the globe and uh the

58
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,700
anecdotes and the surveys and

59
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:50,878
observational studies

60
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:53,579
so having said that there are a lot of

61
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:55,979
like good observational studies and good

62
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:59,459
surveys that shows cannabis can help

63
00:02:55,979 --> 00:03:02,098
different uh different symptoms of women

64
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:04,800
health so let's say menstruation pain

65
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:07,919
and cramps endometriosis which is a huge

66
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,080
topic when it's come to cannabis also it

67
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:12,378
is smooth as the transition from

68
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,260
pre-menopause yeah like the whole

69
00:03:12,378 --> 00:03:19,378
menopausal transition and it's also very

70
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:22,259
much help with orgasm and sex so

71
00:03:19,378 --> 00:03:24,179
basically clothes it's a cannabis can no

72
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:27,299
not completely close what can how do you

73
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:30,480
call it like tighten the Gap in or

74
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:33,540
orgasm like so you see that from desire

75
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:37,280
to labor cannabis can be helpful for

76
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:40,019
female Health that's like a nutshell

77
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,640
very interesting and are we talking

78
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:43,439
about

79
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:45,598
um targeting the endocannabinoid system

80
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:48,799
with different blends and formulations

81
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:52,018
that become products or is it a specific

82
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:56,340
Edibles or beverages what's the optimum

83
00:03:52,019 --> 00:04:00,719
absorption method for a consumer

84
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:03,299
a super interesting question and again

85
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:05,959
the at the moment especially like in

86
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:07,980
Germany we don't have that much of a

87
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:10,319
diversity when it comes to different

88
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:11,158
products okay we have extracts and we

89
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:14,458
have

90
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:16,439
um the the flowers but when you look

91
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:19,379
from the female physiological

92
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:21,298
perspective what can be super helpful or

93
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:23,519
what you know suppositories I mean that

94
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:26,399
there is like one one company in Germany

95
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:29,459
where I met who put that effort to bring

96
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:32,159
that to the market so they have a pre

97
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:35,638
um let's say pre-made kits that

98
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:38,639
pharmacies can make the life of

99
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:41,220
pharmacies easier to bring that kind of

100
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,079
applications form into the customers and

101
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,660
into the patients but other than that

102
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:47,339
there is not not a huge diversity and of

103
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:50,460
course we have to look and we have to

104
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:53,159
see what kind of a cannabinoid

105
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:55,918
um ratios what kind of formulation would

106
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:59,280
be beneficial for which purpose so so

107
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:01,740
sometimes you might need a you might

108
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:03,719
need an eatable beside you might need a

109
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,879
topical application or you might need a

110
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,620
vaginal application so it really depends

111
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:10,500
which kind of symptoms you want to

112
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:13,620
Target is it are you searching for

113
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:17,100
short-term effect long-term effects and

114
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:18,720
like there are many uh there's many

115
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,160
variants that you have to keep in mind

116
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,380
when you develop a drug for female

117
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,660
health and female need so that that's

118
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:27,779
why there is a huge potential out there

119
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:31,320
to design and develop products specified

120
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:34,198
for female needs and uh I mean from one

121
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:37,319
so it's like that it's a two side of the

122
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,300
cone is from one side and like sad to

123
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:42,779
see

124
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:44,819
just banal example I mean I prefer to to

125
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:46,799
take Edibles and I prefer to take

126
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:50,519
vaginal suppositories instead of like

127
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,918
inhalation or instead of like uh smoking

128
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:55,859
that that's that's matches much better

129
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:59,099
to my knees and my uh physiology let's

130
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:00,538
say but yeah there is no product that I

131
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,479
can access to

132
00:06:00,538 --> 00:06:05,519
it's sad that it's not but also it's

133
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:07,918
interesting for us as the people who as

134
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:09,659
people who are like let's say are

135
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:12,799
working in this industry to see this

136
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:15,780
potential so that's a huge the a nice

137
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,478
space for us to move into and to develop

138
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:21,059
product sure

139
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:23,339
yeah it seems to be that these

140
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:26,100
formulations and the specific use case

141
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:28,500
that these formulations are the big uh

142
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:30,120
advantage and the big uh exciting

143
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,579
opportunity that's coming over the next

144
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,199
five to ten years speaking of huge

145
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:36,599
opportunity can we talk a little bit

146
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:38,520
about the femcan story can you maybe

147
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,759
give everybody a little overview of how

148
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:43,918
you set this company up what the main

149
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:46,319
objectives are and any timelines that

150
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:50,339
consumers might need to know about Yeah

151
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:52,560
so basically we started femcan for

152
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:54,899
different reasons also so first I

153
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,939
shortly say something about femias or

154
00:06:54,899 --> 00:07:00,560
femkin is cannabis and can as yes we can

155
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:03,418
and

156
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,180
the the tagline for femkin is at the

157
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:08,579
home of herbal feminism and family this

158
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:10,740
is female remedies basically so I come

159
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:14,939
with a background of traditional herbal

160
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:16,740
medicine and uh the the way that herbal

161
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:19,680
medicine is some kind of I don't want to

162
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:21,660
say suppressed or ignored but you know

163
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,300
herbal medicine always comes as

164
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:27,120
secondary also when you look at um

165
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:29,340
cannabis in medicine you have the the

166
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,079
dog when you get your cannabis

167
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:33,239
prescribed you have to show the doctors

168
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:36,359
that the doctor has to show to the

169
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:39,300
insurances that all the other ways of

170
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:42,419
treatments are done so it's like they

171
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:45,418
they uh try the second the the first and

172
00:07:42,418 --> 00:07:47,519
the second uh let's say a conventional

173
00:07:45,418 --> 00:07:50,399
treatment and then cannabis can be

174
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:52,680
subscribed which uh I think herbal

175
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:55,198
medicine can be super super beneficial

176
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,060
and why they should come at second or

177
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,639
third maybe they should come parallel

178
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,918
with the first line treatment so that

179
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:03,900
that's one part of it the second part of

180
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:05,758
it is that we want to focus on the

181
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:09,719
female health because

182
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:12,180
I mean when you look at the uh look at

183
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,740
the people who support cannabis I mean

184
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,560
women are less likely to support

185
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:19,019
cannabis women are less likely to try

186
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,780
cannabis if cannabis get legalized and

187
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:24,719
all of that comes from like uh

188
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:28,138
Global surveys like the the one that I'm

189
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,539
giving you is just published by Canadian

190
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:33,180
uh University I cannot remember the name

191
00:08:30,538 --> 00:08:35,580
but it's just just publishes 20 23

192
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:37,978
publication and women also have more

193
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:41,158
negative attitude through consumption of

194
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:44,278
cannabis and that's for me as a

195
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:46,200
scientist as a person who know how uh

196
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:49,259
cannabis can be beneficial for different

197
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:52,379
uh female Health like let's say issues

198
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:54,600
and generally for like the well-being it

199
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:57,720
shouldn't be just medical it could also

200
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:00,600
be adult use and recreational just for

201
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,519
General well-being as a person who know

202
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,980
that and have experience with that that

203
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:07,620
that's a little bit hard on me because

204
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,720
that's negative attitude mostly come

205
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:11,940
from social cultural backgrounds like

206
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,920
these typical good girl bad girl if a

207
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,019
girl small cannabis or do cannabis or

208
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:19,620
any kind of drugs for that matter is bad

209
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:21,259
but it's more let's say acceptable and

210
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:23,339
common for men

211
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:27,000
this kind of

212
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:30,240
um how do you call it this kind of

213
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,360
cultural let's say pushbacks it's

214
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,519
something that we as a woman in cannabis

215
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,860
industry should try to overcome by

216
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,860
talking about that by just bring put

217
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:43,740
more light on this subject that yeah

218
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:46,019
okay if you use cannabis consciously and

219
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:51,000
cautiously it could be more beneficial

220
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:54,919
as harmful and uh it's not uh we should

221
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,958
also whether we go to some kind of like

222
00:09:54,919 --> 00:10:00,539
exhibitions and trade shows you also see

223
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:03,000
that maybe like five to ten percent

224
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:04,980
maximum of the participant or woman the

225
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,458
rest are men especially like in Germany

226
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:11,039
and talking about here and I know that

227
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:13,439
it's like changing little by little but

228
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:16,199
uh we need more voice we need more voice

229
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,519
to talk about how the the benefits and

230
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,500
uh

231
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,019
how do you call it take that's a

232
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,259
stigmatize uh because the silver is a

233
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:26,759
stigma around this topic to take that

234
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:29,639
stigmatizing you out of it so uh

235
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:33,240
basically harm reduction uh

236
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:35,939
way of communication so so that's why as

237
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:39,899
fem can we solely want to focus on

238
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:42,420
female Health the herbs that uh how do

239
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:44,399
you call it effects or endocannabinoid

240
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:45,899
system because again not only cannabis

241
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,778
affect our endocannabinoid system

242
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:52,019
another example is cover cover amazing

243
00:10:48,778 --> 00:10:53,100
amazing plants has also more how do you

244
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:55,259
call it

245
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:58,620
um Affinity

246
00:10:55,259 --> 00:11:02,639
um let's say a stronger Affinity even to

247
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:05,820
uh CB1 receptor than like cannabis also

248
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:06,679
all of these all of that said we want to

249
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:10,740
bring

250
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:12,838
endocannabinoid system uh put light on

251
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:15,000
endocannabinoid system and work with the

252
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:17,579
plants that affect these endocannabinoid

253
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,440
system and also desegnatize the Cannabis

254
00:11:17,578 --> 00:11:22,259
in general yeah

255
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,240
very very interesting and one of the big

256
00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:26,700
hurdles you mentioned there is there or

257
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,639
indeed the actual scientific papers

258
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:34,259
aren't completed yet do you see Germany

259
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:35,939
opening up now with a larger scope

260
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:38,159
and remit to be able to do these

261
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:40,640
scientific trials hopefully over the

262
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:42,778
next coming 12 to 24 months

263
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:45,240
to be honest

264
00:11:42,778 --> 00:11:47,299
12 to 20 to 24 months is a little bit

265
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:50,759
like optimistic

266
00:11:47,299 --> 00:11:52,799
uh I've I I'm not sure to be honest I'm

267
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:55,860
a little bit disappointed people with

268
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:58,259
all of these delays and uh how do you

269
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:01,680
call it that they made a huge probiotic

270
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:04,500
monster around cannabis so definitely

271
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:06,659
you know that we now uh the the

272
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,820
government announced two pillar projects

273
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:11,159
one pillar is that self and communal

274
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:15,560
communication with some kind of a social

275
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:19,319
clubs and the second pillar is that to

276
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:21,958
uh it's a very limited pilot project to

277
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:25,040
some shops that they control the whole

278
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:27,719
supply chain okay

279
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:30,360
these stocks are good are super positive

280
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:32,940
because again it helps a lot to take

281
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:37,019
away a stigma from this topic for from

282
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:39,240
Cannabis and hopefully by how hopefully

283
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:43,379
now universities come much more on board

284
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:46,560
to do research also companies should put

285
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:48,139
more effect and put more how do you call

286
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:53,759
it um

287
00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:55,740
uh put uh resources on uh r d and

288
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:58,679
clinical studies than just trying to

289
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:00,720
bring another new kind of flower which

290
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:03,479
is which is good the diversity in the

291
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:07,740
product is good but we also need some

292
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:10,500
kind of uh we need like solid clinical

293
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:12,839
and clinical studies and observational

294
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:16,320
studies to

295
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:18,899
to to be able to develop good products

296
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,120
so that is I mean I hope I hope because

297
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:23,339
a couple of years ago when I asked one

298
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,100
of my University professors say do you

299
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:29,220
want to start some project with like CBD

300
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:31,019
and ADHD and that was just cbd.com and

301
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:33,660
the reply was oh no no do you want to

302
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:35,519
ruin my reputation but now I see that

303
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:37,620
the research in this direction also in

304
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,480
universities get more and more so yeah

305
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,799
all in all is going in the right

306
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:45,120
direction

307
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:48,059
I wish for for a faster uh moves then

308
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,100
it's like a slow slow so yeah

309
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:52,439
yeah well that's it the entrepreneurial

310
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:54,360
mindset wants everything to move fastly

311
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,360
fastly so you can realize your ideas

312
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,700
