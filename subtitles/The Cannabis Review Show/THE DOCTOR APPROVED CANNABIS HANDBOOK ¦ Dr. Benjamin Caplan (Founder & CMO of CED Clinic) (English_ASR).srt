Dr Kaplan I'm great Owen thanks for

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,960
having me

7
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:26,939
thank you very much very much for coming

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,519
on I know you're a busy man and we have

9
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,719
a very busy schedule

10
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:32,759
you're part of a number of

11
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,500
entrepreneurial Ventures and medical

12
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,880
Ventures and you've got a huge area of

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,859
expertise in boats and I've got to touch

14
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,559
on those towards the end of the show but

15
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:42,600
for now can we start with your book that

16
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:44,280
you've recently brought out called the

17
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,859
doctor approved cannabis handbook the

18
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,840
link will be in all the viewing and

19
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:50,399
listening positions that you're watching

20
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,000
this from can you maybe tell everybody

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,759
what uh motivated you to write this book

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,920
sure I mean I've I've seen the common

23
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:00,479
narrative that cannabis is poorly

24
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,920
understood

25
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,018
um the acceptance of cannabis by the

26
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,820
medical sort of community is is

27
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,618
languishing

28
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:10,079
um the the substance of course is

29
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:13,319
stigmatized um but the really the power

30
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:16,500
of evidence and research and advocacy is

31
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:18,359
is bringing real patients real relief

32
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,579
and it's just kind of lost on the

33
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:22,319
medical establishment

34
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:24,900
um and it seemed like the right thing to

35
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:27,118
do to to collect the patient's care

36
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,560
evidence that I've seen the research

37
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,000
that I'm doing and to share it with the

38
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,240
public in language that everybody can

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,239
understand

40
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:36,478
yeah and you have a huge wealth of

41
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,759
knowledge some of the statistics I was

42
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,379
coming across that over 16 000 patients

43
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,680
who've dealt with there must be a huge

44
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:45,420
data now that you've built up a a huge

45
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,360
database when it comes to the

46
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,460
methodology for going about gaining the

47
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:52,200
new information for the book was there a

48
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:54,059
specific way you went about doing this

49
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,340
or was it taken from data you'd already

50
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,060
accumulated

51
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,399
um

52
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,859
the medical establishment is is just

53
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,659
completely

54
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:05,700
left in the dark you know I think

55
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:07,380
doctors are not taught about medical

56
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,199
cannabis in in med school they're not

57
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:12,539
understanding the therapeutic value if

58
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:14,579
we were painting a picture there's a

59
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:16,979
gigantic hole in the middle which is

60
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:19,860
literally this the system which has the

61
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:21,598
most uh prolific signaling in the human

62
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,500
body and that's the endocannabinoid

63
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:25,199
system

64
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,539
um if you I mean if you imagine the

65
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:29,219
depth of

66
00:02:26,539 --> 00:02:30,719
emptiness in the literature that we're

67
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:31,919
learning about the studies that we're

68
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:33,719
conducting the treatments that we're

69
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:36,119
providing you know

70
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:37,739
of course patients are missing you know

71
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,020
one of the one of the one of the systems

72
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:42,060
which causes joy in our body

73
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,860
um and to have that kind of as a as a

74
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,140
gigantic missing piece in medical care

75
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,760
is ludicrous

76
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:49,679
um so it sort of it became a kind of

77
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:51,239
mission on its own once I was

78
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,620
discovering this to share it with

79
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:54,300
everybody I mean this is something we

80
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,800
shouldn't be without

81
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,379
um and and you know listeners and

82
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,480
viewers might not know but

83
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:01,979
in the last hundred years is really the

84
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,439
only time in human history where

85
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:06,959
cannabis wasn't front and center we have

86
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:08,818
archaeological evidence going back 12

87
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,900
000 years that this was part of ancient

88
00:03:08,818 --> 00:03:11,699
human history

89
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,800
um and certainly throughout the rest of

90
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:16,378
History just until you know the early

91
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,540
20th century this hasn't been part of of

92
00:03:16,378 --> 00:03:21,139
normal dialogue but it's our human it's

93
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:23,878
a human plant

94
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:26,098
the book over 60 in different chapters

95
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:28,799
with a host and multitude of ailments

96
00:03:26,098 --> 00:03:30,839
that can be researched uh and looked at

97
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,459
well when it comes to the future of the

98
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,500
medicine side of things obviously the

99
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:35,939
receptor targeting drugs and

100
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,459
formulations that are going to be able

101
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:40,919
to discover is that the the kind of the

102
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:44,580
big huge Market that's off in the future

103
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:45,719
that most cannabis companies will get

104
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,000
into or do you think that's going to be

105
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:50,699
dominated by Pharma

106
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,080
I mean I it's it's not all smoke and

107
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:54,780
mirrors you know the perception of

108
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,580
cannabis has often been clouded with

109
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,519
with myths and misconceptions and

110
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:01,500
skepticism but as more research has has

111
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,480
emerged it's clear that the therapeutic

112
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,400
benefits aren't just hearsay that people

113
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:07,318
are really finding benefits they're

114
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,060
rooted in rigorous science and evidence

115
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:11,780
and that's the underpinnings of the

116
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:14,098
traditional Pharma World they ground

117
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:15,959
Pharmaceuticals in evidence in studies

118
00:04:14,098 --> 00:04:17,459
in clinical trials

119
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:19,319
um cannabis has just been going through

120
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:21,418
its own natural clinical trial people

121
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:23,339
have consumed it really forever Against

122
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:24,719
All Odds and against whatever laws told

123
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:26,159
them they couldn't and people have found

124
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,380
benefits I mean there are countries

125
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,240
where it's common to cook soup and to

126
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:32,279
drink tea with cannabis and everywhere

127
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,840
else people just did it because it felt

128
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:36,239
good it felt right

129
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:37,918
um so I think you know slowly the

130
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,918
mainstream establishment is catching up

131
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:42,120
with what people have already known

132
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:43,198
the story that was published by the

133
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,780
Journal of the American Medical

134
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,360
Association that's in your book that

135
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:51,000
noticed the increase in 65 and over age

136
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,040
group in using cannabis surely that's

137
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,600
the secret untucked Market that most

138
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,400
people aren't really focusing on I know

139
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,400
there's everybody thinks strong about

140
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,659
get their their modern user over into

141
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,519
the industry and it's not going to be

142
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,960
via smoking it's not going to be via

143
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:06,599
vaping Edibles they're not really

144
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:08,819
getting dosed and Emulsion Technologies

145
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,580
at the scale where they they should be

146
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:13,620
so surely that's 65 and over who can

147
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:15,659
have a pill for a multitude of different

148
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,040
ailments are that secret untapped

149
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,199
audience that people should be focused

150
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,360
on their own deal yeah it's not it's not

151
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,879
so secretive um you know Medicare budget

152
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,439
and Medicaid is close to 30 billion and

153
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:26,699
the government at least in the US but

154
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:28,319
really other governments as well are

155
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:30,478
spending so much money to take care of

156
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:33,418
our our our most sensitive populations

157
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:35,099
these older adults as we get older the

158
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:37,198
ailments of Aging catch up with us the

159
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,240
joints become painful the days become

160
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,280
longer it's harder to sleep you know all

161
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,019
of these things things surprise surprise

162
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:44,758
are tied to the endocannabinoid system

163
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:46,019
and if we're not looking and learning

164
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:48,120
about the endocannabinoid system if

165
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:50,279
we're not treating that we're just

166
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,019
treating half of half of the people we

167
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:54,059
see it's just it's it's it's it's a

168
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:56,279
paradigm without a core Mission without

169
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,560
a core Central piece

170
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:01,679
um the book has of course clear chapters

171
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,240
dedicated to to ailments of Aging

172
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,280
um not the least of which is cancer I

173
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,379
mean most of us get cancer about 40 of

174
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:09,478
people get cancer as we get older

175
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:11,399
um but creating an end-of-life plan I

176
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:14,519
mean imagine we live in a world now

177
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:16,258
where dying is this weird time most of

178
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:18,120
us you know don't have the luxury of

179
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:20,460
dying with Dignity

180
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,439
um it's either costly or disconnected

181
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:24,359
from our families when we're getting

182
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:25,800
sick and going to hospitals

183
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,780
um that shouldn't happen it doesn't have

184
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,240
to happen um and I think there's a way

185
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:33,359
to incorporate cannabinoid therapies and

186
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,240
a cannabinoid understanding of moods of

187
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,120
memory of feeling Joy which can make

188
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,699
aging less uncomfortable

189
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,340
do you see the population-based medicine

190
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:46,620
moving towards a more individualistic

191
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:48,719
approach or do you still think it seems

192
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,579
to be a one-size-fits-all at the moment

193
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,319
well traditional medicine it's one size

194
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:53,939
fits all you you have depression we got

195
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,100
this array of pills to treat you with

196
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:56,939
that's ridiculous all of us are

197
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,560
different

198
00:06:56,939 --> 00:07:00,719
um even one day from the next you know

199
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,120
you might have a beautiful day or see a

200
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,259
beautiful movie and feel differently

201
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,478
um should you be taking the same

202
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:08,400
medicine which amplifies things as if

203
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:09,779
you're not changing at all that Paradigm

204
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:11,758
doesn't make sense

205
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:13,799
um on the other hand you know we we've

206
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,080
sort of fallen in love with this genetic

207
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,639
medicine Where oh my gosh if we only had

208
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:19,740
your map we would understand exactly

209
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:22,620
what works for you but that's not true

210
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:24,598
either you know a our map changes

211
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,759
um you know genes are one thing but the

212
00:07:24,598 --> 00:07:28,680
way they're read is another depending on

213
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:30,240
your environment depending on

214
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,759
um the foods you eat the amount you

215
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,840
sleep your manifestation of of the code

216
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:35,400
is different

217
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:36,899
um so it's not so cut and dry I mean we

218
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:39,000
all wish there was a clear answer that

219
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:40,500
worked for everybody maybe because it

220
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,839
would be simple

221
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,360
but that's not realistic and and what

222
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:47,638
I've found treating patients

223
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,800
individually is that it's it's better

224
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,319
for them nobody wants to feel like they

225
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,120
don't have a voice in their own care

226
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:56,340
when people are empowered with care that

227
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,160
matches their needs their days and it

228
00:07:56,339 --> 00:08:01,560
changes with life we're happier you know

229
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,660
we don't want to be in this sort of Silo

230
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,978
you know this pigeonhole of who I am and

231
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,380
who I should be and what I should feel

232
00:08:04,978 --> 00:08:09,300
like you know people want flexibility

233
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:10,759
and freedom to be different one day from

234
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,900
the next

235
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:15,120
I'm going to move now on to your

236
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:16,679
entrepreneurial success that you've had

237
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,019
can you maybe give everybody an overview

238
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,038
what is the CED Clinic's mission

239
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:22,258
sure

240
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:24,538
um the seed Clinic is pronounced like uh

241
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:26,520
seed like the seed of a plant

242
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:28,560
um the seed mission is is a is a private

243
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:31,859
medical practice that specializes in

244
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,538
cannabis therapies and eocare that's

245
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,879
guiding patients with HIPAA compliant

246
00:08:33,538 --> 00:08:37,439
digital health care services for

247
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:40,740
cannabinoid-based treatment so it's sort

248
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,959
of the the scaling of Medical Care a

249
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,700
doctor like me can see one patient at a

250
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:47,579
time and I can get to know them and care

251
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:49,320
about them and evolve with them as you

252
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:52,560
know their therapeutic Journey changes

253
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,480
but how do we scale someone like me when

254
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:56,399
medical school is not teaching cannabis

255
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,019
doctors are not really plugged in I

256
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,879
think we need a digital solution for

257
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:02,278
that that's what eocare is we're

258
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:04,200
reaching out to Broad audiences learning

259
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:06,000
about who they are what they need and

260
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,040
then giving them individualized care

261
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,860
through a digital platform

262
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:13,199
and the successful uh acquisition you

263
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,600
had of solar Sciences to maybe want to

264
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,339
give people a little bit of a story on

265
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,180
that so it was great to hear a success

266
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:20,279
story

267
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:22,759
sure yeah no I I'm privileged to have

268
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:25,439
that success I think solo was a company

269
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:28,319
trying to give transparency into the

270
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,060
system you know around 2019 we had this

271
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,860
Vapor crisis where people were consuming

272
00:09:30,059 --> 00:09:33,119
cannabis and things

273
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,980
things were happening that we didn't

274
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,959
understand that were bad of course that

275
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,399
was a little bit confusing tobacco smoke

276
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:41,039
with cannabis smoke and it was also

277
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,919
confusing licensed regulated dispensary

278
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:45,179
products with crud that was made on the

279
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:47,159
streets by people that didn't know how

280
00:09:45,179 --> 00:09:49,379
to make their products we've since

281
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:51,179
learned that street products are not

282
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:53,519
safe and dispensary products are

283
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:55,319
generally safe if they're regulated but

284
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,419
during that time it was important for

285
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,278
the public to have transparency and see

286
00:09:57,419 --> 00:10:01,139
what was going on and that was what solo

287
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:03,720
was all about

288
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:05,639
and your work at Green acts Capital are

289
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,980
they one of the top firms when it comes

290
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:10,559
to investment in America

291
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,459
yeah um so green Access Capital is a

292
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,979
unique

293
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:15,479
fund that's raising money from

294
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,639
interested and knowledgeable investors

295
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,800
it's led by a team of really the

296
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:21,838
industry's experts in understanding how

297
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:24,240
cannabis can succeed from a business

298
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,880
perspective they look at new startup

299
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,220
companies ones that have started to

300
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:31,559
generate money but maybe not enough and

301
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:34,440
need to scale and green Access Capital

302
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:36,899
feeds that company enough money so that

303
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,399
they can grow and succeed and that

304
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:41,339
success is shared with the business

305
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,899
community of investors in the fund I

306
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:44,880
serve as an advisor just helping them

307
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:46,500
understand which companies have their

308
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:49,399
stuff together and which companies maybe

309
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:51,899
need more work or need a later look

310
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:53,940
and what are your thoughts currently

311
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:55,679
what's happening in New York do you see

312
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:58,320
the medical side of the industry just

313
00:10:55,679 --> 00:11:00,838
getting pushed to the side there or is

314
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,459
it thriving or how your viewpoints on

315
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:03,959
that territory

316
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:06,239
um well I think New York is struggling

317
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:09,299
with the same struggles that everybody

318
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,459
else is is struggling with

319
00:11:09,299 --> 00:11:14,219
um you know there's a shift in

320
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:15,719
perspective that leads to a rewriting of

321
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,339
our understanding of what cannabis is

322
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,720
you know some people think it's only for

323
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:20,760
medicine other people think it's only

324
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,980
for fooling around you know of course

325
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:24,838
anybody who consumes cannabis finds it

326
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,879
therapeutic you know whether it's an

327
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:28,980
adolescent feeling uncomfortable at a

328
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:30,838
party and just wants to feel relaxed or

329
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:33,539
a grown-up who's at the end of a day

330
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:35,399
wants to unwind and just de-stress these

331
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:38,939
are all therapeutic reasons

332
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:41,759
um the unfortunate thing is that people

333
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:43,920
can sell products for a low a low-cost

334
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:45,059
attract a recreational audience that

335
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:46,679
just wants the fool around and maybe

336
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:48,359
doesn't have enough money and all of a

337
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:50,338
sudden the medical industry gets washed

338
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,320
over part of that is because there

339
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:54,120
aren't medical leaders the medical

340
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,560
establishment has just completely lost

341
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,820
its way

342
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:58,739
um so of course they're not going to

343
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,600
fight for themselves

344
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,399
um but that's part of what I'm doing

345
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,680
with the doctor approved cannabis

346
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,179
handbook is arming the public with what

347
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:08,099
I've learned with the knowledge to

348
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:09,539
understand the value here how medical

349
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,579
cannabis can be applied to almost

350
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:14,039
everybody in almost every illness

351
00:12:11,578 --> 00:12:16,379
whether it's treating the illness at its

352
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:18,599
at its at its sort of foundation or just

353
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:20,159
managing the symptoms of discomfort

354
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,778
um there's something in the cannabis

355
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:23,639
plant for everybody you just have to

356
00:12:21,778 --> 00:12:26,519
learn about it

357
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:29,159
is it safe to say the best medical

358
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:32,459
cannabis companies have still not been

359
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:35,278
created yet or do you think that the

360
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:37,439
current crop of companies have copped on

361
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:39,659
to the plans and formulations of these

362
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,120
specific molecules are going to be able

363
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:44,039
to be an advantageous route for success

364
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,120
for a lot of companies that's a really

365
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:46,860
good question

366
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,440
um I think we haven't scratched the

367
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:53,100
surface yet most people out there

368
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:56,700
including clinicians think CBD and THC

369
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:59,159
is cannabis and those are two drops in a

370
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:01,620
gigantic bucket this plant produces

371
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:04,319
hundreds probably thousands of different

372
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:06,060
compounds Each of which has medicinal

373
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,980
value if we look in the published

374
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:09,838
literature you can pick off each of

375
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,459
those individual molecules and find

376
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,040
research on them you can understand that

377
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:15,719
oh my gosh Alpha pinene when I'm walking

378
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:18,179
in the forest and that that Pine smell

379
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,740
oh I feel like I can breathe better well

380
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:21,778
guess what from a pulmonologist's

381
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:23,220
perspective a lung doctor we see that

382
00:13:21,778 --> 00:13:24,600
actually people can breathe a little bit

383
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:28,019
more easily when they're exposed to

384
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,339
Alpha pinene and that's one of as I said

385
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:31,320
a thousand different compounds here

386
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:34,019
there's so much in this natural Pharmacy

387
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,180
that we have yet to understand I think

388
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:38,759
traditional Pathways the pharmaceutical

389
00:13:36,179 --> 00:13:40,078
industry is not going to be able to use

390
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:41,338
cannabis in the same way that they're

391
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:44,338
used to I think we're going to have to

392
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:46,700
develop new tools new understandings a

393
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:49,500
more natural view of how we can use

394
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:51,000
nature in medicine which I think is

395
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,399
really refreshing we have to sort of

396
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,360
turn a new Leaf here on how we care for

397
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,940
people

398
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,339
fermentation engineering seems to be one

399
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:01,500
of the key areas that could hopefully

400
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:03,720
Propel access these rare molecules and

401
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,339
allow for the the Blends whether that

402
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,800
seems to be come to fruition we shall

403
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:09,180
see yeah there's so so what you're

404
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:11,699
referring to are sort of different ways

405
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:13,559
to surface these active molecules one

406
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:16,200
way is to grow a plant and throw it to

407
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:18,179
chance organic plants grow wildly

408
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,100
another way you can do it is to

409
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:21,899
consolidate lots of plants and pick off

410
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:25,259
the parts you want another way actually

411
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:27,539
is to grow other vectors like yeast or

412
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:29,519
like some bacteria can actually produce

413
00:14:27,539 --> 00:14:31,620
cannabinoids and these are all areas of

414
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,778
explanation exploration to see what

415
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,339
people want what people will buy and

416
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:37,200
what actually works so there's a whole

417
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:38,940
industry donning here that's

418
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,160
um really exciting

419
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:42,839
yeah very much so Last Thing Before I

420
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:45,480
Let You Go if there was one medical

421
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:47,699
cannabis conference in America that you

422
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:50,159
think somebody should attend what would

423
00:14:47,698 --> 00:14:51,240
be your recommendation because as we

424
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:53,100
start to see with the conferences

425
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,560
there's more focus on the After parties

426
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,959
than there is on the content on the day

427
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:59,698
yeah no I'm I don't want to be a Debbie

428
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:02,219
Downer but I found conferences to

429
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:03,359
largely be commercial Ventures you know

430
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,160
there are a couple lectures that are

431
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,980
wonderful and it's nice to hear learning

432
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:10,019
there's often regulators and lawyers and

433
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:12,000
hopefully some doctors talking

434
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:13,980
um but the conferences themselves are

435
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,480
really an opportunity for vendors to

436
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:18,180
sell products

437
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:20,519
um so as a as a viewer as an attendee

438
00:15:18,179 --> 00:15:22,439
you're kind of attending this commercial

439
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:24,120
Fest where people want your number want

440
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,380
to contact you and wants want you to

441
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,480
spend money

442
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:29,519
um that doesn't have much value to me I

443
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,139
tend to to speak at some

444
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,940
um but I quickly leave so I don't have

445
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:34,620
to deal with the crowds

446
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,959
um so I you know I think at the current

447
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:38,639
state of conferences I I usually tell

448
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:41,518
people to steer clear

449
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,440
yeah no it's a good bit of advice for

450
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,698
anybody who wants to learn more I highly

451
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,860
recommend checking out Benjamin's

452
00:15:44,698 --> 00:15:48,179
website it's below and the link to buy

453
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:50,039
the book the doctor approved cannabis

454
00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:52,078
handbook will be on YouTube Spotify

455
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:54,240
you'll have easy access to be able to

456
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:55,439
get a copy of the front for now Benjamin

457
