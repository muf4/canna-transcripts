00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,599
welcome everybody to the latest episode

3
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:14,080
of the cannabis review i am delighted to

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,640
be joined on this show by

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,240
anna catharina for phd she's a senior

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,399
special consultant at the danish

7
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:21,759
technological institute anna how are you

8
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:24,159
keeping today

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,599
fine fine thanks thanks for inviting me

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,839
to the interview

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,359
i'm looking forward to contribute with

12
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:30,879
some experience and knowledge from the

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,239
danish side

14
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:33,920
well that's exactly why you have your

15
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,119
own we're on a tour around europe now to

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,440
kind of piece together who are the

17
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:39,039
players in certain territories and for

18
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,878
most people might understand that

19
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,439
denmark has a huge expertise in

20
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:45,599
cultivation propagation new plan

21
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:48,000
cultures and greenhouse technology and

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,320
plant breeding and whatnot so you're a

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,840
perfect person to bring on to kind of uh

24
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,280
talk about on this show can you maybe

25
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,920
give everybody a little overview of how

26
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,879
you got into the position you're in and

27
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,559
into the medical cannabis space

28
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:01,919
into my position yeah that's a good

29
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:03,358
question

30
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,840
i did a phd

31
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,840
in horticulture at cape hagen university

32
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,478
and at that time i was already connected

33
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,880
to dti

34
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:15,438
and then i switched over the phd to dti

35
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:17,359
to continue working with plant breeding

36
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:19,679
and tissue culture where i was really

37
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:21,680
excited about

38
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,240
and

39
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,159
today we talk about tissue culture

40
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,319
we will indeed yes it's the first topic

41
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,320
we're going to jump onto so for most

42
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,758
people who don't understand the cannabis

43
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:33,679
tissue protocols that you guys are

44
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,159
working on up in denmark can you give an

45
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,240
overview of what a cannabis tissue

46
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,400
protocol is and how you guys are

47
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,000
advancing the industry in denmark

48
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,840
yes i will

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,239
tissue culture is really exciting so in

50
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,840
the when you look to plant propagation

51
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,679
you have two ways of doing it so you

52
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,000
have the classical one where you do

53
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,159
cuttings you cut it a small part of a

54
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,078
plant in a greenhouse and it has no root

55
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,320
and you put it in a substrate

56
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:00,078
like soil and then it's getting roots

57
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:03,039
and there will be a new plant but you

58
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:06,559
can also use tissue culture it's um yeah

59
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,080
in use since the 50s

60
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,840
and there you

61
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,000
take plants in a different environment

62
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,080
you can say so you take greenhouse

63
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,318
material you make a sterilization of the

64
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,959
surface and then you put it in small

65
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:21,280
boxes and they have some jelly-ish

66
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,280
substrate in it it's called medium and

67
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,800
this medium has different hormones

68
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,598
treating the plants and the way that

69
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,439
it's getting rude that it's growing that

70
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:31,280
it has different behaviors so you have

71
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:33,759
completely control about the environment

72
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,680
in this box so that has a huge advantage

73
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:37,280
because you can

74
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,879
direct the plant in the way you want to

75
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,318
have for example when you want to make

76
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:43,280
mass propagation you have a hormone

77
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:46,079
combination use inducing a lot of side

78
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,159
shoots so small plants you can also cut

79
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,760
again and then you put it in the small

80
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:53,039
new chamber and grow a lot of plants

81
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:55,919
and for the production it's really

82
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:58,239
important um that you have

83
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,079
the medium the basic substrate which has

84
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,239
nutritions for the plant you have

85
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,120
hormones who trigger the plant in the

86
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,200
way you would like to have it and um

87
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,200
light is also a factor because it can

88
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:10,958
get stressed plants but it can also do

89
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:13,039
something and the temperature of course

90
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,878
to include in india introduce growth of

91
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:15,919
the plant so you have different factors

92
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:17,120
like

93
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:19,518
yeah like

94
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,400
tools you can use to to modify the plant

95
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,799
behavior and it's completely

96
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,280
closed from the environment so you have

97
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,360
um yeah the possibility to trigger the

98
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,439
plant as you like

99
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,200
okay amazing so it's one of the things

100
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,878
that i've noticed as well the

101
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:36,079
large-scale cultivation in europe

102
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:37,840
everybody seems to think that it's going

103
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,440
to be important mass scale from south

104
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,519
america but the process that you guys

105
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:43,519
are coming up with allow for

106
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,120
a european strains and various different

107
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,200
territories around europe to have their

108
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,080
own large-scale production in the

109
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:53,039
medical space is that correct

110
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,799
yeah there's focus as a different

111
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:55,919
approaches and each company has their

112
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,319
own

113
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:00,318
strategy right but you can see overall

114
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:02,479
there's a trend to investigate a tissue

115
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:04,158
culture because you can also

116
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,518
have a certain quality level because

117
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:07,359
when you have some in tissue culture you

118
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,719
have also control about pests for

119
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,280
example when you have a normal cutting

120
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:13,840
you don't know what is inside um

121
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,680
before you have not a test um so it's

122
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,319
really nice to have the tissue culture

123
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,239
for having pest control but also to make

124
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:21,519
a mass propagation for small space

125
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,599
because otherwise you need us a lot of

126
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,840
space for production

127
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,479
and i think the the points of the

128
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:31,039
quality of the product and the time you

129
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:34,000
can enlarge the production is really

130
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,680
interesting also for the danish industry

131
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,199
okay amazing denmark has a

132
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,759
well-established framework for

133
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,960
partnerships in research i'm going to

134
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,280
move on to the net topic is the

135
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:45,359
importance of collaboration how

136
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:47,039
importance do you see this topic being

137
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,439
and the ability to share

138
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,759
the lab results across europe to enhance

139
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,439
the industry over here

140
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,960
it's definitely important to have

141
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:56,719
collaboration and we have different

142
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:59,120
collaborations so the main collaboration

143
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,639
is between the science and the companies

144
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,800
and there's a long history that you

145
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,280
collaborate together so like a classical

146
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,600
university has research projects with a

147
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:09,599
company and for our institute from the

148
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,439
danish technology institute as a gts

149
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,439
institute we have the role to support

150
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:16,879
the industry we have

151
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:19,360
a classical a team of universities for

152
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:21,680
the basic research we have ours as for

153
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,600
the applied research brings in

154
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,199
the knowledge to the industry and the

155
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,639
industry partner who's interested in the

156
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,879
results

157
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,038
and that is really well supported

158
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,879
um and also there are some different

159
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:35,120
funding systems where

160
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:37,918
companies directly can get help from

161
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,519
gts institutes as our institute is where

162
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:41,519
you can get some support from the state

163
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:43,198
to develop new products optimize your

164
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:45,839
project production

165
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,840
or explore new ways of

166
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,519
setting up your production system where

167
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:50,879
you get some financial support from the

168
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:52,719
state and that's really important but

169
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:54,959
also the network also we have also a lot

170
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,160
of focus in denmark on network we have a

171
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:58,478
lot of network

172
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,120
groups and arrangements that people can

173
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:02,959
meet and you can learn from each other

174
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,879
but in denmark we are also quite open

175
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:06,159
for international collaboration because

176
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:07,519
i mean there are a lot of people out in

177
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,479
the world that have experience with

178
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:13,120
medical cannabis um we have experience

179
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:16,159
of growing and um yeah greenhouse

180
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,079
production you can say or inside in

181
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,520
closed systems but it's also important

182
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:21,359
to get some knowledge about the plant

183
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:23,680
itself and then it's really nicely to

184
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,840
see that there's a collaboration with um

185
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,240
abroad where countries where have

186
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:29,519
experience with medical cannabis and can

187
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,560
give some

188
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:34,079
insight because i think we have the

189
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,399
view on things that we don't need to

190
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:38,719
invest everything by ourselves if it's

191
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:40,239
already out there

192
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,759
yeah i couldn't agree with you more i

193
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,280
think ireland is one of those countries

194
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,879
as well when our government kind of get

195
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:47,038
up to speed that we've got one of the

196
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:48,639
best farming industries in the world

197
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:50,399
over here and there's certain parts of

198
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,000
this industry that are already in place

199
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:53,679
over in ireland it just needs

200
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,598
collaboration and expertise from

201
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,478
different territories to be able to

202
00:06:55,598 --> 00:07:00,560
build a fully uh coherent industry the

203
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:03,519
last topic i wanted to talk to you about

204
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,280
was the danish technological institute

205
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:07,519
what is it that they've gotten so right

206
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:09,439
was it first move was it the ability

207
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,038
that they've already been decades in

208
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:12,639
innovation space and working with

209
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:14,560
planned court culture like this what is

210
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,160
it that a country like ireland could

211
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,918
learn from what the dti have done so

212
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,560
well

213
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:23,758
dti has a really long history we are

214
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,598
more than 112 years old and since 112

215
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,919
years we're helping

216
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:30,159
industry partners to get innovation done

217
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:32,639
in their own business so we are really

218
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,280
used to to spot new

219
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,280
industry branches and and spot where us

220
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:38,799
are missing gaps as well as our gaps

221
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:42,638
where we can fill it with knowledge or

222
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,960
can support with we do courses we do um

223
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,280
technical support we do advising so we

224
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:50,000
we touch from all different points you

225
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:51,519
can say of a business um

226
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,399
and we also in

227
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:57,038
all different industry grains from 3d

228
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:59,279
print over building material or

229
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:01,038
slaughtering advices

230
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:03,519
and plant breeding so um i think what

231
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:05,439
you can learn from from the danish model

232
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:07,120
is that we are really close

233
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:09,680
in the industry and we also like a

234
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,160
partner you can say so it's um we have

235
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,478
long-term relationships over many years

236
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,960
where we hop in and out if it's needed

237
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:18,240
or we are constantly on the side so i

238
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:20,318
think it's um

239
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,360
really good to um

240
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,319
yeah to

241
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,400
to learn that we are getting

242
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,919
some close collaboration i think that is

243
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,399
also really um

244
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:31,598
a big point to improve the work in the

245
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:33,598
company because for us it's really

246
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:36,158
important to understand the company what

247
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,158
is the business case what are the needs

248
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:40,080
and then we are helping so that's also

249
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:41,838
nice when they come back then we can

250
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,278
reactivate that and then we can help

251
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,640
further on

252
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:46,399
okay so

253
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:47,759
it seems we've talked to guys in malta

254
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,759
already and it seems the malta

255
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:52,080
enterprise boards are the people in

256
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:53,759
malta who are doing the investing for

257
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,920
the technological companies in the

258
00:08:53,759 --> 00:09:00,159
cannabis space so the equivalent of that

259
00:08:55,919 --> 00:09:01,919
in denmark is the dti is it

260
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,480
or is there another enterprise board

261
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:06,079
that would assist in investment or

262
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,278
does the cannabis industry all fall

263
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,600
within the dti's realm over in denmark

264
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:14,080
i saw the dti um

265
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,560
i i'm not sure if i got the question

266
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,720
is there a different government body

267
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:21,039
that works within the cannabis industry

268
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,959
in denmark or is it just a danish

269
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:25,919
technological institute

270
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:28,639
okay yeah yeah um

271
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:30,958
as a technology institute is a um

272
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:32,240
yeah private research institute you can

273
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,958
see where you can also get some

274
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,480
consultant so we have two faces you can

275
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,599
say

276
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,839
and in denmark you need to have a

277
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,920
license everyone needs to have a license

278
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,519
um and we were one of the first ones so

279
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:45,199
we could already start and do some

280
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,039
tissue culture and do some experiments

281
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,879
because we are allowed to handle with

282
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:50,719
plants

283
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:54,799
and we have also the applied focus so

284
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,560
universities um have also access

285
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:59,359
some of them i think the final goal will

286
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:01,278
be that all of them have access um

287
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,680
but there's a different focus on doing

288
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:05,600
research doing publications and and our

289
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:07,039
institute is focusing on the industrial

290
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,000
need and what is the focus of the

291
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:10,799
company

292
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,360
um so that there's a there's a time and

293
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:15,838
that we can already start with um

294
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,120
developing protocols and

295
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,279
um

296
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,839
yeah make some strategy plans how you

297
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:23,278
could support this industry and we also

298
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,880
um

299
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:28,320
am holding the

300
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:30,399
now annual medical empire symposium

301
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,040
which is again in the eighth of november

302
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:35,278
together with invest in denmark um very

303
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:37,919
really um looking forward again to

304
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:39,439
collecting the whole um medical cannabis

305
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:41,759
industry so we're covering the whole

306
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,120
value chain from patient over product

307
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:46,480
development over to the um yeah

308
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,720
plant material is a resource for

309
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:52,159
everything where we have

310
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,879
talks about breeding how you plant how

311
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:56,679
you produce plants in the future

312
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:58,879
and this time is also

313
00:10:56,679 --> 00:11:01,519
partnership is a big

314
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:04,000
topic of collaboration because we would

315
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,039
like to enhance interplicionary

316
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,559
research

317
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,559
that we can see in some countries that

318
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:10,319
denmark can learn um something where we

319
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,639
have projects with doctors and plant

320
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,399
producers because sometimes the plant

321
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,240
product is already the end product you

322
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,120
can get to the patient so that would be

323
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,320
really um valuable to have some closer

324
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,600
collaboration

325
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,278
but that day we are really looking

326
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,399
forward because we will combined against

327
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:25,200
science

328
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,440
and

329
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,079
the

330
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:32,800
industry um that data to make a bridge

331
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:34,239
about as a knowledge transfer

332
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:36,000
yeah i think there's still definitely

333
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,440
gaps in the knowledge i think everybody

334
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,278
would be able to agree with that and

335
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,200
it's how quickly we advance

336
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:42,399
those gaps and close them and learn as

337
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,240
much as we can

338
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,440
