00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,000
wealth of wealth of knowledge in this

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,920
topic and it's it's great to be able to

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,840
have a come back to the article that we

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,600
had over here in ireland about some

19
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,600
information that may or may not be

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,039
misleading we'll leave it down to an

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,960
expert like yourselves to give us the

22
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,239
good information on it so i kind of

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,600
could kick things actually i might

24
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:55,359
definitely give the audience a little

25
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,000
brief overview of how you got to where

26
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:59,359
you are in toronto and your expertise in

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,159
the industry

28
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,879
yeah sure so i mean i'm originally from

29
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:07,840
toronto i'm a canadian born and grew up

30
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:11,680
in toronto but did my training in ottawa

31
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,840
uh in pediatric neurology and epilepsy

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,880
and did uh completed my full training in

33
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,960
miami a year there and a year in toronto

34
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:21,759
at the hospital for sick children

35
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:24,158
and um it was kind of following my

36
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,519
training that was really when medical

37
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,439
cannabis

38
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:30,000
was coming up from the grassroots from a

39
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:31,798
lot of the parent organizations

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,560
so this is kind of circa

41
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:39,200
2009 to 2012 2013 and around that time i

42
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,040
had a bit of an interest but

43
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,920
there was a lot of stigma around it and

44
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,840
most the vast majority of doctors and

45
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,840
neurologists were not utilizing it as

46
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,439
all at all and that kind of piqued my

47
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,719
interest i guess and after working for

48
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:52,239
about a year and a half at the hospital

49
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:53,920
for sick children i left and opened up

50
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:55,280
my center the neurology center of

51
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,759
toronto

52
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,000
in as a community neurology practice in

53
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,399
toronto and there i was able to kind of

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,478
be free a little bit of of i guess

55
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,799
hospital oversight administration could

56
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:08,719
pursue some in my own interests and

57
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,039
that's when i really started to move

58
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:12,959
into medical cannabis and it was around

59
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,559
that time that i just started collecting

60
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,439
a lot of patients they were coming to me

61
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,000
and um you know i i kind of through my

62
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:22,639
own experience my own self learning

63
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,080
and through my patients who i owe a huge

64
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:26,159
amount of thanks because they've taught

65
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,400
me so much really was able to move

66
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,560
forward into the medical cannabis world

67
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,879
and started with pediatric epilepsy

68
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,959
which was my area that i'm trained in

69
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,399
and had the most confidence and felt

70
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,719
that it was safe to

71
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,400
pursue that with medical cannabis

72
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:42,318
and subsequently evolved that into other

73
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,879
pediatric neurological disorders and

74
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:47,359
adults as well so that's culminated in

75
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:49,518
kind of years of experience now and

76
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,519
through many patients both adults and

77
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,680
kids as i mentioned through epilepsy and

78
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,200
non-epilepsy conditions

79
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,879
i've we've gained quite a lot of

80
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,719
experience here in medical cannabis

81
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:01,919
we're just reviewing all of our patients

82
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:04,000
now and we have uh we're following over

83
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:07,119
500 patients right now for various

84
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,120
neurological disorders

85
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,920
oh sorry i think i lost your urine

86
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,919
you're on mute

87
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:21,280
hi there i'm back again so um yeah

88
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,120
perfectly positioned then to be able to

89
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,039
assist us in this next topic that we're

90
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,719
talking about so you we were talking

91
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:28,639
beforehand you've read the article that

92
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:30,318
was published in the irish times where a

93
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:31,598
number of doctors came out saying they

94
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:33,439
weren't sure about the products that

95
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:35,119
were being prescribed

96
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:37,359
from your point of view and over in

97
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,039
canada are there a safe list of products

98
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,120
that are prescribed to patients over in

99
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:43,039
canada and if so are they available

100
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,360
available in europe

101
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:47,280
yeah that's really important uh because

102
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,360
you know each country tends to have its

103
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,199
own regulatory framework and its own

104
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,280
product availability so most products

105
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:55,280
that i have access to in canada are

106
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,280
canadian products

107
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,840
we have very few products coming from

108
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,680
elsewhere and that has to do a lot with

109
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,080
regulation but a lot to do with cost as

110
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,000
well but the products are similar in a

111
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:10,799
sense that the ratios for thc cbd um are

112
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,959
similar or and the the corresponding

113
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,560
additives whether they be terpenes or or

114
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,560
other components are also similar so

115
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,319
there is similarity between the products

116
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,199
uh that's that are available in canada

117
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:24,240
versus the rest of the world and um you

118
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,560
know but but predominantly through our

119
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,000
regulatory framework here we can access

120
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,399
those products quite readily that are

121
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,918
canadian and really there's no sense to

122
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:33,279
kind of import products at this point

123
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:36,159
and utilize it just because the costs

124
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:38,159
are are enormous for instance epidiolex

125
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,439
is one that often gets asked about in

126
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,000
canada

127
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:44,959
and and gw pharma has not moved into

128
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,478
canada as a market here so to purchase

129
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:48,719
epidiolex

130
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,560
is is just exorbitant for families it

131
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,840
doesn't make any sense at all when we

132
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,680
have

133
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,560
analogous products

134
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,639
such as purified cbd oils here available

135
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,199
in canada

136
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,360
okay and do you see

137
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,639
in your opinion the message the best

138
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,720
medicines are the best version of

139
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,199
cannabis for epilepsy is there a

140
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,400
specific ratio of thc

141
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,160
that seems to work best is is pure cbd

142
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:16,000
actually proven to have worked with

143
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,520
epilepsy patients where there's no thc

144
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,038
in it so

145
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:21,038
we obviously have a much more stricter

146
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:22,399
rules over here when it comes to thc

147
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:24,560
content so

148
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:27,198
i'm just curious as to know is there the

149
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,639
perfect ratio of thc to cbd for an

150
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,360
epilepsy medicine

151
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,439
yeah this is uh a question that remains

152
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,439
unanswered so we need to know this and

153
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:37,038
we don't know this yet because we

154
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:39,038
haven't done any real head-to-head

155
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,719
trials on the different invariant ratios

156
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:42,800
so we have

157
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,880
really good randomized control trials

158
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,800
with purified cbd products and those

159
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:50,000
were the main ones that came out over

160
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,680
the last you know decade and those that

161
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,839
that gives us some direction from the

162
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,840
purified cv point of view some outcome

163
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:57,599
data and some adverse effect data and

164
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,359
that's very high level evidence so it's

165
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,560
good to rely on that but then we also

166
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,800
have some studies that have come out

167
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,639
that have been more open label uh

168
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,520
related studies they don't they're not

169
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,519
as high level um in terms of evidence as

170
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:13,758
we have available for the purified cbd

171
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:16,478
products but they certainly show um some

172
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,479
some positive outcomes for cbd rich

173
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:20,719
extracts those are seed those are oils

174
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:22,800
that have a higher amount of cbd in

175
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,720
proportion to thc but have a significant

176
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,478
amount of thc

177
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,000
in their products as well and we have

178
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:29,839
good outcome data there and we have good

179
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,079
safety data there too

180
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:33,599
now when it comes to that perfect ratio

181
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:35,918
question it's often a question i get

182
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,919
asked a lot by patients and it kind of

183
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:39,758
doesn't really matter because if you

184
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:41,918
have experience in canvas medicine you

185
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,038
can design your own ratio i you know for

186
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:48,159
example i can give a purified cbd oil

187
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:49,918
and give x number of milligrams of cbd

188
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,400
but then i could also supplement that

189
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:54,240
with a purified thc oil and then give x

190
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:56,239
number of milligrams of tg i can make my

191
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,960
own ratios so i don't think there's a

192
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,680
perfect ratio i think that that question

193
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:03,680
is is a is a big black box and we still

194
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,000
have yet we really don't have an

195
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,160
understanding and the truth is

196
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
i think that the resultant answer is

197
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,880
going to come out of the certain

198
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,079
epilepsy conditions depending on what is

199
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:18,478
driving the epilepsy disorder that is

200
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:21,198
going to be what determines the ultimate

201
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:24,000
proportion of cbd to thc or other

202
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,038
cannabinoids there isn't going to be a

203
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,079
perfect

204
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:30,159
proportionate amount of cbd thc to all

205
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:32,318
epilepsy syndromes i think that's a bit

206
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,479
of a misunderstanding how epilepsy works

207
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,919
because epilepsy just means a tendency

208
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:38,399
to have seizures but there can be

209
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:40,719
thousands of causes for that tendency so

210
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:43,279
we have to treat the tendency and not

211
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,680
the actual seizures and that's the

212
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:47,198
medicine to that will be

213
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,280
that's coming in the future for medical

214
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,759
cannabis to really understand um the

215
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:53,359
proportion based on the disease entity

216
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,400
that's causing the epilepsy if that

217
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,000
makes sense

218
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:57,120
yeah no completely and i think that's

219
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,120
one of the things that hinders the

220
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,598
doctors over here is the ability to dose

221
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,519
a patient perfectly i think the future

222
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:06,959
of medical cannabis is a patient being

223
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:08,959
given a an option of both and it their

224
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:10,318
own individual ratio is going to be

225
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,239
determined but as you said you're going

226
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,000
to have standardized medicine based on

227
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,560
the different ailment that you've got or

228
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,800
the age group or the health uh group

229
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,240
that you're sitting within

230
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,439
do you ever see a scenario where

231
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,319
somewhere like over in ireland we

232
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:27,120
haven't legalized cannabis to grow yet

233
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,879
is there an argument for if we're going

234
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,639
to create a grow industry that we should

235
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,639
be looking at what are the ailments that

236
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,479
people suffer from in ireland and let's

237
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:36,240
look at the strains that work best for

238
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,000
these ailments so if there is going to

239
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,158
be a medical cannabis program that there

240
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,679
is strains and products that are made in

241
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:43,120
ireland they're available for irish

242
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,319
patients

243
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,480
yeah again i think that's going to be

244
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,879
difficult um you know where do you stop

245
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,480
there but i.e which varieties of

246
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:51,759
cannabis do you pick and then when you

247
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,800
pick those right in cannabis which

248
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:57,120
ailments do you pick i mean you can you

249
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:59,679
can individualize this forever and ever

250
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,360
you can reduce this down to you know

251
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:02,319
so many different levels that that's

252
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,519
going to be

253
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,680
a real complicated uh path to take and i

254
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,959
honestly i don't think i know the answer

255
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:11,039
there i don't know if anybody could

256
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:12,719
reliably know the answer there it sounds

257
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:14,319
like a great idea and that sounds like

258
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,839
where things are headed so i guess one

259
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,519
way to look at that is

260
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,440
ultimately probably what's going to be

261
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,278
very important here is the individual

262
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,080
genetics i think the the

263
00:09:22,278 --> 00:09:26,720
pharmacogenetics and the understanding

264
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,959
of how genetics uh ex

265
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,959
affect the endocannabinoid system

266
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:33,599
that is all that and time is going to

267
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:35,359
help us dictate the the right treatment

268
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,959
approaches for patients and then in

269
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,879
addition to the disease state as i

270
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,799
mentioned before so it's the genetics

271
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,879
and the actual disease the genetics of

272
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:44,799
an individual and the actual disease

273
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:46,240
causing whatever ailment it is i think

274
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:48,559
the combination of that and really

275
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,080
understanding that and how it interplays

276
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:52,319
with the endocannabinoid system will

277
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,480
ultimately allow us to tailor therapies

278
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,560
accordingly rather than going kind of

279
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,480
the other approach from the other end i

280
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:00,079
think if we do that from the other end

281
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,360
he could do that forever and i don't

282
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,278
know if we would really come up with

283
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,120
good answers there but to um to help

284
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:09,519
with that right now because we have to

285
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,919
kind of work with what we have right now

286
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,679
um it's important for for a practitioner

287
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:17,039
like myself an experienced practitioner

288
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:18,799
to develop standardized protocols based

289
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:20,000
on the best available evidence and

290
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:22,078
that's what we do at my center and

291
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,039
that's what i've developed here so just

292
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:26,719
as an example for our epilepsy patients

293
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:29,919
we have a very standardized protocol

294
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,680
that works through successive phases and

295
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:33,759
those phases so all patients that come

296
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:36,000
in with epilepsy from a certain cause

297
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:37,439
start in a phase one uh we work them

298
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,039
through the phase one and then if they

299
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,320
fail they go to phase two if they fail

300
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,000
they go to phase three and as we go

301
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,839
through those phases the treatment

302
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,919
becomes more and more individualized to

303
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,200
the to the person and then that way at

304
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:51,838
least i know i'm standardizing myself

305
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,839
and then i can use those protocols to

306
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,440
base further treatment decisions for my

307
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,440
entire population but also for the

308
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,440
individual so that's one way that a you

309
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,120
know a practitioner right now can try to

310
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,880
approach these things but when you start

311
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,039
to do all these different kind of

312
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,559
various different approaches then you

313
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,399
might not really know what you're doing

314
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:11,039
and that could lead to actually causing

315
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,799
more harm than good

316
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:14,399
okay so that kind of leaves me on the

317
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:15,838
last topic i want to talk about is

318
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,839
future medicines

319
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,480
it seems to be after our discussion now

320
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:24,480
that the perfect scenario is purified

321
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:26,399
thc purified cbd and a ratio balance for

322
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,639
each individual patient

323
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,639
is that how you see the the medical

324
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,639
cannabis industry unfolding over the

325
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:35,278
next number of years

326
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,799
it might be that's real hard

327
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,399
it might be it might be and i'm not

328
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:40,879
saying that's what i do here just to

329
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,278
clarify i do use the oils with certain

330
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:44,879
proportions so it's not so much about

331
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:46,879
that proportion right now for me it's

332
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:49,439
more about the actual dose the actual

333
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:51,200
milligram dose because if i know that

334
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,279
that can stay consistent from patient to

335
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,680
patient so for instance coming back to

336
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:58,958
the phased protocols we have our phase

337
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:02,319
one protocol um targets reaching a dose

338
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:04,559
of 300 milligrams of cbd as as an

339
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,600
example in most patients so i'm just

340
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:09,919
generalizing right now um so knowing and

341
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,839
that's based on the available evidence

342
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:13,679
that that has been produced and there's

343
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,120
some again there's some other slight

344
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:16,319
changes there if anybody wants to

345
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,720
comment on this i'm very happy to

346
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,720
discuss in detail with people but um you

347
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,720
know that's the first target so it's

348
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,480
more of a milligram dose because that

349
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,480
can stay consistent then i can read the

350
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,320
literature and i can see what's being

351
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,399
used from a milligram based dose and not

352
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,480
so much these proportions to be very

353
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,120
honest when it comes down to how much

354
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,039
thc is being included or whatnot i do

355
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,039
have standards for that but sometimes

356
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:41,439
i'm constrained by the cost

357
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:44,078
for instance um

358
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,959
for instance sorry about that there

359
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:52,399
for instance the

360
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:53,919
the cost of high cbd rich extracts is

361
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,759
really expensive and totally

362
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:57,838
unaffordable for families and we have no

363
00:12:55,759 --> 00:13:00,240
public coverage of our cannabis here so

364
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,320
sometimes i'm at a loss and i have to

365
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,639
offer a patient

366
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,040
a higher amount of thc proportionate to

367
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,959
cbd when really i really want to target

368
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:11,039
a higher cbd to thc proportion so i'm a

369
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:12,559
bit constrained by other factors and i

370
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,838
know that that's some of the difficulty

371
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:17,199
that we see

372
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:19,279
in other countries right now as well so

373
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,759
it tends to be that cost does kind of

374
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:23,679
drive where things are at so so coming

375
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:26,159
back to your question i would love a

376
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:28,479
scenario in which i could just design my

377
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:30,559
own proportions and help patients in

378
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,839
that sense but it's not practical due to

379
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,078
cost that's not practical due to

380
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,920
regulatory framework um so i'm stuck

381
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:37,359
with having to use the proportions that

382
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:39,519
are available and that are affordable

383
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,399
for patients so i try to manipulate the

384
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,399
protocol for those patients accordingly

385
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,120
okay interesting do you know of any

386
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,639
products in europe that you think are

387
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,198
worth keeping an eye out for or is

388
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,959
epideric seems to be the main one

389
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:55,039
um well

390
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,958
again i i i probably don't want to go

391
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:59,759
into mentioning specific products yeah

392
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:00,799
dialects yeah i mean epidiolex is the

393
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:02,720
reason why i have a dialects and i

394
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:03,838
mentioned it is so popular epidiolex was

395
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,320
the product that was used in the

396
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,399
randomized control trials in the us that

397
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,079
really uh resulted in

398
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,120
approval by the fda and approval in

399
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:14,958
europe um so so it's kind of a little

400
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,560
bit of that gold standard if you really

401
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:17,599
go back and look at the

402
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:19,119
trials that have been done but

403
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,000
subsequent to that there are many trials

404
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,839
in israel trials in canada um you know

405
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,919
there's work in germany that's been done

406
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,480
that has used cbd rich extracts from

407
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:30,399
various different companies with results

408
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,639
that are as good as what we saw on

409
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,720
epidiolex trial or sometimes better

410
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,480
given that there was no no these are not

411
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,959
just the same degree of evidence and

412
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,039
quality of control in those trials um

413
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:44,319
but that's at least points to you know

414
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:45,919
positive signal here that there are cbd

415
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,079
rich extracts from various different

416
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:50,000
companies that contain thc that are

417
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:52,559
effective in epilepsy from my personal

418
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,120
experience with my patients um we see

419
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:57,599
this we definitely see this and in some

420
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,959
cases thc is necessary so we just

421
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,240
actually published a paper from my

422
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:02,479
center here in conjunction with the

423
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,360
university of montreal my colleague dr

424
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:08,480
will um where we showed a case series of

425
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:11,680
patients who who failed cbd

426
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,920
but then responded to thc and

427
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:16,638
incremental doses of thc we've got a

428
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,360
great case study that shows a resolution

429
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,079
of

430
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,720
complete resolution of seizures uh male

431
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:26,078
development neurologically and eeg

432
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:28,000
normalization with thc not with cbd so

433
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:29,599
there is a rule here for it we have to

434
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,039
understand it a little bit better and i

435
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,278
think anybody who has some understanding

436
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:36,958
of the endocannabinoid system

437
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:38,799
can understand where and how thc

438
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:40,799
comes into play and that was one of my

439
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:43,439
you know big responses to the irish

440
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,958
times article um was it just speaks to

441
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,680
me that there's a lack of education

442
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:49,679
about thc and an overall vilification of

443
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:52,159
this substance probably embedded deeply

444
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:54,479
within our societies our international

445
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:56,480
society stigma against chc and we have

446
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,039
to really be a bit more open to this and

447
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,440
realize where we're coming from and uh

448
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:02,719
look at this more objectively like true

449
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,800
medical practitioners and true

450
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,879
scientists should

451
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,958
and i'm happy to share the uh the link

452
