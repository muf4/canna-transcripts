of the character of jack herrera who

23
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:54,078
hawaii was called the emperor

24
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:55,439
yeah yeah i'd love to uh

25
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,160
jack was

26
00:00:55,439 --> 00:01:00,159
basically my mentor my original mentor

27
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:02,718
in the cannabis industry the cannabis

28
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:06,959
industry you know it was a lot different

29
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:09,200
uh 30 years ago i met jack in 93

30
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:12,000
in santa cruz california

31
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,719
and he was touring around california and

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,519
america and he was just promoting

33
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:18,879
legalization um he's called the emperor

34
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,039
because he wrote a book called the

35
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:23,118
emperor awares no clothes

36
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,400
and i think i think the book first came

37
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:27,759
out in like 84 or 85

38
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,960
and

39
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,159
it was basically about why hemp was made

40
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:35,118
illegal

41
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:38,960
and it was pretty it was a succinct and

42
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:41,118
concise uh kind of overview of

43
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:43,679
why we're dealing in a time of

44
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:44,560
prohibition for cannabis and hemp

45
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,880
and

46
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,079
he was uh he was

47
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:52,239
insanely passionate about the movement

48
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:54,399
uh he didn't smoke weed until he was 30

49
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:56,078
and got out of the army and then when he

50
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,000
did smoke weed he was like damn they've

51
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:00,478
been lying to me the whole time this is

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,799
this is pretty benign stuff here and

53
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:05,359
they said it was like the devil's weed

54
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,560
and something just lit up in him and he

55
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:10,239
became the uh the

56
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,680
there's nobody that i could even think

57
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,360
of that came close to pushing uh uh

58
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,480
cannabis reform

59
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,480
more than

60
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:23,280
jack hare and he was a he was a gruffled

61
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:25,359
son of a buck and he took no prisoners

62
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,878
and he was just

63
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,680
very direct

64
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:28,639
uh

65
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,800
and

66
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:33,039
you know he if you weren't into cannabis

67
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,239
being legalized like tomatoes as he

68
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:38,000
would say then he wasn't a why he wasn't

69
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,640
he wasn't into

70
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,878
your model of over regulation he thought

71
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:45,439
it to be a very benign thing and that

72
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:48,878
that everybody should have uh access to

73
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:50,560
it and he fought until his dying day

74
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:52,639
to make that happen

75
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,239
that's amazing he was a very thick skin

76
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,719
in the early days i'm sure there was a

77
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,519
lot of shade thrown his way

78
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,878
i mean for sure it's like we you know we

79
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,158
were out on the

80
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:06,158
being out on haight ashbury or telegraph

81
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:08,799
avenue with jack or down

82
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:10,000
at the la coliseum in the parking lot

83
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,519
even in the parking lot of the dead

84
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,840
shows you know it's like you never know

85
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,280
who would be like

86
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,878
more like when it was on the street

87
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,479
though and people would come up whenever

88
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:20,878
our signs with legalizing weed and they

89
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:21,919
would admonish us and chastise us or

90
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:24,479
laugh

91
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:26,719
and uh i always say nobody's laughing

92
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:26,719
now

93
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:31,519
yeah exactly that's for sure i've got to

94
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,199
move on to the next topic because it's

95
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,519
it's a pretty huge and popular

96
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:37,199
conference that happens in the three

97
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,840
major cities can you give everybody an

98
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:41,839
overview of how you set up the icbc its

99
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,799
history and what the plans are for the

100
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,039
future

101
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,680
uh yeah yeah basically i've been

102
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:49,039
producing events my whole life uh mostly

103
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,000
music events

104
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:54,400
and then about 10 years ago i run i own

105
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,158
a big medical marijuana clinic in oregon

106
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,158
and about 10 years ago we're getting all

107
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,318
these questions that were asked to us

108
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:02,719
about these this this new burger

109
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:04,238
burgeoning industry in america

110
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:05,919
two and two equal four to me and i was

111
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,000
like well let's put this conference

112
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:10,559
together and so we we created the

113
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,039
biggest b2b conference in oregon and

114
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,840
since i had lived in europe for eight

115
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:16,639
years and uh was very

116
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,160
uh

117
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:22,400
very euro euro savvy and euro passionate

118
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,240
i wanted to

119
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,839
do events over there and all around the

120
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,079
world and

121
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:30,519
i just saw a niche in international

122
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:32,959
cannabis business in

123
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:35,279
2014 basically is when i came up with

124
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:37,680
the idea for the icbc

125
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:40,159
and we just pushed forward and i went to

126
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,199
uh basically i went to germany i went to

127
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,120
berlin and and the germans were like oh

128
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,879
alex we are so worried for you we do not

129
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,399
know if an event like this will happen

130
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:50,000
five hundred dollars a ticket there's a

131
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:51,758
lot of money and you know and i was like

132
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,680
well i'm working for me too

133
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,639
and uh we just took a big chance and i

134
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,600
just went for it and berlin now has

135
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:02,000
become the biggest b2b event in europe

136
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,320
and we're scaling that event next year

137
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,079
it's going to be almost 5 000 people and

138
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:11,120
about 350 companies uh with over 75

139
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:13,758
countries represented so we are scaling

140
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,519
that model big time um

141
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,120
and i just knew germany is kind of the

142
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:19,519
center of

143
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,439
continental europe and whatever they do

144
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,758
goes to europe so i figured they're

145
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:26,079
going to eventually go they did with

146
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:29,120
medical they are now with cbd

147
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:31,279
uh legalization looks on the horizon uh

148
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,199
and looks like it's on the horizon and

149
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,638
then uh and otherwise i do these other

150
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,120
satellite events i teamed up with

151
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:40,319
spannabis the biggest uh consumer event

152
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,399
in europe and uh we do the one day b2b

153
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,319

154
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,879
uh investment events in zurich

155
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:49,279

about 250 people barcelona with spanish

161
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:05,279
that's about a thousand people but

162
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:06,879
berlin is the event we we're scaling and

163
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:09,918
then we're keeping our other events

164
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:11,600
really intimate and uh

165
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:13,279
just smaller

166
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,280
and not scaling them

167
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:17,519
okay amazing some more niche marketed

168
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:19,279
events for targeted exact industries and

169
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,918
then the main scalable

170
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:23,279
uh event i i'd highly recommend anybody

171
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:24,879
who hasn't been to the one of berlin

172
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:26,879
should definitely book their ticket for

173
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:28,639
uh next year there was three just

174
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:31,120
previously happened in august if i'm not

175
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,400
mistaken yeah we we pulled it off in

176
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,879
august it was

177
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,638
miracles do happen on yeah yeah the

178
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:39,120
challenges around those events i'm sure

179
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,600
will be uh less hindered next year will

180
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,000
there be more more freedom and

181
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,840
accessibility for people to come so

182
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,680
book your tickets for next year before

183
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:50,159
it sells out i'd highly recommend it

184
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,000
gonna move on to the last topic which is

185
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,400
an overview of european cannabis you've

186
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,079
got just a deep understanding yourself

187
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:58,879
of the various different territories the

188
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:01,279
recent elections in germany bode well

189
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:03,279
for a legalized industry over there what

190
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,279
do you know on the ground

191
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:07,119
you might be able to inform the viewers

192
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:08,638
yeah well we've been following this for

193
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,240
a long time they've called it the

194
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:14,400
jamaica coalition and the spd which are

195
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,478
basically the conservatives

196
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:18,318
excuse me the cdu which are basically

197
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:21,598
the conservatives have been in power for

198
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,759
now what is it 16 years and although we

199
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:28,319
even saw a little bit of movement with

200
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:31,520
the cdu we had a member of

201
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,280
the cdu speak at the last icbc which was

202
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:35,198
which was historical

203
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:37,279
uh however

204
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,439
what we see now in germany is a huge

205
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:41,439
shake-up and they're going to form the

206
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:46,160
coalition will probably be

207
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:49,279
with the greens uh and the uh

208
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,360
the uh ftp party and so

209
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:53,359
with the with the social democrats so it

210
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,080
looks like the cdu the conservative

211
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,439
government will not be part of this new

212
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:59,839
coalition

213
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:02,079
and so two of the three members of the

214
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:02,878
coalition have clearance succinct plans

215
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,839
for

216
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,360
uh

217
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,478
legalization

218
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,680
and even when i ask my most pessimistic

219
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:12,079
uh

220
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,720
cynical german friends of how they feel

221
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:16,959
about legalization a year ago they would

222
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,639
have been like we're not sure

223
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:21,439
now everyone seems to think that

224
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:24,319
legalization is on the horizon just

225
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:26,719
since the last few months when we could

226
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,680
see that this this when we could see

227
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,639
what the polling numbers were for

228
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,799
for the new the the election uh

229
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:36,879
everything's completely shaken up in

230
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:39,838
europe and a lot of people think that

231
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:42,320
legalization is uh

232
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,320
it'll be it'll be uh

233
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,000
on the forefront of the new coalition's

234
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,399
agenda

235
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,080
yeah i think the the legal experts in

236
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,799
the cannabis industry in germany are

237
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,519
gonna do well over the next 12 to 24

238
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:58,000
months with the applications of licenses

239
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,720
yeah we are we are very happy about the

240
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
the election results when it comes to

241
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,440
to cannabis

242
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,519
specifically i should say yeah exactly

243
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,200
what other territories we saw luxembourg

244
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,480
recede a little bit basically on their

245
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,680
big announcement that they're going to

246
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,360
have an industry but i don't know

247
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,958
whether that was just one outlier of a

248
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,879
politician

249
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:19,199
speaking out of turn or did you hear

250
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:21,919
more about it look here's what i here's

251
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,839
what i think i think after all this

252
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:26,958
everyone thinks it could be luxembourg

253
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:29,600
or sweden or or portugal or they have

254
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:32,559
ideas excuse me switzerland

255
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,600
luxembourg or portugal i think those are

256
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:35,278
going to be the places that will

257
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,200
legalize first

258
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:40,399
and i actually think it's going to be

259
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:43,519
germany now and i think germany will be

260
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:45,919
the first country to legalize in like a

261
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,959
robust real legalization not a decrim

262
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,559
but uh but a recreational full market

263
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:54,079
yeah and i think that was the case with

264
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:55,679
medical and i think that you know i

265
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,600
wouldn't have predicted this a year ago

266
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,039
but now i think that germany will

267
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,720
actually have the first clear

268
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,958
legalization laws

269
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,720
in europe before luxembourg before

270
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:06,559
switzerland and luxembourg and

271
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,800
switzerland are really important but or

272
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:09,919
switzerland is even more important but

273
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:12,159
uh

274
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:14,240
but when germany legalizes then that you

275
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:16,719
know europe goes where germany goes

276
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,399
generally and so it's it'll it'll be a

277
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,879
seminal moment but that's my big bold

278
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,879
prediction

279
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,480
yeah no i think that's if you get

280
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:28,639
germany going and then france goes hand

281
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:32,079
in hand i think you'll have a european

282
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:34,159
flip within 12 to 18 months it could be

283
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:35,439
that close uh we really actually think

284
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:38,000
that it might be

285
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,320
within 12 to 18 months yeah

286
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,440
and have you see obviously the medical

287
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,120
industry is

288
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,640
leading the way at the moment in europe

289
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,078
that's pretty much where all the talk is

290
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:48,240
at the moment you've got a lot of

291
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:49,679
territories with denmark up there made

292
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,519
in denmark brand coming in the

293
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:54,399
pharmaceutical industry strong presence

294
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,560
in pharma malta same strong presence in

295
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,159
pharma they've started processing

296
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:00,399
product coming into there turning it

297
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:02,000
into goods with the major multisign do

298
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,679
you see those two territories having a

299
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,320
leg up on everywhere else or do you see

300
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:08,559
somewhere like the uk or ireland which

301
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,800
is already got the home base for a lot

302
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,479
of the major uh global headquarters for

303
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:14,479
companies here anyway i don't see it's a

304
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,360
reason why cannabis might not be the

305
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,959
same

306
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,039
yeah i mean i don't think i don't think

307
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,759
the emphasis the previous infrastructure

308
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:22,240
uh

309
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:24,559
matters necessarily of of where

310
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,959
someone's poised in terms of a

311
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:29,919
farmer perspective because this is kind

312
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:32,319
of uh you know it's though it is pharma

313
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:34,000
and though big that infrastructure could

314
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,680
be used and one day

315
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,240
uh might be used uh right now you see i

316
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:43,759
think denmark is pretty much the

317
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:47,039
i mean malta has its niche right uh uh

318
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:48,879
no doubt but it's so small denmark is is

319
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:51,278
uh

320
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:53,278
they're they're i think they're next to

321
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:55,838
bedrock and from holland

322
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:58,958
uh denmark is putting the most cannabis

323
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:01,279
into the medical market in germany and

324
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:04,638
they're doing it in a way that's uh

325
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:06,559
efficient smart a good price a decent

326
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:09,360
product there's no i'm from the west

327
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:11,599
coast so all of the medical it doesn't

328
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,120
compare no it's it's

329
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,959
it doesn't

330
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,759
i think denmark with their with their

331
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:20,319
past and ornamental flower growing and

332
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:21,759
the kind of strong tissue culture

333
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,839
departments that they've got up there

334
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:25,278
they seem to be growing as premium

335
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,120
product as they've gotten within a

336
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:28,879
couple of years totally they've done a

337
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,480
great job and basically they did what

338
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:32,480
holland should have done and what we

339
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,200
expected maybe holland or the

340
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,600
netherlands to do right and then denmark

341
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:40,160
just kind of stepped in and took it to

342
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,800
the next level when holland was was they

343
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:46,240
never they never had the the advocacy or

344
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:48,639
the organization to to to push something

345
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,079
like this to a to the next degree like

346
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,759
like denmark did they just kind of

347
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:54,719
monopoly with bedrock and then they have

348
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:56,480
their coffee shop scene so it was like

349
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,360
so i was surprised holland didn't do it

350
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,039
you know

351
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,000
but denmark did it and they took the

352
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:02,319
reigns

353
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,879
yeah and do you see the fact that europe

354
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,519
is an agricultural heavy uh society and

355
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:08,639
civilization once legalization comes do

356
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,560
you see

357
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,399
ireland having its own strain france

358
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:15,359
having its own strains spain having its

359
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:17,360
own dominant strain and it

360
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,759
kind of nuanced almost like wine or

361
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,879
something like that first for sure i

362
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:24,000
mean

363
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:26,159
i i i think that that's just

364
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,879
what cannabis is and what cannabis does

365
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:29,199
and

366
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:32,000
i i think the region will help obviously

367
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,639
the southern regions are are better but

368
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,600
because it is so in america we grow a

369
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,039
lot of outdoor cannabis right but in um

370
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,600
but in europe because it's a little more

371
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:43,838
clinical a lot of it's going to be at

372
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:47,040
least at the beginning uh mandated

373
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:49,360
hydroponics yeah yeah and it's it's not

374
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:52,240
something i like i like soil grown sun

375
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,639
grown uh cannabis that's what i use it's

376
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,759
a it's just a more

377
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,639
uh

378
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:00,480
chill profile uh not as big up and down

379
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,839
a little more consistent i have the

380
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,759
luxury of that because i live on the

381
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,000
west coast but um

382
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:08,159
of that option but uh

383
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,198
yeah no i think that uh

384
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:13,120
i think every you know the sooner people

385
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:14,719
whatever countries legalize first or get

386
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,120
into the game they're going to be able

387
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,839
to have this like branding advantage

388
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,480
also of saying oh that's some slovenian

389
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,880
weed or that's some the man the irish

390
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,519
boys lads know what they're doing and

391
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:30,720
they've got it all dialed up and

392
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:33,278
and you know so so now is the time to

393
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:38,240
to to put these ideas together

394
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:40,159
and really brand uh start branding uh

395
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,399
not only the weed but then added value

396
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:44,480
products from that area also

397
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,879
yeah i think the the the customer will

398
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,639
buy into specific uh culture like they

399
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:50,639
do with every other brand whether it's

400
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,159
the taste of freshness or ireland or

401
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,879
whether it's the cool chilledness of

402
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:57,039
spain or portugal or whatever it may be

403
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:58,559
before i let you go i'd be remiss to ask

404
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:00,799
you a man who lives in the west coast

405
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,799
what's the best frame that you've ever

406
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:05,919
found or consumed

407
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:08,639
well you know i mean we like the og kush

408
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:11,919
out here everything has og kush in it

409
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:14,320
when you get that pure og kush it's uh

410
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:16,639
it's awesome i mean the cookies the girl

411
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,879
scout cookies the train wreck here in

412
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,278
southern oregon is popular

413
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:23,439
uh all these all these strains are great

414
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:25,120
you know i will say this though for me

415
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,360
my personal strength was i lived in

416
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,560
amsterdam 20 years ago and there was a

417
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:33,680
coffee shop called the katsu and it

418
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:35,679
specialized in uh sativa

419
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:37,919
and right when you walked in this coffee

420
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,599
shop you could smell the distinct smell

421
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:42,240
it's like the opposite of kush right

422
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:45,759
cushions the hardcore indica and then

423
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:48,320
the hazes were the hardcore sativas

424
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,919
um and now so on the west coast we have

425
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,360
everything we have the best weed the

426
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:54,879
best options the best everything but

427
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,959
what we don't have still is someone will

428
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,919
say oh that's part haze or that's that's

429
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:02,719
a hybrid sativa dominant or whatever

430
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:05,198
there's no more pure sativas like when i

431
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:08,720
walked into the katsu in amsterdam years

432
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:12,399
ago and smoked neville's haze or the

433
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,320
silver pearl or the super silver um

434
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,919
these don't exist on the west coast and

435
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,278
and if i could ever get some like

436
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:20,639
old-school haze like that uh it it would

437
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:23,679
be uh

438
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:26,159
it'd be amazing so so you so as green as

439
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:27,758
the grass is here we don't have that

440
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:30,399
one of my favorite strains which is

441
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,720
which is the haze it's a total sativa

442
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,320
and otherwise we like to cush out here

443
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,399
man

444
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,759
