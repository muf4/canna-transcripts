have you on major big news at the moment

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,519
over here in little old ireland so

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,359
yourself and jp are causing the right

12
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:31,038
old ruckus can you maybe give everybody

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,440
an overview maybe not the start of the

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:36,079
story of puff and stuff but from the

15
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:37,920
initial first uh

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,520
legal processes that you guys went

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,760
through when that started and what

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,600
instigated that process so we can get

19
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:47,119
everybody as much information in the 15

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:50,800
minutes yep yep um so basically in 2000

21
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:52,718
in may and 2019 we were rated um

22
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:54,878
and so that's that was basically a week

23
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,679
before jp was rated so we were rated on

24
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:59,839
a saturday and then he was rated the

25
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:01,600
following on friday

26
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,840
um the difference really though between

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,599
our cases is um even though it's

28
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,920
pertaining the same products jp's

29
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:10,239
started from um

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,079
being rated by by customs because of

31
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:13,679
importing a product where we were rated

32
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,759
because an individual bought a product

33
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,040
from us was walking down the street and

34
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,959
then was stopped and searched by the

35
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,200
guards and then

36
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,959
when he told them that he bought that at

37
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,920
us from our shop

38
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:28,399
they came in the following day and asked

39
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,079
for samples which we gave with no

40
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,840
problem and and showed them the lab

41
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:33,599
reports confirming what the content of

42
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,840
thc was

43
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:38,158
um they were kind of um

44
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,799
oblivious to um the difference between

45
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:44,079
cannabis and hemp um so

46
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,880
about seven months after that um we got

47
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:48,399
raided and uh they came in and seized

48
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:50,798
all the products from us

49
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,560
and then um then left and then about

50
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,560
three months after that then they came

51
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,240
in and arrested me

52
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,240
um and then seven months after that then

53
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,560
they arrested my wife so right now both

54
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:04,239
my wife and i are being charged with uh

55
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,240
sale and distribution of cannabis

56
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:07,920
okay so all of the proceedings that

57
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,919
we've been seeing over the last week or

58
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,439
two have stemmed from those initial

59
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,958
first processes

60
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:16,959
yeah so what happened was so we were

61
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:21,680
rated in may and then in january of 2020

62
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:23,920
uh jp and us both filed judicial reviews

63
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,120
to have our cases thrown out because of

64
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:29,199
what the um basically they're you know

65
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,599
is unconstitutional what they're doing

66
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:34,878
um it's against eu um you know we're

67
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:36,959
following within eu laws so um we filed

68
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:39,120
a judicial review exactly the same week

69
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,080
and at that time the judiciary review

70
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,640
board put our two cases together so for

71
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,239
the past year just over a year

72
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,318
our cases have been running in

73
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,920
conjunction with each other

74
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:51,598
since then there's been numerous other

75
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,759
cases um

76
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:56,238
coming about so basically from my

77
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,598
understanding that they're just um

78
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,319
they're going through the process as

79
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:02,639
well but the two biggest high-profile

80
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:05,679
cases would be jp and or laurel collins

81
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:07,518
and pup and stuff now

82
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,840
little collins has been a lot more vocal

83
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,759
than i have been um during the first

84
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,000
four months of our encounter with the

85
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,799
guards and being raided and arrested you

86
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,039
know i was publicly out on you know

87
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,120
in the newspapers on nearly every radio

88
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:23,199
station but then i was advised with my

89
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,319
solicitor that i needed to stop

90
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:29,199
it was really pissing them off

91
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:31,919
that i was out there

92
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:34,318
making a wave for them so i stopped and

93
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:36,238
then jp just continued on so since then

94
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:37,679
we kind of have been just in the shadows

95
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,878
a lot of people have completely forgot

96
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,120
that we've been

97
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:42,719
um that we're actually involved in this

98
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,560
and then it's just been recently over

99
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,318
the past couple of weeks um where i've

100
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,560
been starting to get a bit more public

101
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:51,359
about it um and then jp has been tagging

102
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,438
us to um to include us in in the case

103
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,799
because actually that case like i said

104
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:56,318
even though we got two separate cases

105
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,840
they're actually being they're exactly

106
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:01,919
the same case within the high

107
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,000
court okay perfect so you guys are two

108
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:05,518
separate cases the judicial review put

109
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,199
the two of them together so they could

110
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,158
review them both separately do you have

111
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:11,839
two separate law entities uh

112
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:13,598
representing both of you guys or is

113
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,200
there one individual firm now that

114
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:17,120
represents you both

115
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:19,519
so we have different um

116
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,439
you know different teams um but they are

117
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,918
working together um

118
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:26,240
in a sense so basically whatever we file

119
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:28,399
jp files whatever jp file we file the

120
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,879
exact same thing so at this point in

121
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:33,039
time um everything is done you know we

122
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:34,959
followed the last papers uh friday

123
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,520
actually i signed the last um after

124
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:40,239
david's um so we went to court on

125
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:42,719
tuesday it got adjourned again until the

126
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,319
22nd of february

127
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,759
what's going to happen on that date i'm

128
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,800
not quite sure

129
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:52,000
um but from what we're hearing that the

130
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,720
actual hearing date to finalize this is

131
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,759
going to be the 14th and 15th of july is

132
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,280
going to be the um the deciding factor

133
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,879
whether they're going to drop the

134
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:03,679
charges or

135
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:06,240
the the judicial review will allow the

136
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,759
prosecution to continue um their case

137
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,199
against us

138
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,240
okay so that's very devil's advocate

139
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,919
let's say the

140
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,519
charges get dropped it's now open season

141
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:17,038
for the consumer watching this and for

142
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:19,038
people watching this what does that now

143
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:20,399
allow have happened in the irish

144
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:23,279
industry it's obviously not going to

145
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:25,439
regulate any sort of thc products would

146
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:28,399
it just move it in line with the zero

147
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:30,160
point zero three percent level of phc

148
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:32,239
well the point it would it would put it

149
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,039
in line with 0.2 but

150
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,280
so

151
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:37,599
um yeah sorry i lost my train of thought

152
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:39,599
there so france so the exact same case

153
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,360
is going on in france right so that

154
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,680
france has finally changed their their

155
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,759
drug laws to allow 0.3

156
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,439
uh thc in

157
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,759
products whether if it's cbd or food

158
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:51,839
products so 0.3 is allowed

159
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,280
so that we would suspect that ireland is

160
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:54,719
going to follow suit

161
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,159
it's going to definitely open the market

162
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,080
you know if we win the traditional

163
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,840
review the cbd market in this country is

164
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:00,959
going to probably explode but i don't

165
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:02,879
think it's going to be something that's

166
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,758
going to happen instantaneously because

167
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:05,759
they're going to have to change the

168
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,600
misuse of drug law which is going to

169
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,080
happen as long as we win the judicial

170
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,240
review that will happen it will allow

171
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:13,279
the 0.3 or 0.2

172
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,079
now

173
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:18,239
there has been um rumors i say rumors

174
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:20,879
i've actually got a letter from a tv not

175
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,120
a td sorry from a minister about three

176
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:25,199
years ago confirming that they are going

177
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,680
to change the misuse of drug act to

178
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,439
allow 0.3 thc

179
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,879
but the only thing it stated was that

180
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:32,079
would be in the future well it's been

181
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:34,000
three years and that still hasn't

182
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:35,839
happened and here we are we have about

183
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,079
six cases going through the judicial

184
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:40,079
system costing this state

185
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,439
tons of money for something that they

186
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:44,800
have already admitted that they're going

187
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:46,160
to change at some point in time

188
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,600
yeah well if we've learned one thing

189
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,680
throughout this process anybody who

190
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,319
didn't know anthony politics now knows

191
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,720
the policy makers are not the quickest

192
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,479
of animals in the world and you don't

193
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,800
want to have patience and thick skin to

194
00:06:56,478 --> 00:07:00,800
be dealing with them yep so but i mean

195
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,240
so the market's not going to open up you

196
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,000
know you would really hope that that

197
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,160
would happen but because of the drug

198
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,079
laws are not going to be changed and it

199
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,080
could take you know well france actually

200
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:12,159
did it fairly quickly so it's just a

201
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,000
matter of how quick the irish government

202
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,759
is willing to make that change and then

203
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,120
at that point you know the market's

204
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,400
gonna open but then you're gonna have

205
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,680
the contingency of whether or not

206
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:22,879
they're gonna make the flower still

207
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,680
illegal which france kind of did um so

208
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,360
france's stance was the exact as ireland

209
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,439
so now they've allowed the point three

210
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,598
percent thc they've allowed extraction

211
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:34,800
from the flower to produce cbd but

212
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:36,879
they've out they have banned the sale of

213
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,360
flowers to consumers

214
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:41,199
so um it would appear that ireland would

215
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,360
hate the same stance but france is

216
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,400
actually being taken to court now

217
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,960
to clarify

218
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,959
that the flower can be sold to consumers

219
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:52,719
um because it's a huge market i mean it

220
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:52,719
is it will just be a

221
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,199
very good you know outcome

222
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,840
yeah well we talked to benjamin

223
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,919
alexander john warfra who's the ceo of

224
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:04,159
augur associates in paris there last

225
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:06,478
week and i posed the same question is

226
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,319
this the end of the cbd flower sales now

227
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,959
so he lee seems to believe the cat's out

228
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,879
of the bag now um

229
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:15,198
it's going to find it very hard to put

230
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,639
it back into the into the bag and get

231
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,160
rid of the whole industry otherwise you

232
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,160
end up turning into a black market

233
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,919
industry well that's you know that that

234
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,120
could possibly happen so here's this

235
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:26,159
could that can you know it's all

236
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,399
contingent on a risk assessment so what

237
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,080
the european court of justice said when

238
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:32,240
they ruled on the candidate case or

239
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:34,718
overturned the candidate case in france

240
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:38,080
basically was that if a member state was

241
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:40,399
going to completely ban thc

242
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,240
an entirety um that they were not going

243
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,080
to allow any percentages that they would

244
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,799
have to do a risk assessment to prove

245
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,200
that the product that is being sold um

246
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:51,199
is a risk to um

247
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,879
to consumers and

248
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,000
fortunately for us

249
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:59,120
um and and france that there is no such

250
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,879
um study done now

251
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,278
there is studies to confirm that there

252
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:05,439
is no health risk at all so we

253
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:07,120
definitely have that in our favor but it

254
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,800
appears that france has come up with

255
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,480
something i've heard i don't know

256
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,799
exactly what it is but they've come up

257
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,120
with something to say that it is a

258
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:16,799
health risk and that that's what they're

259
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,440
grasping at those straws to try and keep

260
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:21,838
it that way um so i have a feeling that

261
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,519
that could end up going back into the

262
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,399
european court of justice at them to

263
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,720
find make a final decision on that

264
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,200
okay on a little lighter note now you be

265
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,360
a man answered his question so where is

266
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,959
the best cbd flower being produced in

267
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,879
the world at the moment are the north

268
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:39,599
americans catching up although they've

269
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:41,120
been thc heavy or have the europeans had

270
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,440
maybe a little bit of a head start when

271
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,679
it comes to this territory where they've

272
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,440
kind of had to deal with this first

273
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:49,759
well that's an interesting question uh

274
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,519
so if you look at the markets and you

275
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:53,120
kind of got to split it into threes

276
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,200
right and and what i mean by that is the

277
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,679
united states we'll say north americans

278
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,560
united states and canada um europe and

279
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:02,319
then and then switzerland on its own so

280
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:05,518
with the united states and switzerland

281
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:08,079
the allowed thc amount in a cbd product

282
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:11,039
is point or sorry is one percent

283
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:12,958
yeah so um so you cannot include

284
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:14,958
switzerland in this um now what i've

285
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:16,719
known in the past with switzerland uh

286
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,838
you know going back almost four years

287
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,920
ago

288
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,720
what they do is they wash their products

289
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:24,958
um and that is to drop the cannabinoid

290
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,320
profile of percentages

291
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,479
and then they test it again and if it's

292
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,240
not a if it's still above the point two

293
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,399
percent to be sold within the european

294
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,759
market then they wash it again and wash

295
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,799
it and wash it until they get it below

296
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:37,039
it

297
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:38,958
so when you go to switzerland you can

298
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:41,838
you know i think every single petrol

299
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:43,359
station you can go buy cbd flour but it

300
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,440
is one percent

301
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,440
um so

302
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,640
um so to answer your question i think

303
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,880
that

304
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:53,838
europe has um

305
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:56,320
i think really progressed with the lower

306
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,079
percentage of thc products so you can't

307
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,839
really compare switzerland or the united

308
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:02,000
states within the european market

309
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,800
because of the major difference in

310
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,639
um

311
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:06,958
is there a quality difference in flower

312
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,720
regardless of the thc content

313
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,958
is there a drastic difference let's say

314
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,759
in terpene levels or in

315
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:16,479
i think i think for for quality as far

316
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:19,039
as appearance looks uh it is definitely

317
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:22,399
going to be um

318
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:24,240
the lower of the thc content um

319
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,440
the the bushier cut is going to look

320
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,480
like it's going to kind of look like

321
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,920
bushweed um you know so then as that um

322
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,360
starts going

323
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,039
um

324
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,800
with higher thc so getting around the

325
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:36,879
point 2.3 the flower the plant is going

326
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:39,519
to look much nicer you know but a lot of

327
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:41,278
that can you know controlled by also the

328
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,440
you know the grower and how they're

329
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:45,039
producing it uh or sorry how they're

330
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,800
processing it from you know the drying

331
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:48,559
to the curing a lot of these people are

332
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:51,359
now using machines

333
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:53,278
um to to dry their product which is

334
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,039
causing it to be browner rather than a

335
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:56,639
green so there is this distinctive

336
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:59,199
difference now that you can look between

337
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,519
cbd and and cannabis

338
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,519
um cannabis is more of a you know the

339
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,000
greener color where hemp now is tending

340
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:08,159
to be um the brownish i think that

341
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,519
they're kind of rushing uh their process

342
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:13,439
that's just you know my opinion um

343
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,879
i mean i'm sure that every single cbd

344
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,800
producer out there you know growing

345
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,240
flowers can't keep up with the with the

346
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:19,679
demand

347
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,440
you know they need to do whatever they

348
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:23,919
can to try and get it to market and

349
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,560
expediting the the process of drying it

350
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:28,319
and curing um i think is uh affecting

351
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:30,239
the quality of this somewhat

352
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,079
without it the sooner it's regulated and

353
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,680
we get proper sale of approval on

354
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:35,120
specific products that we're able to buy

355
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:36,319
as a consumer i think the better for

356
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,560
