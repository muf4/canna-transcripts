do you want to give everybody maybe a

24
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:53,439
quick little overview of the cookie jar

25
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:54,719
story and how you got to where you are

26
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:55,919
now and then we'll jump into the first

27
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,558
topic

28
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,640
yeah absolutely so uh our founders are

29
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,159
two serial entrepreneurs and they had

30
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,520
developed a

31
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:05,840
an event-based

32
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,200
company uh just prior to the start of

33
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,880
the pandemic

34
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,840
and with all the regulations and

35
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:14,399
everything and

36
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,320
proper safety precautions uh the the

37
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,799
event-based business

38
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:21,039
wasn't the right time um they'd had a

39
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,080
conversation with one of our founders

40
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:27,280
sons uh who's a cannabis user

41
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:30,798
uh shortly after legalization here in in

42
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,640
2018 and uh the conversation evolved as

43
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,159
he pulled out a plastic bag with

44
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,040
cannabis in it

45
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,880
um

46
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,280
you know and

47
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:40,959
being entrepreneurs and

48
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,840
and inquisitive minds they started

49
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:45,759
asking questions and

50
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,840
quickly realized that

51
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,799
plastic storage isn't really ideal for

52
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,280
cannabis it allows things to interact it

53
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,920
allows for permeability of air all kinds

54
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,920
of factors that that really decrease the

55
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,600
quality or degrade the quality of your

56
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,320
cannabinoids

57
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:05,359
and it spirals from there

58
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:06,718
you know very fortunate to

59
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,520
live in a world where there's lots of

60
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:10,639
resources and lots of manufacturing

61
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,200
options

62
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:16,238
and they concluded that you know storing

63
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:17,839
cannabis in plastic is detrimental and

64
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,800
you can visit our website to learn all

65
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,200
kinds of information about that

66
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,160
but really the ideal

67
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:27,280
medium for storage is is glass because

68
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,239
it's inert

69
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,479
and and on top of that uv glass uv

70
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,480
restrictive or uv resistant

71
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:38,238
glass because uv light

72
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:40,878
further degrades thc into cbn uh so it

73
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,878
reduces that psychoactive effect uh that

74
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:45,598
high feeling that some people seek out

75
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:47,518
when uh when consuming

76
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:49,359
you know the the the story evolves quite

77
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,400
a bit um

78
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,519
you know one of our biggest

79
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,760
differentiators here is um you know in a

80
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,680
country where we're fully legal

81
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:00,318
but it all started out with medicinal

82
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,439
cannabis it's important to recognize

83
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:04,158
that

84
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,719
uh inspection of your cannabis prior to

85
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:09,359
consumption is is so important

86
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,560
so our lid is is very unique within the

87
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,879
industry

88
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,640
it is airtight but it's also built with

89
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:17,039
an edge to edge five times magnifying

90
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,399
glass to allow people to better inspect

91
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,079
their cannabis

92
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,000
keep it in that airtight container

93
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,680
without having to

94
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,120
unnecessarily expose it to the

95
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,439
environment

96
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,840
um you know but there's other factors

97
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:31,199
that play in here as well

98
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,878
you know we're

99
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:34,238
one of the first countries to fully

100
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,318
legalize

101
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,239
uh and we've been

102
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:40,878
essentially

103
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,560
fully illegal for for almost 100 years

104
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:43,679
here in north america

105
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,598
so

106
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,400
there's a lot of misinformation out

107
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:49,598
there

108
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,840
unfortunately and a lot of propaganda or

109
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:54,560
misleading statements

110
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,200
so a lot of

111
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,519
what our company is about is is helping

112
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:02,318
educate people

113
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,959
you know on on the importance of access

114
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:07,759
the importance of how it's produced

115
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,080
how it's stored is is vitally important

116
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:13,359
for the end consumer

117
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,519
so a lot of what we do with our our app

118
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,479
the cookie jar app which is completely

119
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,000
free and available on ios and android

120
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,560
is provide people with information to

121
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,639
help them educate themselves on the

122
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,319
potential benefits of cannabis how it

123
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,840
might interact with them

124
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:29,439
how it might help them with various

125
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:30,478
different uh struggles that they're

126
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:33,759
having

127
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:35,199
okay amazing so can you tell me one of

128
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,800
the things that i'm sure a lot of people

129
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,199
want to know about when it comes to kind

130
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,040
of a storage what are they they kind of

131
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,240
let's say the two biggest things that

132
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,160
are happening your cannabis if you're

133
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,400
not storing in an airtight glass

134
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,680
container what are the two big things

135
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:51,439
that consumers of cannabis need to be uh

136
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,680
informed about and the reason why they

137
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:55,120
should be upgrading their storage uh

138
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,680
component

139
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,478
yeah so probably the two biggest factors

140
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,079
will be airflow and light

141
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:05,038
so airflow

142
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:08,959
oxidizes thc which is one of the most

143
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:11,680
common and sought after cannabinoids

144
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:14,000
when it oxidizes it becomes cbn and and

145
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,680
just doesn't have the same effect

146
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,600
it is still a cannabinoid there is still

147
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,519
medical benefits to it

148
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,680
um but it's not what people are

149
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,918
necessarily seeking out

150
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,280
the second factor is going to be light

151
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:28,799
because uv does degrade thc as well

152
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:30,079
so those are probably the two biggest

153
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,400
factors

154
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:34,000
the third would be

155
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:36,000
humidity

156
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,120
you know if just like

157
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,879
any foods really they're susceptible to

158
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,240
the environment and if there is too much

159
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:44,719
humidity

160
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,240
uh you're more likely to develop molds

161
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,600
or mildews which we don't want to

162
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,478
consume

163
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,720
and if it's too dry

164
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:54,319
that dryness dries out the the terpenes

165
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,639
and the trichome structures in your

166
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:57,680
cannabis uh and your trichomes are

167
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,600
really what

168
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,519
contain the vast majority of of the

169
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,280
cannabinoids that that most people seek

170
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:06,399
out so

171
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:08,719
the top two would be airflow and and

172
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,599
uv light exposure to uv light and then

173
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,039
followed

174
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,800
closely by

175
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,879
uh by humidity

176
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,960
okay great thank you and can you give

177
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:19,279
the viewers an exact where about to you

178
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:21,279
guys in canada and where are your

179
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:23,119
products available in that territory

180
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:24,399
have you guys branched down into america

181
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,720
as of yet

182
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:29,679
yeah so we're based in ottawa canada so

183
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,680
our nation's capital and uh our products

184
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,240
are currently available right across

185
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,199
north america canada and united states

186
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,038
um

187
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,879
we do have distribution points in both

188
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:41,680
countries and we are

189
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:44,159
looking at expanding into the rest of

190
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,879
the world more more readily

191
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,560
okay and do you guys see a position as a

192
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:51,918
consumer storage that you guys are

193
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,439
mainly focused on excuse me or is there

194
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:55,519
is there a massive difference between

195
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:58,399
let's say large-scale storage for the

196
00:06:55,519 --> 00:07:00,079
bulk's providers and a consumer storage

197
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:01,279
and are you guys pivoting into both

198
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:04,079
sectors are you going to stick to

199
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,679
consumer side of things yeah so uh

200
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:08,800
predominantly our focus is on the

201
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,360
consumer storage um the the legal

202
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,520
growers and

203
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,520
you know the industry level people

204
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:16,719
typically have great storage in their

205
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,918
facility

206
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,479
um

207
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:21,680
the so so our main focus is on on the

208
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:23,758
end consumer

209
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,360
that being said we do have some products

210
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,038
that are

211
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,879
in development we'll say

212
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:33,519
um that are more suited towards licensed

213
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:33,519
producers

214
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,439
for them to be able to start preserving

215
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:38,879
those you know important cannabinoids

216
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:40,879
and terpenes

217
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:42,879
earlier on in the process so that at the

218
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:46,319
end of the day the end consumer does

219
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:48,478
have a product that that is superior

220
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,000
okay very interesting and we were just

221
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:51,680
talking there briefly before we came

222
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,279
online that you guys are in a lockdown

223
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,959
over in canada at the moment but one of

224
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:57,279
the pluses is that you've got a legal

225
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:58,478
cannabis industry with a curbside

226
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:01,439
deliveries

227
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,318
what has been the biggest uh product you

228
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,079
see

229
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,240
we were reading a lot about oxley taking

230
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:09,359
a lot of the share from some of the big

231
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,000
providers are you seeing that uh small

232
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,000
cultivar taking a major share from the

233
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,560
big huge bullet providers as we're

234
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,199
starting to read from this territory

235
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,199
yeah very much so um you know if you

236
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,639
look at the the statistics from a couple

237
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,759
years ago

238
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,360
kind of the big five the the five

239
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,439
largest

240
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,439
volume producers controlled i think it

241
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:32,479
was about eighty percent of the market

242
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:34,559
um

243
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,360
you know now it's it's much more on the

244
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:40,478
craft side uh the the smaller growers

245
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,800
that are

246
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,839
they're doing a great job um you know

247
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:48,159
but they're really dialing in

248
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,560
the specifics of you know temperature

249
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:54,000
and light penetration and and nutrient

250
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:56,399
balance and ph and how long to to

251
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,200
vegetative growth and how long to flower

252
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,679
and

253
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,480
um they just seem to be going uh that

254
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:04,479
little extra mile um and and we are

255
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,759
seeing it here in canada that that those

256
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,360
craft growers the people that are

257
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:10,159
putting

258
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,600
you know the the taking the minutia of

259
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:14,319
the plant

260
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,000
and uh and focusing on it focusing on

261
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,360
the littlest aspects

262
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,120
they're making a little bit difference

263
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,839
here a one percent growth here or one

264
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,639
percent growth here or

265
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,160
improvement

266
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:25,120
and they are eating away at that market

267
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:28,240
from

268
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,399
from the the big five businesses here um

269
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,639
so it's it's it's nice to see because

270
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,799
there is a lot of variety coming out

271
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:37,120
um there's growers out there that are

272
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:38,559
using different grower mediums that are

273
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,600
a little bit more environmentally

274
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:44,639
conscious with how they're producing

275
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,440
you know that are working with

276
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:50,080
you know marginalized

277
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,560
minorities or or different aspects of

278
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,399
culture like it's it's really it's it's

279
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:56,479
wonderful to see because

280
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,720
the the restrictions here in canada have

281
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,720
been

282
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:05,039
lightened we'll say uh or or lessened to

283
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,200
a degree in in getting through that

284
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:09,838
license producer application

285
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,519
so we do have newcomers to the industry

286
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,399
quite regularly

287
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,200
um

288
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,200
but we are seeing a huge influx of that

289
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,399
craft growing

290
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,360
mentality

291
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,200
and

292
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,000
the availability of quality craft

293
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:28,160
cannabis here in canada much much like

294
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,320
we experienced with uh with beer

295
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:31,600
yeah and alcohols over the last kind of

296
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,360
decade

297
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,440
so it's it's wonderful it gives people

298
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,879
options and and ultimately

299
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,160
as long as they're making informed

300
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:39,278
decisions

301
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:41,519
we're happy

302
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:42,639
yeah i don't know uh it's one of the few

303
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,399
industries where i don't know any

304
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:47,039
cannabis consumer where if we went up

305
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,200
and said look here's a half an ounce of

306
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:51,519
the best weed in the world or here's two

307
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,879
ounces it is crap weed that anybody's

308
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,320
gonna take the two ounces of the crap

309
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:55,759
wheat everybody it's the one industry

310
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,040
where i don't think there is a low tier

311
00:10:55,759 --> 00:11:01,360
market and i i don't think the the craft

312
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:03,199
suppliers will be able to cater to the

313
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,320
people with a nuanced taste

314
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,240
and uh

315
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,240
exact product that they're looking for

316
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,519
as opposed to the the coke or the pepsi

317
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,039
of the market

318
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,360
yeah you're you're very right i mean

319
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:15,439
there is uh

320
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,079
it's an interesting perspective here

321
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,880
because uh particularly here in ontario

322
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:23,759
uh you know our province

323
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:27,360
there is a huge

324
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:29,278
shift in marketing um and and kind of

325
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,800
the the market perspectives

326
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:32,720
so

327
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:34,240
we have something here that the

328
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,839
government has implemented called an

329
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,720
excise tax

330
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:41,200
uh which basically

331
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,800
taxes based on quality is kind of the

332
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,519
best way i can think about it so the the

333
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:47,439
better the quality product the more tax

334
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,560
you're paying

335
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,959
um

336
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:52,879
it's it's very unique um i actually i

337
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:54,239
don't know of any other industry where

338
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:56,720
where something like that happens where

339
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,839
you're paying more tax

340
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,720
for a superior product exactly

341
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,440
so

342
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,800
kind of over the last year or so there's

343
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,639
there's been

344
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:08,479
i guess for lack of a better better term

345
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,639
it's price wars

346
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,959
so you are seeing really quality

347
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,759
cannabis from a

348
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:16,719
huge number of of growers here in canada

349
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:19,679
that is

350
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,160
priced below market value um because

351
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:24,479
they have to do something to compete so

352
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:26,240
we're in a bit of an interesting area

353
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,720
an interesting time for cannabis here in

354
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,879
canada um you know we're we're very

355
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,959
lucky that our federal government is

356
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:33,919
going through an 18-month review right

357
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,359
now

358
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,599
to

359
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,600
[Music]

360
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,680
kind of look at the whole industry over

361
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,320
the last three years and and

362
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:43,838
re-establish things because

363
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,680
you know the excise tax is a bit is a

364
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,600
big aspect but also it's a it's a whole

365
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:49,679
new industry right so

366
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,360
everybody coming into it was

367
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:53,759
was very green and

368
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,440
if i want to use an industry term

369
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:57,838
um

370
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,480
you know so it'll be interesting to see

371
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,320
kind of in the next 15 months or so or

372
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,200
16 months

373
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,040
where

374
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:09,680
where the government wants to

375
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:11,278
kind of give and take a little bit

376
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:12,719
but right now with the price wars that

377
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:15,120
are going on

378
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,278
uh with so much of the

379
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,159
the cannabis flower specifically on the

380
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:22,480
market being undervalued

381
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:25,120
there are

382
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,360
discount brands popping up everywhere

383
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,278
so you can go and buy

384
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,720
an ounce of cannabis here in canada for

385
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:32,240
a hundred dollars

386
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,720
which is

387
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:38,959
a very reasonable price if you ask me um

388
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,879
but there are also

389
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:42,799

390
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:44,799
