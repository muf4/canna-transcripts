moves in this industry and there's lots

24
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,600
of lessons to be learned by the rest of

25
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,359
the european governments

26
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,520
can we basically give everybody just a

27
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:52,558
quick overview of how you ended up with

28
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,879
multi

29
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,320
enterprise and the cannabis industry in

30
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:59,358
general

31
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,119
yes sure multi-enterprise has been uh

32
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,679
pivotal in the setting up of this

33
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:06,399
industry from its very first inception

34
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:08,719
so when two years and a half ago almost

35
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,240
two years ago we started conceiving of a

36
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:13,840
legislation

37
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:15,919
which allows for the use of cannabis for

38
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,280
medical purposes as well as research

39
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,960
purposes

40
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,359
we mode enterprise has had a central

41
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:24,719
role

42
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:27,759
both in establishing the legislation

43
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,798
as well as attracting the top companies

44
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,719
in the sector

45
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,000
to start setting up their activities in

46
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,239
malta

47
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,280
as we have gone along throughout these

48
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:38,239
three years

49
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,799
we have not only continued to attract

50
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:41,280
key

51
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,920
key companies to start working from

52
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,640
malta but have also supported them

53
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,680
throughout the implementation of their

54
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,840
setting up stage

55
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,280
okay amazing yeah because we've spoken

56
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,880
to a couple of the

57
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,118
people do you have over there like we

58
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:58,798
nick paters from materia ventures deepak

59
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:00,959
who we spoke about and then we had jonas

60
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,719
simerman on two weeks ago so

61
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,559
everybody seemed to be developing and

62
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:05,759
cultivating a lot of the top talent in

63
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,519
the industry are

64
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,199
making them all to their base it's one

65
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:09,919
of the things i think ireland are well

66
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,238
behind

67
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,000
when i when i see europe in the lex

68
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,680
long-term overview i've seen malda in

69
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,439
ireland being two of the pris

70
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,920
the premier destinations for your

71
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:20,479
corporation with the incentivized tax

72
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:22,799
rate

73
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:24,560
with the highly skilled workforce and i

74
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,640
think malta i've just gotten out of the

75
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,719
block so much quicker than ireland and

76
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,639
i i think the leaders over here aren't

77
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,479
as forward thinking as the guys that you

78
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,079
have in charge and malta

79
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:36,159
first topic that are going to move

80
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,959
straight on to it's

81
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:40,318
what i hope to see on a lot of packaged

82
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,519
products in the medical cannabis

83
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:43,598
industry over the next one and that's

84
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,039
the maid and malta sign

85
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:46,878
can you tell all the audience a little

86
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,400
bit about this and what's the strategy

87
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:51,840
behind it

88
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:55,280
sure the made malta sign um

89
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:58,080
should be a synonym of high quality

90
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,318
pharmaceutical grade products and i'm

91
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,640
using the term pharmaceutical

92
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:05,518
on purpose and not medical the reason

93
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:07,518
being that the regulator in malta the

94
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,640
molten medicines authority

95
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:14,319
is making it a requirement that

96
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:16,399
all the facilities are eugmp licensed

97
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:18,158
as though they were producing a fully

98
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,800
fledged pharmaceutical

99
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:22,799
with a marketing authorization so even

100
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,840
these are medical products and do not

101
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,640
require a

102
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,878
marketing authorization or do not as yet

103
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:31,439
have a marketing authorization

104
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:32,560
one can rest assured that the process is

105
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:36,479
as rigorous

106
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,479
and as as

107
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,680
as restricting as the one where

108
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,400
producing a fully fledged pharmaceutical

109
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,959
not only but the ownership of the

110
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,000
product

111
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,400
by the producer does not stop

112
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
at the point of batch release from the

113
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,719
production facility

114
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,360
but the ownership continues up to the

115
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,400
stage

116
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,000
where the distributor releases that

117
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,959
product on the market

118
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,639
so before the distributor releases the

119
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,479
product on the market

120
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:08,798
the ownership and therefore the

121
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:13,039
responsibility and the liability

122
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:16,079
are still held by the producer in malta

123
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:19,439
this is obviously indicative of

124
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,240
the very high quality and the

125
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:23,199
how seriously we are taking the sector

126
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,639
and how

127
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:29,680
not difficult but how rigorous

128
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:32,240
and tara we are um

129
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,199
the medical cannabis sector in malta

130
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,800
builds over

131
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,560
decades of experience in the

132
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,160
pharmaceutical sector

133
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,600
maybe this is not something that

134
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,479
everyone is aware of

135
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,320
but malta has a very important

136
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:47,039
pharmaceutical cluster

137
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:49,040
it's a very well consolidated cluster

138
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,919
with renowned names operating in the

139
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,400
sector

140
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:54,639
companies like teva pharmaceuticals for

141
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:57,599
instance operate from malta

142
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,639
and this has made it such that malta has

143
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,120
not only

144
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,240
the right environment but there are the

145
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,360
right skills

146
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,560
we have the right regulatory expertise

147
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,520
and we have a consolidated and

148
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,720
established

149
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:13,519
cluster which is enabled also by a very

150
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,160
robust

151
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:18,159
ancillary industry so for instance when

152
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,039
you consider the cluster the cluster has

153
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:24,320
its own dedicated printing press

154
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:27,599
which is dedicated to printing of

155
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:30,560
foils vignettes labels and all the other

156
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,120
materials related to the pharma industry

157
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,399
we have precision engineering companies

158
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,800
which are

159
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:37,599
which provide the industry with the

160
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,680
tooling

161
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,600
for for instance tabletting machines

162
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,720
encapsulating machines

163
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,800
there are companies which are

164
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,720
specialized in automation lines

165
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,360
and therefore they come in very handy

166
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,479
for the for the packaging lines and the

167
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,600
automated

168
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:58,159
bottling lines and and all that so it is

169
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,240
a very very healthy cluster so when it

170
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,680
came to evolving into the medical

171
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,759
cannabis scenario

172
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,000
it was building up on all of this

173
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,879
expertise and this has facilitated

174
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,879
the industry in various ways these last

175
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:12,879
two days i've been touring around the

176
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:15,038
facilities that are currently setting up

177
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:18,159
in the medical cannabis sector

178
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:20,000
and all of them boasted of a team which

179
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,280
is highly skilled

180
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,120
and highly operational so these

181
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:28,399
companies were

182
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,360
enabled and to set up so quickly and

183
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:31,038
malta

184
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,759
mostly because they found the right

185
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:35,439
skills the right regulatory environment

186
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,360
and the regulator which is highly

187
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:38,719
competent the the malta medicines

188
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,960
authority

189
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,080
is in fact one of the most highly

190
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:45,599
reputed

191
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:48,000
authorities uh within the eu and it was

192
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,000
one of the first seven which were also

193
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,319
um fda accredited

194
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,038
so this goes to show and how highly

195
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,879
reputed the medicines agency is

196
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:58,639
having the medicines authority as the

197
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:02,000
regulator of the sector

198
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:04,720
gives more credibility more more

199
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
reassurance to anyone who is going to

200
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,960
use the maiden water brand

201
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,038
okay amazing i look forward to seeing

202
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:14,239
that made of malta brand grow now over

203
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:15,598
the next couple years i think it's a

204
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,519
phenomenal idea

205
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:19,120
and as i said i think when you look at

206
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:20,560
the overview of europe it's got to be

207
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,439
malt in ireland that can sell the

208
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,759
services

209
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:25,199
and the specific sectors for the

210
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,038
cannabis industry we're never going to

211
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,199
be the mass cultivation

212
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:31,199
operations but like what you guys have

213
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,120
done the extraction the distillation the

214
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,720
packaging this can all be done in a

215
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,478
country that has a great corporate tax

216
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,880
rate a great skilled workforce

217
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:40,318
and i think most global corporations

218
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:41,680
when they're finally in this space in

219
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,039
europe it'll be between

220
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,959
ireland and malta as with the

221
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:45,918
pharmaceutical industry we've got fiser

222
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:47,439
and the likes here and

223
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:49,918
you guys have made and a few others

224
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:52,240
there so it's it's an amazing

225
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:53,680
amazing to see and i i know again you've

226
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,319
got so much talent that are happening

227
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,400
there

228
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,439
tell me about what it's like attracting

229
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:59,839
the talent

230
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:00,879
is there a specific are you guys

231
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:02,638
pitching to

232
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,080
uh companies or are you guys having

233
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,199
companies come to you and you're setting

234
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:07,598
down the specific

235
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,199
terms and framework that allows them to

236
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:10,719
basically grow their companies at the

237
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,280
best trade possible

238
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,039
so obviously three years ago we were one

239
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:18,638
of the first movers

240
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:22,240
and we had first mover advantage however

241
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:25,120
we didn't make it too easy in that

242
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,280
we we adopted a process which is a

243
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,800
two-stage process

244
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:32,399
the first process is to apply with

245
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:36,240
multi-enterprise for a letter of intent

246
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:38,799
and that gives you the green light to

247
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,320
to start implementing your project and

248
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,000
then eventually you start working with

249
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,839
the medicines authority in order to

250
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,200
obtain the license

251
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,920
um our application process is very very

252
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,360
rigorous

253
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:52,838
so in order to in the first years when

254
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,560
we were attracting the top

255
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:58,720
companies there were three main criteria

256
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:00,799
namely the financial viability of the

257
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:04,160
project that we're looking into

258
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:05,199
obviously due diligence it's important

259
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:07,439
in all sectors

260
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,399
but in cannabis it was even more

261
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,600
important

262
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:13,759
so even the most minor of glitches um

263
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,959
could result in the non-approval of the

264
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:17,679
project

265
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:18,239
and third but not least we were looking

266
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:21,278
at

267
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,000
experience so in the beginning we wanted

268
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:24,080
to make sure

269
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,799
that anyone who is operating in the

270
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:30,160
sector has an established track record

271
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:33,278
of producing cannabis um

272
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:36,159
and dealing with cannabis in the sector

273
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:36,639
and that meant that the first companies

274
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,199
that

275
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:40,559
uh that were attracted to malta included

276
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,000
the big names

277
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:47,439
like uh like afria like mgc

278
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,200
like amec life sciences we have panaxia

279
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,880
we have all of it

280
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:56,399
we have material we have hoshi so

281
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:59,278
it was being first movers

282
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,720
and having this process this transparent

283
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:03,039
process in place

284
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,959
obviously attracted the big names into

285
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:07,759
coming to malta

286
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:08,479
at this stage however we are also

287
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,919
looking

288
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:14,639
and hence for instance attack for can

289
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:16,719
and we are also looking at adding depths

290
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:19,838
and layers to the industry

291
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,639
by opening up to startup activities and

292
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:25,760
startups bring energy startups bring

293
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:28,319
enthusiasm startups bring innovation

294
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:30,639
and unless you have a healthy cluster of

295
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,120
startups operating in any sector

296
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:34,078
you cannot guarantee that you are going

297
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,600
to have

298
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:38,799
um research innovation and development

299
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,759
of the sector

300
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:42,958
so this is our next phase where we are

301
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:46,000
looking at

302
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:49,039
at key startup activities we are finding

303
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,679
ways how to support them tech 4 can

304
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:54,000
is and i can say the name because i have

305
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:58,319
rendered that public themselves

306
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,120
um are very eager to start up the

307
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,120
tech accelerator activity from from

308
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,600
walter it's going to be the first

309
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,320
medical cannabis accelerator in all of

310
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,720
europe so we're very excited about that

311
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,959
so now the industry is not only

312
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,839
attracting just the top companies but

313
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:17,759
also adding flavor adapt and interest

314
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,000
by having these other companies joining

315
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:21,679
in the cluster

316
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,278
amazing yeah i think that's the proper

317
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:24,958
direction as opposed to focusing on just

318
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:25,759
one or two of the large corporations

319
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:27,518
cultivating

320
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:29,039
a sector that provides a multitude of

321
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,039
services will

322
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:32,480
ensure the longevity of the made in

323
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:34,078
malta brand name

324
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,680

to you on the show today i hope we can

326
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:38,239
