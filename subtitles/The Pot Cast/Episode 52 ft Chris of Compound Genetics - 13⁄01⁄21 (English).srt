18
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,920
today

19
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:09,349
awesome my friend so the first question we like to ask people what are you currently

20
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:14,849
smoking on oh man a wave variety of stuff um apples and bananas some baby Yoda um some

21
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:19,239
Arrowhead which is thinner by Clifford Kushner the Menthol I saw some Jokers which is white

22
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:25,300
runs by jet fill gelato um some grape gasoline uh some laughing gas some Blue Sushi and some

23
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:30,069
bubbles of gum Skittles rosin oh and some Fatso rosin so one variety of flavors wow

24
00:02:30,068 --> 00:02:33,848
you pretty much just mentioned every strain I wanted to talk about in this interview so

25
00:02:33,848 --> 00:02:37,768
thank you so much for giving me a perfect segue but the one that I just quickly jump

26
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:42,489
into first I think you said Blue Sushi or sushi what's that one like yeah Blue's issue

27
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:47,349
from it's from the 10 coats it's the Skittles cross I believe or sushi cross it's from satanica

28
00:02:47,349 --> 00:02:52,719
they do an excellent job at la oh awesome and I've always it's probably a silly question

29
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,109
but I've always wanted because I've never had zush or any of the crosses does it actually

30
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:01,110
taste like some sort of sushi a little bit Yeah if you use your imagination for sure

31
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:07,920
it has the YouTubers for sure interesting and I mean in general would you classify yourself

32
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:12,979
as someone who kind of gravitates more towards like the flavor profile of strains or are

33
00:03:12,979 --> 00:03:19,679
you more about the feeling of it definitely churches are important for sure perfect and

34
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,349
do you feel like I've always had this opinion that it's always a bit of a bummer when you

35
00:03:24,348 --> 00:03:28,250
smell a strain it smells so good and then it just doesn't quite translate to flavor

36
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:33,080
you have the same mindset or you think like good terms oh exactly exactly tours are very

37
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,420
importantly they have to be slide on and hit the news that don't apply at all it messes

38
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:40,658
up I think the whole experience for sure hell yeah I always think like yeah like when you

39
00:03:40,658 --> 00:03:44,669
get a strain that tastes as it smells it just kind of elevates the strain to the next level

40
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:50,229
definitely agree the full package that checks all the boxes you know so I mean before we

41
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:53,959
get too deep into the breeding questions I'd love to just ask do you think there's anything

42
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:58,158
you can do as a breeder to try to help make the strain do that like do you think it's

43
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:02,340
just the parent selection or I think testing and using the right Contours to deal with

44
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,870
is important very important having the right selections to start with that are true to

45
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:10,200
the name true chirps and making sure the reading is properly you know what they tested in victims

46
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:14,078
into my product yeah of course I think yeah testing's got to be the foundation of any

47
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:18,870
breeding project alrighty well what a what an awesome little lineup I just want to quickly

48
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:22,050
jump back to one other strain you mentioned in the intro because I'd never heard of it

49
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:26,540
before I think you said Arrowhead yeah it's a new one for working with Burner Cleveland

50
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:30,509
it's from the new Wiz Khalifa menu it's a Khalifa Christmas entertainment by mental

51
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:37,430
I want to carrying with burn from the cookies line oh wow what a what a Powerhouse combo

52
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:41,180
correct me if I'm wrong does that mean that it's kind of similar to the Khalifa mints

53
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,939
but there's also Thin Mints mixed in there yeah it's more of a cookie yes you know the

54
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:52,810
the actual OG with the clifa wow okay and I think the question in terms of the Khalifa

55
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:57,089
stuff that I've been wondering the most about how I when I first saw all of this was like

56
00:04:57,089 --> 00:05:00,839
how did all of this come about did you reach out to him did he reach out to you how did

57
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:07,659
it all happen um locally for the collaboration yeah it was for the moment in the past couple

58
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:12,320
of months on since this is the funeral came my way it was fired got in his hands he liked

59
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:17,228
it and just kind of went from there wow I mean what a what a cool little synchronous

60
00:05:17,228 --> 00:05:24,050
sort of event I was specifically wondering did you try the Khalifa OG and you liked it

61
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:32,090
or did he have that and kind of brought that to the table like how did that part work

62
00:05:32,089 --> 00:05:36,319
first class student X I worked at my last mental breeding project and it came out really

63
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:41,560
fire I found some really unique uh one of my friends at La uh pure proper cultivated

64
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:47,030
it you know and I got an inverse hands and so far it was selected so just checks all

65
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:52,349
the boxes it's a really amazing culture wow that's like a cool sentiment to hear because

66
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:57,290
you don't hear about a lot of new OG Cuts coming out that people think are cool and

67
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:02,850
like kind of different to the others I noticed that you work with a lot of different OG cards

68
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:06,939
do you think it's probably one of your more preferred ones it's definitely unique I'm

69
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:10,848
not exactly sure the background was definitely a unique which you reminds me like a triangle

70
00:06:10,848 --> 00:06:14,310
as if you hybrid a little bit there's a gas above them a really strong bigger and stronger

71
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:19,470
chocolate coverage it's really really heavy OG for sure strong on the gas hell yeah I'm

72
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:24,569
a big fan of the triangle and the sfv so that sounds like it's ticking boxes already I guess

73
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:30,848
my next question would be is do you think that the TK is probably the origin of a lot

74
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:35,719
of ogs or do you think they just kind of appear differently I'm not really sure the history

75
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,669
about the devil and that there's some real aficionados on that subject so I just know

76
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:44,948
the triangle is one of the standards from the west coast is Staple in the community

77
00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:51,340
for a long time yeah for sure for sure and I guess as a final little question on OG before

78
00:06:51,339 --> 00:06:58,138
we jump to the next topic was do you prefer the really gas emojis like kind of like um

79
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:01,530
you know your high octanes and stuff like that or do you prefer the more cushy ones

80
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:06,250
like the TK I like the gas ones for sure those are my favorite is the Galaxy fuels I'm all

81
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:13,129
about the gassy the gassy OG is the stiff I think my favorite for sure so high you get

82
00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:19,699
to know stable in the community for a long time to come yeah 100 I think I kind of realized

83
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:23,889
that myself when I was talking to Coma a while back and he said you know everyone's trying

84
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:27,199
to reinvent the wheel but there's so much more work to be done within the gas field

85
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,629
because as you said it's just like such a like a dominating flavor profile that people

86
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:35,910
just fall in love with don't they never gets all it's always a step what comes and goes

87
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:40,379
the toys so it's theirs you never go wrong with gas but it always it always sells always

88
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:47,069
is a hint who always love it for sure so let's jump back to the start would you be able to

89
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:50,870
tell me a little bit about the first experience you ever had with cannabis the first experience

90
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:55,769
here with canvas and was in high school I think or a freshman year I had some friends

91
00:07:55,769 --> 00:07:59,719
that were the one that were going downtown to this Festival to swap balls they said I

92
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,840
wasn't sure what that was going to do the whole thing I was like smoking balls it's

93
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:07,149
that we took the bus downtown and there was a it's not like a drum circle down there it

94
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:11,918
was like a open vendoring market called bands and music and stuff and they're they're talking

95
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:16,709
they're like what's going on here so I talk to her son there and just that's so high and

96
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:21,469
it kind of fell a little bit from that point hell yeah I mean what a what a cool story

97
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:26,280
and do you happen to know what you were smoking on or was it just kind of like the reggae

98
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:33,228
or it was just some high grade Oregon um indoor no no names at that time the green chronic

99
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:39,250
you know back in the days the staple green Bud oh man I'm jealous and I guess it's maybe

100
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:43,969
a bit of a redundant question but you you obviously got high the first time you smoked

101
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:50,030
oh yeah very high floating on water basically it was incredible was that the moment when

102
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:53,539
you kind of started to think maybe you're going to be involved in cannabis throughout

103
00:08:53,539 --> 00:08:57,319
your life or that happened a bit later down the track but I've been a bit later for sure

104
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,430
I was really fascinated with cameras from a young age limited years ago pursuing to

105
00:09:01,429 --> 00:09:07,569
Marina for a long time but I didn't really make a career until the path yeah okay I mean

106
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:13,589
and so what was the transition from say around that time to when you first started to have

107
00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:18,591
your first grow was it a long time short time um in 2004 I had the opportunity to go to

108
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:22,299
Amsterdam with a friend over there so over to Europe for two years I really studied the

109
00:09:22,299 --> 00:09:25,929
coffee shop culture and really got absorbed in it really I learned a lot about the marijuana

110
00:09:25,929 --> 00:09:30,599
and how it works and how how it affected me in my life and what I really appreciated about

111
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:36,200
it and I came back to Oregon in 2006 and it was around the time of medical marijuana and

112
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,879
I got a basement with a friend in his house I kind of started growing up there I progressed

113
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:43,649
from that to moving into other houses it was imagine more facilities and I started working

114
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:48,519
with the sensors and kind of from that point on I couldn't really digging into it when

115
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:54,789
I got back from this from information there yeah awesome that's it's kind of interesting

116
00:09:54,789 --> 00:09:58,259
how that seems to be like a Common Thread for a lot of people like they have that Epiphany

117
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:03,399
in Amsterdam were there any genetics you remember from that time that you were working with

118
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:06,588
that you were like man that was like a cool thing to start out working with because in

119
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:11,100
retrospect it was like this legendary strain from Amsterdam or was it just more kind of

120
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,459
whatever you could get your hands on oh when I started back in the state there was a little

121
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:20,849
late this is basically like shishka Berry and stuff some of them are a particular dog

122
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:26,829
[ __ ] um Fort Collins that was really head Stoppers I really fell in love with her like

123
00:10:26,828 --> 00:10:31,539
the original East Coast Tower diesel is where all some of the measures yeah wow that's so

124
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:36,539
cool I uh I had noticed when I was looking at a lot of your work that like the dog [ __ ]

125
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:41,019
popped up and I think I even saw the cough in there once or twice and I had only ever

126
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:46,328
really seen Fletcher from archive try to like push these strains in terms of saying to people

127
00:10:46,328 --> 00:10:49,809
like look these are these are great strains you just got to give them a chance do you

128
00:10:49,809 --> 00:10:53,588
feel like you're trying to do the same in a certain sense of like get the word out that

129
00:10:53,589 --> 00:11:02,380
these are still killer crosses

130
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:05,639
with compound but those are definitely Staples that are kind of lost as Rolex I think it's

131
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:10,990
not really recognized with today's modern players sure and I mean just out of a personal

132
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:16,320
curiosity I've never tried the dog [ __ ] for example do you feel like a well-grown

133
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,879
um you know kind of Bud from dog [ __ ] would still be pretty enjoyable for most people

134
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:24,870
these days or it's a bit of like oh definitely definitely the problem with that is it goes

135
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:31,250
12 to 13 weeks of flowers you do it properly so it's kind of lost the attention it deserve

136
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:36,240
so it is it's different definitely a hit I think I think the name kind of holds it back

137
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,639
for you besides that I think it's a great all wrong hold of her yeah I think we have

138
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:44,110
heard from some other guests before that they thought the name might have put some people

139
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:48,620
off but that's good to hear that it's still still power I I had no idea it was a 13-week

140
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:54,340
do you happen to know the genetics on it I don't I don't know it's really really a strong

141
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,930
head height really really something to do a head hurt with a really really intensely

142
00:11:57,929 --> 00:12:04,199
and since he like um Woody uh trigger profile it's really really unique Unforgettable that's

143
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,839
amazing and I guess as a general question do you find yourself gravitating to sativa

144
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,070
strains often or more of like a Kush guy um I like to do something you can find them it's

145
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:18,620
kind of hard to find a good ones in the states anymore I kind of at least I thought when

146
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:22,220
I was doing the Amsterdam for a while but I mean there's something more on the Exotic

147
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:28,080
hybrid um chain right now it's my favorite profile right now at the moment yeah sure

148
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:33,150
I actually had a question about that which was that we see a lot of various different

149
00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:37,909
strains being labeled as Exotics and I think that a lot of the time it kind of boils down

150
00:12:37,909 --> 00:12:44,019
to this cookies or cush kind of lineage do you ever think we'll see sativa Exotics hitting

151
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:49,339
the stores definitely I think so and I hope so I hope the market um expands too I think

152
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:53,480
I think it can be done it just has to be more of um bringing the cultivation tone down I

153
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:58,449
think it throws the q's in the lack of bad appeal sometimes but if you you could higherize

154
00:12:58,448 --> 00:13:06,069
that with some of them for sure yeah sure I can understand that this is a kind of a

155
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:10,930
question that I still don't know much about myself because it's just hard to answer but

156
00:13:10,929 --> 00:13:13,399
in your mind what makes something exotic

157
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:40,860
but as far as like being top shelf and being popular yeah sure I mean that that all checks

158
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:48,110
out interesting and would you ever consider like some cool old world genetics exotic or

159
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:52,610
it's not about like how available it is it's more about like the aesthetic and the look

160
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:59,490
and whatnot oh definitely definitely doesn't exotic and very rare I think it's just a matter

161
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:03,539
of your perspective I think the modern rocker kind of um pigeonhole certain things there's

162
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:10,049
a bigger picture in the water all of those yeah yeah great answer so let's go back a

163
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:14,250
little bit you mentioned that you started out doing smaller grows and then as they succeeded

164
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:19,410
you're progressing to bigger and bigger as time went by what sort of a grow style do

165
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:21,599
you tend to use and where you're using back then

166
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:34,528
pretty basic introduction to grow Style great and do you feel like the sort of synthetic

167
00:14:34,528 --> 00:14:39,669
or soilless style of growing has come a long way since then or do you think it's more just

168
00:14:39,669 --> 00:14:44,599
people learning about how to do it better I think people have wanted to do it better

169
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,980
for sure it's totally they're similar but you can't really reinvent the wheel there's

170
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:53,680
only so much you can improve on this technology and Innovation I think it's definitely the

171
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:58,278
Growers have gotten a lot better as opposed to the earlier era of like medical days yeah

172
00:14:58,278 --> 00:15:04,129
sure and the age-old debate which commonly occurs on the show do you feel like really

173
00:15:04,129 --> 00:15:13,009
well-grown soilists can stand up to really well-grown soil

174
00:15:13,009 --> 00:15:21,610
sure and I mean I'm asking you this because I know that you're so tied in with a lot of

175
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:25,940
these companies and whatnot do you know of any companies that are selling maybe recweed

176
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:29,779
or large-scale stuff that are doing it with soil or you think like soilless is pretty

177
00:15:29,778 --> 00:15:34,078
much the way to go I don't know anyone to throw a saw at all it throws record it's all

178
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:38,568
so as I can tell and Coco and Rockwell it seems to be the the Trinity known or anyone

179
00:15:38,568 --> 00:15:43,819
doing something so or anything like that unfortunately sure except press cultivar and organizing

180
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:49,149
that too a large scale yeah and do you think that's because of just like pests and crop

181
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:54,000
failure or do you think it's just ease of use the mixture of both I think I think I'm

182
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,539
sure that's what makes that happen but it's definitely not the reality yeah okay understandable

183
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:06,139
and I guess final question on that sort of like idea is do you see anyone doing like

184
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:10,149
a sort of a hybrid system where maybe they're growing in Cocoa but trying to do it kind

185
00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:15,509
of with Organic inputs otherwise how many people using teases like that on top of like

186
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:21,159
basic salts too a little hybriding but no no no nothing beyond that way do you think

187
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:26,539
there's any Merit in that or you think like just try to do it properly soil this

188
00:16:26,539 --> 00:16:35,469
[Music] not just one basic salt I think but I think people are uh has conscious to implement

189
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:40,509
more things into the row well hopefully they do that yeah I mean that makes sense right

190
00:16:40,509 --> 00:16:45,120
because yeah people are getting more on game with their turfs and what not okay so if we

191
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,789
jump back now you were kind of developing as a grower and you're moving into bigger

192
00:16:49,789 --> 00:16:55,149
and bigger facilities during this time was there anyone who you kind of looked up to

193
00:16:55,149 --> 00:16:59,179
like often we hear people talking about you know having read some of the earlier books

194
00:16:59,179 --> 00:17:03,049
like you know sensimere tips stuff like that was there anyone you looked up to or you were

195
00:17:03,049 --> 00:17:08,558
kind of discovering things on your own I'm looking up too and if they say I see mag a

196
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:13,399
lot back in the day I wrote from a lot kind of the city that is not a knowledge base um

197
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,679
so the early beers I look like two were probably anxiety attacks might use different just like

198
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:22,679
the first um real beers I looked up to that had a really well robust uh commercial brand

199
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:25,730
it was really put together really dialed with his presentation and his quality and it was

200
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:32,390
it was the Northwest too so it was a good influence for me yeah true I forgot he was

201
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:37,669
around that area as well at the time wasn't he yeah he's in Washington I believe yeah

202
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:42,549
okay cool yeah we hear a lot of people talk about how Mike had a kind of influence on

203
00:17:42,548 --> 00:17:46,509
them like that I think that's kind of cool Credence to the company because in I think

204
00:17:46,509 --> 00:17:50,069
in some people's mind they still think of exotic as a rather new brand but as you pointed

205
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:55,569
out like they've been around a while yeah since 2014 I believe 13 are on there is when

206
00:17:55,569 --> 00:18:01,029
I first caught one of them sure from that point kind of when you're upscaling and growing

207
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:06,089
and growing at what point did you first have the idea about compound um compound came about

208
00:18:06,089 --> 00:18:13,399
around 2016 to 2017. later into my actual cultivation phase more as a progression of

209
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:19,540
my understanding the value of genetics and see I wanted to do my own stuff okay sure

210
00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:23,809
and like how long did it take you to get the working pieces in place from the moment you

211
00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:27,869
first started thinking about it to actually getting it going um actually surprisingly

212
00:18:27,869 --> 00:18:32,048
pretty quickly I insert some seeds from for the first regular line that I found the mail

213
00:18:32,048 --> 00:18:36,859
from um at chalice Festival in 2016. and the the first culture is for the the pen line

214
00:18:36,859 --> 00:18:43,009
the Jeff the gelato and the men talking about at the same time so it was a very fortunate

215
00:18:43,009 --> 00:18:45,730
situation where I really would require so much well each unit initially to start the

216
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:51,490
brand with yeah okay cool I mean that's interesting because I remember the first time I saw your

217
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:56,190
stuff was the jet fuel gelato so I guess I must have seen it kind of not too long after

218
00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:02,250
things first started out I remembered thinking to myself like this looks like a really sort

219
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:07,009
of fire strain like other crosses you made with it and I remembered looking into the

220
00:19:07,009 --> 00:19:11,419
genetics and the thing which caught me was that it's kind of like an interesting mixture

221
00:19:11,419 --> 00:19:18,309
of genetics there's like the 303 seeds there's um the high octane OG what was it about those

222
00:19:18,308 --> 00:19:23,250
specific genetics that you were into did you grow 303 before that or you liked the overall

223
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:28,829
picture it was putting forth um the culture was mainly the gas I found it was really a

224
00:19:28,829 --> 00:19:35,230
unique gassy um I like the really good structure so I gravitated towards um I received the

225
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:38,558
culture from my friend Korean City cannabis and SF who developed a cultivar and I helped

226
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:44,639
name it and um I originally got it was called jet Lotto I changed it into July with inspiration

227
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:51,390
and it kind of really put that cultivar into the spotlight um reading projects sure and

228
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:57,060
I know that a lot of people probably missed out on some of those initial drops are you

229
00:19:57,059 --> 00:20:01,359
the type of breeder who likes to remake the sort of popular crosses or are you kind of

230
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:06,699
like no I make them once and once they're gone that's it I like to go once when they're

231
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:11,210
gone they're gone usually scarcity and make things unique ability to have a unique cultivar

232
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:17,529
that it's not going to be the water down and it really sold and resold over time yeah sure

233
00:20:17,529 --> 00:20:22,281
and I mean are you aware of any of the jet fuel lines still being in stock or are they

234
00:20:22,281 --> 00:20:26,740
just long gone at this point they're pretty much sell it right away go somewhere around

235
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:29,808
yeah that's what I thought I was like you know hanging on to a prayer

236
00:20:29,808 --> 00:20:41,019
in the archive so I noticed from there actually sorry rewind a little bit am I mistaken in

237
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:46,779
the I think that when compound started it was a collaboration between you and another

238
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:52,789
breeder was it yeah eventually it was yeah okay and when do you kind of Go Your Own Way

239
00:20:52,789 --> 00:21:01,450
with that um in the summer of 2018. okay and was that just sort of like uh you wanted to

240
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:08,700
take control of the direction you were heading in no it's kind of it was unfortunately so

241
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:14,180
circumstances that have been um have a flat between us part of the time so there was no

242
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:22,120
one reason for it happening yeah okay would I be correct in the the Menthol was made before

243
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:28,109
the separation yes it wasn't me at the same time gelato I'm trying to put this all together

244
00:21:28,109 --> 00:21:33,969
because I noticed that the wise Farms also uses it why use Farms yeah my old partner

245
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:38,680
so I guess the obvious point to state is that you both recognize that the Menthol was like

246
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:42,900
a cool line and that's why it's popped up what is it about the Menthol that you're really

247
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:49,419
into um it's a unique cultivar it's very um it's like a white July with gassy minty um

248
00:21:49,419 --> 00:21:53,370
Menthol Terps it's really unique it's really deep purple and it turns to breed them very

249
00:21:53,369 --> 00:22:00,649
frosty um exactly implants with a good density and good flower time and very robust and resilient

250
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:04,110
to a Butch Harrison world so it checks all the boxes and it's really a stronghold it's

251
00:22:04,109 --> 00:22:08,928
Unique and it's a good reader for sure the thing that really caught my eye about it was

252
00:22:08,929 --> 00:22:13,980
that like the jet fuel gelato it had a lot of similar components in it but it notably

253
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:18,360
had that white diesel in it which I thought was interesting because that came from White

254
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:23,099
Label seeds which I hadn't really heard a lot about to be honest what was the back story

255
00:22:23,099 --> 00:22:28,119
on those seeds and like what kind of attracted you to using a fairly unknown Breeder's work

256
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:35,639
I was actually from a local Korean city is actually a this diesel weighted in Houston

257
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,950
user for the Brewing project so I believe it's Orlando ah okay that makes sense that

258
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:46,690
makes sense and maybe a silly question but I guess that the strain itself is very mentholy

259
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:52,870
in flavor yeah actually I got the code it was it was called dots we changed it into

260
00:22:52,869 --> 00:22:58,509
the menthology we're in the kid's house is on the component he said this looks like menthols

261
00:22:58,509 --> 00:23:04,058
there's something called Menthol there's stuff from there yeah okay makes sense makes sense

262
00:23:04,058 --> 00:23:10,609
and out of um the Menthol crosses if someone was looking for one that was sort of the most

263
00:23:10,609 --> 00:23:13,859
mentholy they can find because I've actually surprisingly had a lot of people say that

264
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:18,639
that's like a flavor profile that it's kind of a little actually hard to find which crossword

265
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,700
do you recommend that sort of the most mentholi out of all of the lines you've done with it

266
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:28,650
it was a tough one probably the um Tokyo snow is probably my favorite Alliance to The Hibachi

267
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:33,940
Supreme by the Menthol which is watching Supreme is um GMO by uh Living Legends which is um

268
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:39,940
LA Confidential by Legend OG so it's a really unique cross it can't really guess in mentholy

269
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:44,669
yeah wow that's got some real powerhouse strains in the mix there what's your thoughts on the

270
00:23:44,669 --> 00:23:48,038
legend OG I've seen you've worked with it a little bit and it's one of the more neuro

271
00:23:48,038 --> 00:23:52,269
G's on the market do you like it which color are you talking about the report card or the

272
00:23:52,269 --> 00:23:59,170
actual uh for La yeah good good point I forgot that there was the two cuts I think the crinkle

273
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:03,230
is the preferred one is that correct or you you tell me what's up do pickles a little

274
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:08,529
bit different we're not really sure GMO pants more like a cushy uh OG it's more not is it

275
00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:13,629
fully as the actual uh LG OG is more actually OG as far as I'm concerned the critical Cuts

276
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:18,010
more of a it's a different character it's hard to describe it's definitely it's definitely

277
00:24:18,009 --> 00:24:21,549
more Powerhouse for sure that both Kings in their own in their own right but uh definitely

278
00:24:21,549 --> 00:24:27,569
different for sure I prefer the crinkle more the LA okay and do you think they are like

279
00:24:27,569 --> 00:24:32,000
sisters to each other or just strains that happen to get the same name I think this should

280
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
assume near literally it's hilarious other than being OG it's such a certain degree yeah

281
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:44,869
sure okay so I mean moving on there's so many strains I could choose to talk about from

282
00:24:44,869 --> 00:24:50,349
your lineup because there's just been so many powerhouses I think the one that I was pretty

283
00:24:50,349 --> 00:24:56,869
interested in next was um the the collab you had got with rado in the works it was the

284
00:24:56,869 --> 00:25:02,288
gasoline grape the grape gasoline yeah grab gasoline my apologies how did how did this

285
00:25:02,288 --> 00:25:06,908
one come about did you try the grape pie and you were like oh this is winner or how did

286
00:25:06,909 --> 00:25:11,760
it all happen um well can I threw a friend of mine for a while since I started breeding

287
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:16,240
and he's been a good Ally good person I've done so many ideas off of him and he's been

288
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,200
very supportive of me since the start and um I did the first trip to July uh polishing

289
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:26,230
I switched a great podcast and use it in the polishing and I asked Karen if we do a collaboration

290
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:30,630
with it was across the concrete gasoline and he agreed um but nothing really came out of

291
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:33,820
it because we got sidetracked with other things and a few years later down the line my friend

292
00:25:33,819 --> 00:25:38,038
Freedom hunters in Michigan selected the kind of using this pollution it was so far as assistant

293
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:42,669
raising inter profile uh Richard Toronto and solicitor collaboration on this cut and he

294
00:25:42,669 --> 00:25:46,960
said okay and so he's impressively we made a politician and tested the line and it was

295
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,380
a really unique profile it's really really gravy and like cough syrupy gravy with some

296
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:55,960
Sour fuels really one of my current favorites right now wow that sounds awesome it kind

297
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,278
of sounds like what I imagine must taste like but like it sounds like you've done even better

298
00:26:00,278 --> 00:26:05,319
I noticed on a few seed banks that were doing some pre-sales of it like it's all sold out

299
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:10,529
so obviously like people are hyped as for it what can these people expect from some

300
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:15,059
of the crosses like just some of that flavor imparted or like you think it'll be more new

301
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:19,639
sort of flavors coming out of it there's really lots of people in there that are heavy group

302
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,630
of purely kind of like Surry gripped dominant there's also gonna be some new new profiles

303
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:27,400
because we use a wide range of cultivars with a wide range of tripping profilers you're

304
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,470
gonna find lots of different things based on the customers we use so the rose I find

305
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:37,430
some really amazing views in the selections so you just mentioned Rado a moment ago about

306
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:42,130
someone who's like a friend and you know you like his work and whatnot a question I like

307
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:45,539
to ask everyone who comes on the show are there any other breeders who maybe you're

308
00:26:45,538 --> 00:26:49,480
not necessarily doing a collab with or anything but you just kind of keep your eye on and

309
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:54,240
you think they're doing some good stuff yeah right on the bay area there's a beer called

310
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,538
Dior Pharmacy doing lots of work down there it doesn't really lose any cultivars which

311
00:26:57,538 --> 00:27:02,109
received into the political he's doing lots of really good cultural development puts in

312
00:27:02,109 --> 00:27:05,099
the time in the working does really amazing stuff um because I want to watch for sure

313
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:10,449
he's the one that comes around right now and so um the runs guys are doing some good stuff

314
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:12,380
too Nick runs from the runs crew he's a good friend of mine he's putting in some real seed

315
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:19,190
work with the Run sky so you should see some assessment in the next year also yeah amazing

316
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:23,789
I mean I think a lot of people including myself are really interested in the work you've been

317
00:27:23,789 --> 00:27:28,690
doing with the Run Skies the first question I would generally speaking want to ask is

318
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:33,880
that you know runs has been sweeping Awards as of recently for like strain of the year

319
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:38,809
on a few different platforms what's your thoughts on runs itself you often hear people say that

320
00:27:38,808 --> 00:27:42,970
it's kind of like a watered-down gelato do you subscribe to that idea or you think it's

321
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:47,839
better different what's your thoughts I think Russ is one of a kind something unique and

322
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:51,720
real runs is definitely um not watered down the trippy River file on the White Rose is

323
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:56,169
incredible and hard to describe it's like skills but different it's just it's really

324
00:27:56,169 --> 00:28:00,840
unique and grown right once is in a league of its own it's definitely I'm not the biggest

325
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:05,589
cultivar it can be a little um finicky sometimes that real runs is definitely a profile that's

326
00:28:05,589 --> 00:28:11,069
going to be in here for a while so it's definitely a staple you get the right cut and it's run

327
00:28:11,069 --> 00:28:16,349
by the right cultivator sure and I mean like all popular Cuts I'm sure there are many imitations

328
00:28:16,349 --> 00:28:21,288
do you think that the reason maybe some people have this somewhat negative view of it compared

329
00:28:21,288 --> 00:28:26,038
to gelato is just because they're not getting the real deal probably yeah and there's also

330
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:29,900
probably runs out there it's kind of not not doing it sort of properly so you need to find

331
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:35,780
the the right kind of to get the good representation of it yeah of course I mean with that being

332
00:28:35,779 --> 00:28:39,250
said you've done a lot of work with the runs already and we're going to delve into it even

333
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:43,650
more but do you feel like at this point if someone was to see runs winning all these

334
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:47,001
Awards and they're like hey I need to start breeding with that do you feel like they're

335
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,190
almost a bit too late to the party to get on board that train

336
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:56,850
the hot newest thing anymore is simply out there now but I don't think it's gonna be

337
00:28:56,849 --> 00:28:59,908
around for a while you'll see some hundreds of it and new players of it for a while it's

338
00:28:59,909 --> 00:29:05,789
a new staple for sure yeah okay cool I saw that a lot of people were raving about your

339
00:29:05,788 --> 00:29:11,609
Joker's line and I was wondering was this where you first saw the potential for the

340
00:29:11,609 --> 00:29:16,899
white runs line itself or did that come at a different time oh I saw that potentially

341
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:20,470
initially but I was cautious to do it going to like just okay with the boy from The Run

342
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:25,240
Skies but kind of like runs upon she kind of came into first and after becoming friends

343
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,880
with Nick and working with the runs guys more and kind of deciding to do some seed products

344
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,720
together yeah okay and I mean on that exact topic what's it like to collaborate in runs

345
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,149
with Jen in general you know like are they primarily sort of the promotional part of

346
00:29:39,148 --> 00:29:44,639
it and you're kind of doing the breeding part of it how would you describe this collab um

347
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,640
I decided the work for the actual process myself but the necrons is definitely Hands-On

348
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,490
and have great ideas and lots of input on the cultivatives and um where to take things

349
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:56,990
and how to move forward them these are very influential in helping shape my Facebook since

350
00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:01,419
I moved to Francisco from Oregon use a has a good taste and it really um is picky what

351
00:30:01,419 --> 00:30:05,970
he wants to move forward with runs so he's been very helpful with the creative aspects

352
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,650
and it was a lot of work behind the scenes you don't really see it kind of comes the

353
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:13,370
fruition later as the Forefront of the brand but you definitely played a rig role as far

354
00:30:13,369 --> 00:30:19,538
as them yeah the Gen X and what most of the creative aspects there yeah I think undeniably

355
00:30:19,538 --> 00:30:24,799
he's done a lot of work in the creative aspect and like creating the the brand and hyping

356
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:30,319
it and whatnot I forgot to ask just a minute ago the white runs itself it's got some cool

357
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:34,839
genetics in the works given it's got um the Menthol and whatnot could you give us a little

358
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:39,609
rundown on how the creation of this strain occurred was it just sort of a one of the

359
00:30:39,609 --> 00:30:43,199
strains you were making at the time or did you really think like this one's going to

360
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,269
be a winner I've got to do this pairing white runs the culture itself you mean yeah the

361
00:30:48,269 --> 00:30:52,250
line yeah well the wire ones came from the Run scars themselves that's their their work

362
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:58,259
so I'm just almost using it to make the line with uh okay what I thought was when I was

363
00:30:58,259 --> 00:31:03,129
looking through all the various lines I mean all of them look insanely good but to me the

364
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:08,380
rows and gold runts looks like it could be one of the most anticipated strains you know

365
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:13,799
ever so to speak um what do you think people should expect from these seeds do you think

366
00:31:13,798 --> 00:31:17,048
they're just going to sell out like hot fire because I mean that's what I imagine they've

367
00:31:17,048 --> 00:31:20,589
already sold out pretty much as far as I'm concerned the demand seems to be through the

368
00:31:20,589 --> 00:31:24,240
roof I'm actually doing another polish right now to see more seeds and more flavor from

369
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,450
that collaboration and run it next year yeah wow and do you have any ideas about where

370
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:33,289
you want to take this line if you're going to work it further or do you have other projects

371
00:31:33,289 --> 00:31:37,230
you're more interested in working with in the future I like to find some standard Contours

372
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:40,870
from the seeds and try to work those further definitely recover some new emails I'm working

373
00:31:40,869 --> 00:31:45,739
with and just do it for everybody what we find in the seeds and all the ones guys I'm

374
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:50,849
gonna go ahead yeah okay I mean something that I noticed from your work in general is

375
00:31:50,849 --> 00:31:57,250
that you do seem to have a really wide diversity of um like unique females you're using many

376
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:02,388
of them I like don't see being used in other people's work does this come from you being

377
00:32:02,388 --> 00:32:06,908
like really on top of like finding new clones and trading with people and whatnot or do

378
00:32:06,909 --> 00:32:12,059
you just do a lot of funeral hunting yourself a mixture of both I really try to collect

379
00:32:12,058 --> 00:32:17,190
as many cultures as I can and really um probe a network for example reading projects I try

380
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:22,130
to make my lives for my products as exclusive as possible and try to really hone in on a

381
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:26,450
new Cutting Edge flavors from breeders that I respect and Friends kind of collect those

382
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:30,340
and require them and use them for my products so as well as well as selecting my own house

383
00:32:30,339 --> 00:32:36,339
just to make sure we both have a wide network of people I know so people like Irish I tend

384
00:32:36,339 --> 00:32:41,028
to stay social with and have they trust me with their cultivars to do that to work with

385
00:32:41,028 --> 00:32:45,109
you you need to cut something able to acquire which has been one of the benefits to conference

386
00:32:45,109 --> 00:32:51,428
moving forward and it's helped me have unique players and unique lines to release perfect

387
00:32:51,429 --> 00:32:58,960
and I mean in general would you advise aspiring breeders that they should be looking to sort

388
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:04,230
of Fino hunt a little bit within their own lines or it's okay to just sort of like just

389
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:07,808
bring in new clones and just pollinate them sort of thing like I know that I guess I'm

390
00:33:07,808 --> 00:33:11,259
kind of making that sound a bit bad but I guess the question is do you feel like it's

391
00:33:11,259 --> 00:33:15,450
important for a breeder to Fino hunt within their own lines or it's kind of an optional

392
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:18,990
thing because enough people are finding new stuff all the time I think it's important

393
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:22,990
to work your own stuff and make your name for with your own stuff I think beers also

394
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:26,659
should be not like be too afraid to know with other people I think that's a good thing to

395
00:33:26,659 --> 00:33:30,130
move forward especially with the modern era of like legalization and be able to be more

396
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:33,510
out there not be so afraid of it but you still work your own stuff and make name with your

397
00:33:33,509 --> 00:33:37,179
own work as much as possible and find your own selections I think it's the feed reading

398
00:33:37,179 --> 00:33:44,809
minion players yeah okay so when you go about creating new strains do you kind of do it

399
00:33:44,808 --> 00:33:49,099
in a conceptualized way where you're kind of thinking of pairing two strands together

400
00:33:49,099 --> 00:33:52,529
and you're like yeah they're going to blend really well together or is it more of a case

401
00:33:52,529 --> 00:33:56,658
of like trial and error and you're you're doing a big pollination and finding the ones

402
00:33:56,659 --> 00:34:01,690
that are standing out and then proceeding with that sort of design we're planted do

403
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:05,298
I have more thought into it it's more primitive to try to select the best things that represent

404
00:34:05,298 --> 00:34:08,639
cold Wars and troops are looking for or I think that the Market's going or turn the

405
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:13,429
city and kind of use that as my guiding tool as long as my intuition kind of just what

406
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:20,210
I want to see it on the market underground it fits my taste yeah great answer so when

407
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:24,539
you're doing breedings for example I have to ask all I guess is because our viewers

408
00:34:24,539 --> 00:34:28,739
absolutely love it and I love hearing about it too what are some of the things about a

409
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:33,648
male that would impress you are their characteristics we often hear people talking about stem rubs

410
00:34:33,648 --> 00:34:41,128
things like that what's your go-to um we might go to bigger syndrome at the same factor to

411
00:34:41,128 --> 00:34:46,529
me can be misleading for sure um stability I like to do lots of testosterone else drought

412
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:51,780
tests and like different life cycles things that you're running normal settings to make

413
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:57,050
sure it's stable for early flowers in them how fast the boats that's going how dense

414
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:04,079
are also different traits that says just the turbine profile so have you ever toyed with

415
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:10,190
the idea or considered reversing a male and seeing like the terpenes that come off the

416
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:15,869
Reversed male I've heard of that being done and some people don't themselves personally

417
00:35:15,869 --> 00:35:20,990
so I'd be curious to see how that works yeah I really wanna and I haven't been able to

418
00:35:20,989 --> 00:35:24,689
figure out the answer to this but I want to know if it correlates like if you reverse

419
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:30,789
a male and the male ends up producing trichome that smells like grape gasoline and then you

420
00:35:30,789 --> 00:35:36,380
try some of the crosses of that male like does it consistently impart grape gasoline

421
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:40,400
flavors or is it like kind of not correlated in a way that would be an interesting one

422
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:45,710
I think you'll be very curious to find out the mystery boat meals is universe as opposed

423
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:50,280
to the sounds sounds seem to be more dominant based on the culturally reverse buttons with

424
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:54,510
males you never know what's going to be done or recessive or wants to read true or not

425
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:59,380
so the mystery of the email that's it I like that the mystery of the male that's like a

426
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:06,430
new catchphrase yeah um so let's just say you've made a new strain how many seeds do

427
00:36:06,429 --> 00:36:11,029
you like to run to kind of get an idea of what's going on with those genetics and so

428
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:16,329
like for example if if you ran 10 seeds and found one Hermie would you be like this Line's

429
00:36:16,329 --> 00:36:20,390
bunk or do you feel like you've got to run more than that to kind of get an idea of what's

430
00:36:20,389 --> 00:36:26,049
actually going on within the line electoral it's 50 to 100 seeds first per flavor to find

431
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:30,330
a good example representation what's going on I mean ideally more definable setup you

432
00:36:30,329 --> 00:36:34,299
know I'm gonna stay with this time you should be able to find a good representation with

433
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:40,640
at least 50 seeds yeah that's that's a good number I like that so I guess this is a bit

434
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:47,929
of a devil's in the detail question but hypothetically at what point would you can align and I think

435
00:36:47,929 --> 00:36:51,431
I've asked another guest this in the past and it is a bit of a tough one to answer I

436
00:36:51,431 --> 00:36:56,030
understand but let's just say for example you ran 20 seeds or maybe 50 and you found

437
00:36:56,030 --> 00:37:00,800
some of the best results you'd ever seen ever like the most fire stuff you ever found but

438
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,810
you also found a number of hermaphrodites would you at a certain point would you say

439
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:11,349
look this is actually worth releasing because the fire is so good it makes up for the hermaphrodites

440
00:37:11,349 --> 00:37:15,910
or is there a certain point where you're like look I just don't accept that at all across

441
00:37:15,909 --> 00:37:20,440
the board I'm really a fan of losing Gen X with hermia or stable I applied introducing

442
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:25,690
those proven cuts and this is actually releasing the seeds um but I try to stay away from listening

443
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:29,950
things that are unstable and almost the best of the best I think people are having strong

444
00:37:29,949 --> 00:37:36,089
proven objects that are crucial moving forward as um people become more prone to on budgets

445
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:42,170
and having proven genetics are strong is very important to move forward and in general do

446
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:48,588
you like to do in-house testing or do you use external testers a mixture bill I mean

447
00:37:48,588 --> 00:37:53,529
you can't see anything better than yourself seeing firsthand is crucial but I'd like to

448
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:59,710
have a group of people I can trust to do with me as well so I I would agree with that good

449
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:03,740
like five or two people were a little more slower people you can try to take good photographs

450
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:08,959
and record good details and notes yeah and I mean you raised a good point there good

451
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:14,539
photographs I I think it's uh Mr James Bean who said a good photograph sells a thousand

452
00:38:14,539 --> 00:38:20,309
packets of seeds how important do you feel photographs are to being successful as a breeder

453
00:38:20,309 --> 00:38:25,199
in this modern era I'm very important I think you only do so much of a piping reputation

454
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:30,578
I think the good seats can sell out the seeds and you can have a strains kind of standing

455
00:38:30,579 --> 00:38:34,970
stencil you know a good photo I posted in a blue wheel so 10 packs overnight or 20 packs

456
00:38:34,969 --> 00:38:39,909
but as you can see photographs are important I think it also shows that you the time into

457
00:38:39,909 --> 00:38:43,730
tester genetics and I think back in the day you get away with science even more without

458
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:46,679
photographs I think the market is feeling more Savvy and understanding more than the

459
00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:51,440
photographs kind of didn't really test it or didn't put the time in so I've seen the

460
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,818
photographs of the way forward show and I mean I guess an extension of that question

461
00:38:56,818 --> 00:39:02,489
is do you think it's possible to be commercially successful as a breeder in today's climate

462
00:39:02,489 --> 00:39:05,149
and not be particularly active on social media

463
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:12,951
I'm not sure how far you're gonna go with that but you're still here for sure yeah I

464
00:39:12,951 --> 00:39:16,990
mean I've asked that question to people in the past and like funnily enough we hear people

465
00:39:16,989 --> 00:39:21,568
like Rado get mentioned who like you know aren't exactly posting every day but still

466
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:27,474
kind of crush it he's a staple of that it's been one of the ones that kind of paved the

467
00:39:27,474 --> 00:39:30,710
trail for the whole feminized Market in the states I think and kind of was a big inspiration

468
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:36,099
for me Rod has just put so much work in and it's done so many crosses crosses over time

469
00:39:36,099 --> 00:39:42,289
he's just it's pretty impressive yeah I think Rado has put out a really really good number

470
00:39:42,289 --> 00:39:47,019
of films and as you said he paved the way what's your thoughts on Femmes we often hear

471
00:39:47,019 --> 00:39:53,389
people like say things like um mothers that come from feminized seeds aren't as good as

472
00:39:53,389 --> 00:39:59,338
mothers from regular seed do you buy into that at all

473
00:39:59,338 --> 00:40:05,849
to begin with but I think good times done with with solid parents are are tested and

474
00:40:05,849 --> 00:40:09,819
aren't made like hurray from genetics are objective with unsealed traits can be released

475
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:17,039
that's the time sure I mean we hear we hear a wide variety of sort of Whispers and rumors

476
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:22,400
about strains another one I hear is that like Femme females from Femme seeds I mean that's

477
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,880
a bit of a misnomer of course they're females um plants from Femme seeds um like we'll lose

478
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:31,970
Vigor quicker than regular ones will is that another one where you think that's just an

479
00:40:31,969 --> 00:40:44,649
inaccuracy

480
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:49,930
yeah I mean there's certainly a lot of rumors isn't there so I guess to follow up on that

481
00:40:49,929 --> 00:40:55,129
point about um sort of losing Vigor and whatnot given you've got the dog [ __ ] and the

482
00:40:55,130 --> 00:41:01,769
cough and some of these quite more um older strains do you have any ideas about what results

483
00:41:01,769 --> 00:41:07,989
in strains losing Vigor over time I've been replacing that in reality in in the grow I'm

484
00:41:07,989 --> 00:41:11,879
not exactly sure what contributes to that but I think there's several things I mean

485
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:16,680
overall plant care and seeing abuse over time with sprays and treatments and pests and disease

486
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:22,149
and poor grow conditions I think I've seen it dripped over time and you know maybe Chloe

487
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:26,680
and reverting and veg and I'm not sure the science behind that but I know current problems

488
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:31,129
like hotline virus and things like that can definitely make plans change so unfortunately

489
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:34,720
I've been able to live back home all my agenda and TC tissue culture with node Labs so I

490
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:39,269
have all myself cleaned now and it's all tested so I've been able to utilize all proven sterile

491
00:41:39,269 --> 00:41:44,059
plants in my breeding product moving forward has been Advanced my products and helped me

492
00:41:44,059 --> 00:41:50,519
maintain my vigor yeah I mean what a great segue you just gave me I read the article

493
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:55,969
um in High Times you did with thc's or about tissue culture and I thought that was really

494
00:41:55,969 --> 00:42:00,539
cool what was it that first caused you to get involved with tissue culture how did you

495
00:42:00,539 --> 00:42:06,250
first find out about it oh about 2014 I found out about it and it was just fascinating about

496
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:09,230
it that's the thought it was seemed really interesting The Way Forward possibly so it

497
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:13,960
took me a while to get into it they were doing missing people at the history Labs who are

498
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:18,329
interested to know labs and there's networking through my relationships and it's been pretty

499
00:42:18,329 --> 00:42:23,039
amazing to see what she's you can do with the plan how you can really um improve plants

500
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:27,059
and really revise them that you see and back up some extra generics easily with CC there's

501
00:42:27,059 --> 00:42:31,619
lots of advantages so because it's it's really hard to move forward see where it work and

502
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:35,568
go I don't think I've ever really spoken to anyone who'd got tissue culture done on their

503
00:42:35,568 --> 00:42:42,980
clones do you believe that tissue culture would get rid of like that Vigor issue we

504
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:47,789
just mentioned in the prior question or it's more like getting rid of hop latent virus

505
00:42:47,789 --> 00:42:51,070
like you mentioned oh I've seen TC bring back figure I don't think it's not going to bring

506
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:55,760
about like church like anything or plants are drifted to the trips are currently gone

507
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,610
like at the time I like to change that I I don't think I'm gonna like bring back the

508
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:05,220
Sarah diesel I don't seem to happen so I think there's some misconceptions for sure but overall

509
00:43:05,219 --> 00:43:09,559
I would definitely see bringing back bigger and plant Health on plants that need it certain

510
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:13,358
certain ones like not all but it's not like a blanket approach but definitely can help

511
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:18,679
certain plants for sure and do you feel like the difference between the Clone once it's

512
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:24,139
undergone the tissue culture process versus before is quite substantial or it's more like

513
00:43:24,139 --> 00:43:29,179
a subtle thing you need to be familiar to pick up on sometimes for night and day sometimes

514
00:43:29,179 --> 00:43:33,500
we go from like one pound to two and a half pounds overnight with the TC it's really amazing

515
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:38,318
to see the difference sometimes it's a subtle difference it's very different from cultivate

516
00:43:38,318 --> 00:43:45,108
cultivar wow that's exciting and I mean do you think that we'll see like this delineation

517
00:43:45,108 --> 00:43:49,869
over time where like there's a subdivision between like there's like the sour d clone

518
00:43:49,869 --> 00:43:54,340
and the tissue sour Decline and like the tissue one gets like a bit hoarded or whatever do

519
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:58,660
you think that we'll see that Divergence over time or not really yeah I think there's something

520
00:43:58,659 --> 00:44:03,098
except for constantly replenishing your mother's type of TC so you know people that do that

521
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:05,730
I definitely have a different version of their kind of retirement it's the people who can

522
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:10,190
back on it faster in tc2 before it like gets older or gets to be over the other thing we'll

523
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:15,950
have it more uh Elite version of that cup for sure so you'll see before for sure okay

524
00:44:15,949 --> 00:44:20,368
cool and I mean as a final sort of question on tissue culture do you think that it's just

525
00:44:20,369 --> 00:44:25,230
going to become a standard part of the industry where like pretty much most successful breeders

526
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:29,170
end up getting their older stuff tissue culture or do you feel like it's still a bit of a

527
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:33,800
sort of nuanced thing that not everyone's necessarily going to engage in I think it's

528
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:37,619
still a nuanced and still new I think it'll take offered to play catch on a floor and

529
00:44:37,619 --> 00:44:41,480
be the traditional reader in this space during this old proven way well I think that'll still

530
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:44,838
be around but I think we'll look forward to the more recreational grower the more mainstream

531
00:44:44,838 --> 00:44:51,750
regards and adaptive the TC it's the definitely have a stand room before it is the industry

532
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:57,409
progresses I think sure and I mean over the past say two years or probably probably more

533
00:44:57,409 --> 00:45:01,960
but for me I've noticed it in the past two years or so that like different lighting has

534
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:06,269
come a long way particularly the LED stuff what's your thoughts on the LED lights have

535
00:45:06,269 --> 00:45:10,650
you jumped on board that yet I use it for some intelligence for sure amplifier let's

536
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:15,300
see some advantages to it I mean definitely there's a different Lane social at all but

537
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:21,089
I do definitely has a place to stay for sure and definitely you know in a growing um yeah

538
00:45:21,088 --> 00:45:26,889
I don't really have any preference over the tube it definitely is a good layer for sure

539
00:45:26,889 --> 00:45:30,058
you can do a good degree with it in small spaces with like a tennis and stuff like that

540
00:45:30,059 --> 00:45:35,130
enough to worry about eating as much into brainer plants yeah certainly it's good for

541
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:40,079
the the reduced heat output you mentioned doing pollinations there what's your preferred

542
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:44,739
style of pollination like kind of doing it by hand and having a real Hands-On approach

543
00:45:44,739 --> 00:45:49,108
to things or do you just like to stick the mail in the room and give it a good Shake

544
00:45:49,108 --> 00:45:52,578
I'm very Hands-On because I need to plant making sure it's probably up and down and

545
00:45:52,579 --> 00:45:57,140
slowly covered and you're getting the most out of each plant for seed production sure

546
00:45:57,139 --> 00:46:02,980
and I think it was the uh the late subcool who said that he liked to pollinate around

547
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:08,039
week two week three what's your sweet spot for pollination in order to get like really

548
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:13,150
good seed output as well as good seat quality in terms of maturation around like two and

549
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:19,440
a half week three just a week four what's the latest seeds I found it works the best

550
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:26,309
sure and do you tend to do a like a few pollinations or just the one and that's pretty pretty satisfactory

551
00:46:26,309 --> 00:46:31,730
what do you mean one polish now the point two or three times at least maybe four times

552
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:36,510
a couple rounds in the room I'm gonna make sure it's fully saturated and fully covered

553
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:41,590
yeah yeah yeah you know the question perfectly so I mean have you ever worked with any of

554
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:46,230
your females that you're reversing to do a pollination and you've found that like the

555
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:51,769
pollen's not particularly like it's not being taken by the female plants I've never had

556
00:46:51,769 --> 00:46:57,050
that happen actually it's all been pretty um successful and very robust it's function

557
00:46:57,050 --> 00:47:02,550
in C production yeah amen that's awesome I just I always read about like you know how

558
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:07,430
there's the infamous TK which is like people really struggle to get pollen from it and

559
00:47:07,429 --> 00:47:11,358
you hear about you know on the other end of the equation Mach 1 which is not accepting

560
00:47:11,358 --> 00:47:15,119
the pollen and it's kind of an interesting concept the idea of like plants not wanting

561
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:19,940
to accept pollen in a certain regard I've seen that with Mach 1 for sure I did a polishing

562
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:23,338
with Mach 1 and the Jeff the gelato and basically dump the whole macro I'm talking about like

563
00:47:23,338 --> 00:47:27,670
10 to 15 seeds so I've seen it happen with Mac I forgot about that the max we were like

564
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:32,530
like that so I'm not sure what would cause that to happen but definitely a weird plan

565
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:40,620
for polishing yeah overall what would be your advice for kind of a novice kind of more emerging

566
00:47:40,619 --> 00:47:45,391
breeder someone who's trying to get the wheels rolling on their own thing what would be some

567
00:47:45,391 --> 00:47:48,869
advice you'd give them in terms of like how they can do it properly and help establish

568
00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:54,039
a good name and brand for themselves um try to make something unique of your own first

569
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:58,179
before you start your brand Credit Union cultivar of your own and it works out make sure it's

570
00:47:58,179 --> 00:48:02,699
stable and unique and once you have something of your own it's kind of like use that as

571
00:48:02,699 --> 00:48:08,199
like here your introduction to the flavor um I think particular people just like take

572
00:48:08,199 --> 00:48:10,899
a pack and see you do like pop pop them in front of you know and then another breeders

573
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:15,630
see if you do some real work it makes them you get your own you just went across a bit

574
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:22,900
to your own flavor you know a lot better chance of making waves with your own company definitely

575
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:27,329
something I've noticed about your brand compound is that you've done really well in terms of

576
00:48:27,329 --> 00:48:32,568
getting your seeds into a variety of different seed banks and Distributors and it it's really

577
00:48:32,568 --> 00:48:37,099
helping to get the seeds out there to Market so to speak what would be your advice for

578
00:48:37,099 --> 00:48:41,160
someone who's hoping to get their seeds to a seed bank at some point do you think it's

579
00:48:41,159 --> 00:48:45,608
just about presentation and like promoting the brand or what's your advice on that front

580
00:48:45,608 --> 00:48:50,289
other presentations are very very important and have a good photographs and good Instagrams

581
00:48:50,289 --> 00:48:55,449
uh social media presence is huge I think and just having the right direction the right

582
00:48:55,449 --> 00:48:59,868
names I think naming is important in branding is key for um having a new brand now as the

583
00:48:59,869 --> 00:49:06,100
market continues to progress so Brandon branding a presentation is a big thing and just a few

584
00:49:06,099 --> 00:49:11,079
projects are fire you'll do well I mean because yeah proves in the pudding I mean on that

585
00:49:11,079 --> 00:49:18,139
exact topic many people will point to cookie fam and to a lesser extent to runs and say

586
00:49:18,139 --> 00:49:25,500
that these uh the the leaders in terms of illustrating that marketing and brand presentation

587
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:30,019
is arguably the most important thing in the industry obviously it needs to be backed by

588
00:49:30,019 --> 00:49:35,358
a good quality product but marketing is king would you agree with that sort of idea learning

589
00:49:35,358 --> 00:49:40,489
is definitely important I think Paul is King over marketing they're really pretty bad and

590
00:49:40,489 --> 00:49:43,779
really nice branding but if you don't have a fire flower in the bag it's only going to

591
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:47,500
go so far I think quality strength at all and really good morning what's really good

592
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:53,181
Gen X I think both those you looked really well yeah solid sentiment there so just a

593
00:49:53,181 --> 00:49:57,280
few questions ago you referenced the idea of like if you had like a fire strand but

594
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,460
there was some herbs in it like rather than releasing it you would just sort of release

595
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:05,599
cuts and try to get those out to people I'm noticing that there's an increase of that

596
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:11,130
in the industry in terms of like um we've seen jbz do it with the cookie fam a bit like

597
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:16,858
kind of like um Contracting or creating certain cuts for them to then sell under their line

598
00:50:16,858 --> 00:50:20,980
is this something you're going to pursue further because I noticed that I think you're likewise

599
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:24,940
doing that with the cookie fam is that right yeah I'm working at successfully with cookies

600
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:29,059
and burn right now to develop flavors for their menu and create new strains for their

601
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:32,250
brands and for the moving forward so over the next year you'll see a large amount of

602
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:36,679
uh compound players for the cookies brand I'm going to be working with most of their

603
00:50:36,679 --> 00:50:41,368
Library so I'll have seed lines in a Contours for the flower brand and I'm holding a whole

604
00:50:41,369 --> 00:50:46,588
bunch of new product coming forward it's very exciting yeah okay there was some rumors that

605
00:50:46,588 --> 00:50:50,568
Jay Beezy was working pretty exclusively with cookies going forward and I've heard that

606
00:50:50,568 --> 00:50:55,710
maybe he's bowing out and you're going to become the more Prime Time collaborator with

607
00:50:55,710 --> 00:51:00,059
cookies is there any truth to that um I can't speak on JB's you're not sure what he's doing

608
00:51:00,059 --> 00:51:03,660
but definitely working with more with burner and they'll have a type of relationship with

609
00:51:03,659 --> 00:51:09,250
him and we'll see cookies a lot next year and move forward so yeah come on cookies is

610
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:13,260
here to stay for sure and doesn't the name roll off the tongue as well compound cookies

611
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:18,410
I love it yeah I like it too everyone's conquering they're both they're both catchy yeah runs

612
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:23,089
compound as well like you imagine like a little jail being like staff by little runs guys

613
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:29,369
I love it I like that cool so I think the the next question that comes to mind is I'd

614
00:51:29,369 --> 00:51:34,480
love to just quickly chat about burner for a sec because I've I've become a bit of a

615
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:39,510
burner fan over the past year or so and I think that it all started when sticker farmer

616
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:44,980
put up a post saying like you know people hate on Burner but the reality is this guy

617
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:50,469
has created an industry in terms of like Exotics and there are so many people who are putting

618
00:51:50,469 --> 00:51:55,358
food on the table because of what he's done and I thought that's a really unique perspective

619
00:51:55,358 --> 00:52:00,318
on Burner that no one's really put out there but it's true as far as I can tell like people

620
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:05,380
are eating because of this guy do you feel like there's truth in that statement um I

621
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:09,250
definitely think Burns paved the way as if my industry leader is definitely a Visionary

622
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:14,449
as far as that's concerned I'm typically open the doors for me so yeah he's definitely uh

623
00:52:14,449 --> 00:52:17,679
influence a person that seems like how many people make a name for themselves it continues

624
00:52:17,679 --> 00:52:24,599
to show and I think sometimes people try to like give him a bit of flack saying like you

625
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:28,360
know like he's just this hot man he doesn't do much but I got a sneaking suspicion that

626
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:33,099
he probably works very hard behind the scenes what's your perspective on that oh it works

627
00:52:33,099 --> 00:52:36,650
very hard I mean call me at like seven o'clock in the morning with ideas and we're constantly

628
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:41,730
on values if he lives in a breeze you can sleep so his energy is intense with this and

629
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:45,490
he definitely it's his passion you can tell so he's easy to hit on he's the king he's

630
00:52:45,489 --> 00:52:48,539
on top and he only has to turn on his back but at the end of the day he's a really nice

631
00:52:48,539 --> 00:52:53,849
guy he's been very very good to me against anything bad about him at all he's working

632
00:52:53,849 --> 00:52:58,260
I think it's all one of the best in the industry I probably should have asked you a bit earlier

633
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:03,410
how did you first get in touch with him and how did this collaboration come about um originally

634
00:53:03,409 --> 00:53:07,859
about two years ago he said to me to do a project in Oregon we talked about that for

635
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:12,099
a while but then really came to from that but um when I moved to L.A to California excuse

636
00:53:12,099 --> 00:53:18,150
me um again and you asked for some samples and we connected that way yeah sure okay cool

637
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:22,750
and what do you think is the future for the cookies crew and can I put a little prediction

638
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:32,099
out there that um I feel like apples and bananas is just taken off

639
00:53:32,099 --> 00:53:38,130
I mean more firefighters more compound more um more Innovation more uh leading the pack

640
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:43,050
for sure yeah that's exciting stuff to be able to follow so I mean following up on the

641
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:47,420
apples and bananas it's it's one of the strains from you that has seriously caught my attention

642
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:52,920
possibly more than others along with obviously the masses just jumping on it like hotcakes

643
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:58,019
um what is it about this strain that you think makes it so unique is it is it a balance between

644
00:53:58,019 --> 00:54:03,358
those two sort of flavor profiles or what makes it stand out to you oh that's a commission

645
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:08,078
of things I think the the name the player profile triggering profile the the back appeal

646
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:12,471
the potency it just tricks all the boxes the burning with Burns two or 10 XLS I think it's

647
00:54:12,471 --> 00:54:16,989
it's stable it's really it's a good strain it grows well it's vigorous and it yields

648
00:54:16,989 --> 00:54:21,269
buzzer really appealing to smoke and look at it is all around enjoyable to have in your

649
00:54:21,269 --> 00:54:25,150
your jar in your bowl so I think it's going to be a good one getting good responses towards

650
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:29,150
it so I haven't heard anything really bad about it so um it's been really fortunate

651
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:33,720
to have that response and see it we've been received so well so hopefully it continues

652
00:54:33,719 --> 00:54:37,719
to make waves and it does well I think I think I think it's gonna be one of the hot ones

653
00:54:37,719 --> 00:54:42,259
moving forward and how would you describe the flavor profile on it because I've heard

654
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:48,319
a lot of people talk about the Apple flavor not from apples and bananas but just the Apple

655
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:52,358
flavor in general and they say like oh you know like it's not really bang on Apple it's

656
00:54:52,358 --> 00:54:57,690
kind of a round Apple would you describe apples and bananas as having like a a somewhat clear

657
00:54:57,690 --> 00:55:02,338
apple and banana flavor or is it more leaning to one side than the other it's more more

658
00:55:02,338 --> 00:55:07,159
like a gassy like um ripe apple with a banana exhale it's not really a true up like a sour

659
00:55:07,159 --> 00:55:12,710
apple or apple fritter it's more of a a more dried Apple I'd say it's more more a gassy

660
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:17,590
fruit it's not a fruity fruits more there's more gas in there more of a Philly flavor

661
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:22,940
sure and I mean you just reference the apple fritter I've noticed that the frit is really

662
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:27,329
doing well for itself and doing the rounds at the moment do you feel like that has the

663
00:55:27,329 --> 00:55:33,960
bang on Apple flavor I'm not I don't know about being on but it's like Alex and apple

664
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:37,420
turbo I mean it's kind of people away from the whole Apple which you see last year I

665
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:40,559
think along with the Sarah ball itself but I don't think that's a good representation

666
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:47,279
of Apple for sure yeah okay sure do you plan on doing any more work with because I think

667
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:54,660
apple fritters from lumpy is it yeah Sacramento yeah do you are there any other sort of cuts

668
00:55:54,659 --> 00:55:58,449
or strains from lumpy that you plan to work with in the future I don't have any other

669
00:55:58,449 --> 00:56:04,618
ones at the point I have right now his work is really unique though he's one of the trends

670
00:56:04,619 --> 00:56:10,108
that are currently in Industry hurt her great answer so just to jump back to the apples

671
00:56:10,108 --> 00:56:14,219
and bananas for a moment one of the things I was wondering more than anything is what

672
00:56:14,219 --> 00:56:19,618
are the genetics behind that it's a granddaddy purple by Potter cookies by Blue Power by

673
00:56:19,619 --> 00:56:24,608
gelati it's a mixture of the gelati with The Granary purple and some blue paragraph from

674
00:56:24,608 --> 00:56:32,048
Sin City Seeds wow that's a really cool mixture of like new and old genetics do you have any

675
00:56:32,048 --> 00:56:37,530
fond memories of the Granddaddy Purple um literally it was never big on my radar I actually

676
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:43,359
was kind of lead to the table without unfortunately okay how about blue Power I feel like that's

677
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:47,869
making a Resurgence with Sin Cities having that newer release recently yeah they do lots

678
00:56:47,869 --> 00:56:52,500
of good work for sure I'm big fans of them they've been around for a while that's cool

679
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:57,820
so yeah really kind of nice mixture of different things what's the next step for you with the

680
00:56:57,820 --> 00:57:03,480
apples and bananas is it the rose gold runs I'm going to be doing a feminized line with

681
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:07,190
Burger cookies the next year that we're working on now uh so I'm gonna do a BX slime at the

682
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:12,588
regular a new mail trying to find the BX that and there's more alternative to develop with

683
00:57:12,588 --> 00:57:16,078
the Roosevelt runs and just trying to find any cleaners from the CD Bank of that I'm

684
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:21,940
also doing a gastro pop with it to create Gasoline by apples and banana so we're hunting

685
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:27,869
that soon trying to find some extent that we're finished with it as well wow that uh

686
00:57:27,869 --> 00:57:33,170
the hybrid with the grape gasoline that sounds like that's going to be like fruit punch amazingness

687
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:41,630
yeah it's working with the name gaster problem I made the crossings and see the distance

688
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:42,740
also

689
00:57:42,739 --> 00:57:47,618
wow yeah that's cool and I mean you mentioned you're going to be doing a line with cookies

690
00:57:47,619 --> 00:57:53,269
next year with it are there any females from the cookie Library like that that like you

691
00:57:53,269 --> 00:57:57,630
know burner's got that you think it's going to pair particularly well with or maybe like

692
00:57:57,630 --> 00:58:00,700
a bit of a secret female that people aren't aware of but you think it's going to make

693
00:58:00,699 --> 00:58:04,338
waves when you pair it together oh man so much stuff I'm really excited to work with

694
00:58:04,338 --> 00:58:09,029
the Burke cultivars and especially like the F wondering one of the original cookie cuts

695
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:14,800
um his grenadine um his uh we're at the fiscuit also one of the other new cookie compound

696
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:19,380
Cuts there's a bunch of new stuff so then like thin enchiladas and Cherry Burmese and

697
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:23,610
some Sarah Cherry stuff so you just got a bunch of different access to the new uh samples

698
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:29,740
and try to find the best ones that you use in our collaboration wow yeah you just gave

699
00:58:29,739 --> 00:58:33,689
me so many good Avenues to go off on I think the first one thing that you've just brought

700
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:37,820
to mind is I it's now clicked in my head that obviously you've got access to the cookie

701
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:44,098
fam genetics so when I see on your drops that maybe you've made a hybrid with snowman is

702
00:58:44,099 --> 00:58:48,338
that with the real snowman or with the S1 that's still quite hard to get but not the

703
00:58:48,338 --> 00:58:53,769
original one I guess um yeah like that's our original cookie so for sure is there any summons

704
00:58:53,769 --> 00:58:59,829
or any different powers I thought his work but yeah official from the previews for sure

705
00:58:59,829 --> 00:59:05,320
okay and I mean you reference the F1 Durban just in that previous answer have you seen

706
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:08,760
that flower on its own and like what's your thoughts on it because it's such an elusive

707
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:11,650
thing to come by like people say there's a lot of people out there who still don't even

708
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:15,960
know if it really exists including myself I haven't seen any flower at all so I'm very

709
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:19,750
excited to see some bird just got the cut recently so actually I have some examples

710
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:25,670
a couple years ago so I'm curious to see more about myself yeah wow that's exciting the

711
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:29,380
fish scale have you been lucky enough to try that I haven't actually been able to come

712
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:45,298
across that one in flower form

713
00:59:45,298 --> 00:59:50,519
very unique yeah awesome I mean congrats I've heard that one's doing really quite well for

714
00:59:50,519 --> 00:59:56,679
itself that's awesome to see yes one of the new ones for next year as well so it feels

715
00:59:56,679 --> 01:00:02,710
like cookies has struck on a winning equation whereby they get like a really skilled breeder

716
01:00:02,710 --> 01:00:06,470
that they're happy with to help them with the breeding work and then they kind of take

717
01:00:06,469 --> 01:00:12,059
more control over like the the marketing and the distribution side of things is that how

718
01:00:12,059 --> 01:00:15,849
you envision this collaboration going forward or do you think that you've both got more

719
01:00:15,849 --> 01:00:20,230
input in either side of the equation than maybe I'm making it out like I think it's

720
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:25,190
more of a harmonic relationship more uh on the same page I think I I have marketing and

721
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:29,130
creative control as well as they do and we will have a good Vision moving forward so

722
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:34,440
I think it's more of a share a fair collaboration to think before they definitely have a good

723
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:39,960
morning approach a good vision for that but I definitely think it's a good fit we both

724
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:45,010
complicated complement each other yeah I mean that's that's the secret to winning success

725
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:50,150
I guess is that yeah he's both helping out I read in an article that was talking about

726
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:55,010
apples and bananas it said said a line that really got me thinking it said sneakerheads

727
01:00:55,010 --> 01:00:59,590
line up out front of supreme stores to get the newest shoe drop and soon many of these

728
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:03,950
same people will be lining up out front of dispensary for the new apples and banana drops

729
01:01:03,949 --> 01:01:09,000
from cookies and compound collab do you feel like this statement is true in that the Cannabis

730
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:14,659
scene is becoming a marketplace where the hype beasts are starting to really get involved

731
01:01:14,659 --> 01:01:19,298
who were maybe once historically more just invested in the sneaker game but now they're

732
01:01:19,298 --> 01:01:24,230
trying to be likewise at the Forefront of the Cannabis scene definitely the campus is

733
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:27,929
becoming more trending as it becomes more legal and it becomes more accepted publicly

734
01:01:27,929 --> 01:01:35,139
you're going to see more more Trends and more um shifts into that as the market progresses

735
01:01:35,139 --> 01:01:40,838
yeah okay exciting exciting and do you think that we're gonna see uh just a continual rise

736
01:01:40,838 --> 01:01:44,838
of more of the exotic types of strains or do you think that there is still room for

737
01:01:44,838 --> 01:01:51,449
other strains to do well in the masses I think there's room for all of them in the pudding

738
01:01:51,449 --> 01:01:59,169
so the culture done right we'll stay out and shine yeah okay good answer so I was doing

739
01:01:59,170 --> 01:02:03,960
a bunch of digging around your Instagram finding some questions and I came across a post which

740
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:10,369
caught my eye which was that when you were testing the Joker's crossed there was a a

741
01:02:10,369 --> 01:02:15,470
tube which I think had a Seedling in it that was Joker's cross to Black lime reserve and

742
01:02:15,469 --> 01:02:19,539
that caught my eye because I I like black climb Reserve it's a neat strain from Aficionado

743
01:02:19,539 --> 01:02:24,380
and Mean Gene is this a line that like you know caught your attention and you want to

744
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:27,500
work with it in the future or was it just more of like a little experiment you were

745
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:32,099
toying with I receive those seats from my friends that's actually a gift that somebody

746
01:02:32,099 --> 01:02:36,490
gave me I decided to include my most recent opinion on so I'm excited to see those but

747
01:02:36,489 --> 01:02:40,369
those seats hold that hopefully it's something gems I'm a big fan of the blockline reserve

748
01:02:40,369 --> 01:02:46,179
also so well time will tell I'll let you know soon that those are about to be fired yeah

749
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:50,799
I mean it seems like a cool cross to me so I'm excited to follow the results on that

750
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:56,329
one so a question I bring up in every episode because it's just a staple of our show in

751
01:02:56,329 --> 01:03:01,490
general is chemdog I've seen that you've worked with the chemd in a few crosses you've also

752
01:03:01,489 --> 01:03:07,929
worked with uh chemd I-95 hybrids or killer stuff what are your thoughts on the chem dog

753
01:03:07,929 --> 01:03:14,568
cuttings and do you have a preferred one

754
01:03:14,568 --> 01:03:19,539
the highs are incredible it's a very unique High I'm not really prone to the high it's

755
01:03:19,539 --> 01:03:23,500
more of a knock here in your ass high as far as I'm concerned I don't have a big time of

756
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:28,108
soak or so I don't like to be so inhabilitated or knocked out but it's really a staple for

757
01:03:28,108 --> 01:03:35,449
sure I wholeheartedly agree with you on that one I am uh someone who does enjoy smoking

758
01:03:35,449 --> 01:03:40,028
during the day but it's yeah it's it can be debilitating at times when you smoke the chem

759
01:03:40,028 --> 01:03:44,539
I guess my question becomes what some of your favorite daytime smoke then that just kind

760
01:03:44,539 --> 01:03:49,009
of put you in that right spot to you know not be couch locked and still go about your

761
01:03:49,010 --> 01:03:53,640
daily activities right now my go-to's runs crosses I really like the runs profile it's

762
01:03:53,639 --> 01:03:58,179
a strong interpreting profile but it's not too strong it's right around like 24 or 25.

763
01:03:58,179 --> 01:04:03,719
the maximum so I like that what's a good triggering for us it's a good daytime stroke and it kind

764
01:04:03,719 --> 01:04:07,868
of keeps you through the day I like to have so it's really strong interview sure and do

765
01:04:07,869 --> 01:04:14,858
you have a smoke any like sort of wild sativas like you know this sort of anxiety and juicing

766
01:04:14,858 --> 01:04:16,980
ones you sometimes hear about or not so much

767
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:26,420
at all yeah it's it's interesting I used to be the exact same I hated them and then somehow

768
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:30,570
I don't know how I slowly started to like him a bit more I kind of found that anxiety

769
01:04:30,570 --> 01:04:35,890
a bit fun but as someone who used to not enjoy it I I totally get where you're coming from

770
01:04:35,889 --> 01:04:41,259
as a bit of a random one is there any strain that jumps to mind for you that was like the

771
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:44,260
most sort of anxiety inducing one you've ever had

772
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:51,810
um probably a string called Golden pineapple or uh no matter it's across of inner fire

773
01:04:51,809 --> 01:04:55,449
by Durban Poison from the Northwest it's racist interview I don't know what's going to be

774
01:04:55,449 --> 01:05:00,859
going pretty hard wow that's cool and yeah I've actually tried uh golden pineapple before

775
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:05,798
and that's that's a lovely one great Turpin profile on it yeah right or a classic example

776
01:05:05,798 --> 01:05:12,739
Turf really strong yield or two yeah yeah for sure for sure so in general what are some

777
01:05:12,739 --> 01:05:17,769
genetics either from your own or from outside of your own work from other people what are

778
01:05:17,769 --> 01:05:24,130
some genetics that you're excited to pop next um next probably the the white runs processor

779
01:05:24,130 --> 01:05:29,048
or my radar I'm looking for working the runs crosses and apples have been across the grape

780
01:05:29,048 --> 01:05:34,489
grass crosses all these that's gonna set for next year um the cookies there all the stuff

781
01:05:34,489 --> 01:05:38,868
that we're working on the gas the runs throughout the scale across the bigger Premiere right

782
01:05:38,869 --> 01:05:44,349
now really we're gonna be a fan of skill processes and gas and all the cooking stuff does all

783
01:05:44,349 --> 01:05:51,109
it's alternating for me and I mean the the debate is age-old so I don't expect you to

784
01:05:51,108 --> 01:05:56,699
necessarily give any definitive rulings but a lot of people often speculate about the

785
01:05:56,699 --> 01:06:01,818
genetics within Skittles as well as the genetics within cookies I don't suppose you have any

786
01:06:01,818 --> 01:06:07,509
speculations about what's exactly involved in either of those clones I'm not sure exactly

787
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:10,910
at all but I know you're friends with the turf Islands guys with their Med skills and

788
01:06:10,909 --> 01:06:13,980
it's what they say is true I mean you know Tony he's a real guy he's not one to lie so

789
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:21,440
I believe him sort of when he says like that I definitely think that's a weird female that

790
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:27,760
kind of came out to be without the actual structure diaper and I mean when we look at

791
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:32,240
Skittles itself you often hear people talk about how it just doesn't quite have that

792
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:38,239
bag appeal that some of the other Exotics have if you were to come across a new strain

793
01:06:38,239 --> 01:06:42,118
that was similar to that or even in general when you're just working with Skittles do

794
01:06:42,119 --> 01:06:47,260
you view that as like no biggie just got to make a cross that brings the bag appeal and

795
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:51,410
just keeps everything else or do you feel that as like oh that's a kind of like a bit

796
01:06:51,409 --> 01:06:56,269
of a bad trait for Australian to have it's a bad trade for sure I think skills kind of

797
01:06:56,269 --> 01:07:00,000
got lucky with that one hit I'm not sure because usually they really think it's hard to replicate

798
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:05,429
that or that with that said I think in terms are king interflow is shine over structure

799
01:07:05,429 --> 01:07:11,719
I think Market will still shoot a cut as far as his worthiness over structure the culture

800
01:07:11,719 --> 01:07:16,639
doesn't hate it so it's a fine balance of what the market wants versus what the cultivator

801
01:07:16,639 --> 01:07:22,400
wants to cultivate so it'll be interesting to see how before in the industry do you have

802
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:28,579
any speculations about what is in fact inside cookies um no idea no I can't come out of

803
01:07:28,579 --> 01:07:35,298
that at all yeah I honestly think that we'll probably never find out I agree with you probably

804
01:07:35,298 --> 01:07:41,389
do it's gonna be a mystery for sure yeah and I mean it really probably actually just adds

805
01:07:41,389 --> 01:07:44,799
to the Mystique right I mean the fact I'm asking you about it right now is just kind

806
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:49,829
of a testament to like why maybe it's a good thing we don't find out yeah the same thing

807
01:07:49,829 --> 01:07:54,769
with Kim like who knows what chem library is it's a mystery to a degree yeah exactly

808
01:07:54,769 --> 01:08:01,579
I agree I agree so on the topic of Terps I noticed that in your library you made a cross

809
01:08:01,579 --> 01:08:06,278
chord the leopard and I I loved the name of the mum Cheetos Kush not only is it a cool

810
01:08:06,278 --> 01:08:12,119
name but it also kind of evokes these cool images of flavor where did that one come from

811
01:08:12,119 --> 01:08:16,969
and what's it like the Cheetos Kush I see that I got from a friend of mine called manic

812
01:08:16,969 --> 01:08:22,880
Farms it's across the Boba Kush right ukg's boa like structure with the cheese profile

813
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:27,270
with the cushy aspect to it so unique wow yeah so I guess it probably does have like

814
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:32,690
a Cheetos soda flavor yeah it's really starting with the name for sure that's awesome that's

815
01:08:32,689 --> 01:08:37,649
awesome and I guess it raises the idea of how important do you think a name is to a

816
01:08:37,649 --> 01:08:43,150
cross you know like some names uh make and break but other names you can't help but feel

817
01:08:43,150 --> 01:08:47,789
like they're not really fitting what's your approach when naming a strain I think names

818
01:08:47,789 --> 01:08:52,048
are very important moving forward and it really is kind of set the tone for a strain do a

819
01:08:52,048 --> 01:08:55,720
bad name can't really hold the string back as far as appeal in the market but um I think

820
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:59,909
maybe it's really critical I think most people don't do strange dresses with cheesy names

821
01:08:59,909 --> 01:09:03,789
or games that are very classy I try to try to have an answer to stand the test of time

822
01:09:03,789 --> 01:09:07,810
more time with things more um uh well thought out names not just something that's kind of

823
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:10,460
thrown together trying to really be creative I think I think things are going to last gonna

824
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:15,789
like stick around for a while and appeal to a wider audience yeah definitely I can't remember

825
01:09:15,789 --> 01:09:20,509
who it was but in a previous episode we spoke about how like it's a bit frustrating when

826
01:09:20,509 --> 01:09:23,899
a really cool name gets given to a shitty strain because like now you just can't use

827
01:09:23,899 --> 01:09:31,088
that name anymore exactly yeah it's horrible yeah okay on that General line of thinking

828
01:09:31,088 --> 01:09:35,778
are there any of your lines that you feel like haven't properly been discovered by the

829
01:09:35,779 --> 01:09:41,799
general public or as the uh the fans might say they've been a little slapped on um no

830
01:09:41,798 --> 01:09:47,778
actually no that lines are pretty well received I think I'm actually grabbing for that I think

831
01:09:47,779 --> 01:09:53,010
obviously were the sort of so fast I can't really keep up with the demand so um I think

832
01:09:53,010 --> 01:09:56,690
I think it move forward she's out there toward my fan base because I think about stuff so

833
01:09:56,689 --> 01:10:02,919
it's really a humble experience and an awesome deceiving before yeah I mean gosh what a position

834
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:10,430
to be and my seeds are too well received it's crazy it still takes me back every day yeah

835
01:10:10,430 --> 01:10:15,150
that's awesome to hear I guess uh like another question I was really interested in asking

836
01:10:15,149 --> 01:10:20,259
you is that there's been such a prevalent rise in the consumption of concentrates over

837
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:25,460
the past four or five years particularly with like the sort of casual enthusiasts getting

838
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:30,140
involved in cannabis more and more and we see a lot of increase in vape pen sales and

839
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:36,360
whatnot do you think there's Merit to trying to breed a strain specifically for concentrates

840
01:10:36,359 --> 01:10:40,679
or for like vape pen production given how prevalent it is or do you think that's just

841
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:44,610
like a secondary thought to just creating a good plan in general

842
01:10:44,609 --> 01:10:49,519
I think there's definitely certain profiles you could bring out for for concentrates that

843
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:53,890
are different from stock Productions that are they're huge that definitely have advantages

844
01:10:53,890 --> 01:10:59,430
versus traditional flower protection I haven't really downloaded in there myself I don't

845
01:10:59,430 --> 01:11:03,079
like to see people doing it like blue and Seed code like only seed code or if they focus

846
01:11:03,079 --> 01:11:11,840
on the more uh extra worthy cultivar simply so I I I'm really dabbled in sure and do you

847
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:17,110
have any strong feelings one way or the other about the rise in popularity of vape pens

848
01:11:17,109 --> 01:11:22,439
because some breeders and some people within the industry kind of really not exactly stoked

849
01:11:22,439 --> 01:11:27,971
about it I think the high is different The Taste is a little off but there's most of

850
01:11:27,971 --> 01:11:33,869
them for sure in the market but I'm more of a rosin guy ah rosin is that that the go-to

851
01:11:33,869 --> 01:11:39,460
yeah right that's what my concentration sure like would you say that you prefer Rosen over

852
01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:46,270
say flower uh no not at all foreign heart

853
01:11:46,270 --> 01:11:53,200
yeah it starts the the core first and then you go to the extract after the flower the

854
01:11:53,199 --> 01:11:58,889
real deal first that's it yeah I I think for me nothing will ever get me as satisfied as

855
01:11:58,890 --> 01:12:05,050
just trying some nice flower it's got to be the bee's knees I agree with you man fully

856
01:12:05,050 --> 01:12:12,230
so with that being said um are there any sort of um strains you've ever made or just tried

857
01:12:12,229 --> 01:12:17,089
maybe not necessarily made by you where they really just blew you away once you got some

858
01:12:17,090 --> 01:12:23,840
flower of it the trade um probably my favorite streams I tried was um so is lavender and

859
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:27,420
Amsterdam over there remember that tripping profile being so amazing I really haven't

860
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:34,319
experience that since since that day Blown Away profile for my favorite ones yeah that's

861
01:12:34,319 --> 01:12:39,130
actually an interesting one we hear a lot of people reminisce about Soma's lavender

862
01:12:39,130 --> 01:12:47,500
I wonder what happened to it I don't know I'm sure let's hit him up and find out so

863
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:51,939
I mean to get back to kind of some of the more recent work you've been doing in terms

864
01:12:51,939 --> 01:12:57,829
of your collaborations with various people before we get into the some more kind of specific

865
01:12:57,829 --> 01:13:02,670
questions about it I wanted to ask you a general question which is that in the past we've spoken

866
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:07,690
to guests and they've spoken about how they hope that over time there'll be this emergence

867
01:13:07,689 --> 01:13:12,769
of like the ultra high-end cannabis Market kind of in the same way we see that with like

868
01:13:12,770 --> 01:13:17,710
champagne or with whiskey you know like the real Primo of the Primo do you think that

869
01:13:17,710 --> 01:13:24,350
with the current trends in the community where people are willing to pay more for weed and

870
01:13:24,350 --> 01:13:28,441
willing to pay more for exclusive cannabis and things like that do you think that we

871
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:33,599
will see the development of such a premium Market or like a terroir or an Appalachia

872
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:39,030
sort of thing like that over time I think so I think I think the markets right earlier

873
01:13:39,029 --> 01:13:44,158
and it's in its um progression I think as you see more legalization uh Acceptance in

874
01:13:44,158 --> 01:13:48,859
the market coming forward you'll see a lot more maturity of things as far as what you

875
01:13:48,859 --> 01:13:54,488
described yeah okay do you feel like it's still emerging or like we're there now already

876
01:13:54,488 --> 01:13:58,899
we're very early I think it's still very very early I think there's still a lot to come

877
01:13:58,899 --> 01:14:03,960
a lot more more events a lot more levels of presentation and experiences to come industry

878
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:11,539
I think we're still very very early phases of it sure and to kind of bring back in the

879
01:14:11,539 --> 01:14:17,119
ideas we were discussing about the names of strains in relation to this high-end Market

880
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:21,119
do you have any strong feelings about the name game at the moment in the sense that

881
01:14:21,119 --> 01:14:25,960
we've heard people in the past Express a certain sentiment that like they're not super fond

882
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:31,939
of like the dessert menu sort of names where you know every sort of dessert is getting

883
01:14:31,939 --> 01:14:35,829
used up and we're now even seeing things like you mentioned with the sushi and you know

884
01:14:35,829 --> 01:14:40,390
there's wagyu so we're even moving away from dessert do you think that we're going to move

885
01:14:40,390 --> 01:14:44,000
away from dessert names do you think that that's going to have any impact on the development

886
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:48,670
of this high-end Market or do you think it's just people being weird about names maybe

887
01:14:48,670 --> 01:14:55,359
people were being worried about names I think some of these names are here to stay there

888
01:14:55,359 --> 01:15:00,579
anytime soon I'll be curious to see how the name implies out once you can actually share

889
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:03,109
marketing people are using names over again there's no there's no rules to naming people

890
01:15:03,109 --> 01:15:07,439
or just renaming names that people have used in the past and it's getting kind of messy

891
01:15:07,439 --> 01:15:10,839
so it'll be interesting to see how that ends up moving forward and how people can actually

892
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:15,560
lock their names and secure their names it'll be able to ask everyone to say things to become

893
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:21,090
legal so and I mean while we're kind of talking about the names how do you feel having done

894
01:15:21,090 --> 01:15:27,710
this collaboration with Khalifa has affected you like with whiz in terms of do you feel

895
01:15:27,710 --> 01:15:33,260
cross is using the Khalifa OG do well because of the name just on its own or do you think

896
01:15:33,260 --> 01:15:39,010
it's not as simple as that only doesn't do all their own while you know in the market

897
01:15:39,010 --> 01:15:43,270
now as Morgan behind us I think I think the marketing help helps um that stream grow well

898
01:15:43,270 --> 01:15:47,890
I mean it's also a good idea to give us a commentative effect but I think those are

899
01:15:47,890 --> 01:15:51,760
the advantages of being ahead of the curb with the market having a presence in the industry

900
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:56,340
for a time since you first do marketing so I didn't think that that'll play well for

901
01:15:56,340 --> 01:16:02,980
them move forward in the future to their success do you think that doing collaborations with

902
01:16:02,979 --> 01:16:07,819
like entertainers Like Rappers for example is going to be something we see more of in

903
01:16:07,819 --> 01:16:12,420
the future because I remember initially when burner first hit the scene people were really

904
01:16:12,420 --> 01:16:17,029
critical of the fact that like he had this sort of rap gig on the side but it now seems

905
01:16:17,029 --> 01:16:21,250
like it's becoming more mainstream and just introducing more people into the Cannabis

906
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:26,090
scene what's your thoughts on the collabs with like famous entertainers and the like

907
01:16:26,090 --> 01:16:30,480
I think maybe lots of them moving forward but I'm cautious still like doing with everyone

908
01:16:30,479 --> 01:16:36,189
if you look at my DM on Instagram messages if you want to do it trains constantly how

909
01:16:36,189 --> 01:16:40,289
much does it cost to do a stranger how to get a stranger everyone wants that so you'll

910
01:16:40,289 --> 01:16:45,760
see people trying to jump on that band Library moving forward but um who can do it right

911
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:49,940
who's actually executed properly and not water it down and doing I see so many Brands right

912
01:16:49,939 --> 01:16:54,079
now that have poor quality flour and poor just quality overall I think if you don't

913
01:16:54,079 --> 01:16:58,930
have quality and don't have to say that and you can um people won't go very far so yeah

914
01:16:58,930 --> 01:17:04,380
that's the key for those products and having a real estate in industry oh man I'm gonna

915
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:09,090
have to thank you again for replying to my email considering you got famous rappers filling

916
01:17:09,090 --> 01:17:14,250
up the inbox yeah all kinds of people it's crazy people wanting streams and they make

917
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:20,630
you horny or weird messages you laughing so they're selling her like a Viagra company

918
01:17:20,630 --> 01:17:25,900
hitting you up yeah rappers hitting here for that so people who are wild with their ideas

919
01:17:25,899 --> 01:17:31,369
it's crazy wow that's cool I mean something which just came to mind that I would love

920
01:17:31,369 --> 01:17:36,430
to ask you before I forget about is that I've seen this sentiment expressed by a few different

921
01:17:36,430 --> 01:17:41,579
people within the community where they're saying like many of the top brands at the

922
01:17:41,579 --> 01:17:45,439
moment you ask them about their growth space and like they don't even have grow spaces

923
01:17:45,439 --> 01:17:49,769
like they're Outsourcing to other people do you think that that's going to become more

924
01:17:49,770 --> 01:17:53,770
standard or do you think that's even is there any even truth to that as far as you can tell

925
01:17:53,770 --> 01:17:54,770
foreign

926
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:55,770
like

927
01:17:55,770 --> 01:18:09,960
um some people do very rarely see someone they're doing it all on their own most people

928
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:14,289
have some Partners at the center rates things like so uh challenging to get it all valid

929
01:18:14,289 --> 01:18:19,698
all by yourself so I think that's more over time to see that having to move through friends

930
01:18:19,698 --> 01:18:25,319
I think you'll see labeling down for a while you'd be surprised how many brands have legally

931
01:18:25,319 --> 01:18:29,769
indifferent yeah and do you think over time that it's just going to become segregated

932
01:18:29,770 --> 01:18:33,250
like there'll be people who produce and then they sell to the brands and then the brands

933
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:40,289
retail or do you think it's just a temporary period we're in um I think also continually

934
01:18:40,289 --> 01:18:44,250
the ultimate brands that have brands that will have fail and have to end up doing what

935
01:18:44,250 --> 01:18:48,130
level into survive so a little bit make sure the ones that can hold on hold on to their

936
01:18:48,130 --> 01:18:53,130
actual Brandon to themselves the ones that they're kind of like fall for that just to

937
01:18:53,130 --> 01:18:57,150
survive yeah sure I guess yeah certain times people find themselves in a bit of a tight

938
01:18:57,149 --> 01:19:02,488
spot so to jump away from that for just a moment I just wanted to quickly jump back

939
01:19:02,488 --> 01:19:08,109
to the breeding stuff for a second we often talk to breeders about their sort of hierarchy

940
01:19:08,109 --> 01:19:14,259
of traits in terms of like for you you've mentioned already Terps is very important

941
01:19:14,260 --> 01:19:20,460
but in terms of things like yield ease of growing stability what are sort of some of

942
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:25,340
the things that you think of first and foremost in your mind when you're creating a new cross

943
01:19:25,340 --> 01:19:30,590
that you want it to have within it besides terms let's say structure and bigger and potency

944
01:19:30,590 --> 01:19:34,610
I think it's very important that they're called to our viable for someone to cultivate our

945
01:19:34,609 --> 01:19:38,949
commercial scale report into the recreational market so I don't want to make controversy

946
01:19:38,949 --> 01:19:44,059
to just like check one boxes or interviews or opponents that are actually yields and

947
01:19:44,060 --> 01:19:46,960
bad bigger I think it's very important to check all the boxes and really focus on robust

948
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:52,529
detection of important things that really completes all aspects of the competition and

949
01:19:52,529 --> 01:19:58,559
um flower profile yeah sure like having it well-rounded that makes sense yeah yeah it's

950
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:04,880
very important for me so what's your thoughts on the current sort of seed pricing within

951
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:08,969
the market I've heard people in the past talk about how like we should get standardized

952
01:20:08,969 --> 01:20:13,440
pricings where like you know everyone sells an F1 for the same price blah blah blah do

953
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:17,889
you have any particular thoughts about the seed game and pricing or do you think it's

954
01:20:17,889 --> 01:20:23,569
just like Market forces and I think some banks charge more unfortunately by beer rules so

955
01:20:23,569 --> 01:20:29,519
I didn't think it all comes under your presence how computers is everything for the person

956
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:35,420
they're putting into should pay for what you get for and I really don't like the idea of

957
01:20:35,420 --> 01:20:39,539
expenses either I think they should be more middle of the road not too since they were

958
01:20:39,539 --> 01:20:42,689
like rare gen you know what people don't want to pop it they're so expensive but middle

959
01:20:42,689 --> 01:20:50,559
of the road so I think the reason why this came to mind for me is because I remember

960
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:55,610
not too long ago there was a lot of people who were a bit upset about the price point

961
01:20:55,609 --> 01:21:01,170
of that runs release and I think many of the packs were selling for around 700 each do

962
01:21:01,170 --> 01:21:05,880
you feel like there should be any sort of upper limit to how much Siege should cost

963
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:10,409
like should there be any consideration for like sort of having cost accessible lines

964
01:21:10,408 --> 01:21:14,670
for the public or do you think look it's just Market forces if someone wants to offer like

965
01:21:14,670 --> 01:21:19,100
a cheaper line for other people to be able to grow their work out so be it or what's

966
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:23,130
your thoughts on it is it just a case that not everyone gets to own a Gucci bag so to

967
01:21:23,130 --> 01:21:32,150
speak well the other things that are available before the cheaper price

968
01:21:32,149 --> 01:21:43,488
more luxury seeds I mean I know there was one season those were very very limited yeah

969
01:21:43,488 --> 01:21:44,879
those were still lots of time

970
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:50,659
releases only available to certain people in small scale so that was their first certain

971
01:21:50,659 --> 01:21:51,659
large

972
01:21:51,659 --> 01:21:57,340
so I think likewise some of those same people who weren't too happy about the runts release

973
01:21:57,340 --> 01:22:02,569
kind of had some concerns that maybe that seed drop was the result of a crop failure

974
01:22:02,569 --> 01:22:07,259
that kind of pollinated itself do you think there's any Merit to that idea or do you think

975
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:11,610
it's just simply a case that the runs team kept the project under wraps and didn't really

976
01:22:11,609 --> 01:22:13,019
reveal it until it was complete

977
01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:22,730
lots of work and it wasn't Flow by night or an accident they they did real work with that

978
01:22:22,729 --> 01:22:27,319
it was pretty thought I thought out they just didn't have photographs when they released

979
01:22:27,319 --> 01:22:33,420
it yeah sure so I mean another line of yours which caught my eye because it's really cool

980
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:39,219
was Legend orange F2 um my first question was does it have an actual apricot taste because

981
01:22:39,219 --> 01:22:43,539
I've never been able to come across that flavor profile before it does to a degree it's more

982
01:22:43,539 --> 01:22:50,220
of an orange provides a mixture of orange with apricot-esque the actual uh no use didn't

983
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:55,889
translate in my opinion as opposed to the original orange Democratic cultivar from obsolete

984
01:22:55,889 --> 01:23:02,010
but there's definitely some orange in some neighborhoods in there for sure and what was

985
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:07,619
your kind of goal when making the f2s was it just to get a bigger genetic diversity

986
01:23:07,619 --> 01:23:12,099
so you could find a male more specifically embodying what you wanted or how did you go

987
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:17,460
about doing the F2 I received those as F2 when I received them I originally from capillary

988
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:22,610
child Cesspool in 2016. I hunted the season from the meals and I made the F3 so there

989
01:23:22,610 --> 01:23:28,479
there are F2 I received them so luckily I already had that locked in that makes sense

990
01:23:28,479 --> 01:23:33,789
because I noticed that um on the website you spoke about how there was all these various

991
01:23:33,789 --> 01:23:38,560
breeders who'd work had gone into this line you mentioned capillator and Harry palms and

992
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:45,469
Rado and Oni and stuff um I don't think I noticed any mention of obsolete was he that

993
01:23:45,469 --> 01:23:50,539
was that where the Orange Line came from yeah it was obviously maybe there's an orange apricot

994
01:23:50,539 --> 01:23:55,029
clone and I believe uh capillary found a male that from his original sea soccer and probably

995
01:23:55,029 --> 01:23:59,349
the The Legend OD cut and that's what made the F1 and he made the F2 format so yeah it

996
01:23:59,349 --> 01:24:04,610
was an orange papercraft from obviously the original release nice and what sort of characteristics

997
01:24:04,609 --> 01:24:10,500
can people expect your mail to bring to crosses does it bring that sort of apricot-esque flavor

998
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:14,889
you mentioned it does yeah the mill is very dominant so there's all the crosses the front

999
01:24:14,889 --> 01:24:19,690
that were heavy orange dominant everything just came out all that said unfortunately

1000
01:24:19,689 --> 01:24:25,379
so everything you find would be very apricot orange heavy um the line's pretty old so three

1001
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:29,590
years old it's all season pretty much sold out but anything you find will be very apricot

1002
01:24:29,590 --> 01:24:34,949
orange heavy with a kind of like a sativa-esque uh hybrid high with some OG gas in there mixed

1003
01:24:34,948 --> 01:24:40,879
in there too so it's Unique for sure but it's definitely not my current go-to oh I mean

1004
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:45,550
it sounds like it's got a little bit of everything in there would you ever consider bringing

1005
01:24:45,550 --> 01:24:50,090
it back doing some new crosses with it like pairing it with the white runs for example

1006
01:24:50,090 --> 01:24:55,850
or it's it's had its time and place so it's time to place I'm trying to move on unfortunately

1007
01:24:55,850 --> 01:25:00,711
new things cool cool cool so the next one I wanted to ask you about I haven't been able

1008
01:25:00,711 --> 01:25:04,199
to get anyone to give me any info about this one but I think you're going to be perfect

1009
01:25:04,198 --> 01:25:09,339
and I'm probably about to butcher the name so please forgive me the acai berry I say

1010
01:25:09,340 --> 01:25:14,829
eberry acai damn it I was 50 50 about whether I was going to say it the way I said it or

1011
01:25:14,829 --> 01:25:20,930
the way you said it um that that's like seems like it's a very tightly held cut and it seems

1012
01:25:20,930 --> 01:25:26,750
very popular how would you describe the flavor and the high on that one oh it's like a very

1013
01:25:26,750 --> 01:25:31,238
kind of it was very dark purple um very profile that's why his name Asia I think from the

1014
01:25:31,238 --> 01:25:37,342
names because it's kind of like a dark berry kind of purple cultivar it's more one of the

1015
01:25:37,342 --> 01:25:41,039
more more Mellows as far as the high it's not as opposed as the others um it doesn't

1016
01:25:41,039 --> 01:25:46,029
go as well but definitely a pretty comfortable to look at it kind of breeds really purple

1017
01:25:46,029 --> 01:25:50,729
purple plants when you call it when you call it um it's definitely unique um flavor and

1018
01:25:50,729 --> 01:25:56,809
it's stable in the jaw kind of way yeah I mean and follow on question to that which

1019
01:25:56,810 --> 01:26:03,960
of the various gelatos is your personal favorite um probably the 41 Slovakia yeah look I gotta

1020
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:07,130
agree that's definitely my favorite yeah they're all they're all fire they're all I select

1021
01:26:07,130 --> 01:26:14,060
the guava a lot the guava jaw is really fire oh okay how did um you manage to come across

1022
01:26:14,060 --> 01:26:18,449
the acai berry because I like I just don't know anyone else who's got that besides shabinski

1023
01:26:18,448 --> 01:26:24,979
himself I received it from my friend uh Korean City in SF India too around the time I did

1024
01:26:24,979 --> 01:26:30,279
the uh Jeff field polishing back in 2018 I think of course you've been working on it

1025
01:26:30,279 --> 01:26:36,130
for a minute I guess as the follow-up do you feel like there are any of the gelato cuts

1026
01:26:36,130 --> 01:26:41,650
which maybe you know aren't the 41 not your personal favorite but you think that when

1027
01:26:41,649 --> 01:26:46,369
you pair them with males they produce really nice offspring yeah definitely for sure I

1028
01:26:46,369 --> 01:26:51,760
think they're all good they're all very good the jaw lines are very um unique uh collection

1029
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:57,380
of cultivars it's kind of one of the Stables of the last couple years I think I think the

1030
01:26:57,380 --> 01:27:03,150
41 is probably the the best beer for sure though yeah sure definitely seen some powerhouses

1031
01:27:03,149 --> 01:27:08,269
come from that one and speaking of powerhouses anyone who's been following your Instagram

1032
01:27:08,270 --> 01:27:13,700
feed would have seen some amazing looking photos of the baby Yoda Fino of the Khalifa

1033
01:27:13,699 --> 01:27:19,118
mints are you able to give us a little bit of a backstory on that one yeah I got from

1034
01:27:19,118 --> 01:27:24,868
my friend Ellie pure proper it's the one that burnt and I selected for the menu that um

1035
01:27:24,868 --> 01:27:30,109
it's a menthol by Clifford Crush it's really um kicked out uh cultivar heavy checkup coverage

1036
01:27:30,109 --> 01:27:36,880
kind of got like a soapy gassy um career profile um just around 24 25 THC a very unique very

1037
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:43,159
um heavy yield or very um very very robust cultivar it's really really amazing I'm excited

1038
01:27:43,158 --> 01:27:47,829
to get that one out there after the film before next year amazing and is that one where like

1039
01:27:47,829 --> 01:27:52,649
people can maybe find their own version in the Khalifa mint seed packs or you think it's

1040
01:27:52,649 --> 01:27:55,908
more of like a clone and if they want that they're probably going to need to track down

1041
01:27:55,908 --> 01:27:56,908
the Clone

1042
01:27:56,908 --> 01:28:09,000
yeah all over just about 100 packs of original Cleveland seeds so that they're they're rare

1043
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:14,590
also damn well there you go guys looks like you're gonna have to get the Clone itself

1044
01:28:14,590 --> 01:28:19,270
and I think I read on I think it was your Instagram post that originally you wanted

1045
01:28:19,270 --> 01:28:23,160
to name it after Mickey Mouse was that right but Disney's a bit litigious

1046
01:28:23,159 --> 01:28:35,800
idea and creativity yeah okay cool I still think baby Yoda is a dope name for a cut yeah

1047
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:42,940
we'll see because there's various reasons though yeah let's see if uh oh George Lucas

1048
01:28:42,939 --> 01:28:50,369
comes in hard yeah hopefully not we'll see that um speaking of IG it's we're kind of

1049
01:28:50,369 --> 01:28:53,609
going through an interesting period at the moment you know there's been a lot of companies

1050
01:28:53,609 --> 01:28:58,279
that have been having issues with IG removing their posts censoring them Banning them all

1051
01:28:58,279 --> 01:29:03,509
that stuff it almost seems like you have to say like 10 times in a post these days like

1052
01:29:03,510 --> 01:29:09,039
not for sale not for sale not for sale um it on face value it seems to me like your

1053
01:29:09,039 --> 01:29:13,658
Instagram's doing really well with the marketing and whatnot do you have any tips or do you

1054
01:29:13,658 --> 01:29:18,429
feel like it is very hindering and it's just all about how you play the game sort of thing

1055
01:29:18,429 --> 01:29:22,158
I have no idea remix to happen I'm not sure why I got lucky I've had some problems in

1056
01:29:22,158 --> 01:29:27,849
the past but overall across my fingers in the Hollywood but uh yeah I'm not sure what

1057
01:29:27,850 --> 01:29:32,920
it makes it happen though it seems like a roll the dice honestly sure do you think that

1058
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:37,250
there'll ever be some Way Forward where people can exist on the social media platforms and

1059
01:29:37,250 --> 01:29:41,460
not be harassed because the thing that I noticed the most is that it seems like most of the

1060
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:45,480
companies that are sort of having them censored and having stuff removed seem to be legal

1061
01:29:45,479 --> 01:29:49,019
companies in legal environments so it's kind of like at what point are you gonna leave

1062
01:29:49,020 --> 01:29:54,000
us alone yeah I think it'll it'll change eventually I think we're in this kind of weird time frame

1063
01:29:54,000 --> 01:30:00,060
where it's quality legal in some states not really around all states so he wants to change

1064
01:30:00,060 --> 01:30:05,789
his more companies except Nationwide and becomes more publicly you'll see more the changes

1065
01:30:05,789 --> 01:30:12,319
and more more acceptance on social media I just hope so sure so a few times throughout

1066
01:30:12,319 --> 01:30:18,488
our chat you've mentioned um that you're hoping to release Cuts or that cuts are released

1067
01:30:18,488 --> 01:30:22,929
do you think this is going to be one of the ways in which breeders operate moving forward

1068
01:30:22,930 --> 01:30:29,130
where they don't only sell seeds but they start to get cuts out to either clone dispensaries

1069
01:30:29,130 --> 01:30:33,800
or like they they contract them to various parties is that something you see gaining

1070
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:38,560
popularity going forward definitely definitely I think it's a huge the market moving forward

1071
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:42,760
is we have more legalization I think people people want those proven computer Cuts you

1072
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:47,560
know I think the heat work it's important to have yourself clean and TC and verified

1073
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:51,340
the disease-free and claim for research questions inside people's Gardens if you don't start

1074
01:30:51,340 --> 01:30:59,440
the program called ours yeah sure I mean kind of a bit of a left of field question but I

1075
01:30:59,439 --> 01:31:04,460
I was just curious to ask you would you ever consider trying to develop a strain specifically

1076
01:31:04,460 --> 01:31:09,609
that's like a like on the larger yielding side because I think that sometimes you often

1077
01:31:09,609 --> 01:31:14,139
hear people talk about how they love Exotics but the yields are always like you know something

1078
01:31:14,139 --> 01:31:18,159
you've got to take into consideration when growing them would you ever try to reinvent

1079
01:31:18,158 --> 01:31:24,969
blue dream and bring some new sort of thick piece to the game that's just also a big yielding

1080
01:31:24,969 --> 01:31:28,869
yeah it'd be awesome I like the idea I'll drink a really video any runs across anything

1081
01:31:28,869 --> 01:31:32,809
or the drugs were runs is people claim that it's yield so they think that's one of the

1082
01:31:32,810 --> 01:31:36,289
interests you can improve with runs and you'll see it over the coming years is improved runs

1083
01:31:36,289 --> 01:31:38,380
Crossovers and have a really strong potency and yield but with the Run stripping profile

1084
01:31:38,380 --> 01:31:45,010
from the original across how would you describe the runtopian profile some people will say

1085
01:31:45,010 --> 01:31:50,480
that it smells like just a mixture of gelato and Skittles do you feel like it's more nuanced

1086
01:31:50,479 --> 01:31:57,319
than that is a very strong profile it's very um skill distributed and dominant but it has

1087
01:31:57,319 --> 01:32:00,880
a unique uh it's like it's like skills and steroids really unique and really strongly

1088
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:07,340
what my opinion is it's hard to forget yeah sure and I mean sometimes you hear people

1089
01:32:07,340 --> 01:32:12,710
describe Skittles as having like a sort of soapiness to it do you ever pick up on that

1090
01:32:12,710 --> 01:32:16,489
and do you think that's the same sort of soapiness that people describe in other strains or they're

1091
01:32:16,488 --> 01:32:22,488
sort of different ones I really I don't test any soberness and skills and grapefruit you

1092
01:32:22,488 --> 01:32:28,369
kind of like um like a 90 kind of like really unique um like a grippy it's hard to describe

1093
01:32:28,369 --> 01:32:35,300
it's so flavorful it's really amazing in my opinion sure and do you have any predictions

1094
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:40,520
as to what might be the next big flavor profile to take the scene by storm oh that's hard

1095
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:46,670
one I think everyone seems on a quest to find the old school things kind of lost though

1096
01:32:46,670 --> 01:32:52,029
um but yeah I'm not really sure it's I know gasoline is disabled this here say I think

1097
01:32:52,029 --> 01:32:57,198
it just revivals of that sure and I mean you just raised a brilliant little topic of discussion

1098
01:32:57,198 --> 01:33:03,279
many people are currently trying very hard to find or bring back the roadkill skunk was

1099
01:33:03,279 --> 01:33:07,569
that something you ever had any interaction with and or would you ever be interested in

1100
01:33:07,569 --> 01:33:09,109
trying to track that one down yourself

1101
01:33:09,109 --> 01:33:27,380
hopefully not yeah and uh as a bit of a random aside question would you ever consider doing

1102
01:33:27,380 --> 01:33:31,940
any CBD work because I noticed that although there are breeders out there who do work with

1103
01:33:31,939 --> 01:33:36,939
CBD you never see like cookies CBD crosses is that something you might be interested

1104
01:33:36,939 --> 01:33:41,439
in looking at or not not particularly yes I have to work out to serious stuff right

1105
01:33:41,439 --> 01:33:44,939
now with some Partners in Oregon do some CD lines listening controvers from compound basically

1106
01:33:44,939 --> 01:33:52,019
taking so they're kind of Staples and favorites and headed there was some 3D emails so this

1107
01:33:52,020 --> 01:33:57,340
is a type of two and type three products extra for sure Ah that's exciting what sort of females

1108
01:33:57,340 --> 01:34:01,380
jump to mind for you from your collection that you think would blend well into that

1109
01:34:01,380 --> 01:34:07,400
project oh it's like some Jokers and some high society bananas as well some um some

1110
01:34:07,399 --> 01:34:11,559
of the sort of Staples some of my classic ones and bottom of the CD and it makes it

1111
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:17,960
unique crosses good answer I'm sure there's some exciting stuff in there to jump over

1112
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:23,960
to kind of a more Community topic I think a few years ago it might have been might have

1113
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:28,819
been 2018 might have been 2019. I think I saw you guys had a booth at one of the events

1114
01:34:28,819 --> 01:34:35,380
was it Emerald cup or am I mistaken yeah or into XO one of those yeah what's your thoughts

1115
01:34:35,380 --> 01:34:40,550
on the current state of the sort of events we have it feels like there's been a bit of

1116
01:34:40,550 --> 01:34:46,880
a changing attitude amongst like the real breeders and real hardcore enthusiasts since

1117
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:52,039
Rec was introduced and notably we've heard a lot of people say that they're feeling like

1118
01:34:52,039 --> 01:34:57,260
for example the emerald cup like hasn't quite been the same as in Prior years do you share

1119
01:34:57,260 --> 01:35:00,719
that sentiment and what do you think would be the future of these events can we expect

1120
01:35:00,719 --> 01:35:02,380
to see compound at these events

1121
01:35:02,380 --> 01:35:10,989
mainstream now but I think they're here to stay and I think as you see uh covered kind

1122
01:35:10,988 --> 01:35:15,809
of like fade away or you get more under control you see the events coming back I think they're

1123
01:35:15,810 --> 01:35:21,450
huge and they put a big role moving forward is mainstream so you'll see the comment select

1124
01:35:21,449 --> 01:35:27,220
ones it's probably the premiere one only through the throughout the year yeah if it got to

1125
01:35:27,220 --> 01:35:31,199
the point because I think in some states it's now the case that like it's really hard or

1126
01:35:31,198 --> 01:35:36,729
even not possible to sell seeds at the events would you still go to the events if you weren't

1127
01:35:36,729 --> 01:35:40,750
able to sell seeds or do you feel like there's got to be some sort of give and take with

1128
01:35:40,750 --> 01:35:41,789
the Breeders themselves

1129
01:35:41,789 --> 01:36:00,899
that's a big downfall into their full potential yeah certainly new question we don't really

1130
01:36:00,899 --> 01:36:06,309
talk about too much but um I've noticed that many breeders seem to have interesting like

1131
01:36:06,310 --> 01:36:11,060
side Hobbies side passions you know some people are really into craft beers some people are

1132
01:36:11,060 --> 01:36:16,500
into their like Motor Cars some people are into breeding dogs do you have a little side

1133
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:21,170
hobby you're particularly fond of unfortunately not I kind of breathe and eat and sleep with

1134
01:36:21,170 --> 01:36:25,869
this every day I'm passionate my work too much so much to my my downfall I like to get

1135
01:36:25,869 --> 01:36:31,769
into some more products but right now I'm all compound all the day every day for sure

1136
01:36:31,770 --> 01:36:35,000
and I'm bringing a new question into the gang because we've asked a few breeders this and

1137
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,460
I'm going to make it a new staple what's your favorite food

1138
01:36:37,460 --> 01:36:44,520
Falafel and garbanza being stuff like the whole Mediterranean Middle Eastern food oh

1139
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:51,560
Habibi you should come see me I live on it I'm downstairs man yeah dude Lebanese is the

1140
01:36:51,560 --> 01:36:59,530
best I'll bring the apples bananas for dessert oh [ __ ] it's a diet I'm downstairs that's

1141
01:36:59,529 --> 01:37:05,519
awesome okay well this brings us to the final five questions which we like to ask all breeders

1142
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:14,280
so first one is what's the most memorable weed you've ever smoked um probably that dog

1143
01:37:14,279 --> 01:37:21,259
shooter The Loner from somewhere as an Amsterdam there's not my two fears for sure sure and

1144
01:37:21,260 --> 01:37:25,920
is there a strain out there where everyone you knew was like hyping it up talking about

1145
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:30,560
how good it was and then you finally tried it and you were like this isn't that good

1146
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:35,710
um yeah no offensive Capital but the Mac is what the one that comes to mind I think that

1147
01:37:35,710 --> 01:37:39,750
one does tend to polarize a lot of people I I actually really like it but then again

1148
01:37:39,750 --> 01:37:44,479
I've only tried it like from Mac and skunk Tech who are both really good Growers and

1149
01:37:44,479 --> 01:37:48,158
I know that there's a lot of people who um maybe don't quite do it justice when they're

1150
01:37:48,158 --> 01:37:55,960
growing it yeah it's a real culturalism yeah it's a really weird profile isn't it it's

1151
01:37:55,961 --> 01:38:00,630
like orange juice and incense mixed together like it's so weird yeah we know if that's

1152
01:38:00,630 --> 01:38:06,969
the calculator is my friend I need to do a good organization yeah sure look I'm sure

1153
01:38:06,969 --> 01:38:12,908
it's nothing he hasn't heard before so chill chill so next question is I'm about to drop

1154
01:38:12,908 --> 01:38:17,109
you off at a desert island where you're going to spend the rest of your days there you can

1155
01:38:17,109 --> 01:38:22,279
take three strains of weed with you that you have to grow forever what three strains are

1156
01:38:22,279 --> 01:38:31,009
you taking what three clones or you can take seed stock if you want um white rice

1157
01:38:31,010 --> 01:38:39,770
and probably um dog [ __ ] love it nice little mix there opposite end of the spectrum

1158
01:38:39,770 --> 01:38:45,020
you're about to drop someone off to an island you're not particularly fond of this person

1159
01:38:45,020 --> 01:38:53,590
what three strains are you going to leave them with on the island um all the same strings

1160
01:38:53,590 --> 01:38:59,579
love it very diplomatic I like that so final question if you could go back in time to any

1161
01:38:59,579 --> 01:39:03,868
place throughout history anywhere around the world you can just you've got a time machine

1162
01:39:03,868 --> 01:39:07,699
it's going to take you wherever you want and the goal is you're going to collect either

1163
01:39:07,699 --> 01:39:12,869
some seeds or some cuttings or whatever it is where are you going when and what are you

1164
01:39:12,869 --> 01:39:17,340
collecting I really like to spend more time with the hash region of Middle Eastern kind

1165
01:39:17,340 --> 01:39:22,929
of explore the hashing streams that Afghanistan and the Middle East Pakistan Morocco really

1166
01:39:22,929 --> 01:39:28,399
get involved in that always a dream reminder to be involved in action and see the traditional

1167
01:39:28,399 --> 01:39:32,769
methods and be immersed in like the old ways I was gonna say dude we need to go do the

1168
01:39:32,770 --> 01:39:39,690
Silk Road together I'm downstairs and you fly forward hummus uh what an experience that

1169
01:39:39,689 --> 01:39:47,229
would be super Lush fantastic well that is an amazing answer I think that just about
