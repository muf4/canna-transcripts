usual I'd love to hear what have you

119
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:50,399

120
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:51,959

121
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,719
today

122
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:56,519
uh I haven't puffed yet mostly because

123
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,259
it finally stopped raining around here

124
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:59,939
so I've been doing a bunch of yard work

125
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:03,180
but

126
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:05,899
um I have a I have a embarrassment of

127
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:09,199
riches right now uh mostly from Friends

128
00:05:05,899 --> 00:05:09,198
of stuff

129
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,780
um and uh some of we chatted about last

130
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:15,198
time but

131
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:19,039
train wreck Blue Dream

132
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:22,080
Loompa headband my headband Sour Diesel

133
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:26,699
uh chemd

134
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:28,439
um a bunch of uh some death Coast diesel

135
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:31,139
I have a bunch of stuff

136
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:32,579
really I I don't actually repeat very

137
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:35,160
often

138
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:37,800
uh these last few weeks because I've

139
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,419
gotten enough samples that life is

140
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,220
pretty good right now as far as that

141
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:43,560
goes

142
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,240
I love that sounds like you're spoiled

143
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,280
for choice and it's probably not

144
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,860
surprising to any of the listeners that

145
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:52,739
that's the way it is you mentioned a few

146
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:55,740
really interesting names in there I

147
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:58,379
would love to hear which of those lot do

148
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:01,079
you think is the standout to you so far

149
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:04,139
out of all those

150
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:05,639
um I would say that uh

151
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:08,100
I mean this might sound like a little

152
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:10,379
bit of homerism or whatever but the the

153
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:12,240
what I call the LA the headband that I

154
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:15,538
have like it's probably in my top three

155
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,819
or four things all time so

156
00:06:15,538 --> 00:06:20,399
um especially like when I'm at home and

157
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:22,379
I don't have to go out in public uh I I

158
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:24,120
really like it a whole bunch

159
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:27,060
sometimes

160
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,500
um if I'm out in public I get too baked

161
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,240
on it and it makes me feel like I'm a

162
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:33,120
little bit in the Twilight Zone and like

163
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,120
I shouldn't maybe be at a grocery store

164
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,780
that lit up or whatever but

165
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:41,459
um

166
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:43,799
yeah I like uh headbands chems

167
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:46,680
you know I'm almost out of chemd just

168
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:49,079
because I keep smoking it so much I've

169
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,360
not been very good at regulating my

170
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:54,300
amount you know so

171
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:57,300
uh yeah it uh it's gonna be a sad day

172
00:06:54,300 --> 00:07:00,000
soon when my little my jar is gone

173
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:02,819
uh we'll all have to pull one out for

174
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,519
the homie at that time I would love to

175
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:08,160
ask you well before we get to the chem

176
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:10,079
stuff you mentioned you know the LA and

177
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,439
in the past episode you mentioned that

178
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:16,318
it's a very Afghani sort of plant

179
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:19,560
if I had to put it to you and get you to

180
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:22,020
tell me your the absolute best Afghan in

181
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,000
your opinion be it a line or a

182
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:25,439
particular cutting what would you go

183
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,360
with or even if you just want to say

184
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,939
like a certain region you know but what

185
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,919
would be your pick best Afghani

186
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:34,800
uh

187
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:38,459
it's it really hasn't changed in a long

188
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:41,960
time it's it's pretty much for me it's

189
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:41,959
the chem 91.

190
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,280
um and the reason for that is basically

191
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:48,478
like it's got like my favorite Afghani

192
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:50,698
High

193
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:52,740
when I smoke it I feel like you know

194
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:55,919
that feeling you got like when you're in

195
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:57,418
high school and you get really baked and

196
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:59,219
you know like you're you have the

197
00:07:57,418 --> 00:08:00,899
munchies and you're gonna watch a comedy

198
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:04,979
with your friends and you're like just

199
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:07,019
warm and happy and content right not all

200
00:08:04,978 --> 00:08:08,579
weed is Happy some of it's anxious some

201
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:10,740
of it's a little racy some of it can

202
00:08:08,579 --> 00:08:12,959
have these different elements

203
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,240
um but the chem 91 to me is just really

204
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,579
potent and it's also like very warm and

205
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,139
very comforting

206
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:22,139
uh you know and it's interesting too

207
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:23,699
because it's it's ugly and it's not very

208
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:25,620
frosty and it kind of looks like

209
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:28,978
dinosaur weed in the sense it looks like

210
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:31,379
some kind of ancient throwback plant

211
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:34,019
um especially by IG standards today if

212
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:36,060
nobody knew what it was

213
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:38,579
I don't think you would pick it out of a

214
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:41,119
lineup in terms of what you think via

215
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:44,759
pictures would work the best you know

216
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:47,278
yeah it's certainly it's undeniable that

217
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:50,278
uh I the chemd looks a lot better than

218
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:53,879
the chem 91 and also you know the chem

219
00:08:50,278 --> 00:08:55,500
91 is is really unlikely to win a beauty

220
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:58,799
contest

221
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,659
no it's it's ugly and I mean you can

222
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:03,240
make it look pretty but it's dark it's

223
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:05,519
not really that Frosty

224
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,740
um you know it's smell comes and goes

225
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,899
kind of sometimes you hit it out of the

226
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,580
park and it tastes and smells delicious

227
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:14,519
and then the next three times you grow

228
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:17,399
it it you can you know it's in there but

229
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:19,919
it's not very prevalent

230
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:21,839
um but you know the most important thing

231
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:22,919
to me generally speaking with any weed

232
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:27,360
is effect

233
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:29,519
and it has effect in Spades it really it

234
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,740
packs a punch and it does it repeatedly

235
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,019
and you don't really get a big tolerance

236
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:37,019
to it to me like it works pretty

237
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:39,060
regularly you know certainly certainly

238
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:41,459
look you've you've sort of stumbled into

239
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:43,799
this question I I wanted to ask you but

240
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:45,719
I've got to unpack it a little bit but I

241
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:47,099
love the way you described that it makes

242
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,899
you feel like you know when you're in

243
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:51,300
high school getting high for the first

244
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:55,139
time those sort of nostalgic feelings

245
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:58,079
what I've noticed is that exotic weed is

246
00:09:55,139 --> 00:10:00,000
a broad term tends to be all the craze

247
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,700
among the younger Generations those

248
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,740
people who are in high school whereas

249
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,620
chem dog is often thought as being more

250
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:08,820
popular among like the older heads I'm

251
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,620
wondering do you think this will ever

252
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,720
switch and we'll get to the point where

253
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:15,019
like chemdog has some more meaningful

254
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,100
popularity with the younger generation

255
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:18,720
and sort of in line with what you're

256
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,860
referencing that you smoked back then

257
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,420
and you were like wow this is the best

258
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,919
thing ever it's interesting that these

259
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:24,000
days they lean more towards the Exotic

260
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:28,439
like

261
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:31,559
some of that is not their fault

262
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:34,380
um in the sense that you know it a lot

263
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:36,000
of it comes down to access

264
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:37,740
right

265
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,539
um you know I'm sure like for instance

266
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:44,339
you know episode one of of your podcast

267
00:10:41,539 --> 00:10:45,899
your access has probably gone up

268
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:48,060
exponentially

269
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:49,919
with interviewing all these people and

270
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:51,599
making friends and connections and all

271
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:54,179
that type of stuff and getting to try

272
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,339
different things and so

273
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:59,458
um you know being that weed is still

274
00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:01,380
illegal uh and then it is you know it is

275
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:04,679
even in the states where it's quote

276
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:07,019
unquote legal here it's not really legal

277
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:08,699
it's pretty much like highly regulated

278
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:11,159
and highly taxed

279
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:13,320
so a lot of people that are producing

280
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:15,659
stuff are producing stuff of what they

281
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,820
think the market currently wants

282
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:22,019
and so as a result of that like a lot of

283
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:24,360
young people like maybe 90 of their

284
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:25,440
options that they know what to get are

285
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,839
exotic

286
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,600
I'll I'll use a different example right

287
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,339
imagine if old people were telling you

288
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,139
that one of the best bands that they'd

289
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:36,060
ever they'd ever heard was Led Zeppelin

290
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:39,720
but you couldn't go out and find a

291
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:42,000
record or or listen to it yourself it

292
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,700
wasn't available anymore like you hear

293
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,339
rumors of people having albums of it but

294
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:50,040
you actually couldn't experience it

295
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:51,240
right and so I think a lot of the

296
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:54,599
popularity

297
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,579
is access and I also think that you

298
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,920
could take almost any strain forget

299
00:11:56,578 --> 00:12:01,199
about chem for a second you could take

300
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:03,419
dozens of different strains that were

301
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,459
that we consider to be elite

302
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:08,458
that maybe have sort of fallen off the

303
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:10,919
popularity where the vast majority of

304
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:13,319
smokers have never tried it

305
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:16,379
they've just heard about it right and so

306
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:20,339
in order for for some of those Classics

307
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:22,200
to outpace uh the Zaza or the Exotics or

308
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:25,380
whatever you want to call it today

309
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:27,420
people would have to be able to like you

310
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:29,519
know vote with their wallet

311
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:31,860
and get it you know you'd have to be

312
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,259
able to walk into a store or your dealer

313
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:37,139
would have to be like do you want some

314
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:39,059
gelato 45 or do you want some chemd or

315
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:41,939
do you want some dog [ __ ] or do you want

316
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:43,500
some jealousy by you know like they'd

317
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:46,740
have to have the option

318
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:48,778
right certainly look I I wholeheartedly

319
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,399
agree with you and in part this sounds

320
00:12:48,778 --> 00:12:52,139
like a call to Arms you know everyone

321
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,659
listening to the show you need to grow a

322
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:56,039
bunch of chem deseminated into the

323
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:58,379
community

324
00:12:56,039 --> 00:13:00,958
um but no like to play devil's advocate

325
00:12:58,379 --> 00:13:03,838
here the jungle boys have put out a crop

326
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:06,000
of what they called chemdog 91 and I

327
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:09,240
don't know if it was popular enough that

328
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,940
it merited it to come back but what I

329
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,980
will say is I also heard a rumor from

330
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:15,240
someone that they were using the uh the

331
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,300
JB cut

332
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:20,039
well I mean it's also kind of one of

333
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:24,059
those things where it would take some

334
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:26,699
time and like you know I you know a lot

335
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:29,039
of times people it's weird because in

336
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:31,980
the past things that were really good

337
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:34,860
sort of organically got the elite label

338
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:37,139
which is it slowly spread and the more

339
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:39,180
and more smokers that desired it that's

340
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:40,139
where how it gained popularity to some

341
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:44,159
degree

342
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:46,680
where now modern marketing exists and so

343
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:49,319
people get told what's good and that

344
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:53,039
affects perception in my opinion

345
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:54,778
two right like if you know maybe a

346
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:57,659
better way to judge you know if we're

347
00:13:54,778 --> 00:13:59,399
going to use chem 91 as an example take

348
00:13:57,659 --> 00:14:02,519
some kind of exotic

349
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:04,440
and take chem 91 and put them in a joint

350
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:07,560
and don't tell people which is which so

351
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:09,120
they have no indication right because

352
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:12,239
then you're not bringing your biases

353
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:15,179
into it and I don't think the jungle

354
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,940
boys grow very good weed to be honest

355
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:19,319
um you know you know I don't I think

356
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:23,700
they grow

357
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:25,200
you know a commercial quantity and I

358
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,180
don't think that

359
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:30,540
you know we haven't gotten the pressure

360
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:31,679
yet for Quality to really win out in the

361
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:34,439
marketplace

362
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:35,939
it's more like who has licenses and

363
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,740
who's able to do it and then the

364
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:40,139
economics sort of dictates that they

365
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:42,299
blow out large amounts of good looking

366
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:44,339
weed to try to stay ahead of the taxes

367
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:47,578
and all the fees and all the polls on

368
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:50,040
the on the money so I don't really think

369
00:14:47,578 --> 00:14:51,000
we've hit like a legal connoisseur grade

370
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:52,860
yet

371
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,259
in my opinion

372
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:57,959
um the weed you could get in clubs in

373
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:59,819
the 215 era was you had a chance of

374
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:01,198
getting nicer weed on average than you

375
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,000
can get today

376
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:04,379
and I don't think it permanently has to

377
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,299
stay that way but it's that way

378
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:08,879
currently

379
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:12,599
on this topic and you know you mentioned

380
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:15,000
earlier having the licenses and the

381
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,159
legal capabilities to go ahead a lot of

382
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,958
Growers who were producing the killer

383
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:21,000
Bud that you used to be able to say get

384
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:22,919
at a dispensary a lot of them are

385
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,600
feeling pushed out of the market the

386
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:27,299
overwhelming majority of them haven't

387
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,399
been able to secure like a larger

388
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:30,899
license and facility that would allow

389
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:33,720
them to keep going

390
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:36,839
what would be your general advice for

391
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:39,180
any of shall we say you know the uh the

392
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:40,620
old school Growers who are feeling like

393
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:43,259
they're being pushed out of the market

394
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:45,120
do you think they need to maybe find

395
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:47,458
like a unique

396
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,919
um space like a niche or something like

397
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:52,919
that they can fill or like what would be

398
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:56,219
some general advice you might offer

399
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:57,719
uh that's actually it's that's kind of a

400
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,180
big subject man

401
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:03,660
um so I'll try to break it into chunks

402
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:05,838
and where I live in Mendocino County it

403
00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:09,659
sort of is the question of the moment

404
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:12,720
because unlike a lot of other places uh

405
00:16:09,659 --> 00:16:16,319
this place sort of rose out of poverty

406
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:19,980
post logging with the the rise of

407
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,800
medical cannabis uh and so it's like a

408
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:26,278
lot more important to my local area than

409
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:27,778
it might be to a lot of other places

410
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:29,519
um you know because I mean I think about

411
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:31,860
it all the time and I talk about it with

412
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,620
friends and like even if we make it

413
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:36,899
what if the community as a whole falls

414
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:38,879
apart around us

415
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:40,860
and then the place that we love and the

416
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:42,659
place our kids go to school and you know

417
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:46,259
and all this different stuff becomes

418
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:47,458
like you know just very difficult

419
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:50,579
and

420
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:52,679
I uh

421
00:16:50,578 --> 00:16:54,539
I might sound a little political here or

422
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:56,578
a little punk rock or any something like

423
00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:58,860
that when I say this but

424
00:16:56,578 --> 00:17:01,019
like I mentioned before I don't think

425
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:02,639
weed is legal

426
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:05,338
yet

427
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:08,459
um I think it's highly taxed and highly

428
00:17:05,338 --> 00:17:10,318
regulated like the idea that name one

429
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:12,900
other legal plant

430
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:15,240
that you have a plant limit and grow in

431
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:18,419
your backyard right like if I'm a tomato

432
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:20,400
if if I'm into heirloom tomatoes I I can

433
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:22,079
take my my backyard and I can grow

434
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,000
thousands of heirloom tomatoes I can

435
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:25,980
breed those tomatoes to try to make a

436
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,959
better one that I'm into I can share

437
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:31,019
those seeds with my friends

438
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:33,419
you know the only rules or regulations I

439
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:35,400
might hit upon are if I try to

440
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:38,520
commercially sell them then I might need

441
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:41,160
like a tax ID or some kind of like but

442
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:42,418
in terms of just like non-commercial

443
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,580
aspects

444
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:47,700
there is no con there's nobody get

445
00:17:44,579 --> 00:17:49,139
nobody cares right so the way it is now

446
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,940
legally where you're like oh you can

447
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,679
have six plants

448
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,779
you've been doing this podcast long

449
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:57,000
enough that you can't have a mother room

450
00:17:54,779 --> 00:18:00,058
with six plant limitation

451
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,460
you can't you can't breed and make

452
00:18:00,058 --> 00:18:04,678
selections for what you want with the

453
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:08,220
six plant limitation

454
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:10,140
um it's not legal it's world will allow

455
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:13,319
you to do it if you give us a bunch of

456
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:16,980
money and jump through a ton of Hoops so

457
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:19,619
my general gist is like

458
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:21,000
maybe I'll put it this way right uh for

459
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:22,739
my whole life they've been telling me

460
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,480
you shouldn't do this you're a bad

461
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,798
person you shouldn't do this you

462
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,419
shouldn't do this you shouldn't do this

463
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:29,160
you're a bad person stop doing this

464
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:31,380
don't do this we're gonna put get you in

465
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,720
trouble if we catch you doing it and

466
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:38,039
we've been fighting this whole time

467
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:40,558
to make the rest of America be like oh

468
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:41,940
that opinion is dumb

469
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:43,079
these people should be able to do

470
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,700
whatever they want because they're not

471
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:47,159
hiding they're not harming anyone this

472
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:49,200
is preposterous right and so now they've

473
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,419
switched it and they're like man this

474
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,000
thing you've built is pretty cool we'll

475
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:55,980
take it from here

476
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,038
right but the direction that they're

477
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:00,960
going to take it is not the direction

478
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:04,319
that most people that have been involved

479
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:07,558
in cannabis a long time want it to go

480
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:10,079
so to me the fight hasn't stopped

481
00:19:07,558 --> 00:19:13,079
the fight is gone from you can't have it

482
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:15,558
to we want what you have and then you

483
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:15,558
can go away

484
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:21,000
right so for me it's like you're still

485
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,220
fighting now the problem becomes is that

486
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,038
when we were fighting to just have it

487
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:27,779
before prohibition made having it

488
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:29,579
lucrative

489
00:19:27,779 --> 00:19:31,859
so it's sort of like funded the

490
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:33,960
resistance if you were

491
00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:36,000
you know what I'm saying

492
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,279
um the whole concept uh you're familiar

493
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,819
obviously with uh one of the first

494
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:43,099
forums overgrow yep do you know why they

495
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:45,659
named it that

496
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:47,459
overgrow the government

497
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:51,840
overgrow the government which is

498
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:54,538
basically laws only work if a majority

499
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:57,000
of people think the law is a good idea

500
00:19:54,538 --> 00:20:00,058
and respect it

501
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,160
right one of the big reasons why they

502
00:20:00,058 --> 00:20:04,500
ended prohibition when alcohol in

503
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:07,500
America was because so few people agreed

504
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:10,500
with it on average that it led to a

505
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:13,740
general breakdown in trust but for cops

506
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:16,079
for the government for law making

507
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:18,960
you know what I mean and eventually if

508
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:21,119
enough if you live in a democracy you

509
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,220
can't have laws that the majority of the

510
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,678
people think are total [ __ ]

511
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:29,400
like it's a it's a there's a friction

512
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:32,580
there right and so now we've gotten to

513
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:35,759
this idea that it's happened in enough

514
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:37,740
states where I think it's pretty I don't

515
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:40,259
think we can ever go back to Prohibition

516
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:43,259
in turn with cannabis like full

517
00:20:40,259 --> 00:20:45,179
prohibition because too many people use

518
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:47,640
it and like it and too many people have

519
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:50,759
seen it Go recreational or medical in

520
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:52,919
their state and it's not like it's gone

521
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:55,619
Mad Max and Society has fallen apart

522
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:58,380
right so now it's more about

523
00:20:55,619 --> 00:21:00,538
for people like us how do you steer it

524
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:04,380
in the direction that you want

525
00:21:00,538 --> 00:21:06,960
right that's the that's the fight so the

526
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:09,660
fight hasn't really stopped it's just

527
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,000
changed now the the part of it that

528
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:14,340
becomes difficult is that before when we

529
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,319
were fighting like I said prohibition

530
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:17,879
made cannabis very lucrative so if

531
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:20,038
you're willing to risk your freedom to

532
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,419
grow cannabis you probably could make a

533
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:23,700
good living and then you could sort of

534
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:25,440
fight the system as it were

535
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:28,380
you know

536
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,820
um but as they've you know as they've

537
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,200
legalized things and the prices

538
00:21:29,819 --> 00:21:33,779
collapsed

539
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,179
you know where do you where do you get

540
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:37,399
the funding to keep pushing for things

541
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:40,798
as it is

542
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:42,538
I mean I don't I don't know if this is

543
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:44,900
necessarily the show to talk about this

544
00:21:42,538 --> 00:21:47,819
or whatever but what the government

545
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:50,820
thinks is happening with weed versus

546
00:21:47,819 --> 00:21:52,980
what's actually happening with weed in

547
00:21:50,819 --> 00:21:55,558
terms of recreational and legal is so

548
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:57,779
different it's almost it's almost silly

549
00:21:55,558 --> 00:22:01,319
you know like they have no idea what's

550
00:21:57,779 --> 00:22:03,058
going on they don't and you know so the

551
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:07,558
question becomes for people like us

552
00:22:03,058 --> 00:22:09,538
right uh is you know we're probably both

553
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:12,058
in the same boat of we would we would

554
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:14,460
prefer as many old and important things

555
00:22:12,058 --> 00:22:17,639
to be preserved as possible

556
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:19,558
for it's fine to have a bunch of what we

557
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:22,799
would call mids or kind of boofy stuff

558
00:22:19,558 --> 00:22:25,440
or whatever because some people just

559
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:27,658
want to buy a big case of cheap beer and

560
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,038
they're happy with that like there needs

561
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:31,320
to be

562
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:33,480
cheap weed hopefully that's still pretty

563
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:36,779
good quality but cheap weed

564
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:39,720
for people that that's their economics

565
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:43,379
but what I'm hoping is that eventually

566
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:46,798
we'll be able to get a higher grade of

567
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:50,400
weed will lead to a higher price

568
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:54,359
just like with watches or cars or

569
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:56,759
Italian leather shoes or organic food or

570
00:22:54,359 --> 00:23:00,000
whatever else there's like grades right

571
00:22:56,759 --> 00:23:02,879
and I can go to the store and I can buy

572
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,480
a three dollar bottle of wine

573
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:09,780
or I can buy a 300 bottle of wine

574
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:12,000
right and legalization really hasn't

575
00:23:09,779 --> 00:23:14,819
allowed that quality to happen yet it's

576
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,558
basically like who can do it and the

577
00:23:14,819 --> 00:23:19,859
economics of it are really messed up so

578
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:20,700
then who can survive while doing it you

579
00:23:19,859 --> 00:23:22,139
know

580
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,480
and I don't know how politically you

581
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:26,520
want me to get on that one but it's

582
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,620
basically it's a really tough time right

583
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:31,319
now I've never actually been more scared

584
00:23:28,619 --> 00:23:33,058
of diversity surviving than I have right

585
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:37,139
now

586
00:23:33,058 --> 00:23:39,058
um and I do feel for everyone

587
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:41,820
um because most people

588
00:23:39,058 --> 00:23:43,079
you know most people aren't uh I don't

589
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:44,639
know how to put it the right way this I

590
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:46,500
don't want this to sound the wrong the

591
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,720
the like elitist or anything like that

592
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:52,259
but most people aren't like us

593
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:54,779
and what I mean by that is that

594
00:23:52,259 --> 00:23:57,359
most people are gonna even Growers and

595
00:23:54,779 --> 00:23:59,339
stuff like that most people weed is

596
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:01,558
gonna fit within a certain framework in

597
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:03,899
their life you know what I'm saying yeah

598
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:07,259
like there's only going to be a small

599
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:10,019
group of people that weed is like their

600
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:11,759
hobby it's their passion it's what they

601
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:13,918
spend a ton of time thinking about and

602
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:16,259
pushing forward like to use a different

603
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:19,140
analog analogy or something like there

604
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:21,720
might be some people that fish right and

605
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:24,179
then there might be guys that like own

606
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,919
all this specialized fly fishing gear

607
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:28,559
and they plan their vacations around

608
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,360
where they can fish and they just like

609
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:31,740
kind of you know it's important enough

610
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:34,079
to them

611
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:36,900
that it means a lot more

612
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:38,759
than your average fisherman right you

613
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:40,440
know who might occasionally go out there

614
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:42,779
and do something or it might be the same

615
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:44,700
with classic cars or stereos or anything

616
00:24:42,779 --> 00:24:48,000
else you might want to name there's

617
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:49,440
people that are not interested mildly

618
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,419
interested

619
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,980
kind of deep into it where you start

620
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:56,520
learning about some things and then

621
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:58,740
there's a small core of like die hards

622
00:24:56,519 --> 00:25:01,200
who really live and breathe it

623
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:03,538
right in almost any hobby

624
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,759
yeah yeah yeah like you're just sort of

625
00:25:03,538 --> 00:25:07,919
talking about like let's talk about

626
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:10,079
anything Leo like plus two standard

627
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:13,620
deviations above the meme you know like

628
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:15,839
you're in like the top 0.3 percent gets

629
00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:17,939
the most extreme end of the spectrum you

630
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:20,158
can get yeah and that and that's not

631
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:22,259
making me like that just might be like I

632
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:24,299
mean I joke about it like that like a

633
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:26,278
lot of a lot of weed people might have a

634
00:25:24,298 --> 00:25:28,500
touch of the Chisholm you know or

635
00:25:26,278 --> 00:25:30,359
something like that like we like you

636
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:32,339
know like we we're like rain man out

637
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:34,678
there like we're in this one little area

638
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:37,798
like we know a lot

639
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:39,720
right uh and then people that aren't

640
00:25:37,798 --> 00:25:40,619
like us they're like why do you care so

641
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,538
much

642
00:25:40,619 --> 00:25:45,778
about this thing

643
00:25:42,538 --> 00:25:47,339
right and so I get that even up here

644
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:49,200
even in Mendo people have a

645
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:51,000
misconception about Mendo and Trinity

646
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,558
and humble I would say most of the

647
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,440
Growers up here

648
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:57,720
like it did fit like they did it because

649
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,700
it was the biggest economic driver of

650
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,519
their area and it supported their other

651
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:03,360
interests in their life but a lot of

652
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:05,519
people

653
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:08,399
figured out a way to grow a certain

654
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:10,619
Style with a certain couple strains make

655
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,900
money off it and they didn't care to

656
00:26:10,619 --> 00:26:15,479
learn more than that like that was fine

657
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:17,580
for them it fit their movie

658
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:20,278
and so those people

659
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:23,759
are going to have a much harder time

660
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:25,740
because they s they existed basically

661
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:28,679
because there was Prohibition and there

662
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:30,419
was inefficiencies and and all that

663
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:33,000
there's people that have been growing up

664
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:35,820
here for 20 years that haven't really

665
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,419
been refining their craft

666
00:26:35,819 --> 00:26:41,339
the whole time it'd be like it'd be like

667
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:43,740
if you were a I don't know if you were a

668
00:26:41,339 --> 00:26:45,119
you know a doctor or something like that

669
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:48,960
and you never bothered to learn anything

670
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:51,239
post-med school yeah okay fast forward

671
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,980
20 years and you might know a chunk but

672
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,599
some of it might be kind of outdated and

673
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:56,940
there might be new techniques and new

674
00:26:54,599 --> 00:27:00,538
things going on that really matter that

675
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:03,600
just slipped by you and most people up

676
00:27:00,538 --> 00:27:05,879
here and in weed in general it's like

677
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:07,319
they liked you know it was like one of

678
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,179
the things with it was one of the things

679
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:10,798
that got it made a decent amount of

680
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:13,440
money you weren't around a bunch of real

681
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:15,960
criminals it like gave you sort of like

682
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:19,200
a freedom to be independent

683
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:21,419
uh and there's nothing wrong with weed

684
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,659
works for you in that range

685
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:26,400
most of the people that you talk to not

686
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:28,020
all of them some of them fall into that

687
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,700
category in my opinion I won't say who

688
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:32,038
because it doesn't matter but

689
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:33,419
a lot of them that you talk to are are

690
00:27:32,038 --> 00:27:37,079
weed nerds

691
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:39,059
right like live and breathe it yeah like

692
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:41,519
if I if I want a hundred mil there's a

693
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:43,558
bunch of weed growers that if they want

694
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:45,000
a hundred million dollar lottery they

695
00:27:43,558 --> 00:27:47,579
would probably never grow wheat again

696
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,679
and I would hire my friends and start

697
00:27:47,579 --> 00:27:52,139
some kind of like Nursery art research

698
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,298
and development thing and start messing

699
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:57,299
around right

700
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:58,859
um and so you know it it that's the

701
00:27:57,298 --> 00:28:00,839
reason why a lot of strains get lost

702
00:27:58,859 --> 00:28:04,558
right because it's only a few weird

703
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:07,740
nerds holding on to why are you holding

704
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:08,940
on to something that's old and unpopular

705
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:11,519
right

706
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:13,860
that's sort of really good advice for

707
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:15,658
like you know the advocacy needed and

708
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:18,538
the direction to help steer things

709
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:21,960
moving forward I guess if we had a more

710
00:28:18,538 --> 00:28:24,359
sort of um how shall we say like Savory

711
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:26,640
look at the future accounting for the

712
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:29,399
way things have gone thus far

713
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,799
when we're talking about diversity do

714
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:34,320
you think it is that unreasonable that

715
00:28:31,798 --> 00:28:37,259
in like 20 years time the big

716
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:39,418
corporations may have Consolidated where

717
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:41,460
smoking glass house mountains if you

718
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:44,220
want the mids we're smoking alien Labs

719
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:46,319
if you want the ZaZa and like there's

720
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:48,419
just not really any home Growers left do

721
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:49,678
you think that's possible at all or do

722
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:52,259
you think that's like a bit too

723
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:55,860
far-fetched that's possible but that

724
00:28:52,259 --> 00:28:59,339
would be that would that would be uh

725
00:28:55,859 --> 00:29:01,558
Regulators stomping us out in the sense

726
00:28:59,339 --> 00:29:05,158
so look at it from a look at it from a a

727
00:29:01,558 --> 00:29:06,418
related but a different perspective okay

728
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:10,320
um in America

729
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:12,659
when when I was a kid uh up until not

730
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:14,460
even really all that long ago but for a

731
00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:17,039
long time you could go into grocery

732
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:19,319
stores and

733
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:22,619
you like you know we were talking about

734
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:25,019
it offline before we started but you got

735
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:27,119
the vegetables and the fruits that made

736
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:30,000
the most sense for the producers to

737
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:31,199
produce to put into that grocery store

738
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,898
right

739
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:36,058
and they had production models they had

740
00:29:33,898 --> 00:29:37,079
cucumbers and tomatoes and all these

741
00:29:36,058 --> 00:29:38,940
different things that fit that

742
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:41,699
production model but because it was

743
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:44,580
totally legal there was this whole small

744
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:46,620
little group of weirdos that was trading

745
00:29:44,579 --> 00:29:49,500
heirloom varieties of every different

746
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:52,199
kind imaginable and they did that for

747
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:53,880
decades when the only place you could

748
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:57,778
get that kind of stuff was at farmers

749
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:59,520
markets right and then eventually people

750
00:29:57,778 --> 00:30:01,440
were like man these tomatoes taste

751
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:03,179
pretty watery and Bland

752
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,558
and there's these other tomatoes and

753
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:06,000
they taste delicious

754
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:08,099
and they started going to like these

755
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,619
co-ops and these hippie you know places

756
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:12,058
that had some better grades of food and

757
00:30:10,619 --> 00:30:13,918
stuff and they started tasting these

758
00:30:12,058 --> 00:30:15,418
different veggies and they were like man

759
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,860
these are incredible

760
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:19,020
and then some of these big grocery

761
00:30:16,859 --> 00:30:22,079
stores start carrying these lines

762
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:24,359
because enough customers demand I want

763
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:26,579
heirloom tomatoes in this store why

764
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:27,898
can't I get summertime seasonal

765
00:30:26,579 --> 00:30:31,798
delicious

766
00:30:27,898 --> 00:30:33,178
that's not just this one type and so I

767
00:30:31,798 --> 00:30:35,339
think if they open it up and they

768
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:37,919
actually make it fully legal

769
00:30:35,339 --> 00:30:39,658
whether or not

770
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:43,020
um whether or not it becomes like

771
00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:45,960
commercially viable there will be a a

772
00:30:43,019 --> 00:30:48,839
small group to a medium-sized group that

773
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:51,058
will be breeding and trading and saving

774
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:53,220
things and pushing it forward and doing

775
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:55,200
the stuff that interests them and they

776
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:57,899
won't give a [ __ ] about

777
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,659
what's going on in the bigger world

778
00:30:57,898 --> 00:31:02,699
the way that that doesn't work is if

779
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:05,940
they make it illegal

780
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:09,179
for anyone but the large producers right

781
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:12,659
so it's like big corporations

782
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:14,519
controlling all of it is fine as long as

783
00:31:12,659 --> 00:31:16,380
you allow the little guy to do what he

784
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:18,538
wants now would I prefer big

785
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:21,600
corporations to control everything no

786
00:31:18,538 --> 00:31:24,960
but I also live in America and I watch

787
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:27,599
how most Industries are controlled by

788
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:30,659
relatively few groups

789
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:33,240
think about uh think about another thing

790
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:35,340
which is not an exact analogy because

791
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:39,000
it's not plants but it is kind of

792
00:31:35,339 --> 00:31:40,798
similar after prohibition ended uh for

793
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,278
alcohol

794
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:46,200
um for about 70 years Americans had

795
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:48,119
their choice of what kind of crappy

796
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:52,319
pilsner do you want to drink

797
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:55,979
sure we've got bud Bud Light cores old

798
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:59,278
style Pabst you know like the heady beer

799
00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:01,259
when I was in my early 20s going to a

800
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:02,519
bar was Heineken

801
00:32:01,259 --> 00:32:05,819
literally

802
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:08,398
and then now what's happened is probably

803
00:32:05,819 --> 00:32:11,220
30 percent of the market is what it's

804
00:32:08,398 --> 00:32:12,959
it's craft breweries

805
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:15,600
bringing all this different diversity

806
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,960
that was always there it's just big

807
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:20,759
corporations offered you here's

808
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,519
um here's a bunch of schwill do you know

809
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:25,500
that Budweiser like for actual Budweiser

810
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,079
beer it makes about half the barrels of

811
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,038
Budweiser that it used to from the 90s

812
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:32,038
on

813
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:34,319
and it's replaced that by buying micro

814
00:32:32,038 --> 00:32:37,440
breweries because they're this whole

815
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:39,119
segment of the population that likes to

816
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,399
drink beer but it doesn't want to drink

817
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:43,379
that great of beer anymore

818
00:32:41,398 --> 00:32:46,678
it wants to drink a different grade it

819
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:50,100
wants to drink you know Stouts or ipas

820
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:52,860
or ambers or box or you know some kind

821
00:32:50,099 --> 00:32:54,959
of thing like that and it's they become

822
00:32:52,859 --> 00:32:57,538
economically important enough that you

823
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:01,079
have to cater to them to some degree

824
00:32:57,538 --> 00:33:02,339
so what can happen to weed is still wide

825
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:04,139
open

826
00:33:02,339 --> 00:33:06,119
but

827
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:09,240
um the way I look at it is kind of punk

828
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:11,459
rock in the sense of like we we haven't

829
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:14,278
been given what we want yet

830
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:17,159
so the fight isn't over this is sort of

831
00:33:14,278 --> 00:33:19,500
like legalization and wreckweed is sort

832
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:21,419
of like they're losing and this is like

833
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:23,398
their fallback position

834
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:24,899
of like okay okay okay we'll give it to

835
00:33:23,398 --> 00:33:27,119
you but it has all these rules and you

836
00:33:24,898 --> 00:33:30,000
have to do it like this and we need to

837
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:33,959
keep saying no no we want it like this

838
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:37,019
like we want it like this right because

839
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:39,179
even like even Stores

840
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:41,519
um eventually what probably is going to

841
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:44,880
have to happen in order for Quality to

842
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:47,880
really rain is you would have to allow

843
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:52,080
um you know direct to Consumer sales

844
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:53,640
because what happens is right is that in

845
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:55,678
the current model

846
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,640
if you walk into a dispensary to buy

847
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,460
weed

848
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:03,360
you can only buy the weed the dispensary

849
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:05,519
has pre-chosen to buy to sell to you

850
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:07,379
they could be like I don't want to buy

851
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:09,300
this Neville's Haze

852
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,079
doesn't look nice and you want more for

853
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,580
it

854
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:13,398
what does that mean that means the

855
00:34:11,579 --> 00:34:16,500
consumer doesn't get a chance to buy it

856
00:34:13,398 --> 00:34:19,138
so by only having these certain

857
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:21,179
regulated stores that can sell it you

858
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:25,559
give those stores a lot of power over

859
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:27,418
what the consumer gets to gets to see

860
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:28,378
and then the Growers are going to want

861
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:31,378
to grow

862
00:34:28,378 --> 00:34:33,719
what the what the middle man and what

863
00:34:31,378 --> 00:34:36,480
the dispensary is willing to buy but

864
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:39,678
that that shouldn't be who's determining

865
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:43,800
what weed is out there consumer should

866
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:45,059
yeah yeah certainly it seems like I mean

867
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,740
to me it feels like there's a lot of

868
00:34:45,059 --> 00:34:48,779
parallels with yeah the beer and the

869
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:49,799
wine Industries you see where it's like

870
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:52,619
you know a lot of people are getting

871
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:55,260
into like these natural styles of wine

872
00:34:52,619 --> 00:34:57,720
and these craft beers and it's really

873
00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:00,780
about accessibility I certainly have

874
00:34:57,719 --> 00:35:03,059
wondered with cannabis specifically I've

875
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:05,460
always felt like the wine especially in

876
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:08,338
Europe they were really there was

877
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:12,119
something about the the appalachas which

878
00:35:08,338 --> 00:35:15,659
allowed there to be like to put it

879
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:17,519
simply in wine you know someone goes for

880
00:35:15,659 --> 00:35:19,139
like thousands and thousands of dollars

881
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:20,639
a bottle and there's a decent and the

882
00:35:19,139 --> 00:35:22,739
people who own those Vineyards make good

883
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:24,539
good money off it oh yeah and so I sort

884
00:35:22,739 --> 00:35:27,239
of thought how can we do the same thing

885
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:29,279
with cannabis where you can still grow

886
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:31,139
it yourself and maybe if you're in a

887
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,599
good area you can fetch a pretty penny

888
00:35:31,139 --> 00:35:35,400
for it because I think if I try to and

889
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,260
correct me if I'm wrong from extracting

890
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,838
all of what you've said it's basically

891
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:42,540
that the the more variety the better for

892
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:44,699
everyone in every regard but also never

893
00:35:42,539 --> 00:35:47,039
see the right to personally grow because

894
00:35:44,699 --> 00:35:48,659
we need to have the small home Growers

895
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:51,000
yeah I mean

896
00:35:48,659 --> 00:35:54,358
I mean I'll use I'll use the analogy

897
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:57,000
again imagine if uh if your record store

898
00:35:54,358 --> 00:35:58,440
refused to carry Led Zeppelin and you

899
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,599
didn't have the choice you couldn't buy

900
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,940
it so you couldn't hear it

901
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:06,059
right you know

902
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:07,980
um but I do think that you're right and

903
00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:10,500
that I don't know if I use this analogy

904
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:13,199
in the in our previous chat so if I did

905
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:15,719
I apologize but I think it does matter

906
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:18,480
and that if you go back to like say like

907
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:21,719
the 70s and in the United States

908
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,980
most people had almost no knowledge of

909
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:25,439
wine

910
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:27,358
the the regions that are famous for wine

911
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,099
now like in California and stuff like

912
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:31,920
that we're just kind of really getting

913
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:34,800
going back then you would say that like

914
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:37,980
most Americans their knowledge of wine

915
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,359
was like white wine is for the wife and

916
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:42,599
it goes with fish

917
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:45,420
red wine is for is is like meats and

918
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:49,320
roasts and steaks and they kind of knew

919
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:51,420
red and white and after 40 Years of you

920
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,740
know education and the populace now

921
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:55,380
there's people that are like they know

922
00:36:52,739 --> 00:36:57,899
what Napa is they know what regions are

923
00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:01,260
they know like oh I like Zinfandel I

924
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:03,838
like Merlot I like this appellation for

925
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:05,400
my Pinot Gris I like you know because

926
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:07,320
there's all this information and then

927
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:10,680
you get enough nerds that are pushing it

928
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:13,019
forward and you go into like a a heady

929
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:14,819
wine shop and the guy working there has

930
00:37:13,019 --> 00:37:16,320
his favorites and he knows tons of

931
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:18,599
information about it and he's like

932
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,640
preaching to like the customers about

933
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:23,220
what his favorites are and why

934
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:25,440
weed needs to have that kind of thing

935
00:37:23,219 --> 00:37:27,419
because what's happened with weed is

936
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,460
that in the beginning you only had

937
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:30,900
access to like what the dealers you knew

938
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:32,400
had

939
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:35,039
and then it was like what they had

940
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,380
access to and like what they wanted to

941
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:40,139
buy and now that we've got stores it's

942
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:42,599
opened up a bit but it's like the choice

943
00:37:40,139 --> 00:37:44,759
there's the taxes are so high and the

944
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:46,619
pressures are so big they really haven't

945
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,480
opened it up yet to choice they really

946
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:50,820
haven't graded out

947
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:53,159
like what the differences are in weed

948
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:54,359
and a lot of times with these mylar bags

949
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:56,098
and everything like that like people

950
00:37:54,358 --> 00:37:57,480
don't even see the weed until they've

951
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:59,519
purchased it

952
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:01,619
right so there's a lot of improvements

953
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:03,179
that need to be made I would say that

954
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:04,559
like all these laws that have happened

955
00:38:03,179 --> 00:38:06,419
right now

956
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:08,699
a lot of them need to go but they're

957
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:10,619
like the first baby steps

958
00:38:08,699 --> 00:38:13,199
right and the other the other

959
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:14,039
interesting component which I don't know

960
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:14,699
that

961
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:16,739
um

962
00:38:14,699 --> 00:38:19,460
Australia is a pretty big country so

963
00:38:16,739 --> 00:38:23,519
maybe you get this there but in America

964
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:26,159
we're so big that we grow crops where

965
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:28,739
the climate suits the crop

966
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:30,659
right like we you know we used to grow

967
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:32,279
oranges in Southern California or

968
00:38:30,659 --> 00:38:35,039
oranges in Florida

969
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:37,680
we grow you know maple trees grow in in

970
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:40,679
New England right we grow almonds in

971
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:43,259
California we grow potatoes in Idaho

972
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:45,899
right we figure out where the climate

973
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:48,240
suits the crop and that's where the

974
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:50,160
majority of the crop gets grown

975
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:53,039
because it's cheaper to do it that way

976
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:55,078
because the climate suits the crop what

977
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:57,239
we have right now is we have this weird

978
00:38:55,079 --> 00:39:00,000
thing where every state that goes legal

979
00:38:57,239 --> 00:39:01,139
or recreational or medical is its own

980
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,940
Island

981
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:06,059
because the federal government doesn't

982
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:08,460
allow interstate commerce right so

983
00:39:06,059 --> 00:39:11,099
California can't send its weed anywhere

984
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:13,699
else Montana can't send its weed

985
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:17,460
anywhere else you know Massachusetts

986
00:39:13,699 --> 00:39:19,919
Colorado Washington so it's almost like

987
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:22,740
you've got this captive group of people

988
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,180
that just have to take what's on offer

989
00:39:22,739 --> 00:39:26,039
in your little state

990
00:39:24,179 --> 00:39:28,199
and there's nowhere for the

991
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:31,139
overproduction to go

992
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:33,239
and so as a result of that the best

993
00:39:31,139 --> 00:39:35,219
states there's going to come a time when

994
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:36,598
it becomes federally legal where most of

995
00:39:35,219 --> 00:39:39,059
the places that are setting up to grow

996
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:41,220
cannabis won't grow commercial cannabis

997
00:39:39,059 --> 00:39:43,500
because the the climate isn't as

998
00:39:41,219 --> 00:39:45,779
suitable as other areas of the country

999
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:47,460
you know and they'll probably end up

1000
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,720
growing indoor where the power is

1001
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:50,820
cheapest

1002
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:53,039
once you can ship it anywhere in the 50

1003
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:54,359
in the in in the 50 states or you could

1004
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:56,880
ship it International or whatever

1005
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:58,980
they're going to set it up where it

1006
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,260
makes the most sense and you mentioned

1007
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:02,940
glass house or whatever that's like

1008
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:05,339
their whole business that's their old

1009
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:06,780
business plan if if it stays the way it

1010
00:40:05,338 --> 00:40:08,099
is for the next 10 years they'll

1011
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:09,300
probably fail as they burn through

1012
00:40:08,099 --> 00:40:11,160
investor money

1013
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,960
their whole point is to have a hundred

1014
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:14,399
acres and eventually they're going to

1015
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,019
start to ship to other parts of the

1016
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,720
country that can't grow as good a weed

1017
00:40:16,019 --> 00:40:21,539
as California can that's their hope

1018
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:23,939
there's big corporations that are

1019
00:40:21,539 --> 00:40:26,279
setting up that are hoping that we go

1020
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:28,200
federally legal because otherwise

1021
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:31,140
they'll fail in their little state that

1022
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:33,960
they're in so like I guess what I think

1023
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:36,420
about though is like people like Bud

1024
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:38,519
Light and Heineken maybe some of these

1025
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:41,099
more sort of you know everyday man beers

1026
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:43,739
they're very much accepted in the

1027
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:45,838
community from us heady guys there is

1028
00:40:43,739 --> 00:40:48,118
still a lot of sort of um you know

1029
00:40:45,838 --> 00:40:50,400
grievances with some of these mid Z

1030
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:52,380
brands do you think in time that'll

1031
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:55,380
equalize out and it'll just become

1032
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:57,240
accepted that this is in fact like you

1033
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:59,338
know beer and wine and these guys are

1034
00:40:57,239 --> 00:41:01,019
trying to be literally the Bud Light of

1035
00:40:59,338 --> 00:41:02,219
cannabis and

1036
00:41:01,019 --> 00:41:04,079
um and there's nothing wrong with that

1037
00:41:02,219 --> 00:41:06,179
no there's nothing wrong with that the

1038
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:09,539
problem is is that because of the way

1039
00:41:06,179 --> 00:41:11,399
modern marketing works every single

1040
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:13,679
license Holder will tell you they are

1041
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:15,119
trying to grow the best cannabis on

1042
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:17,460
Earth

1043
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:20,880
and they have the terpiest flaviest

1044
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:23,460
highest THC best weed you can buy and

1045
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:28,079
that's why you should buy it from us

1046
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:29,639
right who try to find a brand that wants

1047
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:31,680
to tell you oh we definitely want to be

1048
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:33,719
the Bud Light of weed that's a good

1049
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:36,059
point try to get him to say it right

1050
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:37,379
they won't say it they might grow Bud

1051
00:41:36,059 --> 00:41:39,900
Light but they're going to try to tell

1052
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:42,599
you that it's the most exclusive rarest

1053
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:44,880
fire on the planet

1054
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:47,220
this might be wrong but I think that guy

1055
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,200
who wrote three a light has come out on

1056
00:41:47,219 --> 00:41:51,419
the record being like yeah this is not

1057
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:54,899
going to produce the best quality like

1058
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:57,480
this is volume yeah I mean and the the

1059
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:59,700
problem too this this this might get

1060
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:02,519
into the weeds right

1061
00:41:59,699 --> 00:42:04,919
um so I apologize for that but

1062
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:06,659
one of the issues with legal cannabis in

1063
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:09,000
America is that

1064
00:42:06,659 --> 00:42:12,059
because it's illegal at the federal

1065
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,920
level Banks won't touch you I'm sure

1066
00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:15,900
you've heard that like even getting even

1067
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,059
getting and maintaining bank accounts

1068
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:20,820
for like quote-unquote legal businesses

1069
00:42:18,059 --> 00:42:22,380
can be very difficult because these

1070
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:25,320
banks are like multinational

1071
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:27,599
corporations and they don't want to get

1072
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:29,579
in trouble with the federal government

1073
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:32,099
so they don't care that it's legal in

1074
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:33,839
California they care that the feds say

1075
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:36,480
it's not right

1076
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:39,179
so what happens is is that means that

1077
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:41,880
unlike almost any other business you

1078
00:42:39,179 --> 00:42:44,039
can't go with a business plan to a bank

1079
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:46,500
and get a regular loan

1080
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:48,900
but they're very very concerned with

1081
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:51,440
black market money making its way into

1082
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:54,000
the legal system so they want you

1083
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,619
guaranteed to have banked money to start

1084
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,159
your legal business

1085
00:42:55,619 --> 00:43:01,920
okay well where do you get legal banked

1086
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:03,960
money if the bank won't give it to you

1087
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,300
you then have to get it from private

1088
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:08,579
individuals that have that money in the

1089
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:10,318
bank which means that the way that we

1090
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:11,579
Legalize It in this country all of a

1091
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:14,039
sudden made

1092
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:16,800
private investors some of the biggest

1093
00:43:14,039 --> 00:43:19,440
movers and shakers in cannabis

1094
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,539
because they fund all of it and you

1095
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,400
can't you can't like have I mean imagine

1096
00:43:21,539 --> 00:43:26,279
there's there's scenes in like you know

1097
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:28,460
in Southern California where like the

1098
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:30,720
licenses just for the amount of of

1099
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:32,880
licenses they have is like eight hundred

1100
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:34,858
thousand dollars a year to maintain

1101
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,700
that has to be a check cut to the

1102
00:43:34,858 --> 00:43:37,858
government

1103
00:43:35,699 --> 00:43:39,838
you know and so all these all this

1104
00:43:37,858 --> 00:43:41,098
infrastructure all these build outs all

1105
00:43:39,838 --> 00:43:42,838
this different stuff that's happening

1106
00:43:41,099 --> 00:43:45,599
right now that you see whenever you see

1107
00:43:42,838 --> 00:43:48,599
it it's almost always private money

1108
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:51,000
that's been raised and then you have a

1109
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:53,700
business and the taxes are through the

1110
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,318
roof the regulations are crazy and it

1111
00:43:53,699 --> 00:43:57,598
makes you do all kinds of inefficient

1112
00:43:55,318 --> 00:44:01,199
stuff to like deal with the regulations

1113
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:02,940
right banking is a huge issue and you've

1114
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:04,679
got these private investors that have

1115
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:06,960
been told that weed is basically like

1116
00:44:04,679 --> 00:44:09,480
cocaine in your Pablo Escobar and it

1117
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,818
should be rolling in cash and we want a

1118
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:13,800
big return on our investment

1119
00:44:11,818 --> 00:44:15,779
and that's where you see a bunch of

1120
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:18,180
people starting to grow boof

1121
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:20,339
beca or mids because maybe they don't

1122
00:44:18,179 --> 00:44:22,019
want to but it's the only way they can

1123
00:44:20,338 --> 00:44:23,759
keep their head above water with the

1124
00:44:22,019 --> 00:44:26,039
taxes the regulations and then the

1125
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:28,079
investor group breathing down their neck

1126
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:31,980
for return and profit

1127
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:34,099
and so there's a lot of things that are

1128
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:37,800
that you know that are stacked against

1129
00:44:34,099 --> 00:44:42,059
mod like you know recreational Cannabis

1130
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:43,500
actually getting fire on on the Shelf

1131
00:44:42,059 --> 00:44:45,599
um that three pounds of light you were

1132
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:48,539
joking about you know when Colorado went

1133
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:50,220
went recreational it was one it was one

1134
00:44:48,539 --> 00:44:53,219
of the first places in the country to go

1135
00:44:50,219 --> 00:44:55,559
full recreational I believe you know uh

1136
00:44:53,219 --> 00:45:00,000
Washington State and Colorado not just

1137
00:44:55,559 --> 00:45:02,338
Medical but actual like full wreck right

1138
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,900
all these indoors there the most

1139
00:45:02,338 --> 00:45:06,619
important thing was getting three or

1140
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,619
four pounds of light

1141
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:11,459
because your accountant or your CFO or

1142
00:45:10,019 --> 00:45:13,980
whatever is like dude you want to get

1143
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:15,720
paid you want to pay your staff

1144
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:17,579
well we got to give this enormous chunk

1145
00:45:15,719 --> 00:45:19,739
to these investors that help you build

1146
00:45:17,579 --> 00:45:21,780
out this huge facility that cost a few

1147
00:45:19,739 --> 00:45:25,019
million bucks they're breathing down our

1148
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:29,300
necks what they want is they want you to

1149
00:45:25,019 --> 00:45:29,300
make the most money you possibly can

1150
00:45:30,539 --> 00:45:35,818
now that's not the same thing as the

1151
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:39,480
best weed you can possibly grow

1152
00:45:35,818 --> 00:45:41,880
doesn't mean there's not a balance there

1153
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:43,800
but right now it's been weighted towards

1154
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:45,358
survival

1155
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:47,880
and I don't know if you've seen it but

1156
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:50,578
like in California obviously where I

1157
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:52,260
live there's enormous amounts of

1158
00:45:50,579 --> 00:45:53,579
licenses right now that aren't getting

1159
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:56,400
renewed

1160
00:45:53,579 --> 00:45:58,140
because the people have decided it's not

1161
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,119
economically viable

1162
00:45:58,139 --> 00:46:02,338
yeah certainly

1163
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:03,838
because the taxes are too high and the

1164
00:46:02,338 --> 00:46:05,159
way they set the rules up are too

1165
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:07,858
restrictive

1166
00:46:05,159 --> 00:46:09,960
uh you know proposition 64 most people

1167
00:46:07,858 --> 00:46:12,119
don't know this it was written by a

1168
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:15,358
bunch of tech Bros

1169
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:16,858
uh you know who Sean Parker is

1170
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:19,858
yeah yeah

1171
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:21,779
the guy who invented Napster

1172
00:46:19,858 --> 00:46:23,940
um he's one of the guys that that he's

1173
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:25,740
one of the guys that funded the prop 64

1174
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:28,559
movement

1175
00:46:25,739 --> 00:46:30,659
um and it they didn't they didn't you

1176
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:32,460
know I don't know I don't know what the

1177
00:46:30,659 --> 00:46:34,679
best way to put this is but

1178
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:37,139
it's not like a bunch of lifelong

1179
00:46:34,679 --> 00:46:39,118
cannabis enthusiasts were brought

1180
00:46:37,139 --> 00:46:40,980
together and said hey

1181
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:43,740
why don't you write out

1182
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:46,619
a proposition that would be good for the

1183
00:46:43,739 --> 00:46:48,479
consumer good for you good for the state

1184
00:46:46,619 --> 00:46:51,420
it was a bunch of dudes that might have

1185
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:53,280
been very smart in other fields

1186
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:54,358
thinking that they could be incredibly

1187
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,960
smart

1188
00:46:54,358 --> 00:47:01,500
in this field and as a result

1189
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:03,480
you know they made it you know imagine a

1190
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:05,159
bunch of Rich Tech Bros or whatever made

1191
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:07,019
it so that like you needed private

1192
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:08,699
Capital to exist

1193
00:47:07,019 --> 00:47:10,440
you needed them

1194
00:47:08,699 --> 00:47:13,578
it's almost like they wrote themselves

1195
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:16,079
into the movie right and I'll tell you

1196
00:47:13,579 --> 00:47:17,400
that I you know I don't talk about it

1197
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:19,318
all that much but you know I've done

1198
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:21,599
Consulting and I I definitely have

1199
00:47:19,318 --> 00:47:23,639
rubbed shoulders with the legal scenes

1200
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:26,720
in California and I've tried to help on

1201
00:47:23,639 --> 00:47:29,400
projects and stuff it is a very weird

1202
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:32,879
cultural difference to get a lifelong

1203
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:34,980
weed person in a room with a rich kid

1204
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,940
whose parents are worth tens of millions

1205
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:38,338
of dollars

1206
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:40,318
talk about a culture Clash

1207
00:47:38,338 --> 00:47:45,059
talk about people that don't understand

1208
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:48,179
the other person and so uh you know look

1209
00:47:45,059 --> 00:47:50,039
at look at um you know uh

1210
00:47:48,179 --> 00:47:52,559
Dennis perone or whatever the First

1211
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:53,699
Medical in in America happened in

1212
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:57,119
California

1213
00:47:53,699 --> 00:47:59,818
right and he wrote this law you know he

1214
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:02,280
was this gay activist trying to get

1215
00:47:59,818 --> 00:48:04,500
medicine to a bunch of his friends who

1216
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:06,540
were suffering from HIV and various

1217
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:08,579
other things and they pushed through

1218
00:48:06,539 --> 00:48:09,800
this law that was very vague

1219
00:48:08,579 --> 00:48:13,019
okay

1220
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:15,599
and very much towards the consumer and

1221
00:48:13,019 --> 00:48:19,679
very much towards the grower and it

1222
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:22,680
sparked a 25 a 20-year 25 you know at

1223
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:24,480
least 20 year 20-year boom like nothing

1224
00:48:22,679 --> 00:48:26,639
anyone had ever seen

1225
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,318
and then these people come inside and

1226
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:30,000
they decide to write this wreck thing

1227
00:48:28,318 --> 00:48:32,880
that was basically benefiting the

1228
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,159
government the rich people

1229
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:37,559
um not benefiting the consumer not

1230
00:48:35,159 --> 00:48:39,239
benefiting the grower and we're four or

1231
00:48:37,559 --> 00:48:40,858
five years into it and it's collapsing

1232
00:48:39,239 --> 00:48:43,500
under its own weight

1233
00:48:40,858 --> 00:48:45,239
because no one bothered to talk to the

1234
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:48,719
people that were intimately involved in

1235
00:48:45,239 --> 00:48:50,639
cannabis for a long time about how the

1236
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:55,019
structure of it should work

1237
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:56,338
right so now it probably will take a

1238
00:48:55,019 --> 00:48:57,719
whole bunch of investor money getting

1239
00:48:56,338 --> 00:49:00,599
lit on fire

1240
00:48:57,719 --> 00:49:02,639
and a whole bunch of failure for them to

1241
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:05,519
start adjusting the rules

1242
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:07,739
and you know I don't I don't exactly

1243
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:09,599
know the future is very uncertain

1244
00:49:07,739 --> 00:49:10,979
because

1245
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:13,079
um a lot of these places are only

1246
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:15,000
surviving off investor money

1247
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:18,240
and when investors decide to stop

1248
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:21,480
investing you get failures so I think

1249
00:49:18,239 --> 00:49:23,578
it's very up in the air and probably

1250
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:25,800
most of the people you talk to

1251
00:49:23,579 --> 00:49:28,800
I would imagine because you talk to

1252
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:31,440
people like me aren't very happy with it

1253
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:34,440
right and so it's like it's cool in the

1254
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:36,420
sense that yes America should get used

1255
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:38,220
to the fact that recreational Cannabis

1256
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:40,559
should be totally normal

1257
00:49:38,219 --> 00:49:43,199
but we really would like to scrap most

1258
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:45,900
of the rules around it and come up with

1259
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:48,059
a different more successful model some

1260
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:50,940
brilliant thoughts there for sure I

1261
00:49:48,059 --> 00:49:53,099
guess we will have to wait and watch and

1262
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:55,440
see who does for you're certainly not

1263
00:49:53,099 --> 00:49:56,460
wrong about people operating on investor

1264
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,920
money

1265
00:49:56,460 --> 00:50:00,539
with little change of pace though I was

1266
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:02,099
hoping to ask you last episode so I'm

1267
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:02,940
going to get in now before I forget this

1268
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:06,300
time

1269
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:08,880
I uh like to consider the the followers

1270
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:10,980
of the show along with myself maybe a

1271
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:14,280
bit of bias there just from me a pretty

1272
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:15,838
passionate bunch of organic fans and I

1273
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,640
know you've been around the block long

1274
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:20,159
enough to have tried the whole gamut of

1275
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:22,559
different grow Styles I'd love to hear

1276
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:24,598
how are you growing at the moment in

1277
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:25,920
terms of your style and inputs and

1278
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:29,338
what's your thoughts on the whole

1279
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:30,599
organic versus synthetic debate

1280
00:50:29,338 --> 00:50:33,119
uh

1281
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:34,980
uh it's a big enough topic that I

1282
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:37,858
actually if I talked to Matt about doing

1283
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:40,019
like a couple of like solo episodes on

1284
00:50:37,858 --> 00:50:42,960
it because I think it's like one of the

1285
00:50:40,019 --> 00:50:45,659
most poorly understood

1286
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:47,220
um parts of cannabis and it also is a

1287
00:50:45,659 --> 00:50:48,838
little bit like religion in the sense

1288
00:50:47,219 --> 00:50:51,299
that people get like their belief

1289
00:50:48,838 --> 00:50:53,940
systems in place on something and then

1290
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:55,500
they get very very hard to knock off

1291
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:59,579
what they think of

1292
00:50:55,500 --> 00:51:02,219
and so I I think I would say simply

1293
00:50:59,579 --> 00:51:03,300
uh there is no one-size-fits-all

1294
00:51:02,219 --> 00:51:04,799
solution

1295
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:07,260
right

1296
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,700
um and you know and what I mean by that

1297
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:10,140
is that

1298
00:51:08,699 --> 00:51:13,199
uh

1299
00:51:10,139 --> 00:51:16,379
you know organic versus salts

1300
00:51:13,199 --> 00:51:18,960
I think is is poorly understood and I

1301
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:20,640
don't think one is Superior in all

1302
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,740
instances to the other

1303
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:24,420
like I'll just say that simply

1304
00:51:22,739 --> 00:51:27,058
right

1305
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:30,358
um you know even just even just the idea

1306
00:51:27,059 --> 00:51:32,760
of organic indoor

1307
00:51:30,358 --> 00:51:36,299
right think about that

1308
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:39,240
okay like you know you have let's say

1309
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:41,280
you have a backyard garden

1310
00:51:39,239 --> 00:51:43,259
and you're growing veggies or weeding it

1311
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:46,319
or whatnot and you you know you're

1312
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:47,880
tilling it up and you're amending it and

1313
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:49,980
you're working with like a certain

1314
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:52,318
amount of native Earth

1315
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:53,880
right and you're adding some stuff to

1316
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:55,619
that maybe or maybe you're bringing in

1317
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:57,240
some soil and you're dumping that on top

1318
00:51:55,619 --> 00:51:59,460
of the Native Earth and you're churning

1319
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:01,979
it up and you know you're growing

1320
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:03,300
organically outside according to methods

1321
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:04,800
that have been around for a long time

1322
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:07,559
and then you're trying to grow

1323
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:10,380
organically indoor in a two gallon pot

1324
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:13,980
I'm gonna tell you that like there is no

1325
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:16,800
like soil food web that's complete

1326
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:21,480
that's going on in a two gallon pot

1327
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:25,318
right it's just too small you know so a

1328
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:27,300
lot of times you know and I I mean it

1329
00:52:25,318 --> 00:52:28,800
I don't want to get too in depth here

1330
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:32,160
maybe because I could go off into the

1331
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:36,240
Weeds on it but I think that organic

1332
00:52:32,159 --> 00:52:39,779
weed is the best possible weed

1333
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:42,959
I also think that it's harder to grow

1334
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:45,839
organic weed and there's lots of organic

1335
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,800
weed that is not as nice as salt grown

1336
00:52:45,838 --> 00:52:48,838
weed

1337
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:51,839
does that make sense

1338
00:52:48,838 --> 00:52:54,779
yeah yeah certainly I can certainly

1339
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:57,719
relate to having now been to a few

1340
00:52:54,780 --> 00:53:00,839
bigger facilities both organic and

1341
00:52:57,719 --> 00:53:03,118
synthetic that um a big thing I you know

1342
00:53:00,838 --> 00:53:05,338
I'm I'm DieHard organic right but I

1343
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:08,160
totally acknowledge that on scale you

1344
00:53:05,338 --> 00:53:11,159
start to see some problems that are sort

1345
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:13,699
of inherently addressed in salts so yeah

1346
00:53:11,159 --> 00:53:15,779
it's it's certainly no one size fits all

1347
00:53:13,699 --> 00:53:17,759
well look at it this way this is

1348
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:19,920
something that people don't consider but

1349
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:24,359
I've done a decent amount of Consulting

1350
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:26,579
in the in the legal scene and one of the

1351
00:53:24,358 --> 00:53:28,558
things that is a huge problem with

1352
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:31,980
Organics that people don't want to deal

1353
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:34,319
with right is that

1354
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:36,838
um you know cannabis comes with there

1355
00:53:34,318 --> 00:53:40,858
well there's two parts to it one is that

1356
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:43,858
cannabis uh comes with testing where if

1357
00:53:40,858 --> 00:53:45,179
you have too many heavy metals it fails

1358
00:53:43,858 --> 00:53:48,358
testing

1359
00:53:45,179 --> 00:53:51,598
right and then cannabis is also a bio

1360
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:54,179
accumulator of heavy metals which is a

1361
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:57,180
fancy way of saying it absorbs more

1362
00:53:54,179 --> 00:54:01,259
heavy metals into its you know vascular

1363
00:53:57,179 --> 00:54:03,000
system than most other plants do

1364
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:06,300
okay

1365
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,739
so uh what are you know you have this

1366
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:10,440
situation where

1367
00:54:07,739 --> 00:54:13,858
you know uh heavy metals

1368
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:17,220
I've done so much testing on inputs

1369
00:54:13,858 --> 00:54:19,078
it is really really hard to find any

1370
00:54:17,219 --> 00:54:20,279
kind of input that's derived from the

1371
00:54:19,079 --> 00:54:24,380
ocean

1372
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:24,380
that won't fail heavy metals testing

1373
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:29,099
and heavy metals are heavy right so they

1374
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:30,300
have a tendency to accumulate and

1375
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:34,019
persist

1376
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:37,200
so you make a bunch of compost

1377
00:54:34,019 --> 00:54:41,159
and you compost down your organic matter

1378
00:54:37,199 --> 00:54:43,739
into this like delicious food source

1379
00:54:41,159 --> 00:54:46,699
the heavy metals don't go away they

1380
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:46,699
concentrated too

1381
00:54:47,099 --> 00:54:56,420
right so and most compost is made from

1382
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:56,420
commercial agriculture waste

1383
00:54:56,639 --> 00:55:01,078
so it could also get sprayed with all

1384
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:04,380
kinds of chemicals like the whole

1385
00:55:01,079 --> 00:55:05,818
organic name is really funky so

1386
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:09,000
for instance I don't know if you're

1387
00:55:05,818 --> 00:55:12,800
aware of this but do you know that bone

1388
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,800
meal and blood meal are organic

1389
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:15,720
right

1390
00:55:14,338 --> 00:55:17,578
yeah

1391
00:55:15,719 --> 00:55:21,358
they don't have to come from organic

1392
00:55:17,579 --> 00:55:24,359
cows at all yeah yeah but I'm on growth

1393
00:55:21,358 --> 00:55:25,440
hormone so you could get bone meal from

1394
00:55:24,358 --> 00:55:28,380
the store

1395
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:31,200
that came out of a McDonald's

1396
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:35,220
you know a massive

1397
00:55:31,199 --> 00:55:36,539
you know uh massive factory with 25 000

1398
00:55:35,219 --> 00:55:39,239
cows

1399
00:55:36,539 --> 00:55:41,460
getting fed antibiotics all kinds of

1400
00:55:39,239 --> 00:55:43,139
chems all kinds of different stuff this

1401
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:45,358
and that whatever else

1402
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:49,259
once they take those bones and grind

1403
00:55:45,358 --> 00:55:51,719
them up it's organic right you know

1404
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:53,880
um you know blood meal is the is this is

1405
00:55:51,719 --> 00:55:55,618
the juice that comes off the cows that

1406
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:57,240
goes into the sluices when they do the

1407
00:55:55,619 --> 00:55:58,980
slaughterhouse

1408
00:55:57,239 --> 00:56:01,919
that doesn't have to that doesn't have

1409
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:03,900
to be from an organic cow you know so in

1410
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:06,960
in like

1411
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:09,480
in my world like sometimes salts might

1412
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:12,000
actually be cleaner

1413
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:14,039
depending on what organic inputs you

1414
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,539
might use

1415
00:56:14,039 --> 00:56:18,420
right

1416
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:20,699
um and then the other part of it that is

1417
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:22,980
really is really simple is that I look

1418
00:56:20,699 --> 00:56:25,019
at it as like the plant the plant

1419
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:27,000
absorbs nutrient salt

1420
00:56:25,019 --> 00:56:30,480
okay

1421
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:33,239
um So when you buy salt you know you

1422
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:35,519
know uh salt nutrition that nutrient

1423
00:56:33,239 --> 00:56:37,139
salt is in a form that's ready to ready

1424
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:39,539
to be absorbed

1425
00:56:37,139 --> 00:56:42,239
when you're growing organically those

1426
00:56:39,539 --> 00:56:43,318
salts are trapped in longer organic

1427
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:46,919
chains

1428
00:56:43,318 --> 00:56:49,679
and bacteria and and fungi and different

1429
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:51,780
things need to break that stuff down

1430
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:54,299
to release the salt to make it available

1431
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:57,119
for the plant

1432
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:59,099
so when you're growing the plant is

1433
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:02,160
either getting all of the nutrition that

1434
00:56:59,099 --> 00:57:04,380
it needs when it needs it or it isn't

1435
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:07,078
it can be somewhat simpler to feed it

1436
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:09,119
salts because you can quantify how much

1437
00:57:07,079 --> 00:57:12,180
food you're giving them

1438
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:14,400
where Organics you're hoping that

1439
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:15,480
there's enough stuff in there

1440
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,160
right

1441
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:20,940
does that make sense

1442
00:57:17,159 --> 00:57:23,578
yeah yeah but you still have skirted the

1443
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:26,639
question how do you grow at the moment

1444
00:57:23,579 --> 00:57:29,818
um I do it all

1445
00:57:26,639 --> 00:57:31,858
so to be perfectly honest I feel like

1446
00:57:29,818 --> 00:57:35,659
the best in go indoor is something that

1447
00:57:31,858 --> 00:57:40,019
I call synganic yep which is basically

1448
00:57:35,659 --> 00:57:42,299
you know a mix of Organics and stuff

1449
00:57:40,019 --> 00:57:43,800
that wouldn't necessarily qualify as

1450
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:45,480
organic

1451
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:47,039
right

1452
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:48,000
um but I still think of as really high

1453
00:57:47,039 --> 00:57:50,338
quality

1454
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,920
yeah give us give us some ideas what are

1455
00:57:50,338 --> 00:57:56,338
you doing I'm always Keen to learn

1456
00:57:52,920 --> 00:58:01,139
um so you know I uh

1457
00:57:56,338 --> 00:58:02,759
you know gosh this is gonna sound

1458
00:58:01,139 --> 00:58:05,639
this is going to sound like I'm avoiding

1459
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:09,119
the question again but

1460
00:58:05,639 --> 00:58:11,159
your how how I feed would be very

1461
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:13,980
different if you tell me I'm gonna be

1462
00:58:11,159 --> 00:58:17,338
growing in a one gallon to five gallon

1463
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:20,699
pot versus I want to set up a two foot

1464
00:58:17,338 --> 00:58:24,299
deep by 50 foot long bed

1465
00:58:20,699 --> 00:58:26,879
you know of of organic soil in my room

1466
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:29,280
versus I'm gonna grow in a 50 gallon

1467
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:32,280
container you know what I mean like

1468
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:33,720
there's there's differences in

1469
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:36,059
um an approach

1470
00:58:33,719 --> 00:58:37,259
right that that don't just meet that

1471
00:58:36,059 --> 00:58:39,480
label

1472
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:40,859
but the other thing that's weird okay

1473
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:43,699
and let me just throw this in there

1474
00:58:40,858 --> 00:58:43,699
before I forget it

1475
00:58:44,099 --> 00:58:51,180
because we smoke cannabis that means

1476
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:52,559
it's a little different than other

1477
00:58:51,179 --> 00:58:55,078
things

1478
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:57,780
right so you know I'm sure you've heard

1479
00:58:55,079 --> 00:58:59,640
talk about how like you know you want

1480
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:02,519
your veg your fruits and vegetables to

1481
00:58:59,639 --> 00:59:04,259
be as mineral rich as humanly possible

1482
00:59:02,519 --> 00:59:06,599
right because you want to be able to eat

1483
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:09,000
those vegetables or fruits or whatever

1484
00:59:06,599 --> 00:59:11,880
and you want your body to get that

1485
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:14,460
healthy form of all the nutrition that's

1486
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:15,900
in it and there's been a big worry that

1487
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:18,000
like you know

1488
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:19,680
um the levels of nutrition in our food

1489
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,420
are dropping

1490
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:24,659
which means you're not getting as much

1491
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:27,240
nutrient dense food as you used to

1492
00:59:24,659 --> 00:59:29,639
well that's eating things right

1493
00:59:27,239 --> 00:59:30,479
when you're growing

1494
00:59:29,639 --> 00:59:33,358
um

1495
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:37,260
you know uh generally speaking most

1496
00:59:33,358 --> 00:59:40,078
smokers don't want a plant that's chock

1497
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:42,720
full of nutrition

1498
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:44,880
when they're smoking it

1499
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:47,578
right that's where the whole flush thing

1500
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:49,079
comes into play right it's like you want

1501
00:59:47,579 --> 00:59:51,720
to feed your plant

1502
00:59:49,079 --> 00:59:53,640
to where it develops the right way

1503
00:59:51,719 --> 00:59:55,618
and then it's like you almost want to

1504
00:59:53,639 --> 00:59:58,259
like drain your plant of that nutrition

1505
00:59:55,619 --> 01:00:00,838
before you harvest it so it's not chock

1506
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:02,880
full of that

1507
01:00:00,838 --> 01:00:06,000
and here's another weird thing

1508
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:07,980
is that what you're tricking the plant

1509
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,318
into doing something that it has no

1510
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:12,900
interest in doing

1511
01:00:10,318 --> 01:00:13,739
the plant does not want to be Smoked by

1512
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:17,700
you

1513
01:00:13,739 --> 01:00:19,979
the plant wants to soak up as much

1514
01:00:17,699 --> 01:00:21,179
nutrition within itself as it possibly

1515
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:24,298
can

1516
01:00:21,179 --> 01:00:26,399
hold on to that nutrition until it gets

1517
01:00:24,298 --> 01:00:29,159
fertilized by pollen

1518
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:31,858
and then use that nutrition to make

1519
01:00:29,159 --> 01:00:34,558
viable seed so that its species

1520
01:00:31,858 --> 01:00:36,838
continues the plant does not consent to

1521
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:38,940
being harvested

1522
01:00:36,838 --> 01:00:41,578
right it does it's not it's it's like

1523
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:45,358
it's you know what we're doing with it

1524
01:00:41,579 --> 01:00:46,798
is not how it developed over its entire

1525
01:00:45,358 --> 01:00:49,500
lifespan

1526
01:00:46,798 --> 01:00:52,259
at all even like what you said there was

1527
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:54,599
really interesting like that Paradigm of

1528
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:57,000
getting it to the end of flower and then

1529
01:00:54,599 --> 01:00:59,818
getting it to try to drop all of its

1530
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:01,798
stored up nutrients like it's it's so

1531
01:00:59,818 --> 01:01:06,058
the antithesis of what it's trying to do

1532
01:01:01,798 --> 01:01:07,619
so if I have a I have I have a um we're

1533
01:01:06,059 --> 01:01:08,819
not friend we're not friends anymore not

1534
01:01:07,619 --> 01:01:10,619
because we're not friends but just

1535
01:01:08,818 --> 01:01:13,199
because life pushed Us in different

1536
01:01:10,619 --> 01:01:14,460
directions but some of the nicest weed I

1537
01:01:13,199 --> 01:01:18,000
ever grew

1538
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:20,400
or not or sampled was my buddy had this

1539
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,380
style of growing in a one in one gallon

1540
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:25,619
pots organically

1541
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:28,619
and he put enough food in there for the

1542
01:01:25,619 --> 01:01:31,140
first five or six weeks of growing

1543
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:33,059
and then the last you know he mostly

1544
01:01:31,139 --> 01:01:35,699
grew things that were eight to eight to

1545
01:01:33,059 --> 01:01:38,460
ten weeks that last two or three or four

1546
01:01:35,699 --> 01:01:40,980
weeks it would just start to slowly it

1547
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:42,539
used up all the food in the soil then it

1548
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:44,880
started like using up all the food

1549
01:01:42,539 --> 01:01:47,460
within itself and I'm sure you've seen

1550
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:48,960
like you know or a lot of times when

1551
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:51,480
you're growing salts and you flush a

1552
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:52,740
plant it just goes yellow but a lot of

1553
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:54,480
times when you're growing organically

1554
01:01:52,739 --> 01:01:56,759
and you and the plant starts to run out

1555
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:59,099
of nutrition it's almost like fall

1556
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:01,380
colors it starts to get all these

1557
01:01:59,099 --> 01:02:03,599
beautiful burgundies and Amber all these

1558
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:08,280
different color schematics start coming

1559
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:10,980
out and he would starve that plant

1560
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:13,798
right and he had beautiful white ash

1561
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:16,559
perfect smoke every time

1562
01:02:13,798 --> 01:02:19,259
and he would always say if I grow in too

1563
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:21,480
big a pots or I grow in beds how do I

1564
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:24,180
how do I flush it

1565
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:26,519
when there's so much nutrition

1566
01:02:24,179 --> 01:02:30,598
in there

1567
01:02:26,519 --> 01:02:33,000
right and so you know CSI and I talk

1568
01:02:30,599 --> 01:02:35,700
about this all the time like if you're

1569
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:38,280
growing for seed production

1570
01:02:35,699 --> 01:02:40,439
you're going to feed the plant vastly

1571
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:43,280
different than if you're growing for

1572
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:43,280
smoke

1573
01:02:43,338 --> 01:02:48,599
right because if you're going for seed

1574
01:02:46,019 --> 01:02:51,539
production you're essentially

1575
01:02:48,599 --> 01:02:54,000
wanting to have Healthy Mothers

1576
01:02:51,539 --> 01:02:56,338
that have a lot of nutrition so they can

1577
01:02:54,000 --> 01:03:00,358
make a bunch of babies

1578
01:02:56,338 --> 01:03:02,279
yeah right you want robust nitrogen you

1579
01:03:00,358 --> 01:03:04,259
want excess nitrogen you want excess of

1580
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:06,359
all these different things so that they

1581
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:10,319
can suck up as much food as they want

1582
01:03:06,358 --> 01:03:13,078
but often that smoke like like on a

1583
01:03:10,318 --> 01:03:15,420
reversal failure you know him and I joke

1584
01:03:13,079 --> 01:03:19,619
that like that smoke isn't nearly as

1585
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:22,019
nice as if you were growing it for smoke

1586
01:03:19,619 --> 01:03:23,818
because you would feed it differently

1587
01:03:22,019 --> 01:03:27,298
yeah then if you're trying to get a

1588
01:03:23,818 --> 01:03:30,420
bunch of tiger-striped robust seeds

1589
01:03:27,298 --> 01:03:32,400
so maybe I'm copping out on it but it's

1590
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:36,119
like it's such a big subject it's like

1591
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:38,220
really hard to do a one-size-fits all

1592
01:03:36,119 --> 01:03:39,720
um and you you think about those people

1593
01:03:38,219 --> 01:03:41,639
right like you know there's people that

1594
01:03:39,719 --> 01:03:43,759
brag oh I've got living soil and this is

1595
01:03:41,639 --> 01:03:47,358
my 26th cycle

1596
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:47,359
how do you flush

1597
01:03:47,719 --> 01:03:50,699
your your

1598
01:03:50,039 --> 01:03:52,558
um

1599
01:03:50,699 --> 01:03:54,179
your your weed is going to have more

1600
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:56,819
nutrition in it

1601
01:03:54,179 --> 01:03:59,098
because there's no there's no excellent

1602
01:03:56,818 --> 01:04:00,719
like the plant doesn't naturally be like

1603
01:03:59,099 --> 01:04:02,400
oh the human that's growing me is going

1604
01:04:00,719 --> 01:04:05,279
to want to smoke this thing in in five

1605
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:07,500
weeks I should stop uptaking food and

1606
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:09,660
start to starve myself so I produced a

1607
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:11,159
type of Bud that he prefers

1608
01:04:09,659 --> 01:04:12,058
and most people don't think of that

1609
01:04:11,159 --> 01:04:14,039
right

1610
01:04:12,059 --> 01:04:16,440
yeah I mean I think I've found with a

1611
01:04:14,039 --> 01:04:19,199
lot of my plants they tend to like fade

1612
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:22,440
and do that senescence thing regardless

1613
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:23,338
of the food levels I've found well I

1614
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:26,099
mean

1615
01:04:23,338 --> 01:04:28,500
kind of but I bet that you don't send

1616
01:04:26,099 --> 01:04:30,359
off your leaves for analysis

1617
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:32,400
yeah that's true

1618
01:04:30,358 --> 01:04:34,259
you know you don't know how much is in

1619
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,880
there you're just guessing I mean the

1620
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:37,319
other part that's interesting is that

1621
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:39,059
you know because we you know if you want

1622
01:04:37,318 --> 01:04:41,519
to talk about like white ash crew or

1623
01:04:39,059 --> 01:04:43,500
something like that well it is like such

1624
01:04:41,519 --> 01:04:47,400
an interesting debate in the community

1625
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:49,739
isn't it and also like the fact that

1626
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:51,838
um some stuff I've smoked that has black

1627
01:04:49,739 --> 01:04:54,779
Ash has Still Smoked really nice you

1628
01:04:51,838 --> 01:04:57,779
know it's like great High Yeah it it is

1629
01:04:54,780 --> 01:05:00,298
something that uh

1630
01:04:57,780 --> 01:05:02,339
it often has a lot more to do with how

1631
01:05:00,298 --> 01:05:04,259
it's dried and cured

1632
01:05:02,338 --> 01:05:07,019
than how it's fed

1633
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:09,720
but people wanna people wanna say it

1634
01:05:07,019 --> 01:05:11,519
proves how you fed it

1635
01:05:09,719 --> 01:05:13,318
um when feeding it that way can

1636
01:05:11,519 --> 01:05:15,719
influence it one way or the other but

1637
01:05:13,318 --> 01:05:18,058
it's probably not the biggest thing you

1638
01:05:15,719 --> 01:05:20,879
could feed it organically and starve the

1639
01:05:18,059 --> 01:05:22,798
crap out of it and then dry it too quick

1640
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:25,380
and not cure it right and it won't burn

1641
01:05:22,798 --> 01:05:27,960
the right way

1642
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:30,000
you know like it's it's there's multiple

1643
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:32,579
steps in the way and the other thing I

1644
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:35,519
should probably mention is that a lot of

1645
01:05:32,579 --> 01:05:37,980
my friends we find that uh

1646
01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:40,818
um stuff that's grown without CO2 to be

1647
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:40,818
superior smoke

1648
01:05:41,699 --> 01:05:46,558
you know because you you think about uh

1649
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:48,539
you know what is a plant doing

1650
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:52,700
when it's uh

1651
01:05:48,539 --> 01:05:52,699
when it's absorbing excess CO2

1652
01:05:53,159 --> 01:05:57,500
it's sequestering carbon

1653
01:05:58,139 --> 01:06:02,879
you know what does carbon look like when

1654
01:06:00,059 --> 01:06:06,059
it's burned black generally

1655
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:07,740
so you run a high CO2 room and you get

1656
01:06:06,059 --> 01:06:11,160
bigger yields and you're happy about

1657
01:06:07,739 --> 01:06:14,399
your weight it looks all nice

1658
01:06:11,159 --> 01:06:16,500
it's got more carbon in it

1659
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:19,500
then

1660
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:21,179
um then a plant grown without CO2 or

1661
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:23,039
with a naturally occurring like

1662
01:06:21,179 --> 01:06:26,578
atmosphere CO2

1663
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:29,639
because the atmosphere is 400 PPM

1664
01:06:26,579 --> 01:06:31,740
but if you pump it to 1500 PPM

1665
01:06:29,639 --> 01:06:33,719
it's going to absorb a bunch of that

1666
01:06:31,739 --> 01:06:35,399
carbon into itself

1667
01:06:33,719 --> 01:06:36,959
and then how do you deal with that at

1668
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:38,818
the end

1669
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:40,440
you've got you've got a lot you know it

1670
01:06:38,818 --> 01:06:42,000
got bigger flowers you've got bigger

1671
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:44,460
weight you're happy

1672
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:47,280
but there's more carbon in there

1673
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:48,298
because you fed it carbon and it sucked

1674
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:49,798
it up

1675
01:06:48,298 --> 01:06:51,420
I don't think people think about that

1676
01:06:49,798 --> 01:06:52,858
either

1677
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:56,159
right

1678
01:06:52,858 --> 01:06:58,259
um where in in some cases I almost think

1679
01:06:56,159 --> 01:07:00,719
this this isn't the only reason so don't

1680
01:06:58,260 --> 01:07:02,760
hold me to this but like in some reason

1681
01:07:00,719 --> 01:07:05,098
when people say that they prefer outdoor

1682
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:07,619
I think one of the reasons why some

1683
01:07:05,099 --> 01:07:10,500
people prefer outdoor is that it's not

1684
01:07:07,619 --> 01:07:13,260
you can't pump the room full of four

1685
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:16,079
times the ambient CO2 level

1686
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:17,940
and they end up preferring the smoke

1687
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:20,280
it's not the only Factor the sun

1688
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:22,559
obviously exists and all that so I don't

1689
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:24,660
want to say it's just one thing but it's

1690
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:27,839
definitely a thing that matters

1691
01:07:24,659 --> 01:07:29,639
and so I guess I'll close by saying that

1692
01:07:27,838 --> 01:07:32,219
like organic versus

1693
01:07:29,639 --> 01:07:34,500
salt or indoor versus outdoor or

1694
01:07:32,219 --> 01:07:36,598
whatever there's a big push in the

1695
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:38,699
community to think the way that I do

1696
01:07:36,599 --> 01:07:42,180
things is better

1697
01:07:38,699 --> 01:07:45,298
and it doesn't have trade-offs

1698
01:07:42,179 --> 01:07:47,338
where most things in the world have

1699
01:07:45,298 --> 01:07:50,099
trade-offs

1700
01:07:47,338 --> 01:07:52,199
you gain some things but you have to

1701
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:55,760
deal with these other things

1702
01:07:52,199 --> 01:07:59,399
and so the goal to me

1703
01:07:55,760 --> 01:08:02,280
when you're growing weed obviously is to

1704
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:04,440
grow the healthiest plant you can

1705
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:06,720
starve it a little bit at the end

1706
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:09,059
dry it and cure it the right way so that

1707
01:08:06,719 --> 01:08:10,739
it comes out the type of smoke that you

1708
01:08:09,059 --> 01:08:12,298
want

1709
01:08:10,739 --> 01:08:13,679
and there's a number of different ways

1710
01:08:12,298 --> 01:08:15,298
to achieve that

1711
01:08:13,679 --> 01:08:16,738
and everyone wants to think oh I grow

1712
01:08:15,298 --> 01:08:17,759
organic so I'm better than every salt

1713
01:08:16,738 --> 01:08:21,059
grower

1714
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:22,920
I've grown a lot of organic and it's not

1715
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:25,380
always as nice

1716
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:27,960
you know and then I've grown organic

1717
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:29,039
that I don't think salt could ever be as

1718
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:32,100
good as

1719
01:08:29,039 --> 01:08:34,920
yeah certainly look a very balanced

1720
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:37,140
comment there I um I can certainly agree

1721
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:38,520
no one size fits all and it's it's

1722
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:41,219
interesting to hear you got experience

1723
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:42,960
on both sides of the the table I'm I'm

1724
01:08:41,219 --> 01:08:45,259
actually considering doing some more

1725
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:49,439
salt experiments myself in the future

1726
01:08:45,259 --> 01:08:51,420
did did I talk about on the previous one

1727
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:54,059
did we talk about the experiments I did

1728
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:56,039
with salt and organic side by side I

1729
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:57,779
can't remember why not let's touch on it

1730
01:08:56,039 --> 01:08:59,519
well let's let's chat about it because

1731
01:08:57,779 --> 01:09:02,060
you you brought it up there was a there

1732
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:02,060
was a time

1733
01:09:02,219 --> 01:09:08,819
um where for about five years or so I

1734
01:09:04,738 --> 01:09:12,119
had a section in an indoor okay

1735
01:09:08,819 --> 01:09:14,460
um that I would grow the exact same

1736
01:09:12,119 --> 01:09:16,920
strain

1737
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:19,500
uh under the same type of lighting same

1738
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:23,100
condition same everything and one would

1739
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:24,539
be the best salt and additives regimen I

1740
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:26,900
could come up with

1741
01:09:24,539 --> 01:09:30,960
and the other would be the absolute

1742
01:09:26,899 --> 01:09:33,719
headiest organic I could think of

1743
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:37,020
and I'm talking like I would I I owned a

1744
01:09:33,719 --> 01:09:39,719
cement mixer I mixed all my own soil and

1745
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:41,520
inputs you know what I'm saying like I I

1746
01:09:39,719 --> 01:09:44,338
went to all my friends and we like we

1747
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:46,880
would try to come up with the nicest and

1748
01:09:44,338 --> 01:09:49,619
and what I would do is I would grow

1749
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:52,798
strains I was very familiar with three

1750
01:09:49,619 --> 01:09:54,960
four different strains and you know they

1751
01:09:52,798 --> 01:09:57,960
would be grown in the same room at the

1752
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:59,760
same time some of them were organic some

1753
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:01,859
of them were salt

1754
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:04,020
and

1755
01:10:01,859 --> 01:10:05,639
then I would take it and I would roll

1756
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:07,500
joints

1757
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:09,539
and I would sit down with my friends and

1758
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:11,880
we'd have a sesh

1759
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:14,399
and people would just smoke joints and I

1760
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:19,140
would ask their opinion

1761
01:10:14,399 --> 01:10:21,059
and often sometimes people preferred the

1762
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:22,860
salt version

1763
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:24,600
which would frustrate the piss out of me

1764
01:10:22,859 --> 01:10:27,119
because I put so much time and energy

1765
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:29,039
and effort into the organic one

1766
01:10:27,119 --> 01:10:32,039
and there was some strains that came out

1767
01:10:29,039 --> 01:10:34,019
better organic every time

1768
01:10:32,039 --> 01:10:35,880
there was some strains that came out

1769
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:39,420
better

1770
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:43,859
um you know salt almost every time

1771
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:45,359
and there was some you know that it you

1772
01:10:43,859 --> 01:10:47,339
know you change certain things and it

1773
01:10:45,359 --> 01:10:49,859
kind of depended and so I did these

1774
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:52,980
experiments where because it's like most

1775
01:10:49,859 --> 01:10:55,679
people grow one style at a time

1776
01:10:52,979 --> 01:10:58,079
and then you don't actually get side by

1777
01:10:55,679 --> 01:10:59,699
sides you like are basing enough memory

1778
01:10:58,079 --> 01:11:01,439
or other things

1779
01:10:59,698 --> 01:11:03,299
and so I grew the same five or six

1780
01:11:01,439 --> 01:11:04,678
strains you know for a number of years

1781
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:06,000
because it was like some of my favorite

1782
01:11:04,679 --> 01:11:07,980
smoke

1783
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,960
and I would constantly at parties and

1784
01:11:07,979 --> 01:11:11,039
stuff I'd have them labeled a b you know

1785
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:12,899
whatever

1786
01:11:11,039 --> 01:11:14,880
and people wouldn't know

1787
01:11:12,899 --> 01:11:18,658
and I would have friends

1788
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:20,880
that swore that they could taste

1789
01:11:18,658 --> 01:11:23,219
when they smoked salt weed

1790
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:24,719
that couldn't pick out which one was the

1791
01:11:23,219 --> 01:11:26,819
chem

1792
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:29,698
when I gave it to them

1793
01:11:26,819 --> 01:11:31,079
they couldn't in a blind taste test you

1794
01:11:29,698 --> 01:11:32,698
know they could not

1795
01:11:31,079 --> 01:11:34,380
right

1796
01:11:32,698 --> 01:11:36,658
um and there was so there was certain

1797
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:39,000
things that I found were much harder to

1798
01:11:36,658 --> 01:11:41,099
feed organically than Salt

1799
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,899
and as a result of that if you don't

1800
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:44,760
feed the plant everything that it wants

1801
01:11:42,899 --> 01:11:45,479
when it wants it it's not going to be as

1802
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:47,820
good

1803
01:11:45,479 --> 01:11:49,979
I was gonna say do you think that plays

1804
01:11:47,819 --> 01:11:52,738
into the idea of like how some people

1805
01:11:49,979 --> 01:11:55,139
say well if the original clone was like

1806
01:11:52,738 --> 01:11:57,779
Fino hunted in soil like it's always

1807
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:59,520
gonna like that that was the ground in

1808
01:11:57,779 --> 01:12:01,019
which it proved best if they did the

1809
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:02,280
final hunting rock well it might not

1810
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:04,260
have been as good do you think there's

1811
01:12:02,279 --> 01:12:05,698
much Merit to that or it's like a good

1812
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:08,699
plan it's a good plant

1813
01:12:05,698 --> 01:12:11,219
I think there's some Merit to it and I

1814
01:12:08,698 --> 01:12:14,519
also think that if you're Fino hunting

1815
01:12:11,219 --> 01:12:18,179
and you're giving everything one shot

1816
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:20,400
right the bigger Fino hunt the harder it

1817
01:12:18,179 --> 01:12:22,380
is to taste test and actually make a

1818
01:12:20,399 --> 01:12:25,738
good determination

1819
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:28,679
and then what happens if you are

1820
01:12:25,738 --> 01:12:32,099
feeding if you know what happens if one

1821
01:12:28,679 --> 01:12:34,859
strain wants more food than another

1822
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:36,780
but you're feeding it all the same and

1823
01:12:34,859 --> 01:12:38,759
then so one of them is hungry and

1824
01:12:36,779 --> 01:12:40,859
doesn't come out as nice and one of them

1825
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:43,860
is getting plenty of food and comes out

1826
01:12:40,859 --> 01:12:45,059
nicer because it was fed better

1827
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:48,658
um it's one of the things that makes

1828
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:51,179
Fino hunting hard is you know you know

1829
01:12:48,658 --> 01:12:53,039
the smaller Fino hunt the better the

1830
01:12:51,179 --> 01:12:56,100
judgment

1831
01:12:53,039 --> 01:12:58,019
the bigger Fino hunt the harder it is to

1832
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:59,159
give each plant individually what it

1833
01:12:58,020 --> 01:13:01,679
might need

1834
01:12:59,158 --> 01:13:04,920
because if you're honestly like I'll put

1835
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:07,500
this in a in a different context

1836
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:09,779
um I have charts you know of like the

1837
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:11,579
strains that I have and one of the

1838
01:13:09,779 --> 01:13:13,800
filters that I apply to them is whether

1839
01:13:11,579 --> 01:13:14,880
they're a light a medium or a heavy

1840
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:17,039
feeder

1841
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:19,140
because I've done things like I've done

1842
01:13:17,039 --> 01:13:20,760
light depths and stuff in the 215 era

1843
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:23,940
where I'm feeding everything the same

1844
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:24,719
and then this plant's hungry so I upped

1845
01:13:23,939 --> 01:13:26,819
the food

1846
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:28,859
and now I'm slightly burning these other

1847
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:30,059
plants because they don't need that high

1848
01:13:28,859 --> 01:13:32,039
level of food

1849
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:34,679
so then I realized it was actually kind

1850
01:13:32,039 --> 01:13:35,939
of important to group strains that fed

1851
01:13:34,679 --> 01:13:37,500
the same

1852
01:13:35,939 --> 01:13:39,299
it was really important to do that

1853
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:41,100
because if you put something that

1854
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:43,140
doesn't need much food

1855
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:45,480
like say a cookie

1856
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:46,260
next is something that wants to eat a

1857
01:13:45,479 --> 01:13:48,718
lot

1858
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:50,520
like a camera a sour

1859
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:53,279
one of them is going to by Nature be

1860
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:54,780
unhappy you know what I'm saying

1861
01:13:53,279 --> 01:13:57,779
yeah

1862
01:13:54,779 --> 01:13:58,500
so you kind of have to like

1863
01:13:57,779 --> 01:14:00,539
um

1864
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:02,158
you know I I mean there was there's

1865
01:14:00,539 --> 01:14:04,140
there was times too like some of the

1866
01:14:02,158 --> 01:14:07,439
best herb I ever grew

1867
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:09,600
was I gave everything like really light

1868
01:14:07,439 --> 01:14:12,960
salts

1869
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:15,000
and then everything was in organic soil

1870
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:17,520
and then the stuff that needed more food

1871
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:20,100
I top dressed

1872
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:21,840
well I had that good

1873
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:23,640
it went really like I said it's some of

1874
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:26,940
the you know it allowed me to

1875
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:28,739
individually you know individually deal

1876
01:14:26,939 --> 01:14:30,960
with different strains

1877
01:14:28,738 --> 01:14:32,158
and so the light feeders just got light

1878
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:34,500
food

1879
01:14:32,158 --> 01:14:36,359
the heavy feeders maybe I would top

1880
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:37,979
dress some different organic stuff on

1881
01:14:36,359 --> 01:14:40,259
them once every week or 10 days and then

1882
01:14:37,979 --> 01:14:42,479
when they got watered that water would

1883
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:44,159
hit that top dress and go down and they

1884
01:14:42,479 --> 01:14:46,079
would get more food

1885
01:14:44,158 --> 01:14:46,859
that's cool I haven't heard of that I

1886
01:14:46,079 --> 01:14:48,179
would have thought you would have done

1887
01:14:46,859 --> 01:14:50,460
it the other way but yeah that's really

1888
01:14:48,179 --> 01:14:53,158
interesting you know well because it's

1889
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:56,158
like it's way easier to it's way easier

1890
01:14:53,158 --> 01:14:59,099
to get every Everything a light dose

1891
01:14:56,158 --> 01:15:00,899
and then the up individual beds or pots

1892
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:02,520
or something with the stuff that needs

1893
01:15:00,899 --> 01:15:05,039
more

1894
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:06,719
than it is to give everything heavy dose

1895
01:15:05,039 --> 01:15:09,359
because there's already some things that

1896
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:11,219
don't want that much food

1897
01:15:09,359 --> 01:15:13,019
um yeah

1898
01:15:11,219 --> 01:15:14,219
I mean and then the other part comes

1899
01:15:13,020 --> 01:15:16,440
it's like

1900
01:15:14,219 --> 01:15:18,000
you know if you're growing things and

1901
01:15:16,439 --> 01:15:19,919
you're doing it you know on a certain

1902
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:22,738
level it's like what happens when you've

1903
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:24,779
got strains that are eight weeks and

1904
01:15:22,738 --> 01:15:27,059
you're growing in them off the same

1905
01:15:24,779 --> 01:15:28,920
reservoirs and stuff that on plants that

1906
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:31,080
need 11 weeks

1907
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:33,899
no flush for the plan two one eight

1908
01:15:31,079 --> 01:15:35,640
weeks you need you know you need some

1909
01:15:33,899 --> 01:15:38,099
flexibility in there to be able to give

1910
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:41,159
the individual strain what it wants

1911
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:43,320
I might want to be backing off food on

1912
01:15:41,158 --> 01:15:44,279
this strain because it's done at 6 56

1913
01:15:43,319 --> 01:15:46,380
days

1914
01:15:44,279 --> 01:15:49,139
but this other thing is going to take 75

1915
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:50,760
and I can't back off at 50 at when I

1916
01:15:49,140 --> 01:15:52,500
back off the other one I need to feed it

1917
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:55,619
for a few more weeks

1918
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:57,840
before I start to taper so you know

1919
01:15:55,619 --> 01:15:58,738
actually I'll tell you I'll tell you a

1920
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:59,520
story

1921
01:15:58,738 --> 01:16:02,759
um

1922
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:05,100
I was Consulting on a a bigger Farm down

1923
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:07,800
in uh in Southern California

1924
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:09,480
and you know I was dealing with these

1925
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:11,159
big AG guys

1926
01:16:09,479 --> 01:16:13,198
and they thought what we were doing was

1927
01:16:11,158 --> 01:16:15,299
nuts because what they would do on a

1928
01:16:13,198 --> 01:16:17,539
farm like say a farm of blueberries or

1929
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:21,179
something is they would grow one variety

1930
01:16:17,539 --> 01:16:24,658
unlike 40 acres and they would take Leaf

1931
01:16:21,179 --> 01:16:27,899
samples and they would dial in what that

1932
01:16:24,658 --> 01:16:30,059
one varietal needed exactly in nutrition

1933
01:16:27,899 --> 01:16:32,158
but the idea that like the California

1934
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:33,480
Market required us to grow like 80

1935
01:16:32,158 --> 01:16:35,519
different things

1936
01:16:33,479 --> 01:16:37,439
they were like how do you dial that in

1937
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:39,239
how do you figure that out how can you

1938
01:16:37,439 --> 01:16:40,979
feed the right way how can you give the

1939
01:16:39,238 --> 01:16:42,839
plants what they want

1940
01:16:40,979 --> 01:16:44,279
you know

1941
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:46,819
um so

1942
01:16:44,279 --> 01:16:49,800
it becomes tough like

1943
01:16:46,819 --> 01:16:51,599
sometimes I'll tell people if they're

1944
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:53,460
trying to grow

1945
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:55,860
a whole bunch of different style a whole

1946
01:16:53,460 --> 01:16:59,119
bunch of different plants maybe the best

1947
01:16:55,859 --> 01:17:01,979
way to grow is pots because you can

1948
01:16:59,119 --> 01:17:03,840
individualize the watering you know

1949
01:17:01,979 --> 01:17:06,238
that's not even talking about how fast

1950
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:07,860
things drink versus not right because

1951
01:17:06,238 --> 01:17:08,879
things don't even have the same root

1952
01:17:07,859 --> 01:17:10,979
systems

1953
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:13,920
so there can be times when like if I

1954
01:17:10,979 --> 01:17:16,619
grow say like sour diesel next to next

1955
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:19,920
to OG Kush I'll have to water the sour

1956
01:17:16,619 --> 01:17:22,260
diesel twice as much as I do the Kush

1957
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:23,399
or twice as often

1958
01:17:22,260 --> 01:17:26,699
right

1959
01:17:23,399 --> 01:17:28,319
so if I have them in the same bed

1960
01:17:26,698 --> 01:17:30,719
one of them is either getting under or

1961
01:17:28,319 --> 01:17:32,579
over watered yeah

1962
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:33,719
just the way it works

1963
01:17:32,579 --> 01:17:35,698
so

1964
01:17:33,719 --> 01:17:37,800
figuring out what your plant needs for

1965
01:17:35,698 --> 01:17:39,479
water and food and all that different

1966
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:41,279
types of stuff you'll kind of how I'll

1967
01:17:39,479 --> 01:17:43,019
have to piece it together

1968
01:17:41,279 --> 01:17:44,158
and if you're growing like like behind

1969
01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:45,960
you if you're growing in a little tent

1970
01:17:44,158 --> 01:17:47,698
or something like that like it can be

1971
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:50,158
pretty easy

1972
01:17:47,698 --> 01:17:51,839
if you're growing it over you know some

1973
01:17:50,158 --> 01:17:53,939
licenses or some acreage or something

1974
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:55,860
like that it can be a real logistical

1975
01:17:53,939 --> 01:17:59,879
challenge to figure out

1976
01:17:55,859 --> 01:18:02,279
what to group together and why yeah

1977
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:04,560
certainly sounds like there's a good

1978
01:18:02,279 --> 01:18:07,738
couple of episodes in that topic alone

1979
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:09,000
ready for you to crank out yeah I mean I

1980
01:18:07,738 --> 01:18:10,919
told it to me I was like man I'm gonna

1981
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:14,520
go I'm going to ramble just because it's

1982
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:17,699
like so big of a subject but

1983
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:19,920
um and in a nutshell it's paying

1984
01:18:17,698 --> 01:18:22,019
attention to the plants you grow

1985
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:25,020
and trying to figure out what they need

1986
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:27,000
when and figuring out are they heavy

1987
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:29,640
feeders are they light feeders do they

1988
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:32,698
need something specific you know do they

1989
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:34,980
need you know to do they

1990
01:18:32,698 --> 01:18:37,439
you know all that kind of stuff plays

1991
01:18:34,979 --> 01:18:40,859
into it and so the more things you grow

1992
01:18:37,439 --> 01:18:43,079
the more complex that becomes

1993
01:18:40,859 --> 01:18:45,299
and the bigger size you grow the more

1994
01:18:43,079 --> 01:18:47,158
complex that becomes

1995
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:48,420
so you got you know you got a tent or

1996
01:18:47,158 --> 01:18:49,500
you got a little four lighter or

1997
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:51,960
something like that you can probably

1998
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:54,899
give a lot of individual attention

1999
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:58,380
yeah hugely but you start growing in

2000
01:18:54,899 --> 01:18:59,759
bigger levels and you really it makes a

2001
01:18:58,380 --> 01:19:01,980
big difference because it's like I've

2002
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:04,500
definitely grown things where certain

2003
01:19:01,979 --> 01:19:07,500
strains are hungry and certain strains

2004
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:10,319
are burning from too much food

2005
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:12,779
and now how do I like how do I give this

2006
01:19:10,319 --> 01:19:13,920
plant these plants less and these plants

2007
01:19:12,779 --> 01:19:15,840
more

2008
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:19,440
because that's what they need

2009
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:20,880
yeah certainly it does there's a lot of

2010
01:19:19,439 --> 01:19:22,379
value in what you say grooving them

2011
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:24,060
together and I'm sure from those big AG

2012
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:26,880
guys point of view what we do is all

2013
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:29,699
very quite unscientific right

2014
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:32,699
oh I mean I actually think I used to get

2015
01:19:29,698 --> 01:19:34,019
worried about big AG taking us over

2016
01:19:32,698 --> 01:19:37,019
right

2017
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:39,360
they have Decades of a learning curve

2018
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:41,400
and like I said in big AG is used to

2019
01:19:39,359 --> 01:19:43,319
being able to force feed the consumer

2020
01:19:41,399 --> 01:19:45,000
whatever is the most profitable model

2021
01:19:43,319 --> 01:19:47,099
for them

2022
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:51,119
and that's not weed

2023
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:53,219
so they're having a rough go of it

2024
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:54,960
because they're used to like they're

2025
01:19:53,219 --> 01:19:58,020
used to the only consideration is like

2026
01:19:54,960 --> 01:20:01,020
did I get more tons an acre or less

2027
01:19:58,020 --> 01:20:02,640
and that's not weed yeah they don't

2028
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:04,500
understand most of the most of the

2029
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:06,780
little things about weed that lead to

2030
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:08,579
good quality smoke they would consider

2031
01:20:06,779 --> 01:20:09,719
to be an inefficient mess that we need

2032
01:20:08,579 --> 01:20:12,059
to eliminate

2033
01:20:09,719 --> 01:20:13,920
and then you grow boof

2034
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:16,380
that's uh the lot at the end of the

2035
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:20,279
tunnel for the corporate takeover at

2036
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:23,279
least I wanted to chat to you about some

2037
01:20:20,279 --> 01:20:24,119
chem dog stuff but before we go there I

2038
01:20:23,279 --> 01:20:25,500
wanted to do a little something

2039
01:20:24,119 --> 01:20:27,000
different I've never sort of asked this

2040
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:28,439
style of question before but I think

2041
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,899
you're the perfect person to do it with

2042
01:20:28,439 --> 01:20:33,119
so we recently did an episode with skunk

2043
01:20:30,899 --> 01:20:34,619
VA and he made an interesting comment

2044
01:20:33,119 --> 01:20:36,000
later on in the episode where he

2045
01:20:34,619 --> 01:20:38,519
basically said something to the effect

2046
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:40,500
of I don't really engage in the internet

2047
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:43,320
detective work I don't think there's

2048
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:45,840
much value in that now given both you

2049
01:20:43,319 --> 01:20:47,819
and I have podcasts that very much

2050
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:49,860
engage in the internet detective work

2051
01:20:47,819 --> 01:20:52,139
I'm going to state that up front that we

2052
01:20:49,859 --> 01:20:54,599
might have some bias here but I would

2053
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:57,239
love to hear you both Steel Man and

2054
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:59,159
straw man this statement so what could

2055
01:20:57,238 --> 01:21:01,139
you say that would sort of say yeah

2056
01:20:59,158 --> 01:21:02,698
there's that's true and then on the

2057
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:04,739
other hand what could you say that is

2058
01:21:02,698 --> 01:21:07,319
like well I like that doesn't

2059
01:21:04,738 --> 01:21:09,000
encapsulate the whole story

2060
01:21:07,319 --> 01:21:10,679
boy

2061
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,939
um it's a little bit of a loaded

2062
01:21:10,679 --> 01:21:15,539
question but

2063
01:21:11,939 --> 01:21:17,219
uh I would say that

2064
01:21:15,539 --> 01:21:20,519
um the reason

2065
01:21:17,219 --> 01:21:22,920
why we have everything that we have as

2066
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:26,159
humans is curiosity

2067
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:29,880
right curiosity is what is what drives

2068
01:21:26,158 --> 01:21:31,738
us you know uh inventions pushing things

2069
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:36,719
forward

2070
01:21:31,738 --> 01:21:38,939
um you know and so there is a you know I

2071
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:40,079
talked about earlier on the show okay

2072
01:21:38,939 --> 01:21:43,019
how

2073
01:21:40,079 --> 01:21:44,819
there's a small conjugate of weed nerds

2074
01:21:43,020 --> 01:21:47,340
that like you know dives into this stuff

2075
01:21:44,819 --> 01:21:50,219
super deep and there's a larger group of

2076
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:52,260
weed growers that just doesn't care

2077
01:21:50,219 --> 01:21:55,560
that might be

2078
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:58,679
a division right there

2079
01:21:55,560 --> 01:22:01,440
you know in the sense that we're trying

2080
01:21:58,679 --> 01:22:04,380
to unearth you know we're interested in

2081
01:22:01,439 --> 01:22:06,059
history you and I uh we're interested in

2082
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:09,119
getting a lot of this like oral history

2083
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:11,039
that could be lost you know down on on

2084
01:22:09,119 --> 01:22:13,319
recordings perhaps or getting different

2085
01:22:11,039 --> 01:22:17,760
viewpoints before they're they're lost

2086
01:22:13,319 --> 01:22:20,698
to time because it's the it's the world

2087
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:23,579
that we're in and most of what happened

2088
01:22:20,698 --> 01:22:26,639
happened underground and it isn't

2089
01:22:23,579 --> 01:22:29,460
written down anywhere and it's all it

2090
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:33,360
could be lost you know and so we have

2091
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:34,619
this interest in delving into this

2092
01:22:33,359 --> 01:22:36,960
curiosity

2093
01:22:34,619 --> 01:22:39,300
and trying to find

2094
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:42,119
every little bit we can

2095
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:45,719
about the history of something

2096
01:22:42,119 --> 01:22:48,238
and for a lot of people the history is

2097
01:22:45,719 --> 01:22:50,279
sort of not relevant

2098
01:22:48,238 --> 01:22:51,479
you know like maybe you know I'm not

2099
01:22:50,279 --> 01:22:52,979
going to speak for him or anything like

2100
01:22:51,479 --> 01:22:54,119
that but like maybe he's going to be is

2101
01:22:52,979 --> 01:22:55,559
like well it doesn't put any more money

2102
01:22:54,119 --> 01:22:57,599
in my pocket

2103
01:22:55,560 --> 01:23:00,300
how does it affect like how does how

2104
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:02,039
does like the lineage of chem 91 affect

2105
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:05,100
me today

2106
01:23:02,039 --> 01:23:08,039
it probably doesn't in his mind and

2107
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:10,620
maybe he's not curious about that

2108
01:23:08,039 --> 01:23:12,899
right uh there's nothing wrong with not

2109
01:23:10,619 --> 01:23:15,300
being curious about it

2110
01:23:12,899 --> 01:23:17,339
um you know but

2111
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:19,020
um I think the reason why

2112
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:22,079
you know and it's also interesting too

2113
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:24,000
because if you think about weed Fame

2114
01:23:22,079 --> 01:23:25,319
think about how many people you've

2115
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,000
interviewed

2116
01:23:25,319 --> 01:23:29,759
that you probably interviewed because

2117
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:31,260
they got associated with a famous strain

2118
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:32,820
early on

2119
01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:35,159
right

2120
01:23:32,819 --> 01:23:37,559
and the reason why that matters is

2121
01:23:35,158 --> 01:23:40,139
because people are interested in the

2122
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:41,699
history and they're interested in who

2123
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:44,039
knew what early

2124
01:23:41,698 --> 01:23:46,859
oh if this guy had it early on he

2125
01:23:44,039 --> 01:23:50,819
probably knows more about the real deal

2126
01:23:46,859 --> 01:23:53,039
you see what I'm saying so you know

2127
01:23:50,819 --> 01:23:55,679
like I said there's

2128
01:23:53,039 --> 01:23:57,899
um a lot of people up in Mendo they'll

2129
01:23:55,679 --> 01:23:59,579
be like give me something that the buyer

2130
01:23:57,899 --> 01:24:00,960
wants and I'm gonna grow it and I'm fine

2131
01:23:59,579 --> 01:24:02,939
with that

2132
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:06,960
even on a lot of the hills up here there

2133
01:24:02,939 --> 01:24:09,479
might only be one or two weed nerds

2134
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:13,079
you know uh most people just want to

2135
01:24:09,479 --> 01:24:15,658
crop it and sell it right and you know

2136
01:24:13,079 --> 01:24:17,279
with chemdog specifically

2137
01:24:15,658 --> 01:24:19,679
I think that

2138
01:24:17,279 --> 01:24:22,920
you know he might be right in the sense

2139
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:25,500
that after 30 some years there probably

2140
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:28,199
isn't a lot of new historical

2141
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:30,000
information that's going to come up

2142
01:24:28,198 --> 01:24:31,319
there's also people that have gotten

2143
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,359
famous on it

2144
01:24:31,319 --> 01:24:35,460
and like they're not interested in

2145
01:24:33,359 --> 01:24:36,960
they're they're interested in history in

2146
01:24:35,460 --> 01:24:38,520
the sense of like well if it makes me

2147
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:39,840
look good and it makes me money I'm into

2148
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:41,640
it

2149
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:43,079
if it doesn't then I'm not into it

2150
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:47,039
either

2151
01:24:43,079 --> 01:24:50,579
right and so people get touchy about

2152
01:24:47,039 --> 01:24:52,140
these debates and sometimes

2153
01:24:50,579 --> 01:24:54,359
um and you know I deal with this all the

2154
01:24:52,140 --> 01:24:56,159
time actually is people that were

2155
01:24:54,359 --> 01:24:58,979
involved early

2156
01:24:56,158 --> 01:25:00,719
like not only do they not care

2157
01:24:58,979 --> 01:25:02,459
but they don't want the debate to even

2158
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:04,319
happen

2159
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:06,840
it's sort of like I was there you

2160
01:25:04,319 --> 01:25:09,059
weren't this is what happened

2161
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:10,140
accept it

2162
01:25:09,060 --> 01:25:11,460
right

2163
01:25:10,140 --> 01:25:14,159
and

2164
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:16,198
you know but then there's questions

2165
01:25:14,158 --> 01:25:18,119
because the way that weed happened is

2166
01:25:16,198 --> 01:25:19,619
like most of us were like young Partiers

2167
01:25:18,119 --> 01:25:21,840
and nobody knew that what they were

2168
01:25:19,619 --> 01:25:24,599
doing was going to be famous I mean

2169
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:25,739
think about think about uh chemdog for a

2170
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:26,880
minute

2171
01:25:25,738 --> 01:25:30,779
right

2172
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:31,859
how many 17 year olds popped seeds in

2173
01:25:30,779 --> 01:25:34,920
America

2174
01:25:31,859 --> 01:25:38,519
and never got famous for it

2175
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:39,539
all of them except Kim dog you know I

2176
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:41,520
mean

2177
01:25:39,539 --> 01:25:43,679
and you know you can talk about the sour

2178
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:45,719
diesel thing too where it's like there's

2179
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:47,219
a bunch of young kids

2180
01:25:45,719 --> 01:25:48,719
growing a little bit of weed in their

2181
01:25:47,219 --> 01:25:51,539
closet or with their friend or whatever

2182
01:25:48,719 --> 01:25:54,899
else making these decisions and nobody

2183
01:25:51,539 --> 01:25:56,880
was considering man you know 25 years

2184
01:25:54,899 --> 01:25:58,019
from now all these steps all these

2185
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:00,719
choices I'm making are going to be

2186
01:25:58,020 --> 01:26:03,540
important to a large group of people

2187
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:06,899
so if we let's just cut to the core of

2188
01:26:03,539 --> 01:26:09,658
it do you think that the story that goes

2189
01:26:06,899 --> 01:26:12,539
around online you know that Greg got 13

2190
01:26:09,658 --> 01:26:14,219
seeds do you think that's accurate or do

2191
01:26:12,539 --> 01:26:16,019
you think that's accurate to the best of

2192
01:26:14,219 --> 01:26:19,439
his memory

2193
01:26:16,020 --> 01:26:22,320
um well I'll start by saying I wasn't

2194
01:26:19,439 --> 01:26:24,658
there for any of it so I'm not about to

2195
01:26:22,319 --> 01:26:26,698
say that it didn't happen the way that

2196
01:26:24,658 --> 01:26:27,420
they described it

2197
01:26:26,698 --> 01:26:29,339
um

2198
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:32,340
and what what seems to be generally

2199
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:35,400
agreed is that he bought some weed at

2200
01:26:32,340 --> 01:26:37,500
Deer Creek at a dead show in 91 and then

2201
01:26:35,399 --> 01:26:40,559
he hit dude up and he bought a little

2202
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:43,500
bit more weed that got sent to him it's

2203
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:45,780
never been completely clarified

2204
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:48,960
if all the seeds came out of the first

2205
01:26:45,779 --> 01:26:52,500
or the second batch right

2206
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:56,100
um I don't know if that's 100 percent

2207
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:57,960
certain but it is generally agreed that

2208
01:26:56,100 --> 01:27:01,139
he got two different little batches of

2209
01:26:57,960 --> 01:27:04,439
weed I tend to think that the seeds were

2210
01:27:01,139 --> 01:27:07,139
in the first batch right and you got to

2211
01:27:04,439 --> 01:27:08,519
remember that we know who they came you

2212
01:27:07,139 --> 01:27:10,319
know he bought the weed from Joe brand

2213
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:11,520
and peabud

2214
01:27:10,319 --> 01:27:13,859
okay

2215
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:16,280
but the problem is is that Joe Brandon P

2216
01:27:13,859 --> 01:27:20,599
Bud didn't grow it they were hippies

2217
01:27:16,279 --> 01:27:20,599
buying and selling weed on dead tour

2218
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:24,779
and a lot and they didn't find out that

2219
01:27:22,979 --> 01:27:26,939
anything came in these seeds for

2220
01:27:24,779 --> 01:27:29,179
probably 15 years after they sold the

2221
01:27:26,939 --> 01:27:31,979
bag of wheat

2222
01:27:29,179 --> 01:27:34,319
I mean it's interesting right because

2223
01:27:31,979 --> 01:27:37,198
sometimes I think about that now when

2224
01:27:34,319 --> 01:27:39,059
you say and I I agree in a sense that

2225
01:27:37,198 --> 01:27:41,460
it's very unlikely we'll find out the

2226
01:27:39,060 --> 01:27:43,260
lineage of chemdog now but there is that

2227
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:45,840
little bird in the back of my mind that

2228
01:27:43,260 --> 01:27:48,420
says yeah but Joby and Peabody didn't

2229
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:50,279
know about the chemd for like 10 years I

2230
01:27:48,420 --> 01:27:53,279
mean he might get they might he might

2231
01:27:50,279 --> 01:27:57,979
get mad at me for saying this but

2232
01:27:53,279 --> 01:28:01,139
um I my understanding at least is that

2233
01:27:57,979 --> 01:28:02,579
Joby and Peabody sold the weed to

2234
01:28:01,139 --> 01:28:04,800
chemdog

2235
01:28:02,579 --> 01:28:09,420
and then discovered something came of it

2236
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:10,860
on icmag in the forums say like 040506

2237
01:28:09,420 --> 01:28:13,199
Ashera

2238
01:28:10,859 --> 01:28:16,738
I believe it was it's exactly what you

2239
01:28:13,198 --> 01:28:19,678
said and JJ was online and he was the

2240
01:28:16,738 --> 01:28:21,539
one who linked them back with Greg and

2241
01:28:19,679 --> 01:28:23,639
in fact you know

2242
01:28:21,539 --> 01:28:25,079
um that's kind of why they call they

2243
01:28:23,639 --> 01:28:26,039
used to call like the one through the

2244
01:28:25,079 --> 01:28:28,920
four

2245
01:28:26,039 --> 01:28:31,019
the reunion the reunion batch because it

2246
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:32,819
was like the band got back together

2247
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:35,460
so

2248
01:28:32,819 --> 01:28:37,198
um you know Peabody and Peabody and Joe

2249
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:42,480
B sell this weed

2250
01:28:37,198 --> 01:28:46,019
in 1991 and then 15 14 15 years later

2251
01:28:42,479 --> 01:28:50,099
they hear something came of it

2252
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:52,139
right like people didn't smoke chem 91

2253
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:53,940
until 06.

2254
01:28:52,139 --> 01:28:56,460
yeah there was definitely a big time

2255
01:28:53,939 --> 01:28:57,899
delay and and so there was and that's

2256
01:28:56,460 --> 01:28:59,760
not dissing them or anything like that

2257
01:28:57,899 --> 01:29:02,099
it just means that like

2258
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:03,539
you know they people dead tour brings

2259
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:04,679
people together from all over the

2260
01:29:03,539 --> 01:29:07,139
country

2261
01:29:04,679 --> 01:29:10,139
you know they weren't from that little

2262
01:29:07,139 --> 01:29:13,260
part of of they were significantly older

2263
01:29:10,139 --> 01:29:16,260
than Greg they weren't from that little

2264
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:18,300
part of of Massachusetts that Greg was

2265
01:29:16,260 --> 01:29:20,699
from you know they lived in different

2266
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:22,860
places they met up in on summer tour and

2267
01:29:20,698 --> 01:29:26,219
dude bought a sack

2268
01:29:22,859 --> 01:29:27,420
so let me let me cut to the next

2269
01:29:26,219 --> 01:29:30,300
question that everyone's going to be

2270
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:32,579
wondering then which is that a lot of

2271
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:36,119
people and by a lot I mean a small

2272
01:29:32,579 --> 01:29:38,760
number have suggested that maybe there

2273
01:29:36,119 --> 01:29:41,698
was only four seeds in that first batch

2274
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:43,440
of weed the first iteration of the chems

2275
01:29:41,698 --> 01:29:46,019
we saw which was you know the sister and

2276
01:29:43,439 --> 01:29:47,099
the 91 really and then when they met up

2277
01:29:46,020 --> 01:29:49,620
later

2278
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:51,239
other essential breedings had taken

2279
01:29:49,619 --> 01:29:53,158
place

2280
01:29:51,238 --> 01:29:55,138
um what's your thoughts on that there

2281
01:29:53,158 --> 01:29:56,879
may have only been just four seeds or

2282
01:29:55,139 --> 01:29:58,500
something close to that number

2283
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:59,880
well

2284
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:02,039
um I

2285
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:05,760
there's no doubt that

2286
01:30:02,039 --> 01:30:08,579
you know uh regardless of how many seeds

2287
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:10,560
you think there were they were popped at

2288
01:30:08,579 --> 01:30:11,760
very different times

2289
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:14,039
right

2290
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:16,560
so you know

2291
01:30:14,039 --> 01:30:18,119
I I wasn't there

2292
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:20,940
um but

2293
01:30:18,119 --> 01:30:23,698
I will say that probably the only thing

2294
01:30:20,939 --> 01:30:26,279
that will put this debate to rest

2295
01:30:23,698 --> 01:30:28,259
is if we actually get like genetic

2296
01:30:26,279 --> 01:30:30,599
testing that works

2297
01:30:28,260 --> 01:30:33,239
to where like you can prove if these

2298
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:34,980
things are full sisters or not

2299
01:30:33,238 --> 01:30:37,859
right

2300
01:30:34,979 --> 01:30:40,198
um because the thing is is that you know

2301
01:30:37,859 --> 01:30:42,119
I've talked to you know there's I won't

2302
01:30:40,198 --> 01:30:44,939
say their names or whatever but I do

2303
01:30:42,119 --> 01:30:48,238
think that that chemdog has gotten a

2304
01:30:44,939 --> 01:30:50,460
little a little gun shy about the story

2305
01:30:48,238 --> 01:30:52,198
because no matter what he says he gets

2306
01:30:50,460 --> 01:30:54,539
attacked

2307
01:30:52,198 --> 01:30:57,178
and people are like oh well you said

2308
01:30:54,539 --> 01:30:58,800
this thing on icmag and o5 and it

2309
01:30:57,179 --> 01:31:01,679
doesn't totally line up with what you

2310
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:03,179
said in 2013 and then this doesn't get

2311
01:31:01,679 --> 01:31:06,960
said and that doesn't get said and what

2312
01:31:03,179 --> 01:31:08,100
ends up happening is it ends up

2313
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:10,439
you know

2314
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:14,340
um it just ends up shutting down the

2315
01:31:10,439 --> 01:31:17,158
debate right so all the stories that

2316
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:20,840
I've told you basically came from me

2317
01:31:17,158 --> 01:31:20,839
talking to Staten Island

2318
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:25,800
um and some of the loudest people in

2319
01:31:23,579 --> 01:31:28,019
chem fam online

2320
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:29,639
are you know aren't necessarily people

2321
01:31:28,020 --> 01:31:32,100
that were there when all that stuff

2322
01:31:29,639 --> 01:31:36,300
happened I mean skunk VA he didn't get

2323
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:39,120
he didn't get the the chem until Staten

2324
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:41,340
Island gave it to him right

2325
01:31:39,119 --> 01:31:44,279
um you know uh Peabody was very

2326
01:31:41,340 --> 01:31:46,319
important in the gig he he sold the weed

2327
01:31:44,279 --> 01:31:49,679
but then he didn't get it till years

2328
01:31:46,319 --> 01:31:51,420
late you know until decades later

2329
01:31:49,679 --> 01:31:54,420
um and so you know and then you have a

2330
01:31:51,420 --> 01:31:55,619
situation where you have Greg where

2331
01:31:54,420 --> 01:31:58,380
you know

2332
01:31:55,619 --> 01:32:01,859
um he was a 17 year old kid

2333
01:31:58,380 --> 01:32:03,420
popping some seeds and so maybe I'm not

2334
01:32:01,859 --> 01:32:05,698
answering the question but I will say

2335
01:32:03,420 --> 01:32:08,699
very directly that I think that if it's

2336
01:32:05,698 --> 01:32:11,599
all from the same 13 seeds the only way

2337
01:32:08,698 --> 01:32:15,119
I could possibly see that happening is

2338
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:17,940
if there was multiple phenos which was

2339
01:32:15,119 --> 01:32:21,238
very common back in 1991 the the ounce

2340
01:32:17,939 --> 01:32:22,859
he bought wasn't all this the same weed

2341
01:32:21,238 --> 01:32:27,718
it was mixed weed

2342
01:32:22,859 --> 01:32:30,359
right and that who's to say that all the

2343
01:32:27,719 --> 01:32:32,219
pollen was the same pollen that would be

2344
01:32:30,359 --> 01:32:36,000
the way that Greg and his close friends

2345
01:32:32,219 --> 01:32:40,340
could be absolutely telling the truth

2346
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:44,340
I do not believe the chemd the chem 91

2347
01:32:40,340 --> 01:32:48,600
and the four are full sisters

2348
01:32:44,340 --> 01:32:49,860
I don't I think they're too different

2349
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:51,780
you know

2350
01:32:49,859 --> 01:32:53,460
um and I've grown them all for a long

2351
01:32:51,779 --> 01:32:54,719
time

2352
01:32:53,460 --> 01:32:56,698
um I've had a lot of experience I've

2353
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:59,219
made a lot of seeds with different ones

2354
01:32:56,698 --> 01:33:03,299
of them I've seen their progeny

2355
01:32:59,219 --> 01:33:06,658
I I personally do not do I have proof

2356
01:33:03,300 --> 01:33:08,579
that they're not full sisters no

2357
01:33:06,658 --> 01:33:10,500
but

2358
01:33:08,579 --> 01:33:11,639
um that doesn't mean I'm calling Greg a

2359
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:12,779
liar

2360
01:33:11,639 --> 01:33:16,380
right

2361
01:33:12,779 --> 01:33:17,819
but I I just look at how different they

2362
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:19,739
are and look at how different their

2363
01:33:17,819 --> 01:33:22,079
progeny is when you breed with them and

2364
01:33:19,738 --> 01:33:24,238
look at the different aspects and I just

2365
01:33:22,079 --> 01:33:26,219
don't see

2366
01:33:24,238 --> 01:33:28,500
um them coming from the same exact mom

2367
01:33:26,219 --> 01:33:31,560
and dad

2368
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:33,420
yeah I I certainly agree with you and

2369
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:37,199
the thing that I do always think to

2370
01:33:33,420 --> 01:33:40,739
myself though is that you know often we

2371
01:33:37,198 --> 01:33:42,299
hear the sort of line of like certain

2372
01:33:40,738 --> 01:33:44,519
stories are kept the way they are

2373
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:47,699
because names are tied to it things like

2374
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:51,600
that but then I also think to myself

2375
01:33:47,698 --> 01:33:54,119
like Greg is a glass blower by trade and

2376
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:57,600
I really don't feel like his income is

2377
01:33:54,119 --> 01:33:59,939
necessarily tied to the story so that

2378
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:02,699
sort of helps me to feel like I think

2379
01:33:59,939 --> 01:34:04,738
what he says probably is the truth to

2380
01:34:02,698 --> 01:34:07,859
hit like I don't see why he would have a

2381
01:34:04,738 --> 01:34:09,899
reason to lie per se because he was

2382
01:34:07,859 --> 01:34:11,460
honest right he killed the male from

2383
01:34:09,899 --> 01:34:13,559
that first lot like if you're going to

2384
01:34:11,460 --> 01:34:15,719
be really analytical about it that sort

2385
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:17,580
of makes him seem like oh you know that

2386
01:34:15,719 --> 01:34:19,619
wasn't a good call and he was been

2387
01:34:17,579 --> 01:34:21,420
pretty upfront about that so I don't

2388
01:34:19,619 --> 01:34:23,340
know do you think that there's like

2389
01:34:21,420 --> 01:34:25,020
Merit to that sort of line of thinking

2390
01:34:23,340 --> 01:34:27,360
of well that like it doesn't seem like a

2391
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:29,040
super obvious reason to lie about any of

2392
01:34:27,359 --> 01:34:30,658
it and make me and that's also taking

2393
01:34:29,039 --> 01:34:32,819
into account that maybe like everyone

2394
01:34:30,658 --> 01:34:35,279
his memory is not perfect well your

2395
01:34:32,819 --> 01:34:37,319
memory definitely isn't perfect and you

2396
01:34:35,279 --> 01:34:39,179
got to remember too that like

2397
01:34:37,319 --> 01:34:41,819
I mean

2398
01:34:39,179 --> 01:34:44,699
how do I say this and be polite

2399
01:34:41,819 --> 01:34:48,000
uh

2400
01:34:44,698 --> 01:34:49,678
think about back when you were 17 18 19

2401
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:51,600
20.

2402
01:34:49,679 --> 01:34:53,579
imagine you were a hippie who liked to

2403
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:55,860
go to dead tour and smoke weed and do

2404
01:34:53,579 --> 01:34:58,198
drugs and you're pretty much

2405
01:34:55,859 --> 01:35:00,599
probably mostly into partying and

2406
01:34:58,198 --> 01:35:04,079
chasing girls

2407
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:05,400
right like what was your focus at 17 to

2408
01:35:04,079 --> 01:35:08,399
21

2409
01:35:05,399 --> 01:35:12,119
Hedonism most of us that developed into

2410
01:35:08,399 --> 01:35:14,519
weed nerds weren't weed nerds then

2411
01:35:12,119 --> 01:35:15,539
you know we were trying to have a good

2412
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:19,020
time

2413
01:35:15,539 --> 01:35:22,260
and I think what happened is is that the

2414
01:35:19,020 --> 01:35:24,420
chemd and the chem 91 are two of my

2415
01:35:22,260 --> 01:35:26,100
all-time favorite strains

2416
01:35:24,420 --> 01:35:27,300
and I wouldn't have them if it wasn't

2417
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:33,539
for Greg

2418
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:36,600
so I am very very grateful to Greg for

2419
01:35:33,539 --> 01:35:39,000
as a teenager in an illegal state

2420
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:41,880
taking risks

2421
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:44,639
um and you know but I also think to

2422
01:35:41,880 --> 01:35:46,980
myself because I started growing in 1994

2423
01:35:44,639 --> 01:35:49,440
so a few years after that the level of

2424
01:35:46,979 --> 01:35:52,500
Education the level of knowledge that

2425
01:35:49,439 --> 01:35:54,299
existed back then compared to now was

2426
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:56,520
Tiny

2427
01:35:54,300 --> 01:35:58,920
there was High Times there was a few

2428
01:35:56,520 --> 01:36:01,199
books you mostly didn't know anybody

2429
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:03,060
there was no internet

2430
01:36:01,198 --> 01:36:04,919
there was no way to just get a bunch of

2431
01:36:03,060 --> 01:36:06,900
good information right

2432
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:08,579
and I know stuff that I'm hesitant to

2433
01:36:06,899 --> 01:36:11,399
say

2434
01:36:08,579 --> 01:36:13,500
um just because it it's like you know

2435
01:36:11,399 --> 01:36:14,759
there's a political element to some of

2436
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:17,219
this stuff

2437
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:19,440
you know where what if I say that's the

2438
01:36:17,219 --> 01:36:21,480
truth but all of a sudden you know I got

2439
01:36:19,439 --> 01:36:23,879
you know pea butter skunk VA or somebody

2440
01:36:21,479 --> 01:36:25,198
else or Greg mad at me

2441
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:27,539
you know

2442
01:36:25,198 --> 01:36:29,519
um and you know and but it's not like

2443
01:36:27,539 --> 01:36:32,639
I'm dissing anyone or lying it's like

2444
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:34,560
and it might not be the truth it's

2445
01:36:32,639 --> 01:36:36,659
probably a truth

2446
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:38,340
because let's face it right

2447
01:36:36,658 --> 01:36:40,138
Greg has

2448
01:36:38,340 --> 01:36:41,880
you know I won't name them but Greg has

2449
01:36:40,139 --> 01:36:43,199
some close friends that were like around

2450
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:46,199
him

2451
01:36:43,198 --> 01:36:47,759
when he was popping those seeds

2452
01:36:46,198 --> 01:36:50,759
I wasn't

2453
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:53,159
you know skunk VA was not

2454
01:36:50,760 --> 01:36:54,780
um we encountered the the chem in

2455
01:36:53,158 --> 01:36:58,198
California

2456
01:36:54,779 --> 01:37:00,300
because Staten Island brought it out

2457
01:36:58,198 --> 01:37:02,219
like so

2458
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:03,900
um you know I mean there's you know

2459
01:37:02,219 --> 01:37:05,760
there's people that like everyone would

2460
01:37:03,899 --> 01:37:08,399
consider chem fam

2461
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:10,560
that barely even know each other

2462
01:37:08,399 --> 01:37:13,019
and didn't know each other at all and

2463
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:14,280
had never met back then for long periods

2464
01:37:13,020 --> 01:37:15,780
of time

2465
01:37:14,279 --> 01:37:17,519
so it's like there's different people

2466
01:37:15,779 --> 01:37:18,899
that have different little pieces of

2467
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:21,179
things

2468
01:37:18,899 --> 01:37:23,579
you know so I want to be real careful

2469
01:37:21,179 --> 01:37:24,899
like from California because Staten

2470
01:37:23,579 --> 01:37:29,399
Island told me this stuff and I didn't

2471
01:37:24,899 --> 01:37:31,979
encounter the chems until the late 90s

2472
01:37:29,399 --> 01:37:34,198
which is a long time ago now

2473
01:37:31,979 --> 01:37:36,299
but it's also kind of a long time from

2474
01:37:34,198 --> 01:37:39,000
when those first things were popped

2475
01:37:36,300 --> 01:37:42,060
two right

2476
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:43,380
um you know Matt posted this thing where

2477
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:46,380
we're trying to do this like lineage

2478
01:37:43,380 --> 01:37:48,659
thing and we talked about like potential

2479
01:37:46,380 --> 01:37:51,779
um lineage of the chemd

2480
01:37:48,658 --> 01:37:54,119
right and I was talking I was I was

2481
01:37:51,779 --> 01:37:56,279
talking about it uh you know where I I

2482
01:37:54,119 --> 01:37:58,738
have I've stated before that I think it

2483
01:37:56,279 --> 01:38:00,300
it's reasonably likely that it's it's

2484
01:37:58,738 --> 01:38:03,419
chem skunk

2485
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:05,520
okay and I got and and certain people

2486
01:38:03,420 --> 01:38:07,920
got heated on that right

2487
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:10,260
and then JJ hits me up

2488
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:12,719
right and he goes okay let's say I take

2489
01:38:10,260 --> 01:38:14,940
everything you're saying is true

2490
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:17,219
why does it have to be 91 skunk why

2491
01:38:14,939 --> 01:38:20,399
can't it be sis skunk

2492
01:38:17,219 --> 01:38:22,800
and I was like well crap JJ you're right

2493
01:38:20,399 --> 01:38:25,379
you know it could be

2494
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:28,020
how would we know and so there's a thing

2495
01:38:25,380 --> 01:38:29,880
when philos first came out the way they

2496
01:38:28,020 --> 01:38:32,880
raised all this money from all of us and

2497
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:35,279
collected 300 for test kits was because

2498
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:36,980
there was this Core group of nerds that

2499
01:38:35,279 --> 01:38:39,599
like wanted

2500
01:38:36,979 --> 01:38:41,638
scientific proof that some of these

2501
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:43,860
stories and these lineages were true

2502
01:38:41,639 --> 01:38:45,960
prove or disproven

2503
01:38:43,859 --> 01:38:48,539
and it ended up that they couldn't do

2504
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:51,000
the testing specific enough to give us

2505
01:38:48,539 --> 01:38:54,119
the answers we were craving

2506
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:57,179
right one day we might be able to get

2507
01:38:54,119 --> 01:38:58,738
chem 4 and chemd and chem 91 and what

2508
01:38:57,179 --> 01:39:00,840
not tested

2509
01:38:58,738 --> 01:39:02,099
and genetically it might prove some

2510
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:03,779
things to us

2511
01:39:02,100 --> 01:39:06,360
but until then there's just going to be

2512
01:39:03,779 --> 01:39:07,979
various people you know

2513
01:39:06,359 --> 01:39:09,238
getting mad at each other on the

2514
01:39:07,979 --> 01:39:11,039
internet

2515
01:39:09,238 --> 01:39:13,738
endlessly

2516
01:39:11,039 --> 01:39:15,899
about this [ __ ] right

2517
01:39:13,738 --> 01:39:17,939
um I just as a breeder and a grower and

2518
01:39:15,899 --> 01:39:19,439
I've had a long-term relationship with

2519
01:39:17,939 --> 01:39:22,678
some of these chems

2520
01:39:19,439 --> 01:39:25,919
I honestly think that there's some

2521
01:39:22,679 --> 01:39:27,300
different lineage in there

2522
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:29,520
and I don't I'm not and that doesn't

2523
01:39:27,300 --> 01:39:31,079
mean that it could be as simple as like

2524
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:32,460
let's say that everything that Greg and

2525
01:39:31,079 --> 01:39:34,800
his friends are saying is the absolute

2526
01:39:32,460 --> 01:39:38,340
truth and he has this little

2527
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:39,600
wooden box of seeds that he's collecting

2528
01:39:38,340 --> 01:39:41,039
right and he's got all these different

2529
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:43,320
things labeled

2530
01:39:41,039 --> 01:39:45,238
and he pops you know the story is right

2531
01:39:43,319 --> 01:39:47,158
that he pops five or six four you know

2532
01:39:45,238 --> 01:39:50,698
four five six seeds

2533
01:39:47,158 --> 01:39:53,698
um a b c d e whatever right in 2000. and

2534
01:39:50,698 --> 01:39:57,359
that's where the D came out of

2535
01:39:53,698 --> 01:39:59,759
you know what if you know

2536
01:39:57,359 --> 01:40:02,698
um I don't know you know what if what if

2537
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:05,280
he just grabbed from the wrong bag

2538
01:40:02,698 --> 01:40:07,259
what if it was smudged

2539
01:40:05,279 --> 01:40:09,119
what if he honestly believes that it is

2540
01:40:07,260 --> 01:40:13,820
but it's like he grabbed something that

2541
01:40:09,119 --> 01:40:13,819
was like a hybrid of of chem skunk

2542
01:40:14,039 --> 01:40:18,060
and so it's like he's not lying

2543
01:40:16,979 --> 01:40:20,759
you know

2544
01:40:18,060 --> 01:40:22,800
at all he's totally telling the truth as

2545
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:24,780
best as he recollects

2546
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:26,340
and it just ends up that a few of those

2547
01:40:24,779 --> 01:40:28,259
seeds that he popped weren't from the

2548
01:40:26,340 --> 01:40:29,460
original 13 they were from hybrids that

2549
01:40:28,260 --> 01:40:31,920
got made

2550
01:40:29,460 --> 01:40:33,899
yeah you know

2551
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:35,158
and so

2552
01:40:33,899 --> 01:40:37,979
I don't

2553
01:40:35,158 --> 01:40:40,500
I we were talking earlier on the show

2554
01:40:37,979 --> 01:40:43,678
about if you grow the chemd and the chem

2555
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:45,840
91 side by side the chemd is much more

2556
01:40:43,679 --> 01:40:48,300
attractive

2557
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:51,000
it's much limier green it's much

2558
01:40:48,300 --> 01:40:52,020
frostier you know

2559
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:54,300
um

2560
01:40:52,020 --> 01:40:56,940
uh you know it just looks like a way

2561
01:40:54,300 --> 01:41:00,480
different plant

2562
01:40:56,939 --> 01:41:02,819
I love it you know but if you grew them

2563
01:41:00,479 --> 01:41:04,319
side by side and said you know do you

2564
01:41:02,819 --> 01:41:06,899
think these are full sisters to people

2565
01:41:04,319 --> 01:41:08,460
and they knew nothing of the lineage or

2566
01:41:06,899 --> 01:41:11,099
the history or any of the controversy

2567
01:41:08,460 --> 01:41:13,139
they'd probably say no

2568
01:41:11,100 --> 01:41:14,940
does that prove that they aren't full

2569
01:41:13,139 --> 01:41:16,319
sisters no

2570
01:41:14,939 --> 01:41:19,079
you know but that's what we're doing is

2571
01:41:16,319 --> 01:41:21,000
we're taking 30 year old stories

2572
01:41:19,079 --> 01:41:24,179
from kids

2573
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:26,658
young kids who were Partiers and what

2574
01:41:24,179 --> 01:41:26,658
did they do

2575
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:31,920
you know I do know I will say this and I

2576
01:41:30,779 --> 01:41:33,719
don't know if this has been publicly

2577
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:36,179
said before but I'll say it whatever I

2578
01:41:33,719 --> 01:41:37,679
do know that

2579
01:41:36,179 --> 01:41:40,139
um in

2580
01:41:37,679 --> 01:41:42,539
you know a few years after a little

2581
01:41:40,139 --> 01:41:45,118
while after the exchange happened I know

2582
01:41:42,539 --> 01:41:46,319
that Staten Island and chemdog had a

2583
01:41:45,118 --> 01:41:50,639
conversation

2584
01:41:46,319 --> 01:41:54,479
where chemdog told him that the

2585
01:41:50,639 --> 01:41:57,739
um the skunk had hermed on the chems

2586
01:41:54,479 --> 01:42:01,379
and he had grown up some of these seeds

2587
01:41:57,738 --> 01:42:03,779
and they were unbelievable like he liked

2588
01:42:01,380 --> 01:42:07,739
them better than either of the other two

2589
01:42:03,779 --> 01:42:10,859
hmm that's interesting 100 and that was

2590
01:42:07,738 --> 01:42:13,019
actually statins inspiration for

2591
01:42:10,859 --> 01:42:14,460
starting the Superdog project

2592
01:42:13,020 --> 01:42:16,560
yeah

2593
01:42:14,460 --> 01:42:19,859
we didn't know about reversals back then

2594
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:21,420
we didn't know how to like make the two

2595
01:42:19,859 --> 01:42:24,658
females

2596
01:42:21,420 --> 01:42:26,579
me you know make seed so we had you know

2597
01:42:24,658 --> 01:42:28,500
we had to go it was like a much more

2598
01:42:26,579 --> 01:42:30,899
roundabout way of like how it got

2599
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:34,500
started or whatever but

2600
01:42:30,899 --> 01:42:36,420
um and he he told he told Staten Island

2601
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:38,219
that you know they were filling their

2602
01:42:36,420 --> 01:42:39,779
rooms with these hybrids because they

2603
01:42:38,219 --> 01:42:42,600
were just so much

2604
01:42:39,779 --> 01:42:45,000
frostier and danker and and smelled

2605
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:45,960
amazing and they were running rooms of

2606
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:48,179
it

2607
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:50,939
now granted when he told Staten Island

2608
01:42:48,179 --> 01:42:53,340
this he was probably 21 or 22 years old

2609
01:42:50,939 --> 01:42:56,638
and it was the mid 90s

2610
01:42:53,340 --> 01:42:59,279
yeah look I've got a ton of questions to

2611
01:42:56,639 --> 01:43:01,800
ask but first before it leaves my mind I

2612
01:42:59,279 --> 01:43:04,259
want to give a all honor and credit to

2613
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:06,179
Greg the 17 year old popping you know

2614
01:43:04,260 --> 01:43:07,800
the quintessential cannabis plant you

2615
01:43:06,179 --> 01:43:10,139
know we're all super grateful and we're

2616
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:12,119
all just genuinely curious that's why we

2617
01:43:10,139 --> 01:43:14,340
talk about this stuff I agree with that

2618
01:43:12,118 --> 01:43:17,579
statement a hundred percent uh the

2619
01:43:14,340 --> 01:43:20,159
without him I would not have the chemd

2620
01:43:17,579 --> 01:43:22,439
or the chem 91 and they're literally in

2621
01:43:20,158 --> 01:43:25,618
my all-time favorite list of strains I

2622
01:43:22,439 --> 01:43:28,379
grow and smoke them often uh and my life

2623
01:43:25,618 --> 01:43:31,380
would be diminished without both of them

2624
01:43:28,380 --> 01:43:33,900
so I am incredibly happy that he took

2625
01:43:31,380 --> 01:43:35,940
the risks he did when he was young and

2626
01:43:33,899 --> 01:43:37,679
he did all that type of stuff and I

2627
01:43:35,939 --> 01:43:38,819
honestly think too that it's like I

2628
01:43:37,679 --> 01:43:41,579
don't think this is a negative thing

2629
01:43:38,819 --> 01:43:43,380
with him at all it's it's like he got

2630
01:43:41,579 --> 01:43:45,600
really famous for something

2631
01:43:43,380 --> 01:43:47,219
and I think if you ask them he would

2632
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:49,020
probably tell you that his passion is

2633
01:43:47,219 --> 01:43:52,079
more in glassblowing and other different

2634
01:43:49,020 --> 01:43:53,639
things than it is in actual growing and

2635
01:43:52,079 --> 01:43:55,618
breeding and wheat

2636
01:43:53,639 --> 01:43:57,779
it's not like he didn't do important

2637
01:43:55,618 --> 01:44:01,259
stuff with it but I don't think it's

2638
01:43:57,779 --> 01:44:03,899
like he doesn't have that burning Drive

2639
01:44:01,260 --> 01:44:04,980
yeah because people you know and I don't

2640
01:44:03,899 --> 01:44:07,198
think there's anything wrong with that

2641
01:44:04,979 --> 01:44:10,259
because like people people can have a

2642
01:44:07,198 --> 01:44:12,299
wide range of hobbies yeah truly and I

2643
01:44:10,260 --> 01:44:13,800
think to encapsulate you know sort of

2644
01:44:12,300 --> 01:44:16,260
both our point of views here you know

2645
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:18,719
like all of this comes from a place of

2646
01:44:16,260 --> 01:44:22,260
love for the plant and genuine curiosity

2647
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:25,020
not because we necessarily doubt you or

2648
01:44:22,260 --> 01:44:26,940
anything like that but I wanted to ask

2649
01:44:25,020 --> 01:44:29,820
you a few times it's come up we keep

2650
01:44:26,939 --> 01:44:33,359
saying chem 91 the chemd the chem 91 the

2651
01:44:29,819 --> 01:44:35,759
chemd why do you think the chem 4 isn't

2652
01:44:33,359 --> 01:44:38,399
always in the same breath whenever we

2653
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:40,380
talk about Elite plants 91 and D same

2654
01:44:38,399 --> 01:44:42,658
sentence everyone accepts it they're

2655
01:44:40,380 --> 01:44:44,159
both up there like if you're rating

2656
01:44:42,658 --> 01:44:47,219
plants out of a hundred they're both

2657
01:44:44,158 --> 01:44:49,679
within 95 to 100 somewhere in that area

2658
01:44:47,219 --> 01:44:51,840
you know why what is it about the four

2659
01:44:49,679 --> 01:44:54,658
do you think that doesn't quite leave it

2660
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:55,380
to be the third one

2661
01:44:54,658 --> 01:44:58,319
um

2662
01:44:55,380 --> 01:45:00,800
I would say that

2663
01:44:58,319 --> 01:45:06,059
it's crazy

2664
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:09,300
honestly that the chemd and the chem 91

2665
01:45:06,060 --> 01:45:12,239
are generally regarded as all-time

2666
01:45:09,300 --> 01:45:14,940
greats by a lot of people

2667
01:45:12,238 --> 01:45:17,158
so it's really difficult in in the same

2668
01:45:14,939 --> 01:45:19,198
family to just keep adding all-time

2669
01:45:17,158 --> 01:45:22,799
greats

2670
01:45:19,198 --> 01:45:24,719
you know statistically even having two

2671
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:27,300
of them come like that is probably

2672
01:45:24,719 --> 01:45:28,020
unusual right

2673
01:45:27,300 --> 01:45:31,079
um

2674
01:45:28,020 --> 01:45:34,139
you know the four I think the four has

2675
01:45:31,079 --> 01:45:37,019
two things going for it that make a lot

2676
01:45:34,139 --> 01:45:41,279
of people not not maybe get the full

2677
01:45:37,020 --> 01:45:44,280
thing out of it one is is that the best

2678
01:45:41,279 --> 01:45:45,899
four is usually taken about 12 plus

2679
01:45:44,279 --> 01:45:48,118
weeks

2680
01:45:45,899 --> 01:45:51,238
84-ish days

2681
01:45:48,118 --> 01:45:53,939
it looks done before that but it's

2682
01:45:51,238 --> 01:45:55,678
really done around 12 plus weeks

2683
01:45:53,939 --> 01:45:57,238
there's a lot of Growers that won't take

2684
01:45:55,679 --> 01:46:02,399
it 12 weeks

2685
01:45:57,238 --> 01:46:04,500
so you take it 10 weeks it's not as good

2686
01:46:02,399 --> 01:46:06,658
right the other thing that happens to

2687
01:46:04,500 --> 01:46:10,979
the four that makes people have an issue

2688
01:46:06,658 --> 01:46:13,618
with it is that it cures to a

2689
01:46:10,979 --> 01:46:16,678
are golden

2690
01:46:13,618 --> 01:46:18,179
a little bit of a light brown at times

2691
01:46:16,679 --> 01:46:20,819
and in weed

2692
01:46:18,179 --> 01:46:23,219
when it comes to Brokers or consumers or

2693
01:46:20,819 --> 01:46:25,019
whatever else anything that goes a

2694
01:46:23,219 --> 01:46:28,739
little golden or a little brown or a

2695
01:46:25,020 --> 01:46:31,080
little yellow that means you messed up

2696
01:46:28,738 --> 01:46:32,638
they just don't accept that some weed

2697
01:46:31,079 --> 01:46:35,760
does that

2698
01:46:32,639 --> 01:46:39,900
that it oxidizes a little bit that way

2699
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:44,960
those colors are associated with old bad

2700
01:46:39,899 --> 01:46:44,960
burnt messed up not good

2701
01:46:45,179 --> 01:46:51,199
just as a general rule so the fact that

2702
01:46:48,899 --> 01:46:54,179
chemd tends to go a little golden brown

2703
01:46:51,198 --> 01:46:57,719
after it cures a bit

2704
01:46:54,179 --> 01:46:59,399
visually it's a big Downer for people so

2705
01:46:57,719 --> 01:47:01,920
you get something that's a little off

2706
01:46:59,399 --> 01:47:05,579
you get something that's harvested 10 or

2707
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:07,380
14 days before it needs to be it's not

2708
01:47:05,579 --> 01:47:09,359
going to be as good

2709
01:47:07,380 --> 01:47:10,560
that being said

2710
01:47:09,359 --> 01:47:13,259
you know

2711
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:16,020
um the I think the four

2712
01:47:13,260 --> 01:47:17,280
I think the four has some nl5 Haze in it

2713
01:47:16,020 --> 01:47:21,179
or something like that I don't know

2714
01:47:17,279 --> 01:47:23,519
because it it's got these big long colas

2715
01:47:21,179 --> 01:47:25,260
it stretches like a champ it takes

2716
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:26,820
forever

2717
01:47:25,260 --> 01:47:29,159
um you know you grow the D It's like a

2718
01:47:26,819 --> 01:47:31,618
short squat Afghan it takes a while to

2719
01:47:29,158 --> 01:47:34,859
get going it's pretty much done at nine

2720
01:47:31,618 --> 01:47:36,658
weeks there's a variety of people that

2721
01:47:34,859 --> 01:47:38,698
pull it but it mostly gets pulled in the

2722
01:47:36,658 --> 01:47:41,219
early to mid 60s I would say some people

2723
01:47:38,698 --> 01:47:43,859
pull it in the high 50s Maybe

2724
01:47:41,219 --> 01:47:46,079
and the four really takes I mean it

2725
01:47:43,859 --> 01:47:48,238
takes a full 12 weeks

2726
01:47:46,079 --> 01:47:50,819
there's not very many strains that

2727
01:47:48,238 --> 01:47:53,279
people are willing to take 12 weeks

2728
01:47:50,819 --> 01:47:55,500
this isn't a chem thing but the amount

2729
01:47:53,279 --> 01:47:58,979
of people that would pull sour around

2730
01:47:55,500 --> 01:48:00,658
here 10 days 14 days early because it

2731
01:47:58,979 --> 01:48:02,638
had the nose and it was good enough to

2732
01:48:00,658 --> 01:48:04,920
go

2733
01:48:02,639 --> 01:48:06,779
a lot of Growers don't like going over

2734
01:48:04,920 --> 01:48:08,579
eight nine weeks

2735
01:48:06,779 --> 01:48:11,158
10 weeks on the outside you start

2736
01:48:08,579 --> 01:48:12,899
getting into 11 12 13 weeks they're like

2737
01:48:11,158 --> 01:48:16,259
what are you doing

2738
01:48:12,899 --> 01:48:18,000
I do not want to grow weed that long

2739
01:48:16,260 --> 01:48:20,100
and so I think that's

2740
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:22,500
I think most people don't take the four

2741
01:48:20,100 --> 01:48:24,360
long enough

2742
01:48:22,500 --> 01:48:25,859
um and I also think that it's got a

2743
01:48:24,359 --> 01:48:28,319
little bit more of that like Zippy

2744
01:48:25,859 --> 01:48:29,399
sativa high and like you smoke enough of

2745
01:48:28,319 --> 01:48:32,279
it it kind of gives you like a little

2746
01:48:29,399 --> 01:48:35,399
raciness in your chest and it's a very

2747
01:48:32,279 --> 01:48:37,698
different Buzz than how the chemd and

2748
01:48:35,399 --> 01:48:40,138
how the dog hits you

2749
01:48:37,698 --> 01:48:42,779
maybe I should say this just before I

2750
01:48:40,139 --> 01:48:45,118
forget but uh did anyone ever tell you

2751
01:48:42,779 --> 01:48:47,039
the reason why we all call it the dog

2752
01:48:45,118 --> 01:48:50,099
because it makes you roll on the ground

2753
01:48:47,039 --> 01:48:54,238
like a dog or something no

2754
01:48:50,100 --> 01:48:55,380
no because when Statin Island brought it

2755
01:48:54,238 --> 01:48:57,658
West

2756
01:48:55,380 --> 01:48:58,980
he was a hundred percent fully organic

2757
01:48:57,658 --> 01:49:00,539
grower

2758
01:48:58,979 --> 01:49:02,099
and he didn't want to call any weed that

2759
01:49:00,539 --> 01:49:06,658
he grew chem

2760
01:49:02,100 --> 01:49:10,980
so he shortened it to the dog yeah okay

2761
01:49:06,658 --> 01:49:14,759
him dog you know he's your your organic

2762
01:49:10,979 --> 01:49:17,399
chem dog you know it's chem and so as a

2763
01:49:14,760 --> 01:49:19,199
nickname uh the four or five of us or

2764
01:49:17,399 --> 01:49:21,779
whatever who had it out here

2765
01:49:19,198 --> 01:49:25,019
I will tell you that like me I see

2766
01:49:21,779 --> 01:49:27,599
Collective Staten Island skunk VA

2767
01:49:25,020 --> 01:49:30,540
I never heard any like in the in in that

2768
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:32,699
era the late 90s early 2000s before the

2769
01:49:30,539 --> 01:49:36,420
forums or whatever we all just called it

2770
01:49:32,698 --> 01:49:38,279
dog or the dog yeah that was what we

2771
01:49:36,420 --> 01:49:39,779
call it was the dog

2772
01:49:38,279 --> 01:49:42,179
you know

2773
01:49:39,779 --> 01:49:43,979
um we never called it chem dog

2774
01:49:42,179 --> 01:49:45,840
I mean we I knew obviously that that's

2775
01:49:43,979 --> 01:49:47,939
what like its full name

2776
