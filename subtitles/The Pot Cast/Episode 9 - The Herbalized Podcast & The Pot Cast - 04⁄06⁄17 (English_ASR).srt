hello welcome to the next episode of the

2
00:00:08,789 --> 00:00:14,968
podcast a cannabis podcast the party

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,010
enthusiasts this episode as always was

4
00:00:14,968 --> 00:00:21,059
brought to us by regular sponsors 420

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:22,769
Australia n OGS this episode is a little

6
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:25,079
different to normal we'll be going over

7
00:00:22,768 --> 00:00:26,579
some details for the next-gen Kanaka as

8
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:28,919
well as some australia related issues in

9
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:30,448
jam my apologies to our international

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:40,739
friends for this episode is not as

11
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:44,429
interesting to them let's talk about

12
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:46,229
what inspired the the next-gen Kanaka

13
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:50,189
and kind of how long it's been in the

14
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:53,968
works so in terms of how long it's been

15
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:55,979
in the works we've been thinking about

16
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:57,230
it for probably about the best part of 6

17
00:00:55,979 --> 00:00:59,968
months

18
00:00:57,229 --> 00:01:01,500
the reason was simple it was it all

19
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:04,049
started with the idea of like well how

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,900
can we progress the same yep from our

21
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:09,000
end at least as growers the idea was

22
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,100
simple it was like the biggest problem I

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,709
have is like I see lots of people

24
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:15,000
putting like their hard

25
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:16,469
resources and time into growing things

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,688
and they're just not growing good

27
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:21,750
genetics in my opinion and so yeah you

28
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:23,339
know you could really just not have to

29
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,930
put any more effort in and just get a

30
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,868
substantially better product just by

31
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,610
changing the genetics you know so I try

32
00:01:27,868 --> 00:01:32,310
to stress that to people but people

33
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:33,840
often get very kind of attached to their

34
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,978
choice in genetics and I understand why

35
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,390
it's because like you know before you

36
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:38,250
ever buy seeds you do a little bit of

37
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,570
research and you kind of decide the ones

38
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,368
you've won you're like yeah that's the

39
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:42,959
right choice and so someone to come

40
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:44,430
along and be like no that's wrong I

41
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,438
understand if you're going to get

42
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,630
defensive at that yeah for sure there's

43
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:50,219
a bit of a go there yes so like so what

44
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:52,379
we thought was well like how can we get

45
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:54,478
just genetics into the hands of people

46
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:55,368
and not be like ramming it down their

47
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:59,129
throats

48
00:01:55,368 --> 00:02:00,780
and so we thought yeah well like we we

49
00:01:59,129 --> 00:02:03,298
want to have a cup but like truth be

50
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,680
told if there weren't any prizes it just

51
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,960
wouldn't be worth doing because like I

52
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,640
really don't care to know

53
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:10,549
who grows the best wheat in Australia

54
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:13,068
like that's really like a peripheral

55
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:14,420
part of it to me yeah the major part of

56
00:02:13,068 --> 00:02:16,280
it to me is yeah like the prizes

57
00:02:14,419 --> 00:02:17,719
afterwards and being able to grow the

58
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,550
community and so we thought yeah the

59
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:23,479
prizes as well as just the cup itself

60
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:25,189
yes so we basically decided yeah we need

61
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:26,780
to get some prizes sorta which we've

62
00:02:25,189 --> 00:02:28,969
been in the process of doing for a while

63
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,949
now and thankfully we've had a lot of

64
00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:33,770
support from a lot of like international

65
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:35,269
breeders as well as even some Australian

66
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:39,769
people kicking in some prizes which will

67
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:41,870
be cool oh and yeah basically we want to

68
00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:43,550
be able to reward the people who enter

69
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,950
but more importantly we wanted it

70
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:48,050
haven't you to be able to let everyone

71
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:50,629
get involved you know like just even the

72
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:52,969
casual punter so yeah that was why we

73
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:54,889
thought the majority of the prizes will

74
00:02:52,969 --> 00:02:56,359
be auctioned off and just anyone can bid

75
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:58,069
on those so even if you have an end to

76
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,750
the sample you might be thinking about

77
00:02:58,069 --> 00:03:02,180
getting into it we're gonna you know

78
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:04,219
provide an opportunity to get some

79
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:06,080
really good quality genetics and they'll

80
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:07,489
be domestic so it'll already be here so

81
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,690
like you'd have to worry yeah postage or

82
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:10,819
anything like that which is another big

83
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:12,199
thing about white people don't order

84
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:13,489
tons of seeds because you know it's kind

85
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:16,399
of like running the gauntlet each time

86
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:18,469
you have to go through chaos yeah so

87
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,299
overall we think it's going to be an

88
00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:21,500
awesome opportunity and hey even if like

89
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:24,500
you're just a smoker

90
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:26,569
there'll be half Oz's of each entry up

91
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,189
for auctions if those top entries like

92
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:30,889
you know say one through to five will be

93
00:03:28,189 --> 00:03:33,319
by definition really friggin good smoke

94
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:34,699
so yeah lots of people will be trying to

95
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:35,930
get those so yeah but this seems like

96
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:37,369
there's something for everyone and we're

97
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:39,409
trying to make it that way as well as

98
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:41,719
making it overall a charity which each

99
00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:43,090
year will put the cause and not just

100
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:45,680
Sarah's just sweeten the deal even more

101
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:48,560
yeah and I think that's a great idea I

102
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:52,430
mean I know there's been some mixed

103
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:55,959
reactions from the community in like

104
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:59,750
where the the charity chosen this year

105
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:01,579
and look I can understand how it might

106
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:04,519
rub some people the wrong way but

107
00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:09,769
ultimately I think like if if you're

108
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:11,689
going to put on a cup of any sort you

109
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:13,789
kind of can model it any way you want to

110
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:15,259
and people will choose to enter it or

111
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:17,569
not and what you do at the end of the

112
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:19,548
day put it all in your own pocket you

113
00:04:17,569 --> 00:04:19,879
put it all into a project you put it all

114
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:21,859
into

115
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:25,250
whatever is kind of ultimately that

116
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:27,500
person's decision yeah I mean the idea

117
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:29,240
of saying that like someone is more

118
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,990
worthy of charity than someone else

119
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,550
doesn't really see yeah me not what is

120
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:36,350
about yeah that's not what it's about

121
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:38,210
today helping yeah and and the other

122
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:40,460
thing is you know there'll always be

123
00:04:38,209 --> 00:04:42,799
someone who will believe that someone

124
00:04:40,459 --> 00:04:44,299
else is a better cause you know so we'd

125
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,710
ever want to get into that and we

126
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:48,319
already just said that there was some

127
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:50,989
serious logistical reasons as to why we

128
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:52,670
picked mad farmer because he really

129
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:55,370
kindly offered to throw in a ton of

130
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:57,170
prizes to the point where basically most

131
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:59,509
people who enter will get a prize

132
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:02,330
regardless of where they place and yeah

133
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:04,370
just that that in itself made the cup

134
00:05:02,329 --> 00:05:08,389
feasible people sorry excuse me it

135
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:10,100
feasibly possible yes it's a sad thing

136
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:12,289
that you kind of even have to justify it

137
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:14,090
but I just wanted to to bring it up so

138
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:16,430
that it could be out there for everyone

139
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:18,649
to know that it's it's there's no you

140
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:20,689
know it's a good thing yeah and I mean

141
00:05:18,649 --> 00:05:23,089
we could we could run the cup with no

142
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:24,709
charity component but like exactly and

143
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,729
that's kind of the undertone people take

144
00:05:24,709 --> 00:05:29,689
with that it's like what would you

145
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:31,879
rather we don't do this hmm yeah so they

146
00:05:29,689 --> 00:05:33,620
honestly know that that only popped up

147
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:35,060
for like a day or two after the initial

148
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:37,399
announcement and then very quickly

149
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,750
people kind of understood that like yeah

150
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:40,459
charities charity or like you can't

151
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,860
helping someone if there's someone at

152
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:44,359
the end of the day exactly well listen

153
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,530
and you enjoy Nikita very quick

154
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,689
breakdown cuz I know you're gonna have

155
00:05:45,529 --> 00:05:48,709
you're gonna have to you're gonna have

156
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:51,740
concentrates and you're gonna have

157
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:53,299
flowers so give a breakdown of how you

158
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,579
would submit an entry and where to get

159
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,139
in touch and all that kind of stuff yeah

160
00:05:55,579 --> 00:06:00,529
so hopefully by the end of this week we

161
00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:04,039
will have a set date for when entries

162
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:06,379
can be accepted yep the the rules state

163
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:08,390
that the judges can only test one sample

164
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:10,040
per day and I'm not sure if either

165
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:11,899
contact that rule but we feel that's

166
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:15,170
like one of the most important rules

167
00:06:11,899 --> 00:06:17,179
there is yeah sorry good spoken to

168
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:18,860
people who've judged you know cannabis

169
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,900
events around the world and stuff like

170
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,730
that and I know that is a big problem in

171
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:24,769
factoring the scoring it's like once

172
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:28,129
you've tried one on two strains within a

173
00:06:24,769 --> 00:06:30,589
day by the time you get to five or six

174
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:31,250
how can you what real determinations can

175
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:33,560
you be making

176
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:35,300
apart from that taste

177
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,709
so yeah I think that's a that's a really

178
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,740
cool thing that you guys are doing there

179
00:06:36,709 --> 00:06:41,899
yeah and so as a result of that when we

180
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:44,150
kind of got an indication that there was

181
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:45,529
a lot of people interested we knew that

182
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:47,959
we had to pull the entry day back

183
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:50,149
because they'll only be you know so many

184
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:51,769
days in between when entries need to be

185
00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:53,689
accepted before we announce the results

186
00:06:51,769 --> 00:06:55,490
so as a result of that there'll only be

187
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:58,399
so many applicants at the moment I think

188
00:06:55,490 --> 00:07:00,680
we've got like room for 25 or 30 in each

189
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:03,829
category which yeah to be honest we've

190
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,720
received indication that like we could

191
00:07:03,829 --> 00:07:06,949
get to those numbers so if there's even

192
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,920
that's a great kind of sitting on the

193
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:11,180
fence then who knows they they may them

194
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,650
miss out or we might have to pull the

195
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,759
entry day a little bit back more but we

196
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:16,069
don't really want to do that because the

197
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,719
whole idea was that where it's at now I

198
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:20,029
mean one you know it's like you know

199
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:23,300
kind of the stoner pop culture it's on

200
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:25,159
7/10 yeah more so than that it was like

201
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,860
about six months from when we announced

202
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,090
it so it was like you've still got

203
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,410
whatever you want you know so like no

204
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:33,439
one can complain that they weren't given

205
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:34,850
enough notice basically yeah so yeah if

206
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:36,290
we keep pulling the day back further and

207
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:38,120
further than that wouldn't be the case

208
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:41,270
so we're not going to do that but yeah

209
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:43,160
the rules will be in terms of the

210
00:07:41,269 --> 00:07:46,430
categories there will be together agrees

211
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:49,189
as you said flour and concentrate we

212
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:51,918
could potentially split it further this

213
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:53,959
year but into say indica and sativa

214
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:57,079
categories and possibly solve

215
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:59,509
homelessness it solvent-based however

216
00:07:57,079 --> 00:08:01,430
we'd have to then double the prizes as

217
00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:03,560
we would now have you know instead of

218
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,910
just two first places - second places -

219
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,759
third place yeah etcetera we now have

220
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:09,950
four of each and we would also further

221
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,469
have to double the amount of time taken

222
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:14,360
to test or get more judges on board

223
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:15,950
which would result in people having to

224
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,939
submit more weed at the entry and we

225
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:19,099
just didn't wanna have to go down all

226
00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:21,860
that route so yeah so these you were

227
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:23,510
just keeping it restrained in a sense

228
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,949
and the reason for that is because and

229
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:26,389
this is kind of the big announcement

230
00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:28,550
which I don't know if I really told

231
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:30,978
everyone is that where the whole point

232
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:32,899
of this is because next year we're going

233
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:34,668
to have a physical event we would have

234
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:36,889
liked to have had a physical event this

235
00:08:34,668 --> 00:08:37,519
year but yeah even that it's the first

236
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:39,229
year

237
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,879
there'd be no guarantee that people

238
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:42,530
would make the effort to come from

239
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:43,779
places far and wide like you might get a

240
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:46,329
local turnout

241
00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:48,370
so so the idea was let's do it online

242
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:50,440
for the first year make it really

243
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:51,759
successful and then ensure that people

244
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,320
will make the effort to come to a

245
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:57,789
physical event next year which we've

246
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,840
already secured cool yeah well look

247
00:08:57,789 --> 00:09:03,429
forward to hearing more and more about

248
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:05,170
that yeah and so basically just to

249
00:09:03,429 --> 00:09:07,059
summarize we want the people who are

250
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:09,699
submitting it to be the people who have

251
00:09:07,059 --> 00:09:11,589
produced the flower or made the

252
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,210
concentrate and if you're not the grower

253
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:15,070
of the material for the concentrate we

254
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:16,810
want you to be able to give us all the

255
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:18,310
same details we would require if you

256
00:09:16,809 --> 00:09:20,109
were so you know you basically need to

257
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:24,669
know the person and be able to get this

258
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:26,649
information off them yeah and there's a

259
00:09:24,669 --> 00:09:27,969
few basic bits of information we want to

260
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:31,600
know we want to know you know that the

261
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:34,960
genetics whether it's being grown

262
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,210
organically or synthetically they don't

263
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:41,110
finally a few other little bits of

264
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:42,639
information just relating to the grower

265
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:44,950
and identification and stuff like that

266
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:47,889
basically the way you will enter is

267
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:50,800
really simple you let us know that you

268
00:09:47,889 --> 00:09:53,169
want to enter and you go to the go fund

269
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:55,209
me which will be set up very soon that

270
00:09:53,169 --> 00:09:57,370
will not be in our control that'll be in

271
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:58,750
mad farmers control so we won't see any

272
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:01,419
of the money from it we won't see any of

273
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:03,370
the money from this ever and so once you

274
00:10:01,419 --> 00:10:05,349
pay that it's it's visible on the site

275
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:08,019
but you'll also let us know and we'll

276
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:11,170
send out a package to the contestant

277
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:12,759
filled with both instructions and as

278
00:10:11,169 --> 00:10:14,289
well as mylar bags and it'll health

279
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:16,720
it'll tell you how much to put in each

280
00:10:14,289 --> 00:10:19,899
bag how to zip it all up as well as a

281
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,029
return bag yeah and an MSR and an

282
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:23,289
address and so yeah basically it's

283
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:24,370
pretty easy to submit your sample you

284
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:27,039
know like there's an instruction sheet

285
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:28,690
literally and the show and so yeah you

286
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:31,329
just go from there you submit it in and

287
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:32,500
we have a final date for receiving it

288
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:35,740
and so this was a point I wanted to

289
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:37,419
stress that day is not the date you have

290
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:39,490
to get it in the mailbox that's the day

291
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:42,490
we have to receive it by because that's

292
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:44,710
error when testing starts oh and what's

293
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:47,409
that date again I believe the date is

294
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:49,690
the 10th of September awesome yeah so

295
00:10:47,409 --> 00:10:53,649
that that leaves room for about you know

296
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:56,470
between 25 and 28 contestants I think

297
00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:58,120
but the other big thing to note is

298
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:00,639
because it's online this year it was

299
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,440
really paramount that the judging be a

300
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:04,750
hundred percent transparent otherwise

301
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,100
there's just no point in even entering

302
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:10,090
if you don't have faith in the judging

303
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:12,399
and so essentially all entries will be

304
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:15,160
uploaded you know high quality photos

305
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,259
along with the scorecards and so you

306
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:18,490
know you can you you can literally cross

307
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:21,519
compare you know like if you think

308
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:23,620
something's got awesome bag of bill and

309
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,689
then you like the scorecard and it's

310
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:27,009
mark one like it'll be obvious to say

311
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:30,460
that something dodgy is going on you

312
00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:32,620
know so yeah 100% transparent yeah like

313
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:34,540
you guys are doing that I actually wrote

314
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:36,490
notes about that so don't know that many

315
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:38,259
other events do that either so it would

316
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:40,029
be great also for an international

317
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:42,250
standpoint for people to be able to see

318
00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:43,289
everything that that went in and what's

319
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,610
happening down here

320
00:11:43,289 --> 00:11:48,149
yeah well it's funny you mentioned that

321
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:50,560
we've contacted a few of the

322
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:53,559
international cannabis publications

323
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:55,059
without naming names and yeah at least

324
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:59,769
one of them has expressed some interest

325
00:11:55,059 --> 00:12:02,559
in possibly documenting it and I think

326
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:03,960
that it it might go ahead but most

327
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:06,250
certainly next year there will be

328
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:09,100
there'll be some international presence

329
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:12,240
there which will kind of beef the status

330
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:14,769
of the event of I think that's awesome

331
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,409
yeah I mean you would um we're hoping

332
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:19,240
that next year we'll be like you know

333
00:12:17,409 --> 00:12:21,009
really something special and I think

334
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,740
that this year will really pave the way

335
00:12:21,009 --> 00:12:25,480
for that yeah excellent man well my hat

336
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,909
goes off to you guys and I'm sure it's

337
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,519
been a lot of hard work and you know

338
00:12:27,909 --> 00:12:32,469
some stressful moments as well so yeah

339
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:34,360
anything we can do as you get closer to

340
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,810
it to help you promote it and share it

341
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,210
around

342
00:12:34,809 --> 00:12:38,409
keep in touch because yeah we really

343
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:41,650
like the idea of what you're doing and

344
00:12:38,409 --> 00:12:43,719
you know hopefully it inspires some

345
00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:45,549
other events as well of the same nature

346
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,930
you know it's um it'll be great to see

347
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:49,019
life because they're edible scenes

348
00:12:46,929 --> 00:12:51,519
getting really big cute so you meant

349
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:53,319
yeah that's actually a good point where

350
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,789
we're strongly considering having an

351
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:58,510
edible section because we've had a lot

352
00:12:54,789 --> 00:12:59,589
of interest and in adding an edible

353
00:12:58,509 --> 00:13:01,689
section it would just be one extra

354
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:03,430
section so we can apply that in regards

355
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:06,010
to prizes is not a problem

356
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:07,599
so yeah it's looking very popular if I

357
00:13:06,009 --> 00:13:09,610
had to be honest waiting on like one

358
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,879
more person to message me and say they

359
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:12,399
can

360
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:15,129
and turn edibles entry and then that's

361
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:17,049
Ashley announce it because that's great

362
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:19,509
oh maybe this will be the tipping point

363
00:13:17,049 --> 00:13:20,349
on the podcast yeah you heard it guys I

364
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:25,379
dropped the hint

365
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:28,649
Sam I am now when you're not organizing

366
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:31,328
Australia's cannabis cup you are also

367
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:34,720
growing some amazing cannabis of your

368
00:13:31,328 --> 00:13:38,500
own and alongside doing that hosting the

369
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:40,240
podcast which is you know probably my

370
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:46,539
other favorite Australian cannabis

371
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:49,629
podcast oh thank you sir so what

372
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:50,919
inspired the you know you starting the

373
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:52,778
podcast I mean we talked a little bit

374
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:55,149
about it at the start of the show like

375
00:13:52,778 --> 00:13:57,338
you know recognizing that there was kind

376
00:13:55,149 --> 00:13:59,799
of a more of a receptive community for

377
00:13:57,339 --> 00:14:00,970
it but what was the the inspiration in

378
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:03,370
really getting the show going because I

379
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:06,009
know at the start we we talked about it

380
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:07,720
and you know about even possibly working

381
00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:09,669
together and ultimately I think it's

382
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:13,290
it's great that we did it and then we

383
00:14:09,669 --> 00:14:15,759
went our separate ways yeah I mean I

384
00:14:13,289 --> 00:14:18,938
just quickly referenced that point yeah

385
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:21,430
I had no idea how the show would turn

386
00:14:18,938 --> 00:14:23,980
out at that time and I think I agree I

387
00:14:21,429 --> 00:14:25,989
mean what I was thinking at the time was

388
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:28,720
that it would be like really short like

389
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,948
like sound by a short even yeah and I

390
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,620
was thinking like maybe you could even

391
00:14:29,948 --> 00:14:36,609
like slide in as a little segment on

392
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:38,980
your show yeah yeah that totally changed

393
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:41,379
and I don't even know why really I think

394
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,970
I think I just started writing questions

395
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:44,860
for it and I realized like I've got a

396
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:48,009
lot more questions here than what you

397
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:49,720
could fit into a song by yeah and yeah

398
00:14:48,009 --> 00:14:53,409
well it just becomes pretty organic

399
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:57,160
doesn't it sometimes yeah I'll admit a

400
00:14:53,409 --> 00:14:57,850
lot of pretty much 95% of the questions

401
00:14:57,159 --> 00:15:00,519
I ask

402
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:03,459
I've pre-written and that's because I

403
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:05,169
don't know I I get so wrapped up in the

404
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:09,039
story as I'm listening to it I always

405
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:10,688
struggle to kind of like view it

406
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:12,068
critically and be like oh but what

407
00:15:10,688 --> 00:15:14,019
happened there like you didn't really

408
00:15:12,068 --> 00:15:15,458
wrap up that little bit like from you

409
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:17,459
know just listen to the story it's like

410
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:20,739
oh the story goes on

411
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:22,869
but yeah I I definitely put a lot of

412
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:26,049
effort into it before each interview

413
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:27,490
because I had I have had I've done one

414
00:15:26,049 --> 00:15:29,620
of the interviews I won't say which one

415
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:31,659
and it wasn't about interpreting well I

416
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:34,419
thought I written like lots of questions

417
00:15:31,659 --> 00:15:36,939
and and we just blasted through them and

418
00:15:34,419 --> 00:15:38,349
then I was like I felt like we didn't

419
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:40,600
have enough material and we ended up we

420
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:41,560
did it was fine but I mean I just felt

421
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,450
like we didn't at the time and I just

422
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:44,559
felt so nervous not just like [ __ ] I

423
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:46,120
never want to be in this position again

424
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:48,639
like I'm always gonna try to have

425
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,289
excessive questions but at the same time

426
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,789
I put a lot of pressure on myself to try

427
00:15:50,289 --> 00:15:53,559
to write good questions like I don't

428
00:15:51,789 --> 00:15:55,179
want to ask anything which has already

429
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:58,179
been asked or like that you could just

430
00:15:55,179 --> 00:16:00,309
easily Google and so yeah so yeah I

431
00:15:58,179 --> 00:16:04,000
don't know so with that in mind it takes

432
00:16:00,309 --> 00:16:05,469
time because after like say 30 or 45

433
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,089
minutes of trying to think of like some

434
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:10,540
interesting questions they just all

435
00:16:07,089 --> 00:16:14,680
become sheer ones yeah well I mean you

436
00:16:10,539 --> 00:16:19,539
had a really strong online presence via

437
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:20,919
your heavy days account so I mean we

438
00:16:19,539 --> 00:16:22,599
talked a little bit before about the

439
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:24,969
people that go down the Warren halls and

440
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,980
how important they are to the culture

441
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:29,680
and for it getting expanded and you know

442
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:31,600
by that getting geeky and really going

443
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:34,000
down and the guest that you've kind of

444
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,490
chosen and highlighted for the way I've

445
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,200
been a a really great reflection of

446
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:41,649
those people that go down the Warren

447
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:43,329
holes or on the other scale people who

448
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:45,129
go down the Warren hall tend to find

449
00:16:43,328 --> 00:16:49,328
these guests of your somewhere along the

450
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:52,838
way as well yeah I think the reason for

451
00:16:49,328 --> 00:16:55,000
that is because yeah I'm down that hole

452
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:59,020
and I'm betting people who I want to

453
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:02,500
talk to mostly yeah that's the thing I

454
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:04,418
I've got like just this long list of

455
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:07,150
people I want to interview and most of

456
00:17:04,419 --> 00:17:08,050
them have already said yes so that's so

457
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:11,370
that's great

458
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:13,750
yeah and so just as a little side note

459
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:15,458
anyone who ever messages me and is like

460
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:17,529
hey you know I can get this person on

461
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:18,699
the show thank you so much it's not that

462
00:17:17,529 --> 00:17:20,439
like I don't want to interview them I

463
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:23,110
just got such a big list already

464
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:25,360
so yes yeah and that's just because yeah

465
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:28,839
like I want to and and that really helps

466
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:31,240
with um writing the questions because I

467
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:34,119
I've had a lot of people require

468
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,620
someone and I tried to start writing

469
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:37,508
questions for it that's usually what I

470
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:38,709
do before I even message them and ask

471
00:17:37,509 --> 00:17:40,778
them because it's like I want to know

472
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:44,500
I've got some stuff to ask them

473
00:17:40,778 --> 00:17:45,700
basically yeah yeah and someone's where

474
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,048
like it was just one where a lot of

475
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,110
people asked for it I just yeah I was

476
00:17:47,048 --> 00:17:51,819
really struggling to write questions cuz

477
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:53,349
yeah I just kind of read all the history

478
00:17:51,819 --> 00:17:54,369
and just try to be really critical of it

479
00:17:53,349 --> 00:17:56,648
and I'm just like for what happened

480
00:17:54,369 --> 00:17:58,658
there you know so yeah if you're not

481
00:17:56,648 --> 00:18:03,428
interested in it it's hard to get

482
00:17:58,659 --> 00:18:05,080
involved for sure so last year we almost

483
00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:07,000
cross bars we almost did this in the

484
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:10,210
flesh you you managed to be in Cali for

485
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,638
the the cannabis cup down in where were

486
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:16,179
you again you're out past the night

487
00:18:12,638 --> 00:18:18,969
yeah Sonoma County anomie yep yeah so

488
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:22,210
did you get to record any stuff down

489
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:25,629
there and liven in the flesh I did I've

490
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:28,629
been so lazy editing it all hey a lot of

491
00:18:25,628 --> 00:18:30,759
it a lot of this stuff are so I got I

492
00:18:28,628 --> 00:18:32,349
recorded like two interviews one of

493
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:36,490
them's online I recorded the mister saw

494
00:18:32,349 --> 00:18:40,898
one in flesh yes online I recorded like

495
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:44,859
I'll say like half of one with my boy

496
00:18:40,898 --> 00:18:46,298
from dynasty but we were like just so we

497
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:50,168
went out the night before and we were

498
00:18:46,298 --> 00:18:52,359
just so tired so yeah so we had to like

499
00:18:50,169 --> 00:18:54,309
wrap up halfway through and we still got

500
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:58,119
to finish that off and I got a lot of

501
00:18:54,308 --> 00:18:58,538
footage but um like I don't know it's

502
00:18:58,119 --> 00:18:59,859
hard

503
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:02,349
I've got it I guess I'm just gonna get

504
00:18:59,859 --> 00:19:04,058
everything on YouTube because yeah like

505
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:06,788
obviously SoundCloud doesn't support any

506
00:19:04,058 --> 00:19:09,250
footage and so I guess my motivation to

507
00:19:06,788 --> 00:19:13,829
get all that finished uppers just being

508
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:16,778
put to the side for the moment yeah yeah

509
00:19:13,829 --> 00:19:20,678
you're heavy days pages you know

510
00:19:16,778 --> 00:19:23,259
probably one of the better-known pages

511
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:25,690
as far as Australian breeders go the

512
00:19:23,259 --> 00:19:31,089
photos you show up are absolute weed

513
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:34,179
porn I mean you and you obviously a big

514
00:19:31,089 --> 00:19:38,798
proponent of of growing organic cannabis

515
00:19:34,179 --> 00:19:40,240
as well for a first-time grower somebody

516
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:43,720
who might be listening thinking about

517
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,880
setting something up at home what

518
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:48,610
be a reasonable place to kind of think

519
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:51,039
about getting started I mean I've had a

520
00:19:48,609 --> 00:19:54,009
lot of people ask me about seed banks

521
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:56,259
and reliable sources on sourcing

522
00:19:54,009 --> 00:19:59,319
genetics and making sure that you start

523
00:19:56,259 --> 00:20:02,169
with something good to begin with yeah

524
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:04,329
that's that's it hey and that ties in

525
00:20:02,169 --> 00:20:07,059
two rows talking about earlier where

526
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:09,519
it's like no extra effort you'll get a

527
00:20:07,058 --> 00:20:11,558
way better product just for the genetics

528
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:13,839
and yeah it's because it's really simple

529
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:16,808
in biology there's this this is actually

530
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:18,939
a biology equation and it basically says

531
00:20:16,808 --> 00:20:20,529
that the end product of whatever we're

532
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:22,808
talking about in a genetic sense is the

533
00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:24,908
result of three variables genetics

534
00:20:22,808 --> 00:20:26,889
environment and then other factors which

535
00:20:24,909 --> 00:20:28,360
are usually combinations of synergistic

536
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:30,130
things between the two as well as just

537
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:33,158
other random environmental factors that

538
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:35,140
happen so it's more or less they have a

539
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:37,510
sign that you know the genetic part gets

540
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:39,130
approximately 40% the environmental part

541
00:20:37,509 --> 00:20:41,288
gets approximately 40% and then the

542
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:42,880
other factors get approximately 20% so

543
00:20:41,288 --> 00:20:45,759
what that means is like you know

544
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,620
literally a minimum of 40% of the end

545
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:49,450
result of your grow is determined by the

546
00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:51,579
genetics in my opinion it's a lot more

547
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:53,230
than that but yeah bare minimum what you

548
00:20:51,579 --> 00:20:54,759
should try to consider that like if

549
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:56,169
you're only running like mediocre

550
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:58,538
genetics maybe they're only running it's

551
00:20:56,169 --> 00:21:01,270
a half their capacity like 20% instead

552
00:20:58,538 --> 00:21:03,429
of 40 and so like yeah it really adds up

553
00:21:01,269 --> 00:21:08,379
and it's it's literally no more effort

554
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:09,788
at the end of it so if you're a you know

555
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:11,230
a home grower you're looking to maybe

556
00:21:09,788 --> 00:21:14,679
get your own medicine where would you

557
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:16,480
recommend one like in terms of the soil

558
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:18,429
composition if you're if you're going

559
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,500
inside if you don't have the opportunity

560
00:21:18,429 --> 00:21:22,390
to grow outdoors there's some sort of

561
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:25,179
bare minimums that you need to start

562
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:28,450
with well I mean for organic that was

563
00:21:25,179 --> 00:21:30,730
what got me so into it was the rev is a

564
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:32,590
non line figure who writes for the skunk

565
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:34,779
magazine and he's a really kind of

566
00:21:32,589 --> 00:21:36,548
charismatic presenter and he's very

567
00:21:34,779 --> 00:21:37,658
passionate about organics and he was one

568
00:21:36,548 --> 00:21:39,940
who got me into it and there was this

569
00:21:37,659 --> 00:21:42,070
video he had on YouTube and it was

570
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:45,009
amazing it was actually a seminar he

571
00:21:42,069 --> 00:21:46,689
gave at the Emerald cup because 2005 but

572
00:21:45,009 --> 00:21:48,250
for whatever reason it's been taken down

573
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:50,798
unfortunately and it doesn't seem to be

574
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:52,480
anywhere else but long story short in

575
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:54,639
that video he basically highlights the

576
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,798
point that like the reason why organics

577
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,230
is so good is because it there's so many

578
00:21:56,798 --> 00:21:59,629
different

579
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:01,220
ways to make it work whereas with you

580
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:03,260
know synthetics there's kind of like

581
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:06,110
more of a recipe which is like more of a

582
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:08,599
one-way works only mindset and it's a

583
00:22:06,109 --> 00:22:10,459
you know he's his whole philosophy was

584
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:12,409
like just give it a go I literally just

585
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:15,410
get yourself some good compost get

586
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:17,929
yourself some good potting mix potting

587
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:20,419
soil grow a plant in it just give it

588
00:22:17,929 --> 00:22:21,769
water that's all it really needs your

589
00:22:20,419 --> 00:22:23,330
products gonna be pretty good you're not

590
00:22:21,769 --> 00:22:24,440
gonna get a whole ton of it there's

591
00:22:23,329 --> 00:22:25,579
gonna be pretty good and that's

592
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,798
something which I really liked about

593
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:30,319
organics even if you like [ __ ] up a

594
00:22:27,798 --> 00:22:31,940
bit it more so just affected the yield

595
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:33,409
not the quality so it was like first

596
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:35,090
time around and you'd get really good

597
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:36,500
stuff and it's like [ __ ] this is great

598
00:22:35,089 --> 00:22:38,569
now I just need to try to work on

599
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,769
getting some more and like for me that's

600
00:22:38,569 --> 00:22:41,659
not a problem but I think that that's a

601
00:22:39,769 --> 00:22:43,910
good starting spot for a lot of people

602
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:46,250
because I started out being a bottled

603
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:48,230
nutrient grower and I got reasonable

604
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:49,880
yields but it was pretty it's pretty

605
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:51,769
shitty and then like the first time I

606
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:54,020
grew organics it was like a game-changer

607
00:22:51,769 --> 00:22:56,750
in terms of the quality like it was it

608
00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:58,099
was a full on so it's yeah like I'm

609
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,660
really passionate about it and I guess

610
00:22:58,099 --> 00:23:01,668
if someone wanted to get into it as I

611
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:03,290
said honestly if you just like putting

612
00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:05,179
your toe in the water like just go get

613
00:23:03,289 --> 00:23:07,700
some good compost go get some food

614
00:23:05,179 --> 00:23:09,890
potting mix put compost on the bottom

615
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:11,779
half of the pot put the potting mix on

616
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:13,640
the top half and start growing your

617
00:23:11,779 --> 00:23:14,690
plant and just just add some water I

618
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:17,299
like literally that's all you need and

619
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:19,850
you know obviously have like lights and

620
00:23:17,298 --> 00:23:21,200
[ __ ] like that but um that's really it

621
00:23:19,849 --> 00:23:22,789
and you know and if you want to go

622
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,230
really down the worm hole you can then

623
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:27,589
start to look at more advanced stuff

624
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:30,769
like this stuff I use it's like I kind

625
00:23:27,589 --> 00:23:33,230
of get given it real cheap on my friends

626
00:23:30,769 --> 00:23:34,910
over at OGS who they do like a real good

627
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:36,349
job but again like if you're just

628
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:37,790
thinking about it like don't don't

629
00:23:36,349 --> 00:23:39,709
bother with that it's not worth it I

630
00:23:37,789 --> 00:23:40,460
think it's yeah just get Utah you know

631
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:42,410
what you know what I mean it's like

632
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,690
there's no point buying high-end camera

633
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:45,860
just to see if you're into photography

634
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:47,240
well it's kind of like a little bit like

635
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:49,189
we were talking before you know like

636
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,808
give people a little taste first like

637
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:53,720
have a taste diet with just water and

638
00:23:50,808 --> 00:23:55,279
then you know you'll be in encourage

639
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,019
next time around and start tweaking a

640
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,700
few variables and start making your

641
00:23:57,019 --> 00:24:00,529
yield a little bit more productive and

642
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:04,610
you you start to geek out a little bit

643
00:24:00,529 --> 00:24:06,440
on it yeah exactly and I mean to me

644
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:08,928
people who are really passionate about

645
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,590
organics the EO tends to NAAFI their

646
00:24:08,929 --> 00:24:10,940
concern

647
00:24:09,589 --> 00:24:12,798
you know they're interested in producing

648
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:14,870
clean good quality medicine

649
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:16,519
if Nields about your concern of yours I

650
00:24:14,869 --> 00:24:18,019
would never even recommend really

651
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:19,668
looking into organics unless you're

652
00:24:18,019 --> 00:24:21,408
committed to really learn it because you

653
00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:22,880
can still get this is good of a year but

654
00:24:21,409 --> 00:24:25,580
you've you know it's still got a

655
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,980
learning curve yeah sure I mean I spent

656
00:24:25,579 --> 00:24:30,379
harvest last year at a pure organics

657
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:32,000
cannabis farm in California and you know

658
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:34,159
when you've got the opportunity in the

659
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,750
means to do is that you can do it on a

660
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,299
huge scale in your yield can be

661
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:39,650
phenomenal yeah that's yeah and that's

662
00:24:38,298 --> 00:24:41,990
like that's a thing which a lot of

663
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:43,700
people don't think like cuz the hydro

664
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:45,798
mags have kind of always said that for a

665
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:47,659
long time being like it might be better

666
00:24:45,798 --> 00:24:49,398
quality but we can grow lots more of it

667
00:24:47,659 --> 00:24:51,260
and so for the business minded person

668
00:24:49,398 --> 00:24:52,849
that sounded really appealing but I mean

669
00:24:51,259 --> 00:24:54,950
yeah that's not even the case anymore

670
00:24:52,849 --> 00:24:57,408
and more so like if you are really

671
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:58,759
business minded in that sense like you

672
00:24:57,409 --> 00:24:59,870
know what I mean like you should

673
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:02,690
probably talk to someone else because

674
00:24:59,869 --> 00:25:04,189
that's not what I'm about you know in

675
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:06,259
the world of fruit and veg and

676
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:08,149
everything else Organic fetches a

677
00:25:06,259 --> 00:25:10,879
premium so why shouldn't in the world of

678
00:25:08,148 --> 00:25:13,759
cannabis as well yeah I mean that's

679
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,870
that's certainly the case like I know

680
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:16,369
people on both ends of the spectrum

681
00:25:14,869 --> 00:25:17,839
where there's I know people who grow

682
00:25:16,369 --> 00:25:20,209
organically and as a result they're I

683
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:21,709
would have charged more to grow

684
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:24,409
organically and they still give it for

685
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:26,750
the same price and I think that those

686
00:25:24,409 --> 00:25:28,700
the customers of those later people like

687
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:39,589
they they've got it good and they don't

688
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:41,590
know what's up starting to expand in in

689
00:25:39,589 --> 00:25:44,240
the Australian community where you know

690
00:25:41,589 --> 00:25:46,189
the the more technical terms around

691
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,319
cannabis when we're not really discussed

692
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:51,100
let alone strains even you know growing

693
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:54,859
up and hearing about strains it was

694
00:25:51,099 --> 00:25:56,959
virtually unheard of and now it's quite

695
00:25:54,859 --> 00:25:59,028
prevalent throughout the community it's

696
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,100
really an interesting topic because when

697
00:25:59,028 --> 00:26:03,109
that same point was kind of echoed by a

698
00:26:01,099 --> 00:26:04,658
lot of the um the people I've

699
00:26:03,109 --> 00:26:06,619
interviewed you know like in the past

700
00:26:04,659 --> 00:26:08,840
they wouldn't really seem to care so

701
00:26:06,619 --> 00:26:10,038
much about the strain names or like

702
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:11,769
trying to get like lots of information

703
00:26:10,038 --> 00:26:14,000
about them like it was just more like

704
00:26:11,769 --> 00:26:15,740
how does it make me feel like that's all

705
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,779
I really care about and then as a result

706
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,429
of that there was a lot of like miss

707
00:26:17,779 --> 00:26:20,869
naming of stuff because yeah people

708
00:26:19,429 --> 00:26:22,419
didn't care about the name so they might

709
00:26:20,869 --> 00:26:24,398
have had some real good stuff and you

710
00:26:22,419 --> 00:26:25,600
some seeds in it and like it would be

711
00:26:24,398 --> 00:26:28,268
great to know what this stuff well it

712
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:30,339
actually was and you thought this means

713
00:26:28,269 --> 00:26:31,628
maybe he used on but like now you just

714
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:34,898
got a name on something because you

715
00:26:31,628 --> 00:26:36,730
don't really know yeah so I mean yeah

716
00:26:34,898 --> 00:26:39,368
that's like a bit of a problem but yeah

717
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:40,989
it's really interesting how the names

718
00:26:39,368 --> 00:26:42,759
have become more popular and my theory

719
00:26:40,989 --> 00:26:45,399
around it at least in relation to myself

720
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:47,558
is the more strains that come out the

721
00:26:45,398 --> 00:26:49,808
more you know there's more kind of like

722
00:26:47,558 --> 00:26:51,608
little micro domains that you can become

723
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:54,308
expert in you know that you might be

724
00:26:51,608 --> 00:26:56,618
like well I really like indicas and

725
00:26:54,308 --> 00:26:58,298
particularly I like Afghani so I'm in a

726
00:26:56,618 --> 00:27:00,608
bit like try to collect all the Afghan

727
00:26:58,298 --> 00:27:02,319
as I can and I'll try to become like

728
00:27:00,608 --> 00:27:03,788
without it picking up those elements

729
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:05,589
when I smoke other strains or whatever

730
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:08,349
you know so it's like there's all these

731
00:27:05,589 --> 00:27:09,878
little areas where you can you know

732
00:27:08,349 --> 00:27:12,569
become like a little even micro

733
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:15,519
connoisseur amongst the flavours so yeah

734
00:27:12,569 --> 00:27:17,829
just the people yeah exactly whereas

735
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:20,138
before it was like maybe you were just

736
00:27:17,829 --> 00:27:21,249
known as the dude who smoked a lot of

737
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:23,428
good weed or something you know what I

738
00:27:21,249 --> 00:27:29,288
mean like it was hard to do yeah Joe's

739
00:27:23,429 --> 00:27:30,909
hard to carve your identity yeah and and

740
00:27:29,288 --> 00:27:33,700
people would just stick names on things

741
00:27:30,909 --> 00:27:36,580
to try and make them sound cool too yeah

742
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:38,499
like I read this story hypothesizing

743
00:27:36,579 --> 00:27:42,220
that a lot of the strains back in the

744
00:27:38,499 --> 00:27:43,778
day that had super in them like it was

745
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:45,069
just like it didn't didn't mean anything

746
00:27:43,778 --> 00:27:47,138
it was just letting like so it's so

747
00:27:45,069 --> 00:27:49,839
super skunks to be example you know yeah

748
00:27:47,138 --> 00:27:51,189
a lot of people if you look online a lot

749
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:53,319
of sites will tell you that it's a cross

750
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:55,869
of regular skunk to afghani which was

751
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:57,970
true for what one breeder did however I

752
00:27:55,868 --> 00:28:01,928
know for the majority of it he was just

753
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:04,720
like really good batches of skunk yep

754
00:28:01,929 --> 00:28:06,100
well it's like in Brazil I mean they

755
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,079
have kind of two types of way they have

756
00:28:06,099 --> 00:28:10,599
the brown which is just like brick weed

757
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:12,730
from over the border and then you get

758
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:15,238
access to skunk and skunk has just

759
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:18,190
covers anything that's better than brown

760
00:28:15,239 --> 00:28:20,319
yeah yeah I feel like that was kind of

761
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:21,989
the case in the UK for a long time as

762
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:25,118
well

763
00:28:21,989 --> 00:28:27,340
yeah we're just couldn't very well have

764
00:28:25,118 --> 00:28:29,319
stemmed from there as well yeah I just

765
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:31,538
know that like for them it was like

766
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:32,769
because they they didn't even really

767
00:28:31,538 --> 00:28:34,809
refer to cheese

768
00:28:32,769 --> 00:28:37,150
cheese they just still call it skunk and

769
00:28:34,809 --> 00:28:40,329
I know at least when I went over there

770
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:41,890
in 2010 it was the case that yeah it was

771
00:28:40,329 --> 00:28:44,769
like there was still a lot of Ric weed

772
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:47,320
coming in from various places and I had

773
00:28:44,769 --> 00:28:49,869
got some of that but yeah you could also

774
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:50,980
get like skunk which was like when they

775
00:28:49,869 --> 00:28:52,779
explained it to me at the time I

776
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:54,009
remember thinking this just sounds like

777
00:28:52,779 --> 00:28:55,930
the equivalent of like you know like

778
00:28:54,009 --> 00:28:58,930
pushing hydro in Australia we're getting

779
00:28:55,930 --> 00:29:06,190
hydro yeah right yeah yeah that's a good

780
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:08,710
comparison yeah so there's been a kind

781
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:10,870
of a bit of a boom in the in the Aussie

782
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:13,600
cannabis industry as well I mean outside

783
00:29:10,869 --> 00:29:16,059
of the plant itself it seems that there

784
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:17,980
are a few people like for seeing for

785
00:29:16,059 --> 00:29:20,980
seeing a green rush you've got vaporizer

786
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:24,299
companies so I think I'll add to that

787
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:28,180
the whole host of medicinal things but I

788
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:30,549
even saw like a hemp drink release and I

789
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:32,950
guess now with the the change from food

790
00:29:30,549 --> 00:29:34,750
standards with them allowing us to

791
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:36,630
consume him now we're going to see a lot

792
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:41,920
more of that becoming quite prevalent

793
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:43,600
take on all of that man yeah I mean I've

794
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:46,019
heard that Emma's got lots of

795
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:48,009
antioxidants and stuff in it so I mean

796
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:50,049
even if you wanted just to look at it

797
00:29:48,009 --> 00:29:52,660
see I always try to look at things from

798
00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:54,759
like the most ultimate pessimist view so

799
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:57,070
basically I try to look at things from

800
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:58,539
the view of like what a current medical

801
00:29:57,069 --> 00:30:00,069
doctor would look at them which is like

802
00:29:58,539 --> 00:30:02,170
someone who like probably doesn't really

803
00:30:00,069 --> 00:30:03,759
support marijuana it's like even they

804
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:05,430
would have to agree like a drink like

805
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:08,379
that it's got like lots of antioxidants

806
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:09,940
it's like you could theoretically make

807
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:13,840
it low-calorie if you know you don't

808
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:15,220
stop in for sugar and there's lots of

809
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:17,079
other things that could be you know I

810
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:18,970
call the flavonoids just depending on

811
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:20,799
how they did like the whatever type of

812
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:22,269
the hemp extracts in there like you

813
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:25,059
could you could make it all the way up

814
00:30:22,269 --> 00:30:26,940
to being like almost like a full extract

815
00:30:25,059 --> 00:30:30,159
type thing just without the actual

816
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:33,610
cannabinoids and and if you look at like

817
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:36,400
yeah extract of most things they appear

818
00:30:33,609 --> 00:30:38,079
to be more effective than like oil or

819
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,180
something like that and so the

820
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:41,859
extrapolator there's stuff in there

821
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:43,000
which is doing extra so yeah you might

822
00:30:41,859 --> 00:30:43,279
be getting that in the drink and I think

823
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,440
that

824
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,819
cool in regards to all the vapors and

825
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,940
stuff

826
00:30:46,819 --> 00:30:53,119
I'm not a big vibe dude myself my buddy

827
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:55,400
Gerald the hand he's got like the best

828
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:57,229
vapor I've ever had in that it hooks up

829
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,880
to like a bomb and so like you can still

830
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:01,549
pull it through a bong if you want and

831
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:05,180
it and it yeah delivers like a real wood

832
00:31:01,549 --> 00:31:09,919
here whereas most ya try to it's like a

833
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:13,009
different high yeah it really is yeah

834
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:14,600
and like for me I'm I always laugh at

835
00:31:13,009 --> 00:31:21,049
that I'm a bong ditch I was brought up

836
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:25,579
on them like a couple being sucked down

837
00:31:21,049 --> 00:31:28,759
along the way yeah it's hard it's hard

838
00:31:25,579 --> 00:31:30,500
to switch over to most vapes when you

839
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:34,490
come from bongs because you used to that

840
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:36,230
big hit and yeah but this one this one I

841
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:37,609
tried from Gerald it just pretty good

842
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:39,099
goes hard I'm thinking about getting

843
00:31:37,609 --> 00:31:42,889
there

844
00:31:39,099 --> 00:31:50,599
Gerald is no he'll kill me for not

845
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:52,430
knowing I don't know it's got like an

846
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:54,829
active fan unit though and that's cool

847
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:56,450
so it's like it's actively pushing it

848
00:31:54,829 --> 00:32:00,289
down the stem of the ball and then you

849
00:31:56,450 --> 00:32:02,180
alright so it's pretty good get gets a

850
00:32:00,289 --> 00:32:03,680
good amount of smoke out in a relatively

851
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:05,180
short amount of time and I think that's

852
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:07,310
like the big party like trying to

853
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:08,900
simulate a bunkie which is essentially

854
00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:12,440
that like think it's small amount of

855
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:14,090
time so I know before we sort of started

856
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:16,430
kicking it off you're talking about an

857
00:32:14,089 --> 00:32:19,159
article that you've been writing at the

858
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:21,170
moment and it was a good segue for me to

859
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:23,930
talk about sign that we've kind of

860
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:26,390
covered a little bit but you know I

861
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:30,680
guess one of the demons of the Aussie

862
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:32,210
cannabis scene is a gr weed and and a

863
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:34,660
lot of people don't even know what it is

864
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:39,250
they don't even know that it's a thing

865
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:43,100
yeah it's it's interesting I remember

866
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:46,069
the first the first I ever heard of it

867
00:32:43,099 --> 00:32:49,359
and the first they think Australians

868
00:32:46,069 --> 00:32:52,689
ever heard of it was I got a good friend

869
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:54,248
when Jovi's named because I can't think

870
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:57,369
of like an alter ego named for him right

871
00:32:54,249 --> 00:32:59,440
now but he's on red and he was he was

872
00:32:57,368 --> 00:33:02,259
the first one I know and he was the one

873
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,850
who posted something about it and it was

874
00:33:02,259 --> 00:33:06,489
like the first I ever read about it this

875
00:33:03,849 --> 00:33:08,019
was like three or four years ago and I

876
00:33:06,489 --> 00:33:10,119
remember reading about it at the time

877
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:11,859
and I was like this is this is

878
00:33:10,118 --> 00:33:13,658
interesting because this is like I've

879
00:33:11,859 --> 00:33:16,089
always had the suspicion that something

880
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:18,879
like this was going on because to me I

881
00:33:16,089 --> 00:33:22,288
always used to think like what how come

882
00:33:18,878 --> 00:33:24,878
all like quote hydro weed in Australia

883
00:33:22,288 --> 00:33:26,408
yeah that's like that similar feel like

884
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:28,538
you get like that rubberband feeling

885
00:33:26,409 --> 00:33:30,129
around your head and it's I used to

886
00:33:28,538 --> 00:33:33,339
describe it as like just a brick to the

887
00:33:30,128 --> 00:33:35,259
head like it just just knocks yeah and I

888
00:33:33,339 --> 00:33:37,118
always used to wonder like surely not

889
00:33:35,259 --> 00:33:39,128
all the growers are using the same

890
00:33:37,118 --> 00:33:43,358
strain that just can't be the case

891
00:33:39,128 --> 00:33:45,189
really and yeah yeah I realized that

892
00:33:43,358 --> 00:33:46,868
like a lot of a lot of that those

893
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:50,320
unpleasant feelings are caused by the

894
00:33:46,868 --> 00:33:52,749
PGI's themselves and more so the reason

895
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:54,878
why all the weed looks the same is

896
00:33:52,749 --> 00:33:57,009
because I mean some of the strains are

897
00:33:54,878 --> 00:33:59,678
shared between the big growers but more

898
00:33:57,009 --> 00:34:02,259
so that the PTR's themselves cause the

899
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:08,349
plants to look a particular way and

900
00:34:02,259 --> 00:34:12,878
that's why you know hydro looks so lent

901
00:34:08,349 --> 00:34:14,530
itself to the lent itself to like this

902
00:34:12,878 --> 00:34:16,480
is the good way and so you know is it it

903
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:18,940
looks it's Scott covered in red hairs

904
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,858
it's really danced and you know kind of

905
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:23,648
fat nugs you know that are all really

906
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:25,628
dense so that became the myth for a lot

907
00:34:23,648 --> 00:34:28,868
of people that was the good weed to get

908
00:34:25,628 --> 00:34:32,918
it's interesting I never I'm quite young

909
00:34:28,869 --> 00:34:34,838
so I was never getting weed when it was

910
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:36,460
good so to speak like the first time I

911
00:34:34,838 --> 00:34:43,469
thought we would have been like around

912
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:46,829
like the 2000 and 2008 2009 period and

913
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:49,598
maybe a year or two earlier like just

914
00:34:46,829 --> 00:34:52,539
but yeah about then and so it was always

915
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:54,190
rampant PGR stuff so for me yeah I know

916
00:34:52,539 --> 00:34:55,269
that yeah I never thought it was good or

917
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,898
about I definitely thought it was better

918
00:34:55,269 --> 00:34:57,309
than bullsh

919
00:34:55,898 --> 00:35:00,460
in the sense that I just thought bush

920
00:34:57,309 --> 00:35:03,060
was trash but at the same time that type

921
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:05,849
of sativa that is typically recall

922
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:09,840
bush is it's just doesn't speak to me

923
00:35:05,849 --> 00:35:12,630
anyway I'm not a big yeah yeah yeah so I

924
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:14,190
guess the things to to look out for with

925
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:16,140
it though and this is the interesting

926
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:18,750
part because it's really it's really

927
00:35:16,139 --> 00:35:21,089
kind of hard unless you've got just

928
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:23,449
exposure to seeing a lot of PDR weed

929
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:26,970
because yeah there are a lot of little

930
00:35:23,449 --> 00:35:30,359
variations and and mpg are so it spits

931
00:35:26,969 --> 00:35:32,399
plant growth regulators drive yeah yes

932
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:35,789
that's that basically these are these

933
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:38,329
are chemicals which trying to mimic

934
00:35:35,789 --> 00:35:40,739
natural chemicals the plant would make

935
00:35:38,329 --> 00:35:43,170
however they've got a lot of unwanted

936
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:45,479
side-effects in the human body so yeah

937
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:47,039
if if the if the companies could just

938
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,809
make the natural chemicals themselves

939
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:50,789
that would be great but for whatever

940
00:35:48,809 --> 00:35:52,679
reason like they're not up taken through

941
00:35:50,789 --> 00:35:54,329
the route so you know at your car water

942
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:56,399
the plant we didn't get into the plant

943
00:35:54,329 --> 00:35:58,259
so for that reason you've got a

944
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,730
different chemical that will get in and

945
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:01,800
try to replicate the effects but

946
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:03,539
unfortunately a lot of the molecules

947
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,550
themselves have got for example like

948
00:36:03,539 --> 00:36:09,719
carcinogenic properties or just yeah

949
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:12,180
they disrupt spermatozoa and as a result

950
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:13,980
result in like you know because this was

951
00:36:12,179 --> 00:36:15,299
a this was a typical thing I've got told

952
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:18,329
growing up you know like if you smoke

953
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:20,880
stems you'll have like to form sperm and

954
00:36:18,329 --> 00:36:23,309
I think I used to laugh at that but it's

955
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:27,260
actually true like yeah I literally do

956
00:36:23,309 --> 00:36:30,299
that they all spermatozoa disruption so

957
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:32,580
yeah like for those kind of reasons in

958
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:35,820
most like of the for instance the states

959
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:37,469
in in the u.s. those where you have

960
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:40,530
legit growers you're definitely not

961
00:36:37,469 --> 00:36:42,269
allowed to use PG arts yeah well I mean

962
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:44,910
if it's being tested and yeah he

963
00:36:42,269 --> 00:36:47,670
definitely can't a lot of people seem to

964
00:36:44,909 --> 00:36:49,799
think it is being used in the state so

965
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:51,300
I'm a bit skeptical because I see photos

966
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,400
online all the time of people being like

967
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:55,800
this is PG are we and it's like it's

968
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,750
still super crystal e it's just yeah

969
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,460
it's just dense and that's the thing

970
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:01,380
which I think a lot of people don't

971
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:03,480
understand is it's like it's not just

972
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:05,280
like really dense weiners PG ah wait

973
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,869
it's like AGR's make the strain more

974
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,070
dense than it would have been so if you

975
00:37:06,869 --> 00:37:10,960
had a strain that was going to be super

976
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:13,900
Airy it might not even end up being like

977
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:17,079
you know quote dense yeah after PGI you

978
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:19,599
see it would just be more dense yes yeah

979
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:21,849
exactly so so it's not just like a rule

980
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:23,799
of thumb like you know if you you know

981
00:37:21,849 --> 00:37:25,599
like it could be the case that the most

982
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:29,890
densest but you've ever come across was

983
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:31,569
not a gr you know yeah so yes that's a

984
00:37:29,889 --> 00:37:33,599
big one to remember but I think for me

985
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:35,440
the biggest one in my opinion is the

986
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:38,949
discoloration you know like it's it's

987
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:42,010
got like a weird gray dark color yeah it

988
00:37:38,949 --> 00:37:43,599
doesn't look right dick it looks like

989
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:45,100
it's kind of almost being vaporized

990
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:47,860
sometimes or years

991
00:37:45,099 --> 00:37:50,619
hey like someone had good butt and it's

992
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:53,500
like postpaid bud well I've even heard

993
00:37:50,619 --> 00:37:56,349
rumors of people blasting bud and then

994
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:59,170
selling it like you know to make pho and

995
00:37:56,349 --> 00:38:01,839
then selling the but after I've heard of

996
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:03,190
that too I think the thing that would be

997
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:05,410
though that you'd have to be starting

998
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:07,240
with good bud because I've heard of

999
00:38:05,409 --> 00:38:09,699
people like trying to do extractions on

1000
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:11,229
PTR buds but you know you get a horrible

1001
00:38:09,699 --> 00:38:13,689
returns because there's no track phones

1002
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:15,490
yeah of course but yeah I could

1003
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:16,840
definitely see that being possible if

1004
00:38:15,489 --> 00:38:18,789
you had good weed you know and you gave

1005
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:20,260
it a blast and you got it out and dried

1006
00:38:18,789 --> 00:38:23,110
it for long enough so it didn't smell

1007
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:25,540
like butane yeah an admittedly like to

1008
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:26,980
the to the experience smoking you'd be

1009
00:38:25,539 --> 00:38:28,869
probably still pick up on it but you

1010
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:32,530
know to the to the novice they probably

1011
00:38:28,869 --> 00:38:34,179
different there seems to be a bit of a

1012
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:36,250
rise in concentrates as well I mean

1013
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:38,409
obviously having a concentrate section

1014
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:40,960
to your cup shows that it is happening

1015
00:38:38,409 --> 00:38:43,420
but definitely starting to see it become

1016
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:47,139
more prevalent in the Aussie cannabis

1017
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:50,260
community it was we I was in the States

1018
00:38:47,139 --> 00:38:53,230
and you know talking to young dudes like

1019
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:54,760
in their late teens early 20s and

1020
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:57,039
they're like you know flowers are for

1021
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:59,650
old man Dodd that's what my dad smokes

1022
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:01,360
I'd never touch that stuff and just

1023
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:04,599
straight up doing dabs their whole life

1024
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:06,970
you know that's an interesting one isn't

1025
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:10,779
it I'm um I'm in the same boat I'm on

1026
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:13,429
flour for life yeah I

1027
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:15,410
in Australia I got a theory about it

1028
00:39:13,429 --> 00:39:17,000
pretty simple you know weird [ __ ] here

1029
00:39:15,409 --> 00:39:18,799
so it's natural to want to try to make

1030
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,050
it stronger so you can ask on some

1031
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,120
traits easy so in America you got good

1032
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:24,890
flour though because that's the

1033
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,719
interesting one some people have told me

1034
00:39:24,889 --> 00:39:28,519
like it's just because you know like

1035
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:31,519
eventually people are gonna jack their

1036
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:33,550
tolerance up and then and then it's like

1037
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:35,630
where do you go through from dads and

1038
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:38,690
part of me thinks it's like it's a

1039
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:40,970
mistake in a way it's like yeah abs and

1040
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:43,579
they're good cuz they just they [ __ ] you

1041
00:39:40,969 --> 00:39:44,989
up yeah and then you keep doing them and

1042
00:39:43,579 --> 00:39:46,489
then and then you've done them for like

1043
00:39:44,989 --> 00:39:48,079
a week and then you smoked some flour

1044
00:39:46,489 --> 00:39:50,959
and it just doesn't do anything for you

1045
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:52,309
anymore right yeah like that part of me

1046
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,500
thinks that's maybe what happens to

1047
00:39:52,309 --> 00:39:56,509
literally everyone because I don't know

1048
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,559
it like I just say to people like I made

1049
00:39:56,510 --> 00:40:00,050
a lot of people who are like

1050
00:39:57,559 --> 00:40:01,250
concentrates are only and like as soon

1051
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:03,980
as someone says that to me in their

1052
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:05,239
Australian ideally think like oh you

1053
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:07,429
probably haven't had like really good

1054
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:09,349
flour before yeah

1055
00:40:07,429 --> 00:40:11,719
dab yourself out as being able to

1056
00:40:09,349 --> 00:40:14,360
appreciate the mild but that you've got

1057
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:16,489
now yeah and it but like I mean the one

1058
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:18,079
thing I'll say in defense is maybe not a

1059
00:40:16,489 --> 00:40:20,029
lot of them would dab only but a lot of

1060
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:21,739
them were like mostly dabbed and you

1061
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:23,570
know I have physically met up with them

1062
00:40:21,739 --> 00:40:25,069
and like shared some of my flowers a lot

1063
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:27,800
of them would have been like yeah like

1064
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:29,420
I'd be happy to smoke this yeah yeah

1065
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,430
they're so for me I don't I can't

1066
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:34,010
pinpoint why in the states they do it

1067
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:35,419
because yeah for me it's like I just say

1068
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:37,910
to people I might look if you try like

1069
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:39,590
that the most top end flowers it's to me

1070
00:40:37,909 --> 00:40:42,710
it's on par with the most top ant and

1071
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:44,900
concentrates so yeah yeah it shouldn't

1072
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:46,880
be a case of like all night it's still

1073
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:48,170
better so yeah I don't know I think yet

1074
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,610
the tolerance thing and it's also

1075
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:52,309
America's got like this big thing about

1076
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:56,180
it like just going super hard you know

1077
00:40:52,309 --> 00:40:59,809
right yeah totally I like just go as

1078
00:40:56,179 --> 00:41:01,759
hard as you can yeah well then Carly

1079
00:40:59,809 --> 00:41:03,139
brings us around again to the article

1080
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,970
that you were talking about earlier and

1081
00:41:03,139 --> 00:41:07,069
kind of starting that conversation I

1082
00:41:04,969 --> 00:41:10,429
mean if you're in a in a shitty position

1083
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:12,740
where you can either only your ass

1084
00:41:10,429 --> 00:41:16,399
you're supplying people and you can only

1085
00:41:12,739 --> 00:41:17,989
get crappy weed or you're on the lower

1086
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:21,230
scale of that and you're only able to

1087
00:41:17,989 --> 00:41:23,619
find crappy weed for yourself no I mean

1088
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:26,690
we need to start a conversation

1089
00:41:23,619 --> 00:41:29,089
within the community where we start to

1090
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:31,539
get away from from crappy weed and start

1091
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:34,309
looking at really good cannabis and

1092
00:41:31,539 --> 00:41:36,199
demanding it and finding a way for

1093
00:41:34,309 --> 00:41:39,019
everybody to work together growers and

1094
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:41,509
suppliers to to keep good cannabis

1095
00:41:39,019 --> 00:41:44,750
flowing it's it's such a multi-faceted

1096
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:47,690
problem isn't it it's it's huge it's

1097
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:49,489
there's so many parts which like I feel

1098
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:51,590
like we should start on first but it's

1099
00:41:49,489 --> 00:41:55,639
hard to know where to an interesting

1100
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:58,340
thing to note about that is that in my

1101
00:41:55,639 --> 00:42:01,429
opinion if you're someone who makes like

1102
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:03,019
a substantial amount of money like I

1103
00:42:01,429 --> 00:42:04,969
don't know because substantial is like a

1104
00:42:03,019 --> 00:42:07,190
bit of a vague term actually I put this

1105
00:42:04,969 --> 00:42:10,039
if you're the type of person who's like

1106
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:12,740
a dealer but you're just just kind of

1107
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:14,449
helping me out so to speak maybe getting

1108
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:16,339
cheap weed for yourself or something in

1109
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:17,089
the deal yeah but like I think if you're

1110
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:20,269
at the point where you're actually

1111
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:22,670
pocketing money from it and you're

1112
00:42:20,269 --> 00:42:26,539
selling [ __ ] stuff I think you've got an

1113
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:28,970
obligation to prioritize like literally

1114
00:42:26,539 --> 00:42:31,039
actively looking for a good source of we

1115
00:42:28,969 --> 00:42:32,569
it might take you forever to find it but

1116
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:34,639
like there's nothing that annoys me more

1117
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:36,860
than like I made a dealer and they just

1118
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:38,869
like oh yeah man I just soap AGR's like

1119
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:41,690
that's all I do and it's like and and

1120
00:42:38,869 --> 00:42:43,339
and do you look for like a better source

1121
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:44,960
or anything and they like all ye look

1122
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:46,880
like either well no and it's like well

1123
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,639
it's not gonna come [ __ ] knocking on

1124
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:51,380
the door dude like and so yeah like I

1125
00:42:49,639 --> 00:42:53,239
mean I think if you're like especially

1126
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:55,400
if you're like a dealer for a living and

1127
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:57,109
you're just dealing PTR's like it's it's

1128
00:42:55,400 --> 00:43:00,800
[ __ ] your obligation to like try to

1129
00:42:57,110 --> 00:43:02,690
find a better [ __ ] up yeah and and as I

1130
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,130
said you know it's hard it's hard so I'm

1131
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:09,740
not saying it has to happen but you got

1132
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:12,349
to try and yeah in regards to getting

1133
00:43:09,739 --> 00:43:14,659
growers and stuff to link up it's it's

1134
00:43:12,349 --> 00:43:16,730
about forming good relationships you

1135
00:43:14,659 --> 00:43:18,049
know and and great relationships are

1136
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:19,909
built on lots of things and we mentioned

1137
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:22,870
this earlier but you know like a good

1138
00:43:19,909 --> 00:43:25,039
relationship is one where a buyer is not

1139
00:43:22,869 --> 00:43:28,309
constantly trying to

1140
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:30,320
you get down a cellar and likewise a

1141
00:43:28,309 --> 00:43:31,940
cellars not constantly trying to pull

1142
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:34,430
the wool over the buyers eyes and

1143
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:37,880
regards to quality and that what I mean

1144
00:43:34,429 --> 00:43:39,649
by that is is like there there aren't

1145
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:41,300
really high quality dealers in Australia

1146
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:42,380
because of several factors but a big one

1147
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,340
is that a lot of people don't want to

1148
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:46,670
pay the price

1149
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:49,400
and until you like happy to pay prices

1150
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:52,610
you're not gonna find that dealer and so

1151
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:54,380
the the way I would tie into it is you

1152
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:55,880
know if you meet someone who offers you

1153
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:58,039
weed for a higher price

1154
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:00,200
don't just instantly shy away of your

1155
00:43:58,039 --> 00:44:01,880
suspect ask them for a sample it's

1156
00:44:00,199 --> 00:44:03,109
totally reasonable to ask for a sample

1157
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:04,640
you know like if you even if you're

1158
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:06,980
gonna buy the smallest amount they were

1159
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:08,960
willing to offer one kind is nothing in

1160
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:11,449
compared in comparison to that you know

1161
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,460
even if it was like $50 worth like one

1162
00:44:11,449 --> 00:44:16,549
kind is like $2 worth of weed at max

1163
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:18,199
yeah so like it's totally reasonable to

1164
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:19,880
ask for a sample and if it's good buy it

1165
00:44:18,199 --> 00:44:21,769
and form a good relationship with that

1166
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,329
person and don't try to beat them down

1167
00:44:21,769 --> 00:44:24,679
don't like I asked them next week if you

1168
00:44:23,329 --> 00:44:27,199
can get it for five bucks cheaper

1169
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:29,750
because like that's that's a big problem

1170
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:31,730
you need that good yeah because like

1171
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:34,039
eventually the person will be like oh

1172
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:35,960
man everyone wants a cheaper and so they

1173
00:44:34,039 --> 00:44:38,150
go and find a new source don't tell

1174
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:39,260
anyone all the sudden the weed [ __ ] and

1175
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:40,460
that ties in you know a lot of people

1176
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,660
have had that story of like well you

1177
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:42,590
know like I've got this new dealer and

1178
00:44:41,659 --> 00:44:43,670
like they were really good and then all

1179
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:46,220
of a sudden they just dropped off after

1180
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:48,769
like a month or so and it's like because

1181
00:44:46,219 --> 00:44:50,659
yeah like people just you know passively

1182
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:51,800
always kind of trying to wear and down

1183
00:44:50,659 --> 00:44:53,719
and so they think

1184
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:55,039
[ __ ] it I'll get these cheap rants I can

1185
00:44:53,719 --> 00:44:56,689
give it to them a little cheaper I'm

1186
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:59,480
also making some more money because like

1187
00:44:56,690 --> 00:45:01,099
bottom lines lower now yeah and and it's

1188
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:03,469
a problem and it's like this you know

1189
00:45:01,099 --> 00:45:06,049
this buddy slippery slope on West and so

1190
00:45:03,469 --> 00:45:08,659
yeah it's like so degenerating and nasty

1191
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:10,580
circle yeah so it's like find someone

1192
00:45:08,659 --> 00:45:13,099
find someone who's but weed you're happy

1193
00:45:10,579 --> 00:45:14,750
with to pay the price and value that and

1194
00:45:13,099 --> 00:45:18,049
if there is good person they'll value

1195
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:20,329
you as well ill that's at least happy

1196
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:22,730
about it yeah and I think the community

1197
00:45:20,329 --> 00:45:25,460
is is growing and opening up enough now

1198
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:27,590
where if you're smart about it those

1199
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:30,980
relationships you can start to make them

1200
00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:33,950
and you can start to build them and and

1201
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:36,260
start to find like-minded people close

1202
00:45:33,949 --> 00:45:36,889
by a lot of people message me asking for

1203
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:40,009
weird and

1204
00:45:36,889 --> 00:45:42,679
because usually don't apply but some of

1205
00:45:40,009 --> 00:45:44,119
them for whatever reason and you

1206
00:45:42,679 --> 00:45:45,618
probably just depending on the mood I

1207
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:47,900
mean I'll decide to reply to them and

1208
00:45:45,619 --> 00:45:51,470
just like kind of ask why they're asking

1209
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:52,940
me this more or less but most of the

1210
00:45:51,469 --> 00:45:54,469
time the answer I get is they just like

1211
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:55,970
oh I've tried I've tried and it's like

1212
00:45:54,469 --> 00:45:57,828
when you say you tried do you mean like

1213
00:45:55,969 --> 00:45:59,719
you've message to other people randomly

1214
00:45:57,829 --> 00:46:02,269
who you don't know just asking for weed

1215
00:45:59,719 --> 00:46:04,248
like and it's so funny cuz it's like I

1216
00:46:02,268 --> 00:46:06,528
form friendships with people and you

1217
00:46:04,248 --> 00:46:08,328
know like probably takes a long time but

1218
00:46:06,528 --> 00:46:09,409
like eventually I'll like maybe give

1219
00:46:08,329 --> 00:46:11,180
them a bit of weed like just

1220
00:46:09,409 --> 00:46:14,358
unexpectedly and it'll just yeah you go

1221
00:46:11,179 --> 00:46:15,588
dude and it's like people people don't

1222
00:46:14,358 --> 00:46:17,568
seem to understand that like that's

1223
00:46:15,588 --> 00:46:19,869
that's almost just how friendships work

1224
00:46:17,568 --> 00:46:22,099
you don't just you don't just walk up to

1225
00:46:19,869 --> 00:46:24,048
someone and ask them for something

1226
00:46:22,099 --> 00:46:26,119
immediately it's like when you're when

1227
00:46:24,048 --> 00:46:28,400
you're their friend maybe they'll help

1228
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:30,318
you out like from there okay okay you

1229
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,970
wouldn't do it on the street yeah

1230
00:46:30,318 --> 00:46:33,199
exactly so it's like I just say to

1231
00:46:31,969 --> 00:46:34,578
people I might look I know you won't

1232
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:36,018
weed but maybe you should just try to

1233
00:46:34,579 --> 00:46:37,609
make some friends in the community just

1234
00:46:36,018 --> 00:46:39,439
chat to them and just get to know them

1235
00:46:37,608 --> 00:46:41,630
for ages and then maybe eventually one

1236
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:44,480
of them will offer you something like

1237
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:46,999
even as simplistic or as you know

1238
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,949
reductionist as that sounds that really

1239
00:46:46,998 --> 00:46:50,659
is like the most basic gameplan you

1240
00:46:48,949 --> 00:46:52,969
could have to try to start core score in

1241
00:46:50,659 --> 00:46:54,828
good weed if you had no means of doing

1242
00:46:52,969 --> 00:46:56,568
it in person like literally start making

1243
00:46:54,829 --> 00:46:58,309
friends with people online don't pester

1244
00:46:56,568 --> 00:47:00,318
them and by that I mean don't ask them

1245
00:46:58,309 --> 00:47:01,519
for weird just don't just don't just ask

1246
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:03,079
them questions but like you know what I

1247
00:47:01,518 --> 00:47:05,508
mean like become friends with people

1248
00:47:03,079 --> 00:47:07,940
like be genuine yeah reach out yeah and

1249
00:47:05,509 --> 00:47:09,710
people will sense the genuineness and

1250
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:12,980
then that's when they won't feel weird

1251
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:15,858
about maybe helping you out 100%

1252
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:17,210
so yeah it's interesting it's it's it's

1253
00:47:15,858 --> 00:47:18,650
all about how you present yourself and

1254
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:19,818
it's like yeah I know that maybe you

1255
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:21,710
don't have wheat now so it's really

1256
00:47:19,818 --> 00:47:23,748
tempting to just ask for some week but

1257
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:25,278
it's never gonna work and the other

1258
00:47:23,748 --> 00:47:27,048
problem is they could never understand

1259
00:47:25,278 --> 00:47:29,239
the position you're in anyway so like I

1260
00:47:27,048 --> 00:47:31,880
don't expect them to have a hundred

1261
00:47:29,239 --> 00:47:33,829
percent you know ability to be like oh

1262
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:35,390
well if I was in his shoes I'd never

1263
00:47:33,829 --> 00:47:36,950
help someone else I won't ask that

1264
00:47:35,389 --> 00:47:39,199
because like yeah they've never been in

1265
00:47:36,949 --> 00:47:40,818
my position so they don't know yeah I

1266
00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:42,739
you know what I mean because it's a bit

1267
00:47:40,818 --> 00:47:44,389
of a unique one to be in but at the same

1268
00:47:42,739 --> 00:47:45,710
time they should be smart enough to know

1269
00:47:44,389 --> 00:47:46,210
that right yeah just getting a random

1270
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:48,338
message

1271
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:50,230
with drugs is never gonna result in it

1272
00:47:48,338 --> 00:47:54,039
and if it did like [ __ ] what type of

1273
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:56,679
agar would I be like yeah yeah that's

1274
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:59,079
dude you've got to be alarm bells

1275
00:47:56,679 --> 00:48:05,319
yeah thanks that dude comes and rolls

1276
00:47:59,079 --> 00:48:08,440
you yeah so you've been obviously you've

1277
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:11,170
got a great selection of strains at home

1278
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:14,679
and have over the years produced some

1279
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:16,690
beautiful cannabis and you know have

1280
00:48:14,679 --> 00:48:18,159
done some traveling what what are your

1281
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:19,690
one of the things that you look for in

1282
00:48:18,159 --> 00:48:21,608
like a really good smo Javed you have

1283
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:25,480
like a nutter talk three strains or a

1284
00:48:21,608 --> 00:48:28,829
top one even can you nail it down yeah

1285
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:31,960
my favourite strain is the blue Magoo

1286
00:48:28,829 --> 00:48:33,608
it's it's amazing in my opinion anyone

1287
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:35,800
who likes blueberry strains they'll

1288
00:48:33,608 --> 00:48:37,598
really get glue in the gooey shutouts

1289
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:40,690
dynasty you can get it from them to be

1290
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:44,220
extra it's really good in seed form yeah

1291
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:47,889
I love it because it's it's a very

1292
00:48:44,219 --> 00:48:50,230
indica Afghani type plant however it's

1293
00:48:47,889 --> 00:48:52,299
got much better side branching than the

1294
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:53,588
typical Afghani so from a growing point

1295
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:54,970
of view it yields a lot better than a

1296
00:48:53,588 --> 00:48:57,699
typical Afghani which is like really

1297
00:48:54,969 --> 00:49:00,039
good it's it's got like bang on

1298
00:48:57,699 --> 00:49:04,989
blueberry chirps but it's got like this

1299
00:49:00,039 --> 00:49:07,119
kind of musky incense twist to it so

1300
00:49:04,989 --> 00:49:09,519
it's hard to describe but it's it's a

1301
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:11,130
very like complex and nuanced like you

1302
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:13,570
can just sit there and just kind of

1303
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:15,430
decipher all the components and it's

1304
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:18,460
like it's like a cave you explore you

1305
00:49:15,429 --> 00:49:21,789
know there's so much to it and it's and

1306
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:23,800
finally it's it's so medicinal it's just

1307
00:49:21,789 --> 00:49:26,050
you smoker and you feel like in-between

1308
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:27,810
all your joints like little clouds of

1309
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:30,310
air and you can feel the

1310
00:49:27,809 --> 00:49:33,250
anti-inflammatory properties and it's

1311
00:49:30,309 --> 00:49:36,338
also really good friends ID and things

1312
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:38,380
like that yeah and yeah it's just a

1313
00:49:36,338 --> 00:49:40,630
little side note as well with that smell

1314
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:43,000
it's like a very feminine smell it's not

1315
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:43,990
like a real it doesn't overpower things

1316
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,730
like if you had it in a bag with

1317
00:49:43,989 --> 00:49:48,250
something else it might even get a power

1318
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:49,690
because it's yeah it's got like a soft

1319
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:52,358
almost like the white like lavenders got

1320
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:54,570
this softness to it yeah does it come

1321
00:49:52,358 --> 00:49:58,108
from blue dream is that in its noise

1322
00:49:54,570 --> 00:50:00,838
from blueberry and very close to

1323
00:49:58,108 --> 00:50:05,009
a strain called major-league but which

1324
00:50:00,838 --> 00:50:08,248
is a very old-school strain of Williams

1325
00:50:05,009 --> 00:50:11,579
wonder from SSS C which is essentially

1326
00:50:08,248 --> 00:50:13,048
the best seed bank of all time yep so

1327
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:15,119
yeah it definitely some heavyweight

1328
00:50:13,048 --> 00:50:16,409
genetics behind it and and you know

1329
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:17,519
what's really interesting because I

1330
00:50:16,409 --> 00:50:18,690
thought about this for a while and I

1331
00:50:17,518 --> 00:50:22,229
wanted to make a point of mentioning

1332
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:24,210
this if I ever brought this up was the

1333
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:26,429
the Magoo is part of the reason as to

1334
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:28,650
why I share clones with people because I

1335
00:50:26,429 --> 00:50:31,259
you know like I'm arguing 21 but I share

1336
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:34,380
them with friends for sure the reason

1337
00:50:31,259 --> 00:50:36,298
for that is because the blue Magoo they

1338
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:37,739
don't know who made it was just made by

1339
00:50:36,298 --> 00:50:42,329
someone in Oregon it's like a real

1340
00:50:37,739 --> 00:50:44,608
popular in Oregon and it's it's a result

1341
00:50:42,329 --> 00:50:46,619
of basically because DJ's short the guy

1342
00:50:44,608 --> 00:50:49,199
who invented blueberry he decided to

1343
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:52,950
release clones to the community into

1344
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:54,659
people and as a result you know like my

1345
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:56,669
favorite strain was essentially

1346
00:50:54,659 --> 00:50:58,980
conceived by just some dude in a

1347
00:50:56,670 --> 00:51:00,809
basement because DJ short was willing to

1348
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:03,420
give out his really good cuts of

1349
00:51:00,809 --> 00:51:05,519
blueberry and yeah that's right and yeah

1350
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:07,289
and so for me that really was like one

1351
00:51:05,518 --> 00:51:08,399
I'm gonna make sure that like you know

1352
00:51:07,289 --> 00:51:10,049
like I'm not giving it out to everyone

1353
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,999
to the point where it's just valueless

1354
00:51:10,048 --> 00:51:15,119
but ya know I'm not gonna say no to

1355
00:51:11,998 --> 00:51:17,159
people who are worthy yes yeah that's

1356
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:18,509
something which I always considered and

1357
00:51:17,159 --> 00:51:19,739
I think people should consider as well

1358
00:51:18,509 --> 00:51:22,588
because you know like and I mean

1359
00:51:19,739 --> 00:51:24,749
likewise DJ sure would never he probably

1360
00:51:22,588 --> 00:51:26,190
wouldn't even really know that much

1361
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:27,719
about Australian to be honest but he

1362
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:30,599
would never take credit so it's like

1363
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:31,858
it's really you're just helping other

1364
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:36,239
people you know what I mean like it's no

1365
00:51:31,858 --> 00:51:37,828
skin off your back really yeah yeah the

1366
00:51:36,239 --> 00:51:40,019
whole breeding thing that and the whole

1367
00:51:37,829 --> 00:51:42,509
sharing and the community that you guys

1368
00:51:40,018 --> 00:51:44,068
have it's a really nice thing to see it

1369
00:51:42,509 --> 00:51:47,599
reminds me a lot of the jujitsu

1370
00:51:44,068 --> 00:51:47,599
community in a lot of ways it's cool

1371
00:51:50,739 --> 00:51:57,739
so somebody who they mentioned was um

1372
00:51:55,239 --> 00:52:00,348
we're in regards to the cut like one of

1373
00:51:57,739 --> 00:52:02,179
the goals is to obviously you know have

1374
00:52:00,349 --> 00:52:05,740
an event next year which would be great

1375
00:52:02,179 --> 00:52:09,409
yeah I want to tie it back to like that

1376
00:52:05,739 --> 00:52:12,319
that growth of the community and so

1377
00:52:09,409 --> 00:52:14,118
another thing which unfortunately I've

1378
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:15,980
got no control over or no one really

1379
00:52:14,119 --> 00:52:18,050
does except for just people collectively

1380
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:21,199
is I'd really like for there to be

1381
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:22,900
organic networking at the end of the

1382
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:26,659
comp you know so what I mean by that is

1383
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:28,670
part of it is like so that people kind

1384
00:52:26,659 --> 00:52:30,589
of know who's who see if you think hey

1385
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:32,358
I'm trying real hard I'm at the

1386
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:34,070
forefront of things I'd love to know

1387
00:52:32,358 --> 00:52:35,539
other people who are here with me you

1388
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:37,700
know what I do that you kind of now know

1389
00:52:35,539 --> 00:52:39,230
you might you might thought you were

1390
00:52:37,699 --> 00:52:41,598
gonna get first place and you end up

1391
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:43,608
getting third place and so now you got

1392
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:50,090
two new best friends whoever came second

1393
00:52:43,608 --> 00:52:53,480
at first base so yeah so like and and

1394
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:56,660
that that again ties into kind of the

1395
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:58,639
the Mugu point in that you know like

1396
00:52:56,659 --> 00:53:00,469
through that networking people share

1397
00:52:58,639 --> 00:53:02,358
clones and you know like my ultimate

1398
00:53:00,469 --> 00:53:03,618
goal in some regards people always ask

1399
00:53:02,358 --> 00:53:05,480
me like what's my ultimate goal I don't

1400
00:53:03,619 --> 00:53:07,519
really have one but one thing I would

1401
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:09,469
love to achieve is for there to be like

1402
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:11,929
a clone sharing scene in Australia

1403
00:53:09,469 --> 00:53:14,059
because that's so that's how it happens

1404
00:53:11,929 --> 00:53:17,480
because like sorry many strains are a

1405
00:53:14,059 --> 00:53:19,969
result of just accidents and it was just

1406
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:21,980
because like there was a like a really

1407
00:53:19,969 --> 00:53:24,348
nice female clone in that grow room at

1408
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:27,108
that time and you know as a result

1409
00:53:24,349 --> 00:53:29,320
there's now a new strain yeah so yeah I

1410
00:53:27,108 --> 00:53:31,848
think it's really important that um

1411
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:33,588
people do that but there's there's so

1412
00:53:31,849 --> 00:53:36,349
many issues of surrounding that and so

1413
00:53:33,588 --> 00:53:38,210
the first thing is like I this is like

1414
00:53:36,349 --> 00:53:40,670
kind of a little how to have had a trade

1415
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:42,800
clones you know first of all don't ever

1416
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:47,210
accept the clone of someone unless you

1417
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:49,640
are either a 100 percent sure that the

1418
00:53:47,210 --> 00:53:51,199
clone they have is just better than like

1419
00:53:49,639 --> 00:53:53,569
anything you've got anything you've ever

1420
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:55,608
tried because so many times I've

1421
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:57,380
accepted clones and they just don't

1422
00:53:55,608 --> 00:53:59,059
perform up to what I'm expecting and

1423
00:53:57,380 --> 00:54:00,890
that comes back to exposure you know

1424
00:53:59,059 --> 00:54:01,960
like what you think is really good and

1425
00:54:00,889 --> 00:54:04,088
you tell me it's really

1426
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:05,440
it could be different to what I think is

1427
00:54:04,088 --> 00:54:07,480
really good and that's just because I've

1428
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:09,338
smoked chem 91 I don't think I'll ever

1429
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:11,469
smoke stronger weird than that and so

1430
00:54:09,338 --> 00:54:13,568
yes to me when you give something a 9

1431
00:54:11,469 --> 00:54:16,568
out of 10 to me it might just be a 7 out

1432
00:54:13,568 --> 00:54:18,818
of 10 yeah so that's that's an important

1433
00:54:16,568 --> 00:54:21,460
point because that can lead to frictions

1434
00:54:18,818 --> 00:54:23,079
and especially it can lead to like maybe

1435
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:24,699
you do a trade with someone and like

1436
00:54:23,079 --> 00:54:26,349
user both happy with the deal and then

1437
00:54:24,699 --> 00:54:28,118
all of a sudden you feel ripped off and

1438
00:54:26,349 --> 00:54:30,430
like they they weren't trying to rip you

1439
00:54:28,119 --> 00:54:31,900
off necessarily yeah

1440
00:54:30,429 --> 00:54:33,308
so yeah they you just want to avoid that

1441
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:34,960
and it's really a simple way like you

1442
00:54:33,309 --> 00:54:36,339
just trade somebody first be like I'll

1443
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:38,079
send you somebody that you send me

1444
00:54:36,338 --> 00:54:41,108
somebody if we both like the bud we can

1445
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:44,230
then trade and so that's pretty simple

1446
00:54:41,108 --> 00:54:46,358
and then button so the the kind of the

1447
00:54:44,230 --> 00:54:48,550
unsaid part of that though is how do you

1448
00:54:46,358 --> 00:54:52,210
then you know have a good good way to

1449
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:56,710
trade well you've got to be buying seeds

1450
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:59,588
regularly yeah I I often sorry I feel

1451
00:54:56,710 --> 00:55:01,800
like it's almost wasted time when I'm

1452
00:54:59,588 --> 00:55:03,909
not growing out new strains because

1453
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:05,500
sometimes you find Australian and it's

1454
00:55:03,909 --> 00:55:06,848
phenomenal and so you may be you're

1455
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:09,880
gonna spend a little bit of time working

1456
00:55:06,849 --> 00:55:13,390
with that but honestly it's still just

1457
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:15,369
so so rewarding to pop new seeds to find

1458
00:55:13,389 --> 00:55:17,379
new things and to be able to share them

1459
00:55:15,369 --> 00:55:19,510
as opposed to just growing the same

1460
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:22,450
thing out because to me I look at it

1461
00:55:19,510 --> 00:55:24,579
like at the end of each growing cycle so

1462
00:55:22,449 --> 00:55:26,529
to speak you've got two choices you can

1463
00:55:24,579 --> 00:55:28,510
either grow to make money you know by

1464
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:31,599
like selling the fight or whatever or

1465
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:33,400
you can grow to have new clones at the

1466
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:34,750
end of it because you know you've tested

1467
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:36,068
new things that you've culled out the

1468
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:37,690
run so now at the end of it all you've

1469
00:55:36,068 --> 00:55:39,219
got maybe let's say you know you did a

1470
00:55:37,690 --> 00:55:40,510
whole room full of plants well now at

1471
00:55:39,219 --> 00:55:42,189
the end of it you've maybe got two or

1472
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:43,960
three plants that are like phenomenal

1473
00:55:42,190 --> 00:55:46,358
and like you know I've got them in your

1474
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:48,789
kit so to speak yeah so it's like you

1475
00:55:46,358 --> 00:55:50,409
got a choice you can do those to me I'm

1476
00:55:48,789 --> 00:55:51,849
not interested in the money one you know

1477
00:55:50,409 --> 00:55:53,469
I'm interested in finding new clients

1478
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:55,630
because hey the clones are worth a lot

1479
00:55:53,469 --> 00:55:57,039
more in their you know an infinite

1480
00:55:55,630 --> 00:55:58,780
source of dividers opposed to just a

1481
00:55:57,039 --> 00:56:00,039
finite one which will get you money but

1482
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:04,298
then it's gone and you've got to make

1483
00:56:00,039 --> 00:56:07,239
more yeah but more so it opens the door

1484
00:56:04,298 --> 00:56:09,099
if no one popped seeds that's that's

1485
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:10,709
just a shame because then we've got no

1486
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:12,480
new flavors and it in

1487
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:14,220
you really do need to constantly have

1488
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:17,309
new strains coming on to the scene

1489
00:56:14,219 --> 00:56:20,279
because I it gets people interested but

1490
00:56:17,309 --> 00:56:22,559
Morden Lee I'm sure as you're aware when

1491
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:24,420
you're like and this is a hard point to

1492
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:26,460
explain you know because by definition a

1493
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:28,800
heavy smoker is anyone who smokes once a

1494
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:30,900
day so like further feel like people

1495
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:32,400
like us that doesn't sound like a heavy

1496
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:33,510
smoker like if someone came up to me and

1497
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,579
was like oh you know I just have like

1498
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:37,470
one one hit before bed like I wouldn't

1499
00:56:35,579 --> 00:56:39,210
get on a heavy smoker at all I'd be like

1500
00:56:37,469 --> 00:56:41,819
you're a smoker but that's a heavy

1501
00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:44,010
smoker by medical definition and so and

1502
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:46,859
you do notice even if you smoke that

1503
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:48,750
much if you suddenly switch strains

1504
00:56:46,858 --> 00:56:50,819
you'll feel like you've just been hit

1505
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:53,159
for six you know and that's because the

1506
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:55,050
the change in cannabinoid profile is

1507
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:56,309
like a shock to the system and it almost

1508
00:56:55,050 --> 00:56:57,869
feels like you've had a bit of a

1509
00:56:56,309 --> 00:56:59,130
tolerance break in the sense of like

1510
00:56:57,869 --> 00:57:01,380
it's just it's hitting you harder than

1511
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:03,900
the previous strain was until you can

1512
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:06,780
readjust to it and so if nothing else

1513
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:09,150
you know there's people might you need

1514
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:10,440
to take meds every day and it's like for

1515
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:12,358
them to be able to have something which

1516
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:13,769
can just totally feel like a shock to

1517
00:57:12,358 --> 00:57:16,139
the system even though they haven't gone

1518
00:57:13,769 --> 00:57:17,608
on a tolerance break that's awesome and

1519
00:57:16,139 --> 00:57:19,230
from a recreational for you it's always

1520
00:57:17,608 --> 00:57:21,630
nice to have a new flavor sort of gotta

1521
00:57:19,230 --> 00:57:24,630
feel like it yeah a different type of

1522
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:26,519
euphoria or whatever and I mean you know

1523
00:57:24,630 --> 00:57:28,890
it's always the joy of being able to get

1524
00:57:26,519 --> 00:57:30,929
overseas to places where you've got

1525
00:57:28,889 --> 00:57:32,460
access to the various strains and you

1526
00:57:30,929 --> 00:57:35,039
don't even have to buy lots of it you

1527
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:39,150
know and you can just it's then you get

1528
00:57:35,039 --> 00:57:41,159
a real good appreciation of how varying

1529
00:57:39,150 --> 00:57:42,829
and subtle the different effects of

1530
00:57:41,159 --> 00:57:45,088
different strains can be

1531
00:57:42,829 --> 00:57:47,369
yeah and that's something which I think

1532
00:57:45,088 --> 00:57:48,989
it's like if that whole exposure point

1533
00:57:47,369 --> 00:57:51,510
isn't you know like if people knew about

1534
00:57:48,989 --> 00:57:53,159
the different ways they could feel I

1535
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:55,770
think it was so much more passionate

1536
00:57:53,159 --> 00:57:59,969
about things like this one time I had

1537
00:57:55,769 --> 00:58:02,489
some banana OG and every time you took a

1538
00:57:59,969 --> 00:58:05,549
hit from this stuff you'd get like a

1539
00:58:02,489 --> 00:58:06,598
wave of kind of teen girls / euphoria go

1540
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:08,550
through your body and I'm sure it runs

1541
00:58:06,599 --> 00:58:10,619
experienced from striking weight a song

1542
00:58:08,550 --> 00:58:12,390
playing time that the crazy part was

1543
00:58:10,619 --> 00:58:14,180
like every time you took a hit of this

1544
00:58:12,389 --> 00:58:16,098
stuff we are tired of doing

1545
00:58:14,179 --> 00:58:18,409
and it was just mind-blowing it was like

1546
00:58:16,099 --> 00:58:20,539
like this is there's clearly you know

1547
00:58:18,409 --> 00:58:22,298
like a specific composition of chemicals

1548
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:24,740
in this weed right now which is doing it

1549
00:58:22,298 --> 00:58:26,480
exactly right and and what people

1550
00:58:24,739 --> 00:58:29,209
haven't probably haven't realized is

1551
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:30,769
that I only like smoking there's been a

1552
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:32,990
couple of times I enjoyed it but I never

1553
00:58:30,769 --> 00:58:34,460
that did the other times not knowing

1554
00:58:32,989 --> 00:58:36,288
that those couple of times they enjoyed

1555
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:38,088
it there's a specific strain out there

1556
00:58:36,289 --> 00:58:41,510
for them that's gonna replicate that

1557
00:58:38,088 --> 00:58:44,000
every time for them yeah totally totally

1558
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:45,950
so yeah I think exposes a big one and

1559
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,619
that'll be good is just over time it'll

1560
00:58:45,949 --> 00:58:50,058
naturally happen and yeah I mean yeah a

1561
00:58:48,619 --> 00:58:52,130
little side note of what I was

1562
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:53,990
mentioning before in regards to the

1563
00:58:52,130 --> 00:58:55,519
popping seeds you also really need to

1564
00:58:53,989 --> 00:58:57,019
keep the client's because I know a lot

1565
00:58:55,519 --> 00:58:58,639
of people who grow seeds out but they

1566
00:58:57,019 --> 00:59:00,259
don't keep clone that's just such a

1567
00:58:58,639 --> 00:59:02,808
waste you know like you're seriously

1568
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:07,539
very seeing the genetic if you found the

1569
00:59:02,809 --> 00:59:07,539
best strain on earth it's now gone yeah

1570
00:59:07,969 --> 00:59:13,338
sorry gone sorry I mean if you keep the

1571
00:59:11,179 --> 00:59:15,608
clone and you propagate a mother plant

1572
00:59:13,338 --> 00:59:17,630
she's viable for a long time right

1573
00:59:15,608 --> 00:59:20,538
theoretically forever as long as you

1574
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:22,220
don't treat it bad yeah yeah yeah it's

1575
00:59:20,539 --> 00:59:23,630
just like people it's just it seems like

1576
00:59:22,219 --> 00:59:25,009
a bunch of effort and this was something

1577
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:28,068
calling through myself and I realize

1578
00:59:25,010 --> 00:59:29,450
every time I kind of upped the ante as a

1579
00:59:28,068 --> 00:59:31,548
grower or as a breeder

1580
00:59:29,449 --> 00:59:33,199
yeah it then just became the new norm

1581
00:59:31,548 --> 00:59:35,179
like it was like oh you mean I've got to

1582
00:59:33,199 --> 00:59:37,730
take cuttings of every planet before

1583
00:59:35,179 --> 00:59:39,379
flower that's so many and then there

1584
00:59:37,730 --> 00:59:41,269
soon enough that was the norm and then

1585
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:44,269
it was like oh I gotta keep cutting some

1586
00:59:41,269 --> 00:59:46,250
for males as well you kidding and just

1587
00:59:44,269 --> 00:59:48,469
now that's the norm you know I mean and

1588
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:49,909
so that's like it's just adjusting and

1589
00:59:48,469 --> 00:59:51,439
getting used to it because some people

1590
00:59:49,909 --> 00:59:53,149
will be like oh if the plants really

1591
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:55,010
good I can just revenge it I don't need

1592
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:57,500
to take a client problem is when you

1593
00:59:55,010 --> 00:59:59,480
reread your plant often that plant will

1594
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:01,338
now be reduced potency and reduce yield

1595
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:03,559
so it's like you might have a fact that

1596
01:00:01,338 --> 01:00:06,108
it's like often it's not the same plan

1597
01:00:03,559 --> 01:00:08,539
and not as good I should say and right

1598
01:00:06,108 --> 01:00:10,808
yeah it's worth the effort to take time

1599
01:00:08,539 --> 01:00:13,400
to keep the client's because there's

1600
01:00:10,809 --> 01:00:15,990
probably been more good strains lost

1601
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:19,440
even in just Australia

1602
01:00:15,989 --> 01:00:21,358
like there are clone onlys in America so

1603
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:23,730
to speak because yeah lots of people in

1604
01:00:21,358 --> 01:00:25,139
Australia buy good quality seeds yeah

1605
01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:26,490
it's like they just they just grow out

1606
01:00:25,139 --> 01:00:28,739
and they're like yeah that was like an

1607
01:00:26,489 --> 01:00:34,019
awesome day three or four answers next

1608
01:00:28,739 --> 01:00:35,429
one yeah that's it okay so that's

1609
01:00:34,019 --> 01:00:38,159
interesting

1610
01:00:35,429 --> 01:00:40,949
so if you if you pop a bunch of seeds

1611
01:00:38,159 --> 01:00:43,440
right and I don't know what your

1612
01:00:40,949 --> 01:00:45,689
feelings are on feminized seeds is that

1613
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:49,170
is that kind of the way people go or is

1614
01:00:45,690 --> 01:00:50,849
that not a thing as far as I thought you

1615
01:00:49,170 --> 01:00:53,088
kind of still a bit risky with playing

1616
01:00:50,849 --> 01:00:56,400
with the genetics further down the line

1617
01:00:53,088 --> 01:00:58,559
yeah to me honestly I've learned a lot

1618
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:00,358
of feminized seeds out and I've never

1619
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:03,809
really had major issues with him

1620
01:01:00,358 --> 01:01:08,819
Africa's own from the Kali Khan okay I

1621
01:01:03,809 --> 01:01:10,529
didn't mind everyone Kelly cause and I

1622
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:12,330
mean some of them don't but most of them

1623
01:01:10,530 --> 01:01:14,730
do yeah basically

1624
01:01:12,329 --> 01:01:16,858
in general yeah my feminine seeds have

1625
01:01:14,730 --> 01:01:18,750
never heard me Don them and when I speak

1626
01:01:16,858 --> 01:01:20,400
to people that tends to not be their

1627
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:22,289
issue with feminized seeds either it

1628
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:24,599
tends to be when people want to breed

1629
01:01:22,289 --> 01:01:26,608
with feminized seeds so that's a because

1630
01:01:24,599 --> 01:01:28,559
it's like as a breeder you should be

1631
01:01:26,608 --> 01:01:29,730
going to the effort of doing all the

1632
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:31,799
things that need to be done

1633
01:01:29,730 --> 01:01:33,329
and if you're either feminized seeds is

1634
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:36,210
a bit of a shortcut because it's like oh

1635
01:01:33,329 --> 01:01:37,829
I don't have to bother you know calling

1636
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:39,659
out the males I can yep

1637
01:01:37,829 --> 01:01:42,569
I can select through 30 plants instead

1638
01:01:39,659 --> 01:01:44,579
of 15 because you know they sure yeah so

1639
01:01:42,570 --> 01:01:46,559
it's like if you're just going out for

1640
01:01:44,579 --> 01:01:48,630
yourself go for feminized seeds it's a

1641
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:51,000
great way to especially because you know

1642
01:01:48,630 --> 01:01:52,619
you don't have to like [ __ ] with culling

1643
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,760
the males if it's your first time really

1644
01:01:52,619 --> 01:01:56,070
you don't have to well yeah that's

1645
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:57,240
that's gonna ask you about so if you if

1646
01:01:56,070 --> 01:01:58,769
you don't know where you've got right

1647
01:01:57,239 --> 01:02:01,559
there not feminized seed so you've got

1648
01:01:58,769 --> 01:02:03,869
say you've got 10 plants growing you

1649
01:02:01,559 --> 01:02:05,940
would advise or you would take cuttings

1650
01:02:03,869 --> 01:02:08,608
of the 10 of those before they showed

1651
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:11,820
any signs of sex or what they were gonna

1652
01:02:08,608 --> 01:02:13,650
be and and have them all clearly labeled

1653
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:15,690
and marked and then make your decisions

1654
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:19,470
after the flowering point and refer back

1655
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:22,530
to those previous cuttings basically yes

1656
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:24,779
to everything you said except I sex them

1657
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:25,240
first so I find out what are the mouth

1658
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:27,790
and the

1659
01:02:25,239 --> 01:02:29,859
females and then I take cuttings of all

1660
01:02:27,789 --> 01:02:32,590
the females and if I work in a breed

1661
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:34,210
with the males I would select my mile

1662
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:37,690
out of the group and then take a cutting

1663
01:02:34,210 --> 01:02:40,210
of that yeah and then cull the miles and

1664
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:42,070
sorry and then yeah and so then I'd have

1665
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:44,170
a cutting of all the females plus the

1666
01:02:42,070 --> 01:02:45,970
one male plus peak parents of all those

1667
01:02:44,170 --> 01:02:49,900
ones and I put the peak ones into flower

1668
01:02:45,969 --> 01:02:52,029
yeah little ones because some often a

1669
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:54,639
lot of sites will tell you to keep the

1670
01:02:52,030 --> 01:02:56,050
big plant as I'm River and then grow the

1671
01:02:54,639 --> 01:02:58,539
little one up and flower that it's like

1672
01:02:56,050 --> 01:03:00,220
no that's totally wrong put the big plan

1673
01:02:58,539 --> 01:03:01,690
into flower because otherwise it will

1674
01:03:00,219 --> 01:03:03,489
get way too big and then what the [ __ ]

1675
01:03:01,690 --> 01:03:05,409
you're gonna do with it yeah a big one

1676
01:03:03,489 --> 01:03:07,329
into flower and then the little one once

1677
01:03:05,409 --> 01:03:10,210
it's rooted and cloned that's you knew

1678
01:03:07,329 --> 01:03:14,980
that they're an easy to maintain yeah

1679
01:03:10,210 --> 01:03:20,139
cool cool and and then in sexing before

1680
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:22,300
you determine clones is there tips and

1681
01:03:20,139 --> 01:03:24,969
tricks to sexing males and females I

1682
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:27,340
mean obviously every new time grower is

1683
01:03:24,969 --> 01:03:30,368
worried about you know having their

1684
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:31,900
females pollinated so everybody trips

1685
01:03:30,369 --> 01:03:33,880
out they don't want to get their boys

1686
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:36,990
out before there's any problem of them

1687
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:39,608
releasing pollen yeah yeah good question

1688
01:03:36,989 --> 01:03:42,969
yeah I got some tips and tricks for

1689
01:03:39,608 --> 01:03:45,279
easel so if you're feeling confident

1690
01:03:42,969 --> 01:03:46,149
what you do is you let the plants get

1691
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:48,340
rootbound

1692
01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:50,410
and so by that what I mean is you put

1693
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:52,510
them into little pots after you sprouted

1694
01:03:50,409 --> 01:03:54,309
them and by little I don't mean crazy

1695
01:03:52,510 --> 01:03:57,910
small I mean like you know relatively

1696
01:03:54,309 --> 01:03:59,739
small maybe like a half a liter up to a

1697
01:03:57,909 --> 01:04:03,368
1 liter pot I wouldn't go higher than

1698
01:03:59,739 --> 01:04:04,989
one litre though and basically you let

1699
01:04:03,369 --> 01:04:07,150
the plant grow in that and basically

1700
01:04:04,989 --> 01:04:09,159
that's the only part it'll ever be and

1701
01:04:07,150 --> 01:04:10,210
before it goes into the final pot which

1702
01:04:09,159 --> 01:04:11,679
you're then basically you're

1703
01:04:10,210 --> 01:04:14,619
transplanting into that one and then it

1704
01:04:11,679 --> 01:04:15,909
goes into flower yeah by leaving it in

1705
01:04:14,619 --> 01:04:16,720
that small pot and letting it get

1706
01:04:15,909 --> 01:04:18,670
rootbound

1707
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:21,009
the plant like gets a little bit

1708
01:04:18,670 --> 01:04:22,389
stressed but we're in veg cycle so

1709
01:04:21,010 --> 01:04:25,869
stress doesn't mean anything in veg

1710
01:04:22,389 --> 01:04:27,759
cycle so yeah he gets reviewing gets a

1711
01:04:25,869 --> 01:04:29,829
bit stressed and it'll show sex early

1712
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:31,600
the other thing I do in conjunction with

1713
01:04:29,829 --> 01:04:32,980
that which is a little bit easy to do

1714
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:34,750
because most people when they go on

1715
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:36,490
their first time it's probably easier

1716
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:36,800
for them to just have the plant and I

1717
01:04:36,489 --> 01:04:38,359
can

1718
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:40,130
propria part because towards the end

1719
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:42,110
when you've got like a big plant in a

1720
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:44,450
small pot it becomes a little bit harder

1721
01:04:42,110 --> 01:04:46,190
to maintain so if you're not feeling

1722
01:04:44,449 --> 01:04:48,079
real confident with that one the other

1723
01:04:46,190 --> 01:04:49,970
one which I'd recommend or you can do

1724
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:52,190
them together is keep the plan under

1725
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:54,769
24-hour light okay under the 24-hour

1726
01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:57,559
light plant won't grow as quickly it'll

1727
01:04:54,769 --> 01:05:00,769
have smaller internodal distance but

1728
01:04:57,559 --> 01:05:03,349
it'll be very sensitive to darkness so

1729
01:05:00,769 --> 01:05:06,429
if you so if you say grow it up to say

1730
01:05:03,349 --> 01:05:09,110
five nodes big it's got five nodes and

1731
01:05:06,429 --> 01:05:10,940
it's under 24-hour lights and you then

1732
01:05:09,110 --> 01:05:13,460
start to give it eight hours of sorry

1733
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:16,159
six hours of darkness which is not

1734
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:17,840
enough to make it flower but it's a lot

1735
01:05:16,159 --> 01:05:20,059
of darkness in comparison to getting

1736
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:21,920
none but and yeah yeah the plants will

1737
01:05:20,059 --> 01:05:24,739
almost like start to prepare for flower

1738
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:27,050
and they'll start to Airy their sex yeah

1739
01:05:24,739 --> 01:05:29,929
so yeah so either one of those or both

1740
01:05:27,050 --> 01:05:33,110
together works really well and and then

1741
01:05:29,929 --> 01:05:36,259
you can find out the sex before either

1742
01:05:33,110 --> 01:05:39,920
one of those sorry to interrupt but on

1743
01:05:36,260 --> 01:05:41,570
either one of those would you then after

1744
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:43,340
doing either one rebound or whatever

1745
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:46,460
would you then move it fully into its

1746
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:48,320
flower cycle yes and once it got root

1747
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:50,599
found and showed sex it would be about a

1748
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:54,650
reasonable height anyway to do that yeah

1749
01:05:50,599 --> 01:05:56,150
I would then replant it the shows as

1750
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:57,889
soon as it showed sex if there was a

1751
01:05:56,150 --> 01:05:59,869
health growth on it to take a clone then

1752
01:05:57,889 --> 01:06:01,670
and there I'd do that otherwise I know

1753
01:05:59,869 --> 01:06:03,739
it's a female so yeah as you said put it

1754
01:06:01,670 --> 01:06:05,630
in the final pot maybe give it a week or

1755
01:06:03,739 --> 01:06:07,519
so before you flip it to flower so it

1756
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:10,010
can just kind of establish itself and

1757
01:06:07,519 --> 01:06:10,909
it'll grow a little bit and yeah then

1758
01:06:10,010 --> 01:06:12,770
you'll be able to get a nice healthy

1759
01:06:10,909 --> 01:06:14,690
clone offered and you can still take

1760
01:06:12,769 --> 01:06:16,759
clones relatively safely up until the

1761
01:06:14,690 --> 01:06:18,920
end of the first week of flower so even

1762
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:20,840
if you have to be a bit longer you could

1763
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:23,389
do that but the one caveat I'll put on

1764
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:25,130
that is if that coin doesn't root you

1765
01:06:23,389 --> 01:06:27,109
won't know till about it takes about two

1766
01:06:25,130 --> 01:06:28,460
weeks for a clone to really show you

1767
01:06:27,110 --> 01:06:30,320
whether it's gonna root or not so if

1768
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:31,970
after about two weeks if your conditions

1769
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:33,650
are good that hasn't rooted it's

1770
01:06:31,969 --> 01:06:35,419
probably not gonna root so at that point

1771
01:06:33,650 --> 01:06:36,110
you'd be in week 3 of flower and now

1772
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:37,700
it's too late

1773
01:06:36,110 --> 01:06:39,200
take a clone in my opinion so that's a

1774
01:06:37,699 --> 01:06:41,509
bit risky doing it but you know you can

1775
01:06:39,199 --> 01:06:43,639
do it yeah and I guess well you just

1776
01:06:41,510 --> 01:06:45,680
want to take enough clones initially so

1777
01:06:43,639 --> 01:06:48,589
that your success rate in the routing is

1778
01:06:45,679 --> 01:06:49,659
increased right yeah that's it I I'm a

1779
01:06:48,590 --> 01:06:51,309
bit paranoid

1780
01:06:49,659 --> 01:06:53,469
you'll take like two or three clients of

1781
01:06:51,309 --> 01:06:55,150
everything because I'm I feel if I took

1782
01:06:53,469 --> 01:06:59,078
one and it just didn't you know what I

1783
01:06:55,150 --> 01:07:01,630
mean like you just don't damn it of

1784
01:06:59,079 --> 01:07:04,329
course the one time I only cut one it's

1785
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:07,390
happened to me once and I lost my most

1786
01:07:04,329 --> 01:07:09,970
beloved plant literally learned yeah

1787
01:07:07,389 --> 01:07:13,568
yeah and I took three chlorines and none

1788
01:07:09,969 --> 01:07:15,838
of them religion so there you go

1789
01:07:13,568 --> 01:07:19,960
maybe I should be doing four or five a

1790
01:07:15,838 --> 01:07:22,328
hundred percent and especially like in

1791
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:25,240
the climate that we live in with the

1792
01:07:22,329 --> 01:07:26,339
legalities involved you know it the

1793
01:07:25,239 --> 01:07:28,269
reward

1794
01:07:26,338 --> 01:07:30,578
understandably has to be there so that

1795
01:07:28,269 --> 01:07:33,670
doesn't mean that our growers have to

1796
01:07:30,579 --> 01:07:36,400
wear lots of crap you worry Leslie let

1797
01:07:33,670 --> 01:07:40,180
them let them grow less really good weed

1798
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:45,119
and paying like what it's true yeah

1799
01:07:40,179 --> 01:07:48,009
that's it and I think you also need to

1800
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:49,568
not not abused the medical side of

1801
01:07:48,010 --> 01:07:53,380
things in the sense I know so many

1802
01:07:49,568 --> 01:07:55,509
people and they eventually someone will

1803
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:58,420
like start throwing the term medicine

1804
01:07:55,510 --> 01:08:00,579
around and yeah and then using that as

1805
01:07:58,420 --> 01:08:02,619
almost like a form of like I need this

1806
01:08:00,579 --> 01:08:05,230
for cheaper because it's it's one thing

1807
01:08:02,619 --> 01:08:06,970
to be like giving someone some you know

1808
01:08:05,230 --> 01:08:09,010
weed or if you want to call it medicine

1809
01:08:06,969 --> 01:08:10,480
in this sense at a discounted rate

1810
01:08:09,010 --> 01:08:11,650
because like you feel like they really

1811
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:13,329
need it and they can't afford it but

1812
01:08:11,650 --> 01:08:15,298
there's another thing for like what I

1813
01:08:13,329 --> 01:08:17,560
hear about which is mostly people who

1814
01:08:15,298 --> 01:08:19,810
just kind of start to throw the term

1815
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:23,259
around and be like oh and then use that

1816
01:08:19,810 --> 01:08:27,160
as like a segue into like you hear that

1817
01:08:23,259 --> 01:08:29,710
cocoa can't be brought out from the

1818
01:08:27,159 --> 01:08:32,229
house that's a boy it's going down

1819
01:08:29,710 --> 01:08:35,619
cool yeah and so people use that oh [ __ ]

1820
01:08:32,229 --> 01:08:38,559
off sorry

1821
01:08:35,619 --> 01:08:41,079
and if we use that as a segue to try to

1822
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:43,600
you know get stuff for cheaper like you

1823
01:08:41,079 --> 01:08:46,448
know I literally got told two days ago

1824
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:48,250
by a writer who froze he grows really

1825
01:08:46,448 --> 01:08:51,099
good organic stuff and

1826
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:54,009
if he gives away super chief in my

1827
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:55,449
opinion like crazy chief like like he's

1828
01:08:54,009 --> 01:08:59,680
barely I think he's probably just

1829
01:08:55,448 --> 01:09:01,479
covering his bare minimums yeah and he

1830
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:03,670
was saying like yeah like he was giving

1831
01:09:01,479 --> 01:09:07,899
this girl like for one ounce a month and

1832
01:09:03,670 --> 01:09:10,779
then all of a sudden she's needs to it's

1833
01:09:07,899 --> 01:09:12,219
just like he he like agreed to do it at

1834
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:13,900
first but then he just realized that

1835
01:09:12,219 --> 01:09:16,899
what you know she would then just go and

1836
01:09:13,899 --> 01:09:18,608
sell it to a friend yeah just like you

1837
01:09:16,899 --> 01:09:21,818
know just willing to pay like good

1838
01:09:18,609 --> 01:09:26,739
prices for it and it's just like yeah

1839
01:09:21,819 --> 01:09:28,060
that's kind of yeah it's a shame I mean

1840
01:09:26,738 --> 01:09:30,159
there's always gonna be people out there

1841
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:34,989
looking to rip you off wherever they can

1842
01:09:30,159 --> 01:09:36,479
and yeah I mean some of some of the the

1843
01:09:34,988 --> 01:09:41,048
rest of us kind of half can prop it up

1844
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:42,068
it's a shame well I guess one thing I

1845
01:09:41,048 --> 01:09:44,619
always think about because I actually am

1846
01:09:42,069 --> 01:09:49,210
I was around at a friend's house today

1847
01:09:44,619 --> 01:09:51,759
and the can a koala and the Oz can a

1848
01:09:49,210 --> 01:09:56,050
lady well know if you rare those guys

1849
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:58,738
from Instagram we're there and they're

1850
01:09:56,050 --> 01:10:06,430
there brings gonna start bringing some

1851
01:09:58,738 --> 01:10:09,519
CBD isolate and I mean hemp produce

1852
01:10:06,430 --> 01:10:13,060
isolate it's your opinion on that I mean

1853
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:14,530
is it is it any different from CBD

1854
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:16,960
isolate that would be produced from a

1855
01:10:14,529 --> 01:10:17,769
cannabis plant I honestly haven't really

1856
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:21,969
nothing to it

1857
01:10:17,770 --> 01:10:26,230
but from the briefings I have read yeah

1858
01:10:21,969 --> 01:10:28,600
it seems to suggest that CBD derived

1859
01:10:26,229 --> 01:10:31,149
from cannabis would be much better

1860
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:33,219
because assuming you know talking about

1861
01:10:31,149 --> 01:10:34,960
like knowing on percent like you know

1862
01:10:33,219 --> 01:10:37,630
like like stuff that looks like crystal

1863
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:39,520
meth basically yes you know at that

1864
01:10:37,630 --> 01:10:40,810
point it's all the same you know it

1865
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:42,520
really doesn't get out of where it's

1866
01:10:40,810 --> 01:10:45,340
come from it's yeah right knowing I'm

1867
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:47,800
sensivity yeah but if it's like some

1868
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:50,469
kind of extract like a dab type thing

1869
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:51,810
from a plant would be way better because

1870
01:10:50,469 --> 01:10:53,939
we know that

1871
01:10:51,810 --> 01:10:56,580
the you know all the the other

1872
01:10:53,939 --> 01:10:59,639
components of their plans such as you

1873
01:10:56,579 --> 01:11:02,309
know the flavonoids and the turbines all

1874
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:05,160
of these things synergize with the

1875
01:11:02,310 --> 01:11:07,890
cannabinoids so yeah it it makes sense

1876
01:11:05,159 --> 01:11:11,550
that you know THC base weed which has

1877
01:11:07,890 --> 01:11:13,380
got the right THC the right cannabinoid

1878
01:11:11,550 --> 01:11:15,900
profile and flavonoids yeah I think

1879
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:18,180
that'd be better and I think that um who

1880
01:11:15,899 --> 01:11:20,819
is a CBD crew the good ones is like

1881
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:22,590
there's a CBD crew and CBD seeds and one

1882
01:11:20,819 --> 01:11:24,029
of them's like a [ __ ] jerk and one of

1883
01:11:22,590 --> 01:11:27,210
them's like Shanti Barber and that one's

1884
01:11:24,029 --> 01:11:29,880
like legit those guys offer Australian

1885
01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:33,060
cord CBD Devine and it's apparently the

1886
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:36,390
first strain that's derived from a

1887
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:39,810
cannabis plant not not him that has like

1888
01:11:36,390 --> 01:11:41,280
zero percent THC and like 16% CBD and

1889
01:11:39,810 --> 01:11:42,720
it's got like yeah well and it looks

1890
01:11:41,279 --> 01:11:44,579
like a cannabis plant and it's like

1891
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:47,100
apparently got pretty good tips so I

1892
01:11:44,579 --> 01:11:49,619
couldn't the extract would be good I

1893
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:51,630
smoked some really nice other were the

1894
01:11:49,619 --> 01:11:56,970
two CBD strains at the farm last year

1895
01:11:51,630 --> 01:11:59,250
there was some Swiss and maybe it was my

1896
01:11:56,970 --> 01:12:01,199
remember spot it was a spider web which

1897
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:05,609
was like something from from Charlotte's

1898
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:08,539
Web yeah and I mean they were they were

1899
01:12:05,609 --> 01:12:12,149
delicious one of them had a super low

1900
01:12:08,539 --> 01:12:16,229
CBD super low THC m1 had a kind of

1901
01:12:12,149 --> 01:12:18,269
higher CBD and medium THC and though

1902
01:12:16,229 --> 01:12:20,759
they're really lovely like the taste the

1903
01:12:18,270 --> 01:12:25,530
smell profile were absolutely delicious

1904
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:27,900
but the buds themselves were like we're

1905
01:12:25,529 --> 01:12:32,420
considerably different to like normal

1906
01:12:27,899 --> 01:12:34,589
cannabis buds too in that they kind of

1907
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:36,060
they didn't have as much structure to

1908
01:12:34,590 --> 01:12:39,180
them that could have been a part of the

1909
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:41,430
grow as well so yeah okay I mean I've

1910
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:42,690
got a 1 to 1 CBD strain I grow but it

1911
01:12:41,430 --> 01:12:44,520
didn't look like regular weight but I

1912
01:12:42,689 --> 01:12:48,119
think it yeah one to one level it

1913
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:52,140
probably would yeah yeah yeah I haven't

1914
01:12:48,119 --> 01:12:54,180
really seen what the end product of what

1915
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:55,530
they're making this the hemp extractions

1916
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:57,240
look like like whether there's any

1917
01:12:55,529 --> 01:12:59,189
appreciable I mean they probably FB

1918
01:12:57,239 --> 01:13:01,710
calyx is like individually stacked on

1919
01:12:59,189 --> 01:13:02,829
top of each other but yeah yeah but I

1920
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:06,670
mean

1921
01:13:02,829 --> 01:13:09,550
this is a quick note I still wasn't

1922
01:13:06,670 --> 01:13:11,260
aware that you were able to import CBD I

1923
01:13:09,550 --> 01:13:12,850
thought there was still some weird my

1924
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:16,720
little restriction about it

1925
01:13:12,850 --> 01:13:18,250
yeah well as far as I know I think is I

1926
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:21,820
think it's still technically classified

1927
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:23,260
as a poison right that's the way they do

1928
01:13:21,819 --> 01:13:24,789
it where it's like cuz it's like you can

1929
01:13:23,260 --> 01:13:26,110
get prescribed a poison because pretty

1930
01:13:24,789 --> 01:13:26,529
much every drug is listed as a fourth

1931
01:13:26,109 --> 01:13:29,949
yeah

1932
01:13:26,529 --> 01:13:32,619
yeah but you can't import poisons so I

1933
01:13:29,949 --> 01:13:34,689
wasn't wondering if and this is with no

1934
01:13:32,619 --> 01:13:39,599
research backing it up but if it wasn't

1935
01:13:34,689 --> 01:13:42,399
to do with the change from the foods for

1936
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:44,910
Australia New Zealand reclassifying hand

1937
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:47,069
I don't know if that changed some of the

1938
01:13:44,909 --> 01:13:51,689
availability if it's all hemp derived

1939
01:13:47,069 --> 01:13:54,729
yeah actually I mean in the sense that

1940
01:13:51,689 --> 01:13:56,229
yeah that actually probably works um I

1941
01:13:54,729 --> 01:13:59,289
just think that you might have to derive

1942
01:13:56,229 --> 01:14:00,579
it it might have to make it here you

1943
01:13:59,289 --> 01:14:06,729
know there may might he just just press

1944
01:14:00,579 --> 01:14:08,380
it here yeah I mean it's gonna it's if

1945
01:14:06,729 --> 01:14:10,539
that's the case like if that is the

1946
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:12,970
workaround that now that hemp is you can

1947
01:14:10,539 --> 01:14:15,519
consume it so now you can start to make

1948
01:14:12,970 --> 01:14:16,990
hemp-based extraction things I mean it's

1949
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:20,680
gonna be interesting to see what happens

1950
01:14:16,989 --> 01:14:24,579
in terms of that market here yeah it's

1951
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:26,050
it's interesting I I don't know if it'll

1952
01:14:24,579 --> 01:14:27,579
be game-changing you know I think it'll

1953
01:14:26,050 --> 01:14:30,250
be game-changing for like you know

1954
01:14:27,579 --> 01:14:33,670
epileptic kids and stuff like that yeah

1955
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:35,859
I I just I always have to remind people

1956
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:39,659
the reason why I grow a one-to-one

1957
01:14:35,859 --> 01:14:43,149
strain is because as far as we can say

1958
01:14:39,659 --> 01:14:46,000
one-to-one seems to be arguably the most

1959
01:14:43,149 --> 01:14:49,029
therapeutic ratio yeah the reason for

1960
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:52,090
that is because if you look at all the

1961
01:14:49,029 --> 01:14:54,340
different symptoms and spectrums of

1962
01:14:52,090 --> 01:14:57,220
disorders that cannabis treats it

1963
01:14:54,340 --> 01:14:58,840
appears that THC tends to treat the

1964
01:14:57,220 --> 01:15:00,670
large majority of the minutes only

1965
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:03,010
actually a very small amount that are

1966
01:15:00,670 --> 01:15:04,810
exclusively traded by CBD so what that

1967
01:15:03,010 --> 01:15:07,090
means is there's only a small amount of

1968
01:15:04,810 --> 01:15:09,700
diseases where you absolutely need CBD

1969
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:14,380
but the largest amount of them actually

1970
01:15:09,699 --> 01:15:15,769
benefit from having both THC and CBD so

1971
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:17,630
yeah so example

1972
01:15:15,770 --> 01:15:19,640
the real epileptic kids those are one of

1973
01:15:17,630 --> 01:15:22,579
the ones who exclusively benefit from

1974
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:25,250
the CVT but most people I think they

1975
01:15:22,579 --> 01:15:26,869
actually don't get benefits for most

1976
01:15:25,250 --> 01:15:28,760
like I'm pretty sure like the glaucoma

1977
01:15:26,869 --> 01:15:33,529
people for example like you actually you

1978
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:36,739
need the THC more so than the CBD in

1979
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:39,859
that case yeah and I think even in in

1980
01:15:36,739 --> 01:15:41,809
some of the cases of kids with with

1981
01:15:39,859 --> 01:15:44,210
epilepsy and things like that think

1982
01:15:41,810 --> 01:15:45,770
further into their treatment like years

1983
01:15:44,210 --> 01:15:47,720
down the line they're finding that

1984
01:15:45,770 --> 01:15:50,510
they're happening to up the THC a little

1985
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:52,670
bit as well yeah exactly I think that

1986
01:15:50,510 --> 01:15:56,570
they're it's really synergistic together

1987
01:15:52,670 --> 01:15:58,430
so yeah so yeah that's which and that

1988
01:15:56,569 --> 01:16:01,399
that plays into it all you know like in

1989
01:15:58,430 --> 01:16:03,110
my opinion I'm really really quite

1990
01:16:01,399 --> 01:16:05,269
skeptical of the current medical saying

1991
01:16:03,109 --> 01:16:07,219
we have because it's it's like a seems

1992
01:16:05,270 --> 01:16:11,380
like a big fast to me you know it's like

1993
01:16:07,220 --> 01:16:14,810
scary and and I'm literally counting on

1994
01:16:11,380 --> 01:16:17,630
the you know I guess the government so

1995
01:16:14,810 --> 01:16:20,300
to speak to increase the penalties on

1996
01:16:17,630 --> 01:16:22,100
growing after the whole schemes kind of

1997
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:23,989
fully rolled out sort of speaking that

1998
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:26,660
they'll do exactly what they did in

1999
01:16:23,989 --> 01:16:29,119
America where it they'll say anyone who

2000
01:16:26,659 --> 01:16:31,550
needs it now has access everyone else

2001
01:16:29,119 --> 01:16:33,289
yes still growing is just a criminal and

2002
01:16:31,550 --> 01:16:35,659
even worst criminal potentially yeah

2003
01:16:33,289 --> 01:16:38,390
like just doing it for the money so yeah

2004
01:16:35,659 --> 01:16:41,059
so yeah so I in my opinion like you've

2005
01:16:38,390 --> 01:16:43,340
really gotta be steadfast in the right

2006
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:45,289
to grow your own has to be like the

2007
01:16:43,340 --> 01:16:48,260
number one thing like if you don't have

2008
01:16:45,289 --> 01:16:49,939
the right to grow for yourself I did I

2009
01:16:48,260 --> 01:16:52,670
don't think I would compromise for that

2010
01:16:49,939 --> 01:16:54,349
because even in even in the states you

2011
01:16:52,670 --> 01:16:56,569
know we can both attest to this even in

2012
01:16:54,350 --> 01:17:00,590
a mark even a place where you can grow

2013
01:16:56,569 --> 01:17:02,960
yourself there's so much issues with you

2014
01:17:00,590 --> 01:17:05,449
know it not being grown correctly like

2015
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:07,850
in like a medical sense yeah and so it's

2016
01:17:05,449 --> 01:17:09,949
like if it was exclusively up to like

2017
01:17:07,850 --> 01:17:12,020
Marlboro or whatever what hope in hell

2018
01:17:09,949 --> 01:17:15,319
do you have that they give a [ __ ] about

2019
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:18,440
your health exactly yeah

2020
01:17:15,319 --> 01:17:22,369
no it's it's pretty crazy man like I

2021
01:17:18,439 --> 01:17:24,710
still just get blown away at like how

2022
01:17:22,369 --> 01:17:26,750
our laws are shaping up here but I think

2023
01:17:24,710 --> 01:17:29,060
we're gonna have to go through like a

2024
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:29,390
kind of a dark period where it's gonna

2025
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:32,030
be

2026
01:17:29,390 --> 01:17:36,230
like that and it's gonna be mad control

2027
01:17:32,029 --> 01:17:40,159
before actual decriminalization and

2028
01:17:36,229 --> 01:17:41,719
recreational use comes in but it's gonna

2029
01:17:40,159 --> 01:17:46,239
I think that I think we're in store for

2030
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:49,820
like a few years of dark crappy weird

2031
01:17:46,239 --> 01:17:53,300
reform after reform of bizarre cannabis

2032
01:17:49,819 --> 01:17:54,909
law yeah and I mean I think I would

2033
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:57,020
probably agree with that and the

2034
01:17:54,909 --> 01:17:58,399
interesting part about it is like how we

2035
01:17:57,020 --> 01:18:00,290
referenced earlier there's almost like

2036
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:02,449
two sides to the spectrum there's like

2037
01:18:00,289 --> 01:18:07,479
the political side of it and then

2038
01:18:02,449 --> 01:18:10,010
there's just the actual kind of

2039
01:18:07,479 --> 01:18:11,719
underground production side of it and

2040
01:18:10,010 --> 01:18:14,659
that we could for example as a whole

2041
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:17,270
community just as a hypothetical we let

2042
01:18:14,659 --> 01:18:19,309
you know what no one's gonna try to be

2043
01:18:17,270 --> 01:18:21,170
active in campaigning for law change

2044
01:18:19,310 --> 01:18:23,210
instead everyone's just gonna try to

2045
01:18:21,170 --> 01:18:25,130
focus on going the dankest way possible

2046
01:18:23,210 --> 01:18:27,109
you know what I mean

2047
01:18:25,130 --> 01:18:29,329
and yeah or you could do the opposite

2048
01:18:27,109 --> 01:18:31,189
and it's like neither one of those would

2049
01:18:29,329 --> 01:18:32,630
be I mean I think the first situation

2050
01:18:31,189 --> 01:18:33,919
would probably better like you know like

2051
01:18:32,630 --> 01:18:35,539
it's really illegal and you've got good

2052
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:37,310
weed as opposed to having it legal but

2053
01:18:35,539 --> 01:18:40,699
everyone's just smoking PTR's

2054
01:18:37,310 --> 01:18:42,020
yeah but you know what I mean so in my

2055
01:18:40,699 --> 01:18:44,960
mind it's like whoa

2056
01:18:42,020 --> 01:18:46,970
I accept that there's that political

2057
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:48,680
instability which essentially means like

2058
01:18:46,970 --> 01:18:50,360
you know all your work could be for

2059
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:51,860
nothing so it's like that's why I think

2060
01:18:50,359 --> 01:18:54,199
it's like you've got to push that other

2061
01:18:51,859 --> 01:18:56,420
end of the coin so hard because it's it

2062
01:18:54,199 --> 01:18:57,559
what if it's just like the other way

2063
01:18:56,420 --> 01:18:59,210
around where it's like we get to the

2064
01:18:57,560 --> 01:19:01,460
point where weed is so dank and

2065
01:18:59,210 --> 01:19:03,170
everyone's smoking dank weed that it's

2066
01:19:01,460 --> 01:19:06,739
just like [ __ ] this needs to be legal

2067
01:19:03,170 --> 01:19:09,199
like and with you know that's what might

2068
01:19:06,739 --> 01:19:11,149
be what pushes it over in the end yeah

2069
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:13,010
like maybe and I mean I think it would

2070
01:19:11,149 --> 01:19:14,629
be a lot more complex and I think a big

2071
01:19:13,010 --> 01:19:18,380
thing would be labor getting in power to

2072
01:19:14,630 --> 01:19:20,449
be honest yeah but but even then you

2073
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:22,670
know like that's that's just like a

2074
01:19:20,449 --> 01:19:24,109
minor point but I think yeah like I've

2075
01:19:22,670 --> 01:19:25,609
always thought that and that's a part of

2076
01:19:24,109 --> 01:19:26,899
the reason why I breathe it's because

2077
01:19:25,609 --> 01:19:29,449
it's like I just thought yeah like if

2078
01:19:26,899 --> 01:19:32,119
everyone could smoke dank weed hopefully

2079
01:19:29,449 --> 01:19:34,309
they would then have the knowledge and

2080
01:19:32,119 --> 01:19:35,819
the willpower to say no to PGI's and

2081
01:19:34,310 --> 01:19:38,190
then that's like how you get it out

2082
01:19:35,819 --> 01:19:40,259
you can also get good flavors since the

2083
01:19:38,189 --> 01:19:41,669
community so yeah it's an interesting

2084
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:44,340
one right yeah you've got to push that

2085
01:19:41,670 --> 01:19:46,500
side of the coin always I mean

2086
01:19:44,340 --> 01:19:50,940
Australia's still caught up with some

2087
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:52,859
really bad preconceived notions of weed

2088
01:19:50,939 --> 01:19:54,539
smokers as well you know that it's still

2089
01:19:52,859 --> 01:19:57,328
got a really bad rap there they managed

2090
01:19:54,539 --> 01:20:00,868
to be down in in a lot of parts of the

2091
01:19:57,328 --> 01:20:03,359
US you know that whole reefer madness it

2092
01:20:00,868 --> 01:20:05,429
really sunk in in like in my parents

2093
01:20:03,359 --> 01:20:08,279
generation you know it's it's it's

2094
01:20:05,429 --> 01:20:09,840
pretty hardcore whereas in the states

2095
01:20:08,279 --> 01:20:12,719
you see people of my parents generation

2096
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:14,310
even later in life I mean California is

2097
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:16,618
different be starting to see it around

2098
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:17,880
the all around America now where people

2099
01:20:16,618 --> 01:20:20,639
later in life is starting to really

2100
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:24,989
break down their preconceived notions

2101
01:20:20,639 --> 01:20:28,710
about cannabis yeah totally hey just I

2102
01:20:24,988 --> 01:20:30,750
just feel like it's a bit of a weird

2103
01:20:28,710 --> 01:20:34,050
statement to make but I feel like on the

2104
01:20:30,750 --> 01:20:35,609
whole the older generation of Australia

2105
01:20:34,050 --> 01:20:38,310
more conservative than the older

2106
01:20:35,609 --> 01:20:40,049
generation in America yes and I think

2107
01:20:38,310 --> 01:20:41,310
that's like I mean on the outlying end

2108
01:20:40,050 --> 01:20:42,840
of the spectrum definitely not you know

2109
01:20:41,310 --> 01:20:44,699
there's definitely some really [ __ ]

2110
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:46,319
conservative outliers in America fight

2111
01:20:44,698 --> 01:20:48,839
yeah if you look at the general masses

2112
01:20:46,319 --> 01:20:50,130
and so it's really one of those programs

2113
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:51,510
where it's like you hate to say but as I

2114
01:20:50,130 --> 01:20:54,929
we just need the old people to die off

2115
01:20:51,510 --> 01:21:00,300
and you know I mean obviously not

2116
01:20:54,929 --> 01:21:01,710
literally but yeah we will see that will

2117
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:04,679
see that change coming in that

2118
01:21:01,710 --> 01:21:08,069
generational change come in you know

2119
01:21:04,679 --> 01:21:09,929
it's it's that's like 2025 years away

2120
01:21:08,069 --> 01:21:12,929
though you know so hopefully that's not

2121
01:21:09,929 --> 01:21:14,550
half photo a cannabis reform is yeah

2122
01:21:12,929 --> 01:21:16,109
it'll be like a trickle-down thing where

2123
01:21:14,550 --> 01:21:18,119
like you'll see that one person in

2124
01:21:16,109 --> 01:21:19,319
Parliament start to really support it

2125
01:21:18,118 --> 01:21:22,559
and then you know and then it just

2126
01:21:19,319 --> 01:21:25,349
starts yeah along with and the others

2127
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:27,030
lose their numbers yeah and and that's

2128
01:21:25,349 --> 01:21:29,520
you know typically how it's happened

2129
01:21:27,029 --> 01:21:31,698
around the world so and it's playing out

2130
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:33,960
all around the world so it's you know

2131
01:21:31,698 --> 01:21:36,368
they could surprise me and it could

2132
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:44,920
could really happen quicker

2133
01:21:36,368 --> 01:21:47,889
