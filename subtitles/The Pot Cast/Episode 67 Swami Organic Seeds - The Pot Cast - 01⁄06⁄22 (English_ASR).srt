question we love to ask our guests what

78
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,400
have you been smoking on lately well you

79
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:20,959
know I just had some nl5as

80
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,959
along with the Fosters bro

81
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,580
God that's so funny that you bring up

82
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,140
The Fosters it's like uh I don't know if

83
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,760
you know this but like it's it's not

84
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:32,158
really sold in Australia but it's sold

85
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:34,560
everywhere outside of Australia

86
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:39,060
yeah I'm not I'm not a real big fan of

87
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:41,340
it but you know I just there it was you

88
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,259
know I appreciate it you know putting in

89
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,598
the uh the effort for the Australian

90
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:47,039
chat I love it okay and it's it's so

91
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:48,719
interesting that you mentioned that

92
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:51,298
you're smoking the nl5 haze you know

93
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:53,400
it's uh such a sort of trending strain

94
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:55,319
at the moment how would you describe the

95
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,539
effect of that

96
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:59,878
well it just depends on who you are

97
00:03:57,539 --> 00:04:01,679
really because it's quite introspective

98
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:03,479
you know

99
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,340
um I wouldn't recommend it for anybody

100
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:06,719
with anxiety issues I wouldn't recommend

101
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,658
it for anybody

102
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:12,419
who has any kind of bipolar or mental

103
00:04:09,658 --> 00:04:14,579
disorders or anything like that because

104
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:16,680
it can take a normal human being and

105
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:19,139
turn them into a freaking nut in a in

106
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,358
seconds they'll they'll be walking

107
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:23,340
through glass they'll be dry they'll be

108
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:26,279
crashing the ditch you know they'll

109
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:28,019
forget to water the dog they'll it's

110
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:31,258
just one of those things and that's why

111
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:33,240
that the warning is still there you know

112
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:35,340
and it's I don't find it extremely

113
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,040
comfortable to smoke it but I'll take a

114
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:40,679
poll here and there you know just it's

115
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:43,259
it's a it's a good tasking thing if you

116
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,220
don't get too far into it you know

117
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:46,740
laughs

118
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,720
okay interesting yeah I know that for a

119
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:50,699
number of years I certainly really

120
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,979
couldn't go near some of the strongest

121
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:55,139
sativas I enjoy nowadays

122
00:04:52,978 --> 00:04:56,639
um and I I think that in part that was

123
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:59,040
probably because I had a lot of sort of

124
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,900
general anxiety at that time

125
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,639
but interesting nowadays it's sort of

126
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:04,739
one of those things I gravitate to more

127
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,600
so it's it's funny I imagine having a

128
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,519
conversation with myself you know five

129
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,699
ten years ago and like you couldn't pay

130
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:13,680
me to smoke

131
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:16,500
right and and you you really hit the

132
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,000
nail on the head right there it's it's a

133
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,000
state of mind

134
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,240
it you know I can smoke anything

135
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,978
you know around the globe oh no I'm

136
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,060
there's nothing to be afraid of

137
00:05:25,978 --> 00:05:29,758
ever

138
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:32,660
it's all what Society put there oh it's

139
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:35,520
illegal oh no it's illegal so

140
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:37,680
automatically your brain's set up for

141
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:40,680
failure you know

142
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,699
so if you avoid those those thought

143
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:46,500
processes of of

144
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:48,478
oppressing nature then you're gonna do

145
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,860
well you're gonna do way better and then

146
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:52,500
you can do anything in the world you

147
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,300
know smoke anything smoke smoke all the

148
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,399
Highland ties smoke all the Africans

149
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,978
yeah it's going to give you some anxiety

150
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:01,019
but you know if you're skilled at what

151
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:02,279
you do you're gonna find a way to deal

152
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:04,680
with it and you're going to go out and

153
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:06,299
put that to use you know

154
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,579
yeah that's interesting like yeah

155
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,978
finding a way to make it work for you I

156
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:12,418
certainly can jive with that I would be

157
00:06:10,978 --> 00:06:13,978
interested to know because I was I was

158
00:06:12,418 --> 00:06:16,079
pondering this last night as I was

159
00:06:13,978 --> 00:06:18,300
writing some questions for our chat I've

160
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:20,099
spoken to a few people who have sort of

161
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,478
touched on this idea but never fully

162
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,960
gone there so I wanted to ask you

163
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:27,779
specifically do you think nl5 Haze is

164
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:30,000
one of if not the ultimate expression of

165
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:33,179
cannabis no

166
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,939
it's just one of those things that made

167
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:38,160
its way into history at a time when uh

168
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:40,079
the DEA was really harsh on on everybody

169
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,620
in the United States you know and how

170
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:45,599
Neville introduced the nlives there and

171
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:48,600
all that to us over here in the United

172
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,280
States that really changed the game over

173
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,620
here I grew up in the Pacific Northwest

174
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:54,119
I know what roadkill skunk was I know we

175
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,899
were buying bags in Northern Lights

176
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,819
where you know it was all here but what

177
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:02,219
dominated everything here was killer

178
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:05,100
green butt it sidelined in all five Haze

179
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:07,139
and anything that came around you know

180
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:09,600
because all the local Growers are

181
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:11,819
growing this Puget North you know this

182
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,500
this Puget weed whatever the hell that

183
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:16,680
was

184
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:18,000
but it's it's it's just different it's

185
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,098
totally different

186
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,259
I've been wondering this myself for the

187
00:07:20,098 --> 00:07:25,319
past week or so is killer green but the

188
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:26,699
same as Kentucky Bluegrass you know I

189
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,560
just don't know because it's possible

190
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:30,060
that somebody actually did take

191
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,459
something out of the Pacific Northwest

192
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,500
back then but when we were growing up as

193
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:36,299
kids it was everywhere that's all you

194
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,879
had that was all you bought everybody

195
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,939
was growing it it was everywhere and it

196
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:43,800
had a really pungent Indica kind of it

197
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:45,120
was it reminded me of California Orange

198
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,340
quite a bit

199
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,439
you know but it had more of a garlic

200
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:51,418
thing going on and it's very well could

201
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,579
be uh in our lines and in that killer

202
00:07:51,418 --> 00:07:56,219
green Bud too my parents knew Steve

203
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:58,859
Murphy too oh okay you think maybe it

204
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:01,500
comes from Steve Murphy I don't know you

205
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:04,139
know he what he gave people it spread

206
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,939
around and the Imports had a lot to do

207
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:07,978
with it too because the Brotherhood

208
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:11,939
Imports were coming up there you know my

209
00:08:07,978 --> 00:08:13,620
parents had Panama Colombian Thai stick

210
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:15,120
I remember being in fifth grade and

211
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:19,139
unraveling

212
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:22,860
the the twine off the Thai stick man you

213
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:24,598
know we smoked that [ __ ] and

214
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:27,479
oh boy I thought I was in trouble for

215
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:29,038
the next Universe you know oh man I

216
00:08:27,478 --> 00:08:31,439
think everyone listening to this right

217
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:33,479
now is a little bit collectively jealous

218
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:36,418
of your childhood after hearing that

219
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:37,919
well it was my parents that had a lot to

220
00:08:36,418 --> 00:08:40,860
do with it I was born into the culture

221
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:44,218
you know my dad unloaded tankers of a

222
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:46,139
Mexican weed in North Hollywood in 1966

223
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:48,839
at 18 years old and got paid by my

224
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:50,699
grandpa to do it so it's just been

225
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:53,160
something that was in the family for a

226
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,440
long time just working with the biker

227
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:57,120
side of the the gig the Brotherhood of

228
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,700
Euro love what people don't realize is

229
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,019
they were bikers and Surfers and they'd

230
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,540
made a pact

231
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:04,860
to work with each other not work against

232
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:06,958
each other

233
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,220
so that's what they call the Brotherhood

234
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:11,759
of eternal love

235
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:13,259
yeah often we hear Hell's Angels thrown

236
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:15,059
around do you think that it was like

237
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:16,500
sort of them and then a group of hippies

238
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:18,179
and they combined together and then that

239
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,879
made the Brotherhood

240
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:23,458
it was up in the Pacific Northwest it

241
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:25,379
was specifically the bandito's faction

242
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:27,479
of the Hell's Angels yes

243
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:29,100
you know many nights I'd wake up when I

244
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,980
was a kid and they just all roll out

245
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,659
there you know 300 strongest and fire

246
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:36,120
off all their oozies and just just leave

247
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:37,620
you know but that's who brought us the

248
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,720
Roadkill

249
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,519
that's who brought the roadkill out to

250
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:45,120
us and I remember seeing it growing when

251
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,860
you know in 1981 82 I remember watering

252
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,419
the plants I remember picking buds off

253
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,399
the plants and taking them to school and

254
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:52,139
smoking them with my friends you know

255
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,259
that's how I got busted with this stuff

256
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:57,360
oh wow wow so many Avenues we're gonna

257
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:59,159
have to loot back on I guess before we

258
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,360
get into the roadkill skunk too much

259
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:02,458
because I would love to pick your brain

260
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,220
on it I just wanted to quickly ask the

261
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:08,399
KGB the killer green Bud any speculation

262
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:11,700
as to what the genetics might have been

263
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,860
it was in Afghani probably a Mexican

264
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,879
because you know they're or Colombian I

265
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,139
would say too

266
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:17,639
you know

267
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:19,439
because there was a lot of Colombian

268
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:21,179
Imports most of the herb that was coming

269
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,200
in back then in the late 70s was

270
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:25,439
Colombian

271
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,660
Brown dark black Colombian

272
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,399
cheap plentiful

273
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:30,719
fat sacks

274
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:33,360
good weed

275
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,160
yeah wow and just because I'm a little

276
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,080
out of touch with the timeline was this

277
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:38,639
before like the commercial release of

278
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,580
skunk one

279
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:43,439
oh yeah absolutely you know I I hadn't I

280
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:47,040
never heard a skunk one until probably

281
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,720
1987 or 88. and by then I was already

282
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:52,078
incarcer had already gone through the

283
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,600
ringer with roadkill you know and when

284
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:57,000
skunk one came out and I smelled it and

285
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,339
I grew it and I looked at it man

286
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,100
I thought it was a joke you know because

287
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:04,440
it wasn't skunk at all it was just a

288
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,659
plant that seemed to melt under every

289
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,519
condition that we put it in it would

290
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:11,039
melt in the frost it would melt in the

291
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:12,600
heat it would melt and just melt you

292
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:13,980
know these these weren't

293
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,079
these were at the Pacific Northwest

294
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:18,920
genetics that we knew

295
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:21,899
yeah I've never been a fan and still not

296
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:24,599
it's just not a real story so what what

297
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:26,820
is the rks to you is it like a pure

298
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,940
Afghani how would you describe it

299
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:32,879
it was probably yeah

300
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:35,160
the HC says it was a pure Afghani and I

301
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:38,519
believe him because everything he told

302
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:40,740
me corresponds to timeline that my

303
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:43,560
parents were associated with this gig

304
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:46,019
so I trust what he's saying and I would

305
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:48,958
say he's probably right that it's a pure

306
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:49,620
Afghani but it could have an import in

307
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,659
it

308
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,278
we don't know when I was growing those

309
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:55,980
plants in 81

310
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:58,919
they were thin okay they were thin Leaf

311
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:01,259
they weren't wide fat leaves and they

312
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:03,778
would get black and green when the cold

313
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:06,659
hit them lots of purple in the buds you

314
00:12:03,778 --> 00:12:08,458
know uh more of a Christmas tree Indica

315
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:10,860
profile like if you look at the old

316
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:13,979
catalogs the old indicators they looked

317
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:15,659
a lot like that it was probably a Hindu

318
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,100
one of the things we've heard from other

319
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:18,719
people who have come on the show is

320
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,860
obviously they're not stating it with

321
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,019
certainty but they've said you know

322
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:24,600
there might have been a few things that

323
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:26,879
had that Aroma and you know not just one

324
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,839
specific clone where do you sit on that

325
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:31,019
one

326
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,399
absolutely you know if I've I've grown

327
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:34,078
just about everything from around the

328
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,480
world you know

329
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:40,799
um and not just one or two at a time I

330
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:43,800
grow a bunch and um I've seen a lot of

331
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:45,240
the that skunk pop up in a lot of

332
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:48,838
different things but what I see it pop

333
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:51,419
up in most is uh unmolested Hindu type

334
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:55,200
stuff you know the higher altitude

335
00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:58,139
Afghani Pakistan Hindu stuff just that's

336
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,120
where I see it yeah okay and you know

337
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:01,740
people often say that the reason why

338
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,778
roadkill disappeared was because people

339
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:07,019
were getting busted is is that your

340
00:13:03,778 --> 00:13:09,240
thoughts on why we sort of saw it vanish

341
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:11,399
um it's probably at least 70 to 80

342
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:14,399
percent of the reason yeah

343
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:17,159
because it was so loud it was so stinky

344
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:19,679
man you were just done you're done

345
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:21,120
you're not getting away you know they're

346
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:23,120
gonna track you down

347
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,100
percent

348
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,419
yeah it was impossible it really was it

349
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,639
was quite difficult

350
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:31,620
yeah look I can only imagine pre-carbon

351
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:34,799
filters the anxiety level must have been

352
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:37,139
through the roof well it I got cracked I

353
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:39,419
did two weeks in juvie for it

354
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:41,940
so you know and we did know Growers that

355
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:44,039
were getting cracked and and you'd be

356
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,940
driving down the street and smell it you

357
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:48,059
know

358
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:49,860
you just knew that house right there you

359
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:52,799
know

360
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:54,778
so we we've seen like a huge over the

361
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:56,699
past probably three four years now this

362
00:13:54,778 --> 00:13:58,919
huge Resurgence in people looking for

363
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:00,778
the roadkill skunk do you think it's the

364
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:04,078
type of thing where we will ever find it

365
00:14:00,778 --> 00:14:05,700
again and if we do would you think we

366
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:08,159
should try to breed it from scratch

367
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,839
again or go back on Old seeds and try to

368
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:13,439
hunt it through that

369
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:16,139
well I've done both I've I've I have a

370
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,459
five-year rks project going now and

371
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:18,419
we're all just about done with it

372
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:21,119
actually

373
00:14:18,419 --> 00:14:22,799
and um we looked at a lot of stuff man

374
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,560
we went through a lot of things a lot of

375
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:27,719
Old Land races a lot of old types uh

376
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:28,919
and it just boiled back down to the

377
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,800
original lines

378
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:35,278
it really did you know so

379
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:38,639
but of course I had to outcross to get

380
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:41,578
it back you know I'm using

381
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:44,698
and 85 humble roadkill that was taken to

382
00:14:41,578 --> 00:14:46,259
Mexico in 1985 dude stopped by Humboldt

383
00:14:44,698 --> 00:14:48,359
bought a bag went straight to Mexico

384
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:51,120
gave it to his sister

385
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:54,659
smoked the weed took the seeds out of it

386
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,578
gave it to her local farmer who's you

387
00:14:54,659 --> 00:14:58,860
know doing exports

388
00:14:56,578 --> 00:15:01,559
and he crossed it to that type which was

389
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:03,860
a European type Uruapan

390
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:07,198
it's outside of uh

391
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:08,820
oh man I forget but anyway

392
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:11,338
um it's a good reason for growing good

393
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:16,019
herb and it's noted for that

394
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:17,699
the seeds were sent back in 2017 and I

395
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:20,879
only got two males they were pretty big

396
00:15:17,698 --> 00:15:22,979
yeah so you know so I figured I'd just

397
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:25,559
cross up outcross them to my oldest

398
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:28,139
types in the hopes that I could grab

399
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:30,000
that genotype in there somehow by waking

400
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:32,220
it up with these old types

401
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,980
you know with Mr Green jeans cherry bomb

402
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:36,720
with Coots blue Orca and and with this

403
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,699
purple Zeb which had blue mystic in it

404
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,740
and the purple roadkill skunk in there

405
00:15:38,698 --> 00:15:43,078
you know and that one was pretty good

406
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:46,139
but that was more of a poly from Nirvana

407
00:15:43,078 --> 00:15:48,539
than just an old unmolested type

408
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:49,560
you know and it did it worked but it

409
00:15:48,539 --> 00:15:52,139
wasn't

410
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:55,379
I I had to go through a lot of seeds so

411
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:57,720
I did F2 of the blue Orca by the 85

412
00:15:55,379 --> 00:16:01,860
roadkill Uruapan

413
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:03,420
and just search through massively of

414
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,879
those and we found what we were looking

415
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:07,139
for was going Yep this is it this what

416
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:09,360
it looks like this is what it smells

417
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:11,698
like let's hope that if we cross it back

418
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,720
to one of these 63 breeder packs that HC

419
00:16:11,698 --> 00:16:15,240
gave me

420
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,980
that we can wake up that genotype and

421
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,379
that's all we got man

422
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:21,659
honestly

423
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:24,299
unless you're gonna go out there in the

424
00:16:21,659 --> 00:16:26,399
world and go search for unmolested types

425
00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:27,838
for that skunk phenotype and then bring

426
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,698
those types back to the United States

427
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,800
and sit there and work and work them and

428
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:33,778
work them and work them together

429
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:36,059
it's just nobody's ever going to find

430
00:16:33,778 --> 00:16:37,919
that you know

431
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:38,939
unless they don't unless they don't have

432
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:40,198
it

433
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,779
you know

434
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:44,519
yeah it it's interesting because that

435
00:16:42,778 --> 00:16:46,379
that sounds like it could well be a nice

436
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:48,419
recipe for success and we've heard other

437
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:51,120
people sort of use alternative routes

438
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:53,278
and looking through what they consider

439
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,019
to maybe be like really Early Skunk

440
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:57,120
releases I guess I'd be interested in

441
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:58,799
hearing do you know a lot of people say

442
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,959
that at a certain point pretty early on

443
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:04,438
in the grand scheme of things Sam Reddit

444
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:06,539
from stinky to Sweet skunk do you think

445
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:08,459
there ever was a stinky that's what they

446
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:10,798
say but I just don't I think sounds

447
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:13,019
[ __ ] man I think that guy's just

448
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:15,179
[ __ ] dude everything he said he tried to

449
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:18,240
sell out the industry you know he's a

450
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:20,100
known liar I mean he all his stories

451
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,539
don't match anybody else's stories

452
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:23,338
there's people that were here there's

453
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:24,899
people that were there and everything he

454
00:17:23,338 --> 00:17:27,599
says he can just contradict everything

455
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,820
man you know what I mean David Watson is

456
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:33,839
a douche man and that's that's I said

457
00:17:29,819 --> 00:17:36,298
that okay it's all right anyway I don't

458
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:37,980
believe him I think it's [ __ ] you

459
00:17:36,298 --> 00:17:41,460
know because I've seen a lot of types

460
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:45,240
man you know I I know what Colombian

461
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:47,700
does I know what ties do you know I've

462
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,380
worked almost every damn tie yeah so

463
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,179
like to confirm do you think like it

464
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:55,020
always was sweet like there was never

465
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:56,880
this rks prior to the Sweet skunk it

466
00:17:55,019 --> 00:17:59,400
don't have nothing to do with it nothing

467
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,080
to do with it at all none of that it was

468
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,480
it's just [ __ ]

469
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:07,139
if he got a hold of it and bred that out

470
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:08,940
of it he had nothing to do with it

471
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,679
yeah I guess I still see where you're

472
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:13,320
coming from yeah even if he did make the

473
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:15,360
sweet from the rotten he it's sort of by

474
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:17,579
itself saying he didn't make the rotten

475
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:19,319
it was just another claim to fame you

476
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:22,079
know people want to just

477
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:23,939
jump on top and jump on a bandwagon and

478
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:25,740
be the one and the only to have the one

479
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:27,000
and the only whatever it is

480
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,400
you know

481
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,660
either you have it or you don't

482
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,400
you know

483
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:34,440
and it

484
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,820
it's a pig with lipstick or it's the

485
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:42,240
real thing man you know okay

486
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:44,460
um so I'd be interested to to hear your

487
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,140
thoughts on I mean you sort of just

488
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:48,360
touched on Sam and mentioned you're

489
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:49,919
you're not a fan I'd love to hear your

490
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:51,839
thoughts on Neville because he's someone

491
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,059
who more recently we've been hearing

492
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:56,519
thoughts about well I respect Neville

493
00:18:54,058 --> 00:18:58,859
yeah I respect Neville hell yeah because

494
00:18:56,519 --> 00:19:01,019
he was actually a breeder he bred dogs

495
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:03,178
before he bred cannabis so that gives

496
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:04,980
him authenticity

497
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:07,380
okay he's not some dude that just woke

498
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:10,319
up dude I'm gonna be a breeder and open

499
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:12,240
the same company you know cat had an

500
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:14,519
idea and Cat did it

501
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,440
you know he he's not the father of

502
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:20,519
modern breeding for no reason at all

503
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,720
yeah he really was great you know so he

504
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:24,720
knew what he was looking for they say

505
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:26,700
Neville had the eye you know what I mean

506
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,720
when you when they say yeah he's got the

507
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,460
eye

508
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,140
if you got the eye you got the eye you

509
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:34,259
know what you're looking for you see it

510
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:36,059
you know it's they're they're smiling

511
00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:39,240
compared to the ones over here that are

512
00:19:36,058 --> 00:19:41,759
frowning you know you know when you see

513
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,380
it so Neville had the eye

514
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:46,859
you know so he was really good at making

515
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:48,480
selections like like I am or like a lot

516
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:50,879
of other breeders are too

517
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,579
you know they see it they see the hybrid

518
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,039
potential they see the the Vigor they

519
00:19:53,579 --> 00:19:57,480
know what they're looking for

520
00:19:56,038 --> 00:19:58,379
you know and he knew what he was looking

521
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,019
for

522
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,280
and yeah he he he took it to the top

523
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:04,619
didn't he

524
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:06,359
yeah definitely definitely I mean I

525
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:08,339
certainly regard him like yourself as

526
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:10,379
the the father of modern braiding I

527
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:13,079
guess I'd be interested to ask some

528
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:15,660
guests in the past have mentioned that

529
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:17,159
through having known him more closely on

530
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,960
a personal level or maybe friends of

531
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,700
that he might be one of those people

532
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,919
where you need to do a little bit of

533
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:25,200
separating of the uh the art and the

534
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:26,880
artist so to speak have you ever heard

535
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,380
anything like that like you know he's a

536
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,419
great breeder but maybe there was some

537
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:31,260
character flaws any thoughts on that at

538
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:33,600
all

539
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:37,379
well I talked to his best friend every

540
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:39,119
day you know and he's online now because

541
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:41,520
he just resurfaced out of the woodwork

542
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:43,798
from being you know these guys were

543
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:46,679
persecuted internationally

544
00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:48,240
they'd had they were sought after for a

545
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:50,220
long time

546
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,579
by you know

547
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:55,019
and um so people just get tired of it

548
00:20:53,579 --> 00:20:57,359
they get tired of hiding they get tired

549
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:58,859
of seeing all this [ __ ] and they

550
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:00,839
want to pop out of the woodwork and say

551
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:02,339
hey no that didn't happen so before

552
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:05,939
Neville died

553
00:21:02,339 --> 00:21:08,099
he said he told Dwight find me

554
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:09,360
because I'm doing what he was doing I'm

555
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:12,298
doing what Neville was doing I'm

556
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:13,199
focusing on on breeding not magazine

557
00:21:12,298 --> 00:21:15,359
culture

558
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,460
you know I'm not I'm not my head isn't

559
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:19,259
in magazine culture and capitalism and

560
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,880
trying to be the next big thing my

561
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:22,440
head's in breeding and the fascination

562
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,080
that lies in that

563
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:30,360
you know so anyway when I posted my back

564
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:34,619
Cross of the Neville uh nlfi by the 88

565
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:37,500
5 Hayes Neville saw it and he's like oh

566
00:21:34,619 --> 00:21:39,058
that's it right there in the end before

567
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,579
he died he pointed Dwight in my

568
00:21:39,058 --> 00:21:42,658
direction and we got in contact with

569
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:44,158
each other and so we've been

570
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:45,900
communicating each other and sharing

571
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,220
projects and doing things with Neville's

572
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:50,179
last works

573
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:52,860
you know like the Outback Haze and

574
00:21:50,179 --> 00:21:55,620
Neville's Kush and a couple other things

575
00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:57,899
you know

576
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:59,219
um wow would I be able to pull you up

577
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,780
for a quick second and ask you about

578
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:02,339
some of those varieties because I had

579
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:04,079
seen the Outback Hayes mention never

580
00:22:02,339 --> 00:22:05,038
heard of Neville's Kush I'd love to hear

581
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:06,359
a little more

582
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:08,220
well here's the thing about the

583
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:10,678
Neville's Kush is we don't know what the

584
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:12,380
lineage is is because Neville was really

585
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:15,538
sick at the time

586
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:17,760
and he didn't want to bug him you know

587
00:22:15,538 --> 00:22:20,940
hey man what's this

588
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:23,279
you know so we don't know but never

589
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,900
wanted a Kush because that's what

590
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:27,000
everybody was doing in the game so he

591
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,380
said hey I want to make one too so he

592
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,619
did

593
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:34,220
and yeah Dwight has those

594
00:22:31,619 --> 00:22:40,079
and yeah he's he's in with the family

595
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:42,900
the the Neville family is is uh is is

596
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:44,819
I I can't talk about it too much okay I

597
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:47,820
could just say that things are happening

598
00:22:44,819 --> 00:22:50,279
that's all just just for clarification

599
00:22:47,819 --> 00:22:52,500
say are we talking about like his

600
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:54,418
extended friends or like his literal

601
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:57,538
family are sort of doing stuff with his

602
00:22:54,419 --> 00:23:00,600
literal family family and friends ah

603
00:22:57,538 --> 00:23:01,259
that that's exciting he had a son you

604
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:04,219
know

605
00:23:01,259 --> 00:23:07,200
and he's interested

606
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:08,940
wow that would be cool I know that just

607
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,919
out of like you know being Australian I

608
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:13,080
tried to sort of track him down many

609
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:14,940
many years ago and it was very hard but

610
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:16,019
I had always hoped that some news like

611
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,100
this would sort of come out of the

612
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:19,619
Woodworks

613
00:23:17,099 --> 00:23:21,779
oh there's a lot going on man but I

614
00:23:19,619 --> 00:23:24,058
can't talk about it you know it's not my

615
00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:26,759
position but if you interviewed Dwight

616
00:23:24,058 --> 00:23:28,678
you should he might he might talk about

617
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:30,359
some of that you know what I mean I

618
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:31,880
can't I can't overstep my boundaries and

619
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:34,558
and

620
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:38,039
just you know give that information out

621
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:40,500
sure yeah but yeah you know it's it's

622
00:23:38,038 --> 00:23:42,240
it's alive wow that's that's really

623
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:45,000
exciting and and just to loop back

624
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,620
before we move on the Outback Hayes I

625
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,019
think it's one that people are still

626
00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:50,639
sort of learning about it's not super

627
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:52,139
well known are you able to tell us

628
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,179
anything at all about that in terms of

629
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:56,100
maybe the genetics or what it's similar

630
00:23:54,179 --> 00:24:01,140
to at least

631
00:23:56,099 --> 00:24:03,178
well you know it says it's 21 33 and and

632
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:05,580
hampi's tie

633
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:07,200
you know whatever tie that was we don't

634
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:08,639
know

635
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,120
but

636
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:14,159
you look at Thailand and you look at the

637
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:17,158
types in Thailand and for thousands of

638
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,760
years it was the squirrel tail type you

639
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:19,500
know

640
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:22,200
that it was held by Kings and

641
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:24,298
distributed throughout the regions by

642
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,700
the people that held that type and

643
00:24:24,298 --> 00:24:28,139
that's that's the esan province type the

644
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,700
Thai stick

645
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:31,320
those types

646
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,960
but there were other types of course

647
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:35,879
that were you know like the red tie the

648
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,980
blue tie the blah blah blah blah tie the

649
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,659
chocolate tie you know these were

650
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:42,419
developed for export

651
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:44,340
yeah not not the red but the chocolate

652
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:45,840
and the in the Thai stick that was all

653
00:24:44,339 --> 00:24:47,279
that was all export those were export

654
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:49,558
crops

655
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,819
but they were based off of the squirrel

656
00:24:49,558 --> 00:24:53,099
tail variety

657
00:24:50,819 --> 00:24:55,619
and there's like three or four or five

658
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:57,359
different phenotypes of this squirrel

659
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:59,579
tail tie and I think that's probably

660
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:01,019
what it is it's it's a squirrel tail

661
00:24:59,579 --> 00:25:02,699
variety

662
00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:05,879
and Neville liked it

663
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:08,340
you know so I used it so he put it in

664
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:11,640
there and there's probably a tie in the

665
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:14,699
haze so it it matches up great

666
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:16,500
you know wow and I'm I'm feeling a bit

667
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:20,038
out of my depth right now you you said I

668
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:22,679
think you said 21 cross 33 sorry what

669
00:25:20,038 --> 00:25:24,599
were those cultivars that was his Haze

670
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:27,059
ah yeah like the numbered cutting

671
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:28,678
there's photographs of if you look I can

672
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:31,019
find photographs of them and they look

673
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:34,019
nice you know they're like wow that's a

674
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:35,278
nice looking Haze man yeah wow nice and

675
00:25:34,019 --> 00:25:36,839
for some reason I thought when you said

676
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:38,220
the 21 I was like is he talking about

677
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:40,678
Mueller Madness because I think there's

678
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:42,659
a famous 21 cutting of malam or

679
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:45,538
something yeah I grew those that

680
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:49,679
flowering time was too long man what

681
00:25:45,538 --> 00:25:51,900
Neville said sent Dwight his branch of

682
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,480
the Outback he also gave it to other

683
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:59,159
people connoisseur

684
00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:02,220
you know uh and a couple other guys

685
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:04,260
but they they have different lines or

686
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:05,400
different branches of the word so each

687
00:26:04,259 --> 00:26:07,200
one of these guys that have a different

688
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,419
branch of his Outback work have

689
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:12,419
different you know they've put their own

690
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:14,940
selections on it in their own IBL Elling

691
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:16,860
of it and have made it what it is in

692
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:19,380
their own selections so Dwight's is

693
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:21,359
different than connoisseurs and and it's

694
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:24,419
different than whatever whoever else has

695
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:26,240
it in San Francisco and you know

696
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:29,700
so the phenotypic

697
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,740
variations are going to vary depending

698
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,700
on what breeder gets it you know what

699
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:35,278
I'm saying

700
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:38,278
yeah okay so I've already you know like

701
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:39,900
like how I got a hold of the nl2 the R2

702
00:26:38,278 --> 00:26:42,419
you know

703
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:45,538
my selections were different than than

704
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:48,419
Dwight's selections so right there our

705
00:26:45,538 --> 00:26:51,778
line goes in two directions

706
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:54,059
you know so if I keep going down my my

707
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:55,980
path my mind is going to be totally

708
00:26:54,058 --> 00:26:57,778
different than his in three or four

709
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:00,480
generations even though it's a 30-year

710
00:26:57,778 --> 00:27:03,298
ideal and how would you describe your

711
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,819
nl2 I've been lucky enough to try uh

712
00:27:03,298 --> 00:27:07,918
bodhi's thin Leaf nl2 but I've never

713
00:27:05,819 --> 00:27:09,359
tried the more Indica leaning phenotypes

714
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,500
what's your thoughts on the line in

715
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:13,199
general

716
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:15,720
this is the uh I got this line from from

717
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,960
Dwight it's the uh the R2 it's it's

718
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:21,298
popular up in Northern Ontario it's a

719
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,720
30-year IBL of the nl2 that they did

720
00:27:21,298 --> 00:27:26,278
Outdoors they had privacy and they had a

721
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,140
lot of space and they had a lot of room

722
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:30,298
to do a lot of selections so they really

723
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:32,700
did a good job on selecting for

724
00:27:30,298 --> 00:27:36,179
phenotypes that finished early with a

725
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:37,259
nice cush profile you know

726
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:40,259
um

727
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:43,980
they're fast and they're resonance

728
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:47,339
and they withstand the cold pretty great

729
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:49,620
um R2 means Ron had two seats whoever

730
00:27:47,339 --> 00:27:51,538
honest that's a great name and it was

731
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:52,619
rumor that there's skunk one in it but

732
00:27:51,538 --> 00:27:54,058
we don't know

733
00:27:52,619 --> 00:27:57,119
you know

734
00:27:54,058 --> 00:27:59,759
it looks like nl2 it behaves like an nl2

735
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:03,359
you know cushy because that's what nl2

736
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:05,940
is it's nl1 by Neville's Kush ah and and

737
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:07,038
do you see any real sativa in there at

738
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:10,200
all or no

739
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:12,298
very very little just enough to make it

740
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,460
interesting you know how most Afghan

741
00:28:12,298 --> 00:28:17,099
dominant types are with that one sativa

742
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:19,919
in it you know yeah I I think that was

743
00:28:17,099 --> 00:28:21,538
largely the sentiment body echoed when I

744
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,700
was talking to him he was like oh you

745
00:28:21,538 --> 00:28:25,379
know this was just one plan out of God

746
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:28,380
knows how many that had a little bit of

747
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:31,020
a thinner leaf and uh just melted your

748
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:32,700
face the highest lovely stuff oh I like

749
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:34,079
it it's great I smoked the hell out of

750
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:37,620
it it reminds me of a good Williams

751
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:39,960
Wonder you know nice rounded nice warm

752
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:41,459
Huggy kind of thing you know

753
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,319
man I love that you just said that

754
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:45,419
Williams Wonder is one of my super

755
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:46,859
nostalgic strains I love and not enough

756
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:48,059
people have had experience with it I

757
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:50,278
feel like

758
00:28:48,058 --> 00:28:53,220
yeah it's a it's a good one huh nice and

759
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:55,079
Huggy yeah I think I think it was like

760
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:57,120
the first weed I ever tried where I was

761
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:58,619
like oh this is kind of like mangoey

762
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:00,119
passion fruit like getting towards that

763
00:28:58,619 --> 00:29:01,798
passion fruit side of things at least

764
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:04,558
the sample I tried was

765
00:29:01,798 --> 00:29:08,058
it's the Rooter Alice in it that gives

766
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:10,619
it that Unique Kind of uh astringent

767
00:29:08,058 --> 00:29:12,658
bitter thing that it has you know what I

768
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:15,178
mean on top of the suite that The

769
00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:16,620
Afghani has and do you know anything

770
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:18,419
about it like I think there's some

771
00:29:16,619 --> 00:29:20,278
rumors that it was created in Oregon

772
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:22,200
somewhere between Williams and wonder

773
00:29:20,278 --> 00:29:23,880
but I've always wondered is do you think

774
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,919
there's any truth to that

775
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,600
I used to think that too and that's what

776
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:30,120
that was the rumor right but it was

777
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:31,879
spread by some guy in Indiana and his

778
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:34,678
name wasn't even William

779
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:37,980
do you think like that was the case for

780
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:39,899
a lot of the SSC crosses

781
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:41,519
I don't know you know when those guys

782
00:29:39,898 --> 00:29:43,979
source that stuff back then they were

783
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:45,778
getting what they could get you know oh

784
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:48,720
this is good let's get it you know

785
00:29:45,778 --> 00:29:52,380
Oregon Afghani what the hell was that

786
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:55,019
you know a Kandahar probably

787
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:58,260
you know who knows

788
00:29:55,019 --> 00:30:00,000
but back then it was mostly Imports or

789
00:29:58,259 --> 00:30:03,000
what heads had gone and collected from

790
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,919
their travels abroad you know

791
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,619
what I want to know is who sent Mel

792
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:11,340
Frank the nine seeds of Afghani number

793
00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:14,038
one from Kabul Afghanistan in 1979.

794
00:30:11,339 --> 00:30:15,480
was that was that was that Watson

795
00:30:14,038 --> 00:30:16,859
who did that

796
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,058
yeah that's that's actually a really

797
00:30:16,859 --> 00:30:20,339
good question because I always ask

798
00:30:18,058 --> 00:30:22,139
people who are a bit older like do you

799
00:30:20,339 --> 00:30:24,839
remember distinctly the first time you

800
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:28,380
saw Afghans rolling into California for

801
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:31,199
example oh man man they brought him in

802
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:33,600
in 69. they were going to Afghanistan

803
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,819
and getting the hash they were the

804
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:37,259
Hawaii was loaded with hash that the

805
00:30:35,819 --> 00:30:38,700
Brotherhood brought there man it was all

806
00:30:37,259 --> 00:30:42,359
Kandahar you know

807
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:44,220
it was the candors yeah wow and I mean

808
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:46,199
you you may not have a definitive answer

809
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:48,899
to this but do you have any guesses as

810
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,600
to what uh Steve Murphy's purest Indica

811
00:30:48,898 --> 00:30:52,319
might have been

812
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:55,500
Mazar

813
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:57,839
or or just one of those region you know

814
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:59,460
it's rumored to be a Mazar it looks like

815
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:01,199
a Mazar

816
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:03,659
but it could be a Kabul it could be

817
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:07,259
anything within that region a bulk

818
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:09,299
anything Bishop Bergen and who knows you

819
00:31:07,259 --> 00:31:11,099
know we had little knowledge of these

820
00:31:09,298 --> 00:31:12,778
things back then we just knew

821
00:31:11,099 --> 00:31:14,038
Afghanistan

822
00:31:12,778 --> 00:31:15,720
you know

823
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:17,940
it was only the Brotherhood and people

824
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,319
that kept record of this stuff that came

825
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:20,460
back and said yeah we got this from

826
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:23,099
gandhar

827
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:26,278
you know I think a lot of people looking

828
00:31:23,099 --> 00:31:27,839
at the purest Indica would be quite

829
00:31:26,278 --> 00:31:29,519
impressed it's a very pretty looking

830
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:31,918
plant and in a lot of ways it sort of

831
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:34,319
reminds me of deep chunk do you feel

832
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:36,000
like it's one of the better expressions

833
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:37,460
of Afghani or like there's actually a

834
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,679
lot that's better it's just less known

835
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:42,480
no it's the Western world's used to One

836
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:45,120
Thing Man and it's the combination of a

837
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:47,220
Mazar and a Hindu in one package it's

838
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:48,719
simply because of the introduction of

839
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:51,058
the Northern Lights combination of the

840
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:54,179
Hindu and the in the Mazar

841
00:31:51,058 --> 00:31:58,099
so people this this Americanized thought

842
00:31:54,179 --> 00:32:01,200
process they love that outboard

843
00:31:58,099 --> 00:32:04,158
exhaust smell on Labor Day you know what

844
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:08,100
I mean that that greasy sweet

845
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:10,860
tiny you know they're just used to it so

846
00:32:08,099 --> 00:32:12,000
that's what all through the 80s is what

847
00:32:10,859 --> 00:32:14,339
Americans

848
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,398
the palette was used to

849
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:19,740
so as we bred with these types into the

850
00:32:17,398 --> 00:32:22,619
early 90s that's what everybody got

851
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:25,620
that's what everything is now it's all

852
00:32:22,619 --> 00:32:28,639
all Nazar Hindu effect

853
00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:32,038
so unless you really go to

854
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:34,200
the the specific regions and get those

855
00:32:32,038 --> 00:32:36,480
specific afghanis you're not going to

856
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,580
know what this is all about each one of

857
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,440
these hash plants you know these

858
00:32:38,579 --> 00:32:42,298
families kept these things for hundreds

859
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,519
of years in their family or their tribe

860
00:32:42,298 --> 00:32:48,058
or whatever so they have a unique

861
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:49,859
special product that's like unique and

862
00:32:48,058 --> 00:32:51,778
special and like food grade super

863
00:32:49,859 --> 00:32:53,398
valuable you know what I mean and it was

864
00:32:51,778 --> 00:32:55,859
only war and stuff like that that

865
00:32:53,398 --> 00:32:58,019
started disrupting that that

866
00:32:55,859 --> 00:32:59,939
you know that heritage

867
00:32:58,019 --> 00:33:02,579
so like I said I've grown a lot of

868
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:04,679
afghanistans I've probably grown maybe

869
00:33:02,579 --> 00:33:06,839
10 different land race afghanis and

870
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:09,600
we're talking you know up to 40 plants

871
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:11,819
every run Outdoors

872
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:14,579
so I'm looking at the trains of all

873
00:33:11,819 --> 00:33:15,898
these these afghanis and none of them

874
00:33:14,579 --> 00:33:19,918
have that

875
00:33:15,898 --> 00:33:21,178
that modern indoor perfect Cola thing

876
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:25,140
going on

877
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:28,320
but all of them have a higher

878
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:31,320
kind of resin quality a higher terpene

879
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:33,240
value a higher you know you really your

880
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:34,918
eyes really light up when you when you

881
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:37,620
put your senses on

882
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:39,419
you know like the ball cash for example

883
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:40,518
that's like one of the best caches in

884
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:45,120
the world man

885
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:46,940
Smiley giddy happy just boom yes

886
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:50,339
you know

887
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:54,120
like if if all herb could smoke like

888
00:33:50,339 --> 00:33:56,339
that everybody'd be happy you know wow

889
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:58,558
you've uh you got me thinking I think I

890
00:33:56,339 --> 00:34:00,538
might have some bulk seeds stashed away

891
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:02,940
maybe I need to get on to them

892
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:05,158
it's interesting man you know it would

893
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:07,500
be really cool to do an indoor run of

894
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:09,480
something like that and you know maybe

895
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:11,940
hybridize it to a modern type and see

896
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,378
what you can what you can do that's a

897
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:14,760
popular thing now you know and I don't

898
00:34:13,378 --> 00:34:16,679
know if I'm the cause of that because

899
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,899
that was that's what I started doing so

900
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:20,338
long ago and then other guys started

901
00:34:18,898 --> 00:34:23,098
doing it another guy started doing it

902
00:34:20,338 --> 00:34:27,000
you know back then it was me snow High

903
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:32,280
but I just a couple guys doing it

904
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:34,139
now now we got 500 C 999 seed banks and

905
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,500
they're all like ah trying to be the

906
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:38,820
next big thing you know it's just funny

907
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:40,500
yeah certainly and you know what you

908
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:42,480
just touched on a question I wanted to

909
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:44,159
bring up which was sort of ties into

910
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,659
both when you were talking about Neville

911
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,398
and he had the eye as well as what you

912
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:49,440
just mentioned about the types of

913
00:34:47,398 --> 00:34:52,199
crosses you do I noticed both in

914
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,780
Neville's work and with your own that

915
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:56,819
possibly from my perspective one of the

916
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:59,040
sort of key components that seems to

917
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:00,900
have a good chance of success is doing

918
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:02,579
those raw f1s you know you mentioned

919
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:04,680
earlier that hybrid Vigor you know you

920
00:35:02,579 --> 00:35:06,900
really can't replicate it do you think

921
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:09,059
that's one of the keys

922
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:11,338
there's a method to my madness and it's

923
00:35:09,059 --> 00:35:13,559
not magazine breeding culture okay

924
00:35:11,338 --> 00:35:15,179
I have an agricultural background I went

925
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:17,099
to college for this stuff

926
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:20,460
you know before

927
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:23,220
I was listening to the advice of ask Ed

928
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:25,380
you know what I'm talking about but

929
00:35:23,219 --> 00:35:27,059
so when I popped out of college I had an

930
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:29,160
edu I had an agricultural background

931
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:31,920
when I first started growing cannabis

932
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:33,118
you know on my own as an adult out of

933
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,300
school and

934
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:38,099
so I approached it at on that level the

935
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:40,380
way I cloned the way I did everything

936
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:42,900
was different than this magazine

937
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:45,420
Paradigm which seemed to be geared

938
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:47,460
towards product sales and selling mark

939
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:49,079
gimmicky this and that

940
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:51,599
and the way they taught us to do this in

941
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:53,640
Agri and in the agriculture sense it was

942
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,140
so much more simpler and basic and and

943
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:56,519
right

944
00:35:55,139 --> 00:35:58,920
you know

945
00:35:56,519 --> 00:36:00,300
it was really that the magazine the

946
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:04,079
myths

947
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:06,720
that turned turned me off about all that

948
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:09,300
because it's just [ __ ] you know you

949
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:11,279
don't need none of that [ __ ] yeah look

950
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,839
it's interesting that you you bring that

951
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,700
up because I did want to talk about that

952
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:16,739
and I thought I've been having more

953
00:36:14,699 --> 00:36:19,139
recently I think it's pretty edgy a bit

954
00:36:16,739 --> 00:36:23,279
controversial is that I'm starting to

955
00:36:19,139 --> 00:36:25,618
think maybe High Times was like equally

956
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,000
as damaging for the scene as it was

957
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:29,700
beneficial

958
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,400
it's it's true but you know

959
00:36:29,699 --> 00:36:34,679
it's like don't shoot the messenger

960
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,240
they gave us a lot during the 70s they

961
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:37,799
gave us a lot during the 80s but

962
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:41,479
somewhere in the like 90s it started to

963
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:44,400
fall off into into glossy marketing

964
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:45,539
gimmicky [ __ ]

965
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,980
you know

966
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:52,320
in the 70s they were they were thick fat

967
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:54,000
informative magazines you know I

968
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,859
remember sitting around reading these

969
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,780
things as a kid when my parents got

970
00:36:55,858 --> 00:36:59,279
would buy them you know so they're

971
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:00,960
always around I've read every damn High

972
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,640
Times there ever was

973
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,159
you know I've watched the magazine

974
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:07,219
deteriorate into what it is today is is

975
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:09,000
what you might say but yeah you're right

976
00:37:07,219 --> 00:37:12,299
it did

977
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:15,119
in a way lead to a lot of misinformation

978
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:17,700
and targeting a lot of 18 to 25 year old

979
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:21,180
males to buy Just Junk

980
00:37:17,699 --> 00:37:23,098
you know yeah that that junk comment you

981
00:37:21,179 --> 00:37:25,739
make really hammers home because I think

982
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:29,700
at a certain point you see that you know

983
00:37:25,739 --> 00:37:31,500
pay for play advertising and awards and

984
00:37:29,699 --> 00:37:33,899
articles start to creep into the

985
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:36,420
magazine and for a long time I thought

986
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:38,639
you know whoever was the editor-in-chief

987
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,720
sort of dropped the ball a bit by you

988
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:41,699
know we're gonna do a big strain

989
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:43,679
write-up about this company's blueberry

990
00:37:41,699 --> 00:37:45,858
and it's like what like that's just some

991
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:48,838
random paid advertisement more or less

992
00:37:45,858 --> 00:37:51,779
and you start seeing it what it is man

993
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:54,119
you know you start seeing it for what it

994
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:55,680
is you see right through it yeah I

995
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:57,660
thought it's interesting and I thought

996
00:37:55,679 --> 00:38:00,059
even more funny was that you know a few

997
00:37:57,659 --> 00:38:01,739
years ago High Times sold and like Danny

998
00:38:00,059 --> 00:38:03,960
Danko and all those people working for

999
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:05,939
it moved on and now they've started a

1000
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,380
new magazine and everyone was like sort

1001
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:09,179
of keen to support it and I was like but

1002
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:11,039
hang on wasn't Danny Danko the

1003
00:38:09,179 --> 00:38:14,879
editor-in-chief who allowed all this

1004
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:17,338
sort of faux advertising to occur that's

1005
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,680
funny you say that Donnie Danko did a

1006
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:21,358
living next soil article and basically

1007
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:23,519
plagiarized all of her information and

1008
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:26,039
didn't gives any credit you know because

1009
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:28,380
we're the ones where I'm the proprietor

1010
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:29,880
of living organic soil we just dropped

1011
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:31,079
the soil thing in favor of the seed

1012
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,880
thing because that really wasn't going

1013
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:34,500
anywhere you know you could teach a man

1014
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,880
to fish guess what he fishes for the

1015
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,440
rest of his life

1016
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,640
so that's what we're doing we weren't

1017
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,380
making any money off that and we

1018
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:42,480
couldn't sustain that

1019
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:43,619
so we taught a man to fish a thousand

1020
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,179
times

1021
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:47,579
for free

1022
00:38:45,179 --> 00:38:49,199
you know the information's out there you

1023
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:51,960
could go and get it you don't need

1024
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:54,480
nothing man your which the secret to all

1025
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:57,780
of this is increasing your negative

1026
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:59,159
ionic surface area in your soil That's

1027
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:01,260
it man

1028
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:03,598
well yeah okay and you think that's why

1029
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:04,859
without people understanding exactly

1030
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:07,200
what you're saying they sort of have

1031
00:39:04,858 --> 00:39:10,259
this propensity to want to increase your

1032
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:12,719
cationic exchange capacity

1033
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:15,960
well as Americans and capitalists and

1034
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:17,279
marketing victims they're they're you

1035
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,619
know they want instant gratification

1036
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,240
because they're Americans they they want

1037
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:24,240
to spray the bug and the bug needs to

1038
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:26,519
die now shh you know so when they apply

1039
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:28,500
these fertilizers they want to see magic

1040
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:29,460
they want to see oh just like in the

1041
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:32,219
picture

1042
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:34,199
if I put more on it'll get bigger more

1043
00:39:32,219 --> 00:39:38,819
more you know

1044
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:41,098
it craves electrolytes yeah exactly bro

1045
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:42,960
okay so that's what's going on and it's

1046
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:45,720
it's a big scale and there's a lot of

1047
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:48,000
money to be made millions of dollars you

1048
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:50,159
know and now Monsanto has their hands in

1049
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,139
this they own General Hydroponics blah

1050
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:54,059
blah blah blah Miracle Grow blah blah

1051
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:56,519
blah they're not gonna take their dirty

1052
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:57,960
[ __ ] hands out of that scene

1053
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:59,400
they're gonna They're Gonna Keep

1054
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:02,460
marketing they're gonna keep pushing

1055
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:04,260
their [ __ ] poison on us you know

1056
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:06,059
so

1057
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:08,700
you know like I said my information's

1058
00:40:06,059 --> 00:40:10,440
free get online and go find it you know

1059
00:40:08,699 --> 00:40:12,379
the soil recipes all of that everything

1060
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:15,358
tell you how to do everything for free

1061
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:17,460
what's trippy about it all is is that

1062
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:19,858
the seed company idea because anybody

1063
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:22,980
can do this so that's that's what's

1064
00:40:19,858 --> 00:40:24,900
happening anybody is doing this

1065
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:26,400
so it creates a lot of confusion it

1066
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:28,380
creates a lot of you know I don't even

1067

00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:21,960
or it's a Jamaican or a nice African or

1090
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:23,639

that's that's awesome and I'd love to

1095
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:34,500
touch on the Colombian a little more

1096
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,900
because I think as time's gone by I've

1097
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:39,599
started to realize that when I first got

1098
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:42,119
into genetics so to speak I maybe put a

1099
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:44,359
bit of over emphasis on Thai and

1100
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:48,119
especially with the re-emergence of like

1101
00:41:44,358 --> 00:41:49,920
the the black Colombian Haze things like

1102
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:51,780
that I think I'm starting to learn more

1103
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,700
from people that like Colombian might be

1104
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:57,240
the unsung hero in a lot of different

1105
00:41:53,699 --> 00:41:59,039
things what's your thoughts

1106
00:41:57,239 --> 00:42:00,659
I think you're right man I think it's

1107
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:02,759
it's it's

1108
00:42:00,659 --> 00:42:05,460
um overlooked a lot

1109
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:08,640
it's quite potent it's quite has a nice

1110
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:12,420
effect it's it's your eyes man they just

1111
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:14,460
boom you know you're baked you're stoned

1112
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:17,400
you know there's there's CBD in there

1113
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:18,960
you know you're you're on the couch you

1114
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,519
think oh I'm gonna smoke this Colombian

1115
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,099
sativa and I'm gonna just get all this

1116
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:25,619
energy it don't really work that way man

1117
00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:26,880
you know I had a cold I smoked some

1118
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:28,559
black Colombian with a friend of mine

1119
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,260
who grows a bunch of Pollies wedding

1120
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:34,320
cake this cookies that and all this one

1121
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:36,480
hit dude was on the floor one hit of

1122
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:37,980
some ropey ass looking black Colombian

1123
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,980
okay

1124
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:43,380
and that's that says it all you know

1125
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:45,179
and do you feel like you know a lot of

1126
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:46,920
the consumers out there for example who

1127
00:42:45,179 --> 00:42:48,899
might say oh you know cookies is all

1128
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,760
that really does it for me do you think

1129
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:53,639
like they just don't have the exposure

1130
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:55,920
to really make that claim

1131
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:57,598
yeah they don't they're just they're

1132
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:01,079
just lost in that world of capitalism

1133
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:03,240
and you know they don't

1134
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:05,579
maybe they're not thinking enough maybe

1135
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:08,159
they're just complacent in their lives

1136
00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:09,660
with their device and their programming

1137
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:12,358
and everything that they do in their

1138
00:43:09,659 --> 00:43:13,858
life and they just don't care you know

1139
00:43:12,358 --> 00:43:15,719
but I mean look at somebody like me

1140
00:43:13,858 --> 00:43:16,799
who's passionate about cannabis and

1141
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:18,239
everything and has done it his whole

1142
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,920
life compared to somebody who just wants

1143
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:21,299
to smoke a smoke or whatever and get

1144
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,760
stoned what does he care about cookies

1145
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:26,039
or whatever you know what I mean and

1146
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,440
there's a lot of that a lot of kids

1147
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:30,179
younger younger people

1148
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,740
yeah look I think it's actually probably

1149
00:43:30,179 --> 00:43:33,960
one of the more pertinent questions

1150
00:43:31,739 --> 00:43:36,419
that's been in my mind for a while now

1151
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:39,358
which sort of if I gist it out it's like

1152
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:41,280
is the onus on us as The Growers and

1153
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:43,679
breeders to try to educate the general

1154
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:46,200
consumer or like like how do we let

1155
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:48,239
people know that like cookies is not the

1156
00:43:46,199 --> 00:43:50,460
ultimate expression of cannabis

1157
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:52,799
well I kind of do that you know I kind

1158
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:54,838
of that's my there's a method to my

1159
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,579
madness and that's introducing different

1160
00:43:54,838 --> 00:43:58,920
types of cannabis to people

1161
00:43:56,579 --> 00:44:01,318
from around the world man in different

1162
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:04,019
combinations and in going back to what

1163
00:44:01,318 --> 00:44:06,179
you were saying about uh hetero hybrid

1164
00:44:04,019 --> 00:44:07,679
Vigor now there's a method to my madness

1165
00:44:06,179 --> 00:44:10,739
with this

1166
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:12,838
and I I don't I guess I'm gonna say it

1167
00:44:10,739 --> 00:44:14,399
I I'm I'm working with heterosis

1168
00:44:12,838 --> 00:44:16,019
breeding okay I'm following the

1169
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:18,180
heterosis pattern

1170
00:44:16,019 --> 00:44:19,858
that when I take parents of unrelated

1171
00:44:18,179 --> 00:44:24,118
genetic origin and I cross them together

1172
00:44:19,858 --> 00:44:27,719
I'm going most likely going to have a

1173
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:29,818
heterosis hybrid child

1174
00:44:27,719 --> 00:44:30,899
there's going to be parents there's

1175
00:44:29,818 --> 00:44:31,980
going to be kids that look like their

1176
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:33,300
mom there's going to be kids that look

1177
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:36,539
like they're dead and there's going to

1178
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:40,380
be kids that have hybrid Vigor because

1179
00:44:36,539 --> 00:44:43,559
these are unrelated genetic parents that

1180
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:45,119
push everybody out of the way

1181
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:47,279
their flowers are bigger if there's more

1182
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:48,480
resin they're faster they're they're

1183
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,280
everything

1184
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:53,219
so that's kind of what I focus on is

1185
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:56,700
because I want people to experience the

1186
00:44:53,219 --> 00:44:57,419
heterosis value of the F1 and they get

1187
00:44:56,699 --> 00:44:59,818
it

1188
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:02,460
finally they see it finally they're

1189
00:44:59,818 --> 00:45:04,920
getting it finally dude buys a pack of

1190
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:08,599
seeds cracks them open finds this plant

1191
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:08,599
goes oh my God

1192
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:13,619
you know over and over again

1193
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:16,260
it doesn't matter what what happens

1194
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:18,539
online because that's all [ __ ] that

1195
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:21,839
dude's life just changed you know he

1196
00:45:18,539 --> 00:45:24,960
told me in an email and it's it's year

1197
00:45:21,838 --> 00:45:27,000
after year man you know yeah you know

1198
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,679
what you just made me think back myself

1199
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,239
when was the last time I grew a true F

1200
00:45:28,679 --> 00:45:32,399
on Harvard and I thought it's probably a

1201
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:33,539
while ago and so then I thought you're

1202
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,639
right there's probably a lot of people

1203
00:45:33,539 --> 00:45:37,500
out there who have never grown a true F1

1204
00:45:35,639 --> 00:45:40,739
and they they do have that sort of you

1205
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:43,199
uh yeah like Revelation moment

1206
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:45,118
yep and that's what it is man

1207
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:47,399
um and the Chance exists that you're not

1208
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:49,619
gonna find that heterosis Vigor and some

1209
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:53,160
of these these owl Crossings but the

1210
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:54,240
reality is is it works 95 of the time

1211
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:57,239
man

1212
00:45:54,239 --> 00:46:00,059
so out of a pack of 15 seeds cat's gonna

1213
00:45:57,239 --> 00:46:01,019
get five individuals exhibit heterosis

1214
00:46:00,059 --> 00:46:03,838
trades

1215
00:46:01,019 --> 00:46:05,579
you know sit like with a bulk I did a

1216
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:08,519
bulk by a cyanide

1217
00:46:05,579 --> 00:46:10,500
they're monsters man those are just just

1218
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:14,099
colas of hash

1219
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:16,139
you know are branches of hash

1220
00:46:14,099 --> 00:46:17,818
you know and that's what those plants

1221
00:46:16,139 --> 00:46:20,460
were traditionally bred for they were

1222
00:46:17,818 --> 00:46:23,818
hash plants they were bred to produce

1223
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:24,980
resin not take centerfold pictures in

1224
00:46:23,818 --> 00:46:27,838
High Times

1225
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:29,159
Sinai it's not not a strain you hear

1226
00:46:27,838 --> 00:46:30,719
about often I have heard about it before

1227
00:46:29,159 --> 00:46:33,299
and I thought oh Egyptian that sounds

1228
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:34,799
sort of cool anything unique about that

1229
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:36,839
one from your perspective that maybe

1230
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,940
differentiates it a little bit

1231
00:46:36,838 --> 00:46:40,858
well just the fact that it's an ancient

1232
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:43,318
type and it was developed as a hash

1233
00:46:40,858 --> 00:46:45,779
plant for thousands of years you know

1234
00:46:43,318 --> 00:46:49,259
it's drought tolerant

1235
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:51,540
um it's potent you know it has flavor

1236
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:53,339
it's it's you could tell it was selected

1237
00:46:51,539 --> 00:46:54,900
you know it was something that was kept

1238
00:46:53,338 --> 00:46:56,759
by these people for a long time it's

1239
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:58,318
pretty neat actually but you got to be

1240
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,700
you got to be a gland race guy to

1241
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:01,500
appreciate this stuff you got to be like

1242
00:46:59,699 --> 00:47:03,539
wow man yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna grow a

1243
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:05,099
bunch of cyanines and like fill a jar

1244
00:47:03,539 --> 00:47:08,119
over that you know

1245
00:47:05,099 --> 00:47:10,980
you gotta be one of those guys

1246
00:47:08,119 --> 00:47:12,358
yeah certainly certainly okay so if

1247
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:14,639
anyone was listening and they're like

1248
00:47:12,358 --> 00:47:16,559
look I'm Keen to give it a go I want to

1249
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:18,539
try a cool F1 maybe find some of this

1250
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:20,338
hybrid Vigor you're talking about what's

1251
00:47:18,539 --> 00:47:22,318
something you offer that you think you'd

1252
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:23,940
be happy to sort of say look start with

1253
00:47:22,318 --> 00:47:26,039
this you probably find something good

1254
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:29,099
you know one of the things I always

1255
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:31,858
point to People Too is a Mazar Sharif by

1256
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:33,960
the 76 Peace Corps Guerrero and I've

1257
00:47:31,858 --> 00:47:35,578
worked that line into the into an IBL

1258
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:37,318
over the last 10 years using siblings

1259
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:41,460
and back crosses and blah blah blah blah

1260
00:47:37,318 --> 00:47:45,000
to get what I want out of it as as a

1261
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:47,220
line it's got a good medicative quality

1262
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,420
to it okay it's better than an OG it's

1263
00:47:47,219 --> 00:47:49,980
better than cookies it's better than

1264
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:52,680
that you're gonna eat you're gonna sleep

1265
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:54,780
you're gonna be well

1266
00:47:52,679 --> 00:47:56,519
and and you're you know this is weed you

1267
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:58,560
don't smoke for like two three days in a

1268
00:47:56,519 --> 00:48:00,719
row because you're gonna have a hangover

1269
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:04,318
effect for two three days in a row

1270
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:06,118
you know wow that's not

1271
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:08,519
well you can look at the numbers on my

1272
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:12,358
page and you can see the CBG in there

1273
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:15,480
and you know it's very odd that these

1274
00:48:12,358 --> 00:48:18,119
these these terp profiles are so

1275
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:20,940
different from all these modern polies

1276
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:23,579
you know because they are different

1277
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:26,639
period these these all these modern

1278
00:48:23,579 --> 00:48:28,440
polies have the same genetics unless

1279
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:30,980
these guys are outcrossing them to these

1280
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:30,980
land races

1281
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:39,059
you know out of curiosity because it

1282
00:48:37,318 --> 00:48:41,400
does it is like a bit of a focal point

1283
00:48:39,059 --> 00:48:43,920
in discussions more recently have you

1284
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:45,660
ever tried Mach 1 and if so do you think

1285
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,099
the Colombian in that is a real

1286
00:48:45,659 --> 00:48:49,259
Colombian there's been some question

1287
00:48:47,099 --> 00:48:52,380
marks around that from people

1288
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:54,240
no I haven't but I have had smoke the uh

1289
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:56,099
Cuban black Haze and I can tell you that

1290
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:58,559
is definitely in all five Haze and

1291
00:48:56,099 --> 00:49:00,480
probably skunk one ah interesting okay

1292
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:02,940
because I think some people think it's

1293
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,900
just pure nl5 Haze do you suspect some

1294
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:06,300
skunk

1295
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:07,619
here's my theory here's my theory here's

1296
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:09,359
what happened dude bought a pack of

1297
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:10,380
seeds from the catalog he moved to

1298
00:49:09,358 --> 00:49:12,838
Florida

1299
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:15,480
skunk got mold if you got a male so he

1300
00:49:12,838 --> 00:49:17,759
used it on his NL Haze and are there any

1301
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:21,119
specific skunk traits you see in the

1302
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:23,339
Cuban black eyes yeah the orange hairs

1303
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:26,519
you know the nose bite

1304
00:49:23,338 --> 00:49:28,679
that sk1 has you know those trades that

1305
00:49:26,519 --> 00:49:31,139
sk1 has that are identifiable in most of

1306
00:49:28,679 --> 00:49:33,358
its out crosses you know but it's

1307
00:49:31,139 --> 00:49:36,659
definitely in all five Haze no doubt

1308
00:49:33,358 --> 00:49:39,119
about it and um you mentioned before the

1309
00:49:36,659 --> 00:49:41,699
the Peace Corps Guerrero we had a

1310
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:43,200
listener who was a fan of yours asked if

1311
00:49:41,699 --> 00:49:45,960
you could maybe talk a little bit about

1312
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:48,659
the Peace Corps Panama

1313
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:52,260
okay here's what happened

1314
00:49:48,659 --> 00:49:55,739
I knew a guy one time who knew a lady

1315
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:58,200
who during the 70s all throughout the

1316
00:49:55,739 --> 00:50:00,059
70s worked in South America and Mexico

1317
00:49:58,199 --> 00:50:02,338
as a Peace Corps worker

1318
00:50:00,059 --> 00:50:05,279
she was heady she was from California

1319
00:50:02,338 --> 00:50:07,920
and she was a stoner so she collected

1320
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:11,339
seeds from the weeds she bought and

1321
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:15,000
every freaking region she went to when I

1322
00:50:11,338 --> 00:50:17,639
got the package there were over 30 types

1323
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:20,460
and stuff I couldn't even pronounce

1324
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:22,559
you know they were all stored they're

1325
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:24,900
all stored improperly

1326
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:28,199
it's rolled up in little bindles and put

1327
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:31,200
in a film container you know

1328
00:50:28,199 --> 00:50:33,960
kept in a box somewhere so the only

1329
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:37,919
thing that we got up was the Panama

1330
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:39,599
the Guerrero and the Acuna okay

1331
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:43,318
now the Acuna was given to another

1332
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:46,680
grower and he got robbed and we lost it

1333
00:50:43,318 --> 00:50:49,318
so the Panama

1334
00:50:46,679 --> 00:50:51,960
we reproduced it we reproduced the Guero

1335
00:50:49,318 --> 00:50:54,539
and we distributed it snow High got some

1336
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:55,699
of my Panama and he calls it the 76.

1337
00:50:54,539 --> 00:50:57,960
okay

1338
00:50:55,699 --> 00:51:01,139
we don't know what the years were on the

1339
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:03,539
Panama so I say 74 through 76. he says

1340
00:51:01,139 --> 00:51:05,279
76 I say 74.

1341
00:51:03,539 --> 00:51:07,460
but they all they all came through my

1342
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:10,200
hands first

1343
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:12,119
yeah wow and and do you feel like

1344
00:51:10,199 --> 00:51:14,098
they're quite unique compared to maybe

1345
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:16,500
some of the other Panama's we see like

1346
00:51:14,099 --> 00:51:18,240
from maybe ice seeds or Coastal genetics

1347
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:19,440
oh yeah they're beer man they're just

1348
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:21,539
pure Panama

1349
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:24,179
there's there's no molestation about it

1350
00:51:21,539 --> 00:51:26,940
it's just the pure Panama Red Line you

1351
00:51:24,179 --> 00:51:30,480
know everything that it ever was uh it

1352
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:32,039
starts stardom Under 12 12 in seed you

1353
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:35,400
know

1354
00:51:32,039 --> 00:51:37,739
big long red Spears lots of lots of

1355
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:41,579
hairs you know one or two hits and

1356
00:51:37,739 --> 00:51:43,858
you're blah blah you know

1357
00:51:41,579 --> 00:51:46,380
so I guess I'd be interested in asking

1358
00:51:43,858 --> 00:51:48,380
you some people think that the reason

1359
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:51,300
why Haze is so good was because

1360
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:53,039
collectively it was better than the

1361
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:54,660
individual Parts but it sounds like

1362
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:56,940
you're really fond of each of the

1363
00:51:54,659 --> 00:51:59,578
individual parts do you think that Hayes

1364
00:51:56,940 --> 00:52:01,380
was much of an improvement on each of

1365
00:51:59,579 --> 00:52:03,359
the components

1366
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:04,619
well the thing is is nobody really knows

1367
00:52:03,358 --> 00:52:07,739
what Hayes is

1368
00:52:04,619 --> 00:52:10,559
okay we can only guess and we we what

1369
00:52:07,739 --> 00:52:12,179
what we what the top guys think me

1370
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:13,859
Dwight and these other guys we're

1371
00:52:12,179 --> 00:52:16,500
tracing lineage and we're tracing

1372
00:52:13,858 --> 00:52:18,779
history and we're we're tracing roots of

1373
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:22,500
import and all this other [ __ ] so it was

1374
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:25,859
most likely Brotherhood Imports

1375
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:29,039
okay whatever those guys brought in

1376
00:52:25,858 --> 00:52:33,058
what you know here's a here's a hint

1377
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:35,759
in 1966 there was a movie called uh

1378
00:52:33,059 --> 00:52:36,960
oh what was that it was a surfer movie

1379
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,059
um

1380
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:40,500
Mike Henson and the other dude that go

1381
00:52:39,059 --> 00:52:43,140
around the world it was called Endless

1382
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:45,780
Summer Okay that was a Brotherhood of

1383
00:52:43,139 --> 00:52:49,019
eternal love sponsored movie

1384
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:52,380
it was actually a hash and Seed scouting

1385
00:52:49,019 --> 00:52:56,639
Mission okay they used the movie as

1386
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:58,920
cover to go and do this in 1966 so they

1387
00:52:56,639 --> 00:53:02,279
set up all these relations

1388
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:04,559
seed hash and everything in 66.

1389
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:06,119
so they could come back and this is

1390
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:08,280
where it held Mike Henson got all these

1391
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:10,740
seeds and hashback he started making the

1392
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:12,540
old surfboards because you could carry a

1393
00:53:10,739 --> 00:53:15,358
surfboard on the plane and you could

1394
00:53:12,539 --> 00:53:17,338
carry epoxy

1395
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:20,338
so they could build these compartments

1396
00:53:17,338 --> 00:53:23,039
with massive seed massive hash and just

1397
00:53:20,338 --> 00:53:26,639
get right on the plane man

1398
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:29,099
yeah so now by 1971 they told me okay by

1399
00:53:26,639 --> 00:53:32,039
1971 all the genetics in the world that

1400
00:53:29,099 --> 00:53:34,140
they knew of were in Laguna Beach

1401
00:53:32,039 --> 00:53:36,000
and do you think like there's this

1402
00:53:34,139 --> 00:53:37,739
Treasure Trove of genetics sitting

1403
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,260
somewhere waiting to be cracked open or

1404
00:53:37,739 --> 00:53:41,759
it all got dispersed there's Brotherhood

1405
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:42,780
guys I know that won't come off their

1406
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,000
[ __ ]

1407
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:46,440
you know and like I could have had a

1408
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,358
chance but not anymore you know it's

1409
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:50,280
just that way these guys are never gonna

1410
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:51,420
come off their [ __ ] they're gonna die

1411
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:53,339
with it or they're gonna give it away

1412
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:55,740
when they're dead when they're dying

1413
00:53:53,338 --> 00:53:59,219
you know that's how I got the one in the

1414
00:53:55,739 --> 00:54:00,959
blue Orca off cue you know what I mean

1415
00:53:59,219 --> 00:54:02,399
and we were on good terms the whole

1416
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,440
freaking time man

1417
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,579
just one day I'd show up at his house

1418
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,780
and you don't even know who the [ __ ] I

1419
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:09,539
am

1420
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:11,220
dude had a heart attack okay

1421
00:54:09,539 --> 00:54:12,900
forgot everybody and everything got

1422
00:54:11,219 --> 00:54:15,299
addicted to [ __ ] opiates forgot who

1423
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:17,039
the [ __ ] I was forgot even gave me the

1424
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:19,980
one

1425
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:21,960
and just you know just forgot us forgot

1426
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:23,519
that we had kid you know we'd come there

1427
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,659
with our kids and sit on his couch and

1428
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:27,119
eat dinner and all this other [ __ ]

1429
00:54:24,659 --> 00:54:29,399
[ __ ] you know yeah it was It was kind of

1430
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:31,380
disheartening you know but I've seen

1431
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,880
that before where a guy has a heart

1432
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:33,660
attack and he forgets his own [ __ ]

1433
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,000
kid

1434
00:54:33,659 --> 00:54:37,980
you know

1435
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,920
so whatever whatever all the [ __ ] that

1436
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:42,420
coot said it's just crap

1437
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:44,880
you know we never really said anything

1438
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:47,460
about it he said he only said one thing

1439
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:49,380
to me he said well you got the genetics

1440
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:51,838
now so you're set

1441
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:53,460
and I said yeah I know man it says but

1442
00:54:51,838 --> 00:54:55,920
we got to do something for you we gotta

1443
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:57,900
you know he says just just make a

1444
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:00,300
donation in my kid's name

1445
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:02,099
his kid got run over by a drunk driver

1446
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:03,599
in the early 70s and he went out and

1447
00:55:02,099 --> 00:55:04,800
beat the [ __ ] out of the guy and went to

1448
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:07,500
prison for it

1449
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:09,119
so we did that we made a donation in his

1450
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:10,318
kid's name and we still got all that

1451
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:11,760
[ __ ]

1452
00:55:10,318 --> 00:55:14,519
you know

1453
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:17,220
food bank or whatever that we're doing

1454
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:18,960
for for for what he gave us you know

1455
00:55:17,219 --> 00:55:20,459
because I've always been fair and I

1456
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,019
don't steal [ __ ] from people or none of

1457
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:24,780
that

1458
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:26,099
this game's pretty uh Cutthroat and

1459
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:28,680
dirty man

1460
00:55:26,099 --> 00:55:30,480
some Scallywags out here

1461
00:55:28,679 --> 00:55:32,940
I mean it's good you brought that up

1462
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:34,858
because we did have a viewer submit a

1463
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:36,358
question about that and I guess you sort

1464
00:55:34,858 --> 00:55:38,338
of answered some of it but they were

1465
00:55:36,358 --> 00:55:40,980
sort of wondering is there an

1466
00:55:38,338 --> 00:55:43,199
alternative cutting of like the one like

1467
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:45,780
a sort of a fake one or is it just the

1468
00:55:43,199 --> 00:55:48,419
one real one and that's the one you have

1469
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:50,040
yes people that coot didn't trust and

1470
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:51,838
people that I didn't trust who we

1471
00:55:50,039 --> 00:55:52,800
thought that were going to [ __ ] us that

1472
00:55:51,838 --> 00:55:54,719
we're going to go out and just

1473
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:56,818
automatically start a seed company

1474
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:58,799
we didn't give them the cut we gave them

1475
00:55:56,818 --> 00:56:01,440
the one by blue moon rocks that cross

1476
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:04,800
too or back cross one

1477
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:07,679
and they looked almost the same

1478
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:09,780
you know and sure [ __ ] man those guys

1479
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:12,719
take off and boom that's what they did

1480
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:16,680
so guess what

1481
00:56:12,719 --> 00:56:18,959
now we can illegitimize you

1482
00:56:16,679 --> 00:56:21,358
you know if you if you think that you're

1483
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:23,400
gonna like just blow smoke up somebody's

1484
00:56:21,358 --> 00:56:24,980
ass to come steal a cut and you're not

1485
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:27,119
going to get found out in the process

1486
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:28,920
come on man

1487
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:31,680
and yeah there's been people that I've

1488
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:33,240
worked with that have stolen the blue

1489
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:35,699
orca from me house stolen the one from

1490
00:56:33,239 --> 00:56:37,919
me there is the one and there is the

1491
00:56:35,699 --> 00:56:40,199
blue work out there I can't tell you who

1492
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:41,579
or where or whatever but it's floating

1493
00:56:40,199 --> 00:56:43,078
around

1494
00:56:41,579 --> 00:56:45,539
and but they're hard to keep the cuts

1495
00:56:43,079 --> 00:56:47,400
are hard to keep so good luck

1496
00:56:45,539 --> 00:56:49,079
and the reason I like them so much is

1497
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:51,180
because they're authentic old

1498
00:56:49,079 --> 00:56:53,339
Brotherhood Thai in an Afghani

1499
00:56:51,179 --> 00:56:55,139
combination I love afghanis and ties man

1500
00:56:53,338 --> 00:56:58,019
that's my favorite

1501
00:56:55,139 --> 00:56:59,519
you know that sounds amazing I would

1502
00:56:58,019 --> 00:57:00,780
love to ask you because it's actually

1503
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:03,480
really hard to find this sort of

1504
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:06,000
information what on in terms of the one

1505
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:08,219
what are like the Terps like what's the

1506
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:11,400
flavor what's the effect

1507
00:57:08,219 --> 00:57:14,098
oh man it's just it's just really strong

1508
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:15,780
you know all these these kick cookie

1509
00:57:14,099 --> 00:57:17,700
Growers man once they get a hold of that

1510
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:19,140
they're like [ __ ] that man that's all I

1511
00:57:17,699 --> 00:57:21,419
want to smoke this is all I want to grow

1512
00:57:19,139 --> 00:57:22,858
and that's what they tell me it's the

1513
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:24,720
truth because that's all you have in

1514
00:57:22,858 --> 00:57:26,759
your jar that [ __ ] works

1515
00:57:24,719 --> 00:57:28,379
you know after you smoked everything in

1516
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:30,119
the universe there's the one sitting

1517
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:31,559
there in the jar

1518
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:33,300
you know it's one of those ones where

1519
00:57:31,559 --> 00:57:35,400
you're like uh

1520
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:37,680
it'll wreck your day

1521
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:40,019
so you know you don't just jump into

1522
00:57:37,679 --> 00:57:42,539
that now Blue Earth on the other hand

1523
00:57:40,019 --> 00:57:44,460
that's that's like a Williams Wonder or

1524
00:57:42,539 --> 00:57:46,920
uh something like that that's something

1525
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:49,199
women can smoke it's gonna make you feel

1526
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:52,680
good it's gonna you know it's gonna make

1527
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:55,558
you feel warm and Huggy and smiling and

1528
00:57:52,679 --> 00:57:57,960
have a good appetite and sleep well you

1529
00:57:55,559 --> 00:58:00,180
know because blue Orca finishes at 56

1530
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:01,440
days and the wand finishes at 80. so if

1531
00:58:00,179 --> 00:58:04,440
anybody out there thinks that they have

1532
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:06,300
the one better check that at 80 days bro

1533
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:07,800
you know what I mean okay that's

1534
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:09,780
interesting to hear and and one of our

1535
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:13,380
listeners specifically was interested in

1536
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:15,300
picking up across from you of the one to

1537
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:17,818
something they said which cross would

1538
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:19,440
you recommend and which of the crosses

1539
00:58:17,818 --> 00:58:21,659
do you think like you're best gonna get

1540
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:23,039
like a dominant the one sort of

1541
00:58:21,659 --> 00:58:24,719
expression

1542
00:58:23,039 --> 00:58:26,460
well I'll tell you what I'm doing now is

1543
00:58:24,719 --> 00:58:28,379
I'm trying to put

1544
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:30,420
a package into seed form

1545
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:33,140
so I've done all these various I did an

1546
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:35,940
outcrossing to the black candahar

1547
00:58:33,139 --> 00:58:38,098
to get the one in the blue Orca together

1548
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:41,358
in one package so I've been working

1549
00:58:38,099 --> 00:58:44,818
those lines and working for the trades

1550
00:58:41,358 --> 00:58:47,279
to get into a seed line that's that

1551
00:58:44,818 --> 00:58:49,798
represents everything that I expect out

1552
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,000
of it and if it's not gonna work I'm not

1553
00:58:49,798 --> 00:58:54,838
gonna do it

1554
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:56,579
so I'm pretty far into it right now and

1555
00:58:54,838 --> 00:58:58,078
you know that might be done pretty soon

1556
00:58:56,579 --> 00:59:00,298
maybe this year

1557
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:03,119
but as far as like what somebody can buy

1558
00:59:00,298 --> 00:59:06,900
it's the one by blue moon rocks the back

1559
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:09,960
cross two three four if it's cubed

1560
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:12,298
you know yeah I had seen that one online

1561
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:14,159

1562
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:16,079

1563
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:18,960
rocks that you thought made it like a

1564
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:21,480
well-suited partner to the one

1565
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:24,119
well when I was uh

1566
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:26,639
growing herb in the 90s

1567
00:59:24,119 --> 00:59:29,338

1568
00:59:26,639 --> 00:59:31,558

the chiscuit berry didn't do it you know

1577

01:01:43,139 --> 01:01:48,179
I guess an interesting sort of uh

1628
01:01:46,199 --> 01:01:50,279
Counterpoint maybe just to be Devil's

1629
01:01:48,179 --> 01:01:52,199
Advocate slightly is I can't remember

1630
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:54,000
who it was but someone who deals with a

1631
01:01:52,199 --> 01:01:56,759
lot of land race work it might have even

1632
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,559
been Lewis from AC said that

1633
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:00,599
um if you do truly want to work with the

1634
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:02,519
land race line there is a bunch of

1635
01:02:00,599 --> 01:02:04,859
Hermes stuff you've got to weed through

1636
01:02:02,519 --> 01:02:07,079
would you agree that there is some land

1637
01:02:04,858 --> 01:02:10,759
races that do have sort of Hermes and

1638
01:02:07,079 --> 01:02:14,280
it's not all horrible breeding per se

1639
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:15,299
absolutely you know uh allows for

1640
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:17,040
example

1641
01:02:15,298 --> 01:02:19,619
um absolutely riddled with it in a

1642
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:20,460
cashmere absolutely riddled with it

1643
01:02:19,619 --> 01:02:23,280
um

1644
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:25,380
things like that you know that are often

1645
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:27,059
these really weird regions of the globe

1646
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:29,400
that they don't really give a [ __ ] about

1647
01:02:27,059 --> 01:02:32,160
intersex you know they use it as hash

1648
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:33,960
Planet you know so when you go up you

1649
01:02:32,159 --> 01:02:35,279
get you start pulling the stuff out of

1650
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:37,619
the woodwork and think that you're gonna

1651
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:39,180
breed with it you better think again man

1652
01:02:37,619 --> 01:02:40,920
you better you better look at it real

1653
01:02:39,179 --> 01:02:44,519
good you know

1654
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:46,139
yeah definitely but then again there's a

1655
01:02:44,519 --> 01:02:48,539
lot of land races and a lot of the

1656
01:02:46,139 --> 01:02:51,420
narrow Leaf drug cultivars and we're

1657
01:02:48,539 --> 01:02:53,579
talking as far north into Kazakhstan 50

1658
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:56,700
degrees north that have no intersects

1659
01:02:53,579 --> 01:02:59,400
that that are just nice plants you know

1660
01:02:56,699 --> 01:03:01,618
yeah that's true I guess it also is a

1661
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:04,500
reflection of the the thousands of years

1662
01:03:01,619 --> 01:03:06,539
of caretaking and whatnot but uh just to

1663
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:07,858
jump to another question that a listener

1664
01:03:06,539 --> 01:03:09,900
had submitted that I think you'll be

1665
01:03:07,858 --> 01:03:11,039
able to answer for them is they said oh

1666
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:13,318
you know unfortunately I'm sort of

1667
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:14,759
limited to growing in a tent do you have

1668
01:03:13,318 --> 01:03:16,739
any offerings that you think would do

1669
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:20,579
well in a tent or just a small space in

1670
01:03:16,739 --> 01:03:22,019
general yeah I I would do like uh you

1671
01:03:20,579 --> 01:03:23,940
know if somebody came to me and said hey

1672
01:03:22,019 --> 01:03:25,739
this is what I need I would I would give

1673
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:28,619
them what they need you know like a blue

1674
01:03:25,739 --> 01:03:30,659
Orca Cross or or something that I know

1675
01:03:28,619 --> 01:03:33,480
stays Squat and Compact and that that

1676
01:03:30,659 --> 01:03:35,879
they can manage the short flowering time

1677
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:38,400
you know what they want

1678
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:41,519
yeah nice nice you know where myself is

1679
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:44,940
like I'll grow anything you know

1680
01:03:41,519 --> 01:03:45,599
no no roof limit yeah pretty much you

1681
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:47,519
know

1682
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:49,380
and I just don't grow inside I don't I

1683
01:03:47,519 --> 01:03:51,298
don't grow inside anymore man it's all

1684
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:53,220
it's all in greenhouses

1685
01:03:51,298 --> 01:03:55,139
light up you know

1686
01:03:53,219 --> 01:03:57,179
because I can control the flowering and

1687
01:03:55,139 --> 01:03:59,699
in height and everything and I can see

1688
01:03:57,179 --> 01:04:01,318
the full range of expressions and and do

1689
01:03:59,699 --> 01:04:03,539
whatever what I need to

1690
01:04:01,318 --> 01:04:05,699
do you think that commercially produced

1691
01:04:03,539 --> 01:04:07,858
cannabis like you know for the masses so

1692
01:04:05,699 --> 01:04:09,719
to speak will eventually transition to

1693
01:04:07,858 --> 01:04:12,539
being sort of all Greenhouse slash

1694
01:04:09,719 --> 01:04:14,699
outdoor I don't know you know I just

1695
01:04:12,539 --> 01:04:16,558
don't know the industry is really a

1696
01:04:14,699 --> 01:04:19,439
mystery to me right now it just seems

1697
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:23,339
that there that marketing's over the top

1698
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:28,200
man CBD toothpicks CBD socks you know

1699
01:04:23,338 --> 01:04:30,659
CBD cars for your tire I mean cars tires

1700
01:04:28,199 --> 01:04:33,480
for your car you know it's just a joke

1701
01:04:30,659 --> 01:04:37,500
man so it's gonna spill over into the

1702
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:40,139
legitimate legitimacy of it you know all

1703
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:42,179
this gimmicky [ __ ] so it's it's gonna

1704
01:04:40,139 --> 01:04:43,500
climax it's gonna boil over and then

1705
01:04:42,179 --> 01:04:46,318
it's gonna settle

1706
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:49,019
so whenever this in the settling is when

1707
01:04:46,318 --> 01:04:51,239
it goes federally legal that's gonna be

1708
01:04:49,019 --> 01:04:53,159
that's it and that's kind of what I'm

1709
01:04:51,239 --> 01:04:56,338
waiting for too because that puts

1710
01:04:53,159 --> 01:04:59,519
legitimate that puts legitimacy to what

1711
01:04:56,338 --> 01:05:00,719
I'm doing I can now go and patent my

1712
01:04:59,519 --> 01:05:03,659
types

1713
01:05:00,719 --> 01:05:05,759
nobody can patent a type you can't do

1714
01:05:03,659 --> 01:05:09,139
that don't believe anybody it's [ __ ]

1715
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:12,119
only Monsanto can

1716
01:05:09,139 --> 01:05:14,400
okay the wild west not until it's

1717
01:05:12,119 --> 01:05:16,318
Federal and and we're talking you're

1718
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:19,260
gonna be shelling out you know a

1719
01:05:16,318 --> 01:05:21,779
thousand two thousand bucks for this

1720
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:25,260
patent and and you're gonna be waiting

1721
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:28,440
six months seven months 12 months for an

1722
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:31,079
answer and it's gonna come back as a uh

1723
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:33,659
oh what's the word I'm looking for uh

1724
01:05:31,079 --> 01:05:36,720
not a patent but uh

1725
01:05:33,659 --> 01:05:39,899
in the process of being a patent for the

1726
01:05:36,719 --> 01:05:42,480
next five years you know so you got Five

1727
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:44,400
Guys Pat trying to patent the same type

1728
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:46,260
and you're hoping that oh am I gonna be

1729
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:48,000
the one to do it so that's what it's

1730
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:50,520
gonna be and if I don't patent my times

1731
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,858
guess what it's up for grabs man you

1732
01:05:50,519 --> 01:05:56,519
know everybody's type is up for grabs

1733
01:05:52,858 --> 01:05:58,440
until the patent is on

1734
01:05:56,519 --> 01:05:59,519
you know I could go steal cookies if I

1735
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:02,818
wanted to

1736
01:05:59,519 --> 01:06:04,858
you know there's no patent on it

1737
01:06:02,818 --> 01:06:07,199
yeah wow that'll that'll be an

1738
01:06:04,858 --> 01:06:09,179
interesting day for sure yeah it's gonna

1739
01:06:07,199 --> 01:06:11,159
it's gonna level the playing field man

1740
01:06:09,179 --> 01:06:12,058
and it's gonna really get rid of the

1741
01:06:11,159 --> 01:06:15,239
noise

1742
01:06:12,059 --> 01:06:17,940
I'd be curious to to know what strain

1743
01:06:15,239 --> 01:06:18,959
like in your opinion most emulates a

1744
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:21,298
coffee

1745
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:24,119
hmm good question man it's going to be

1746
01:06:21,298 --> 01:06:25,980
South Americans you know here's a here's

1747
01:06:24,119 --> 01:06:27,599
a something that

1748
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:30,780
well I guess the Western World doesn't

1749
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:33,660
know much about is that the indigenous

1750
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:35,099
people tend to select for their culinary

1751
01:06:33,659 --> 01:06:38,639
traits

1752
01:06:35,099 --> 01:06:42,240
so a lot of South American types

1753
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:42,980
Echo their Colonnade their culinary you

1754
01:06:42,239 --> 01:06:48,118
know

1755
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:49,079
spicy cilantro chocolate coffee all that

1756
01:06:48,119 --> 01:06:51,240
stuff

1757
01:06:49,079 --> 01:06:54,420
you know peppers

1758
01:06:51,239 --> 01:06:56,459
you go to Africa what happens there they

1759
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:59,220
start it starts imitating they're called

1760
01:06:56,460 --> 01:07:00,960
they're what they eat

1761
01:06:59,219 --> 01:07:04,078
you know

1762
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:06,298
that's one thing I've noticed

1763
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:07,980
yeah that's cool I'm gonna have to give

1764
01:07:06,298 --> 01:07:09,480
that a go a nice nice Mexican or

1765
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:12,358
something

1766
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:15,539
um I would say yeah man a Mexican or

1767
01:07:12,358 --> 01:07:17,338
um uh Colombian or uh or even a oaxacan

1768
01:07:15,539 --> 01:07:18,359
would give you a nice probably a good

1769
01:07:17,338 --> 01:07:21,019
coffee

1770
01:07:18,358 --> 01:07:21,019
you know

1771
01:07:22,039 --> 01:07:27,180
I'm just I might say that Oaxaca is

1772
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:30,659
probably my favorite

1773
01:07:27,179 --> 01:07:33,239

1776
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:39,838
of those ones where like it's a nice

1777
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:42,240
balance of different sort of things or

1778
01:07:39,838 --> 01:07:45,298
it's just it's a it's a feel well type

1779
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:47,578
you know it's a well-being type

1780
01:07:45,298 --> 01:07:49,318
where you smoke it and you just

1781
01:07:47,579 --> 01:07:51,900
shit's okay man

1782
01:07:49,318 --> 01:07:54,480
you know it's just something you can

1783
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:56,940
work on something you can play on

1784
01:07:54,480 --> 01:08:00,539
something something you can do anything

1785
01:07:56,940 --> 01:08:03,720
on and not be too out of your mind

1786
01:08:00,539 --> 01:08:05,940
you know like say a Vietnam would do to

1787
01:08:03,719 --> 01:08:09,538
you certainly

1788
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:12,599
and So speaking of Hayes Origins we

1789
01:08:09,539 --> 01:08:14,780
suspect it's Vietnam making the noise in

1790
01:08:12,599 --> 01:08:14,780
there

1791
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:21,060
because I'll say it there's nothing

1792
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:23,399
stronger than a good Vietnam man

1793
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:25,739
they're just

1794
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:28,318
I'm really glad to hear you say that

1795
01:08:25,738 --> 01:08:30,539
because I uh I think that one of the

1796
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:32,100
most memorable equatorial land races

1797
01:08:30,539 --> 01:08:35,039
I've ever had I've had some really nice

1798
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:36,719
ties through Bodhi but um he he let me

1799
01:08:35,039 --> 01:08:39,539
try one of his Vietnamese one time and

1800
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:41,939
that's forever held the the spot in my

1801
01:08:39,539 --> 01:08:43,439
mind is like most memorable sort of weed

1802
01:08:41,939 --> 01:08:46,500
I ever smoked

1803
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:48,539
it's it's very haze-like you know and

1804
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:50,520
these properties that Hayes has they're

1805
01:08:48,539 --> 01:08:52,319
they're reminiscent if you're if you're

1806
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:53,759
a smoker of all these land races so what

1807
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:57,859
the things that I identify and these

1808
01:08:53,759 --> 01:09:00,659
other guys identify Vietnam uh Colombian

1809
01:08:57,859 --> 01:09:04,199
uh walking

1810
01:09:00,659 --> 01:09:05,939
uh Thai these are these are there's

1811
01:09:04,198 --> 01:09:07,798
notes in there you know it's like when

1812
01:09:05,939 --> 01:09:11,460
you're when you're playing in a band you

1813
01:09:07,798 --> 01:09:15,600
you know what that note is you know

1814
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:18,298
they're playing a G man you know

1815
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:20,759
it's like that it's like you can you can

1816
01:09:18,298 --> 01:09:22,679
you can you can tear it apart with your

1817
01:09:20,759 --> 01:09:25,319
mind you know

1818
01:09:22,679 --> 01:09:27,779
but anyway get a hold of these via Just

1819
01:09:25,319 --> 01:09:30,359
Watch What Happens Next okay

1820
01:09:27,779 --> 01:09:34,940
Dwight and me we're we're working on

1821
01:09:30,359 --> 01:09:34,940
this Vietnam Haze trip thing okay

1822
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:39,298
that's that's awesome I'd love to see

1823
01:09:38,219 --> 01:09:41,640
that happen

1824
01:09:39,298 --> 01:09:43,019
oh I got some good Vietnam crosses I did

1825
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:44,338
cross um

1826
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:46,679
uh

1827
01:09:44,338 --> 01:09:49,738
that

1828
01:09:46,679 --> 01:09:51,719
um Vietnamese Provincial Park land race

1829
01:09:49,738 --> 01:09:55,019
to the black Columbian and that's

1830
01:09:51,719 --> 01:09:56,640
probably pretty Haze like man you know

1831
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:59,100
if you're Haze guy that'd probably be

1832
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:01,199
one to get and check out and go through

1833
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:03,660
a pack of those you know

1834
01:10:01,198 --> 01:10:05,159
wow I might need to do that what sort of

1835
01:10:03,659 --> 01:10:07,738
flower times do you think might sort of

1836
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:09,238
be in the ballpark they're long man now

1837
01:10:07,738 --> 01:10:10,919
the black Columbian isn't as long as

1838
01:10:09,238 --> 01:10:13,859
people would think we're talking you

1839
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:15,779
know 70 days but it will go over 100 if

1840
01:10:13,859 --> 01:10:17,819
you have that phenotype it does now my

1841
01:10:15,779 --> 01:10:19,859
selecting when I do this stuff I'm doing

1842
01:10:17,819 --> 01:10:21,359
it in a in a light depth hoop and I'm

1843
01:10:19,859 --> 01:10:23,639
looking for stuff that finishes early

1844
01:10:21,359 --> 01:10:26,219
because I know what you guys want you

1845
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:28,079
don't want that oh two million day

1846
01:10:26,219 --> 01:10:30,420
whatever when we could have the same

1847
01:10:28,079 --> 01:10:31,800
package in 80 Days

1848
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:35,158
you know

1849
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:36,719
and yeah I'm not overlooking that we may

1850
01:10:35,158 --> 01:10:37,619
lose something in later flower times

1851
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:39,119
either

1852
01:10:37,619 --> 01:10:40,198
you know I'm still paying attention to

1853
01:10:39,119 --> 01:10:43,679
that

1854
01:10:40,198 --> 01:10:46,379
yeah sure sure I I wanted to ask you

1855
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:48,739
because for the longest time I had

1856
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:52,380
always seen this most beautiful picture

1857
01:10:48,738 --> 01:10:54,000
I think it's of your chocolate tie how

1858
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:56,039
how did you get it like like with those

1859
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:58,380
really swollen bracks and the purple

1860
01:10:56,039 --> 01:11:00,719
look I think it's an outdoor photo from

1861
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:03,480
memory it might even be I think it might

1862
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:06,539
be Darwin's chocolate Thai I don't know

1863
01:11:03,479 --> 01:11:08,218
yeah it's it's that line but one of

1864
01:11:06,539 --> 01:11:10,920
them's from snow high and one of them's

1865
01:11:08,219 --> 01:11:13,679
from uh Kirby okay

1866
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:15,179
Kirby did a back cross and he wasn't he

1867
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:18,060
wasn't supposed to but he did it anyway

1868
01:11:15,179 --> 01:11:22,140
and I gotta hold the pack of seeds so I

1869
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:25,880
I put that to the to the snow high and

1870
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:29,100
worked it out into what I remember

1871
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:31,739
buying chocolate tie

1872
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:34,199
you know the traits I remember the

1873
01:11:31,738 --> 01:11:35,698
smells the look The you know what the

1874
01:11:34,198 --> 01:11:37,799
flower looked like and everything so

1875
01:11:35,698 --> 01:11:39,119
that's what I was doing so after a

1876
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:40,739
couple you know a couple runs of that

1877
01:11:39,119 --> 01:11:42,479
that was pretty easy because that Line's

1878
01:11:40,738 --> 01:11:45,359
pretty much an IBL anyway

1879
01:11:42,479 --> 01:11:48,119
you know I just put my hand on it you

1880
01:11:45,359 --> 01:11:49,799
know yeah wow I mean I think one of the

1881
01:11:48,119 --> 01:11:52,500
things which always caught me about it

1882
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:55,500
was that it looked so modern for a

1883
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:57,539
strain that obviously was old world

1884
01:11:55,500 --> 01:12:00,359
well you got snow High working it you

1885
01:11:57,539 --> 01:12:02,219
got Howard which is Daryl spelled

1886
01:12:00,359 --> 01:12:03,420
backwards working it

1887
01:12:02,219 --> 01:12:04,679
okay

1888
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:07,020
and you got

1889
01:12:04,679 --> 01:12:10,560
Herbie working it you got me working it

1890
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:12,360
you got three four breeders on the thing

1891
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:14,400
and we're not just dumb asses we're

1892
01:12:12,359 --> 01:12:16,500
breeders you know

1893
01:12:14,399 --> 01:12:18,119
you know we we we're looking for stuff

1894
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:20,640
we're looking for trades and everything

1895
01:12:18,119 --> 01:12:22,380
so if it's gonna happen after that yeah

1896
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:26,039
it's gonna have a modern

1897
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:27,359
you know Cola nice looking flower kind

1898
01:12:26,039 --> 01:12:29,760
of trip

1899
01:12:27,359 --> 01:12:31,738
there's still radial ties you know

1900
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:34,159
it reminds me of um what do they say it

1901
01:12:31,738 --> 01:12:36,479
takes a village to raise a child

1902
01:12:34,158 --> 01:12:38,460
that's one of those things man really

1903
01:12:36,479 --> 01:12:39,839
and that's the result you know you're

1904
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:40,920
looking at it right there in that in

1905
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:42,060
that photograph

1906
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:44,219
you know

1907
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:45,840
that's awesome look we touched on it a

1908
01:12:44,219 --> 01:12:48,359
bit earlier but I'd love to come back I

1909
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:49,560
am a passionate organic grower myself I

1910
01:12:48,359 --> 01:12:51,719
would love to hear a little bit about

1911
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:53,640
your grow style obviously you mentioned

1912
01:12:51,719 --> 01:12:55,500
it's organic what are some of the

1913
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:58,380
general things you think are important

1914
01:12:55,500 --> 01:13:00,658
to focus on in your organic grow

1915
01:12:58,380 --> 01:13:02,159
well it's just soil food web gardening

1916
01:13:00,658 --> 01:13:04,738
you know we work with the soil food web

1917
01:13:02,158 --> 01:13:08,339
not against it microbes

1918
01:13:04,738 --> 01:13:10,619
um funguses uh there's so many things

1919
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:13,440
that we utilize that enhance this

1920
01:13:10,619 --> 01:13:15,960
experience on a natural level man that

1921
01:13:13,439 --> 01:13:18,899
just takes this to a different place you

1922
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:20,158
know and we've educated people on all of

1923
01:13:18,899 --> 01:13:23,460
this you know I'm the first guy to use

1924
01:13:20,158 --> 01:13:25,859
aloe okay and post it um you know all of

1925
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:28,500
this stuff

1926
01:13:25,859 --> 01:13:31,380
we hammered it out an icy mag 10 years

1927
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:33,179
ago it's all hammered out there and the

1928
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:35,100
mess is still there but they've you know

1929
01:13:33,179 --> 01:13:36,719
they've gone in there we got band and

1930
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:40,500
all this other [ __ ] and

1931
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:42,840
you know what happened was

1932
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:44,340
we had a big group on icy mag and we

1933
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:46,020
were you know my thread was leading the

1934
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:48,480
[ __ ] charge and I see mag every day

1935
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:50,400
biggest threat ever you know

1936
01:13:48,479 --> 01:13:52,079
biggest flat ever biggest [ __ ] listen

1937
01:13:50,399 --> 01:13:54,119
that ever whatever

1938
01:13:52,079 --> 01:13:55,619
you know but it was just good fun for us

1939
01:13:54,119 --> 01:13:58,500
and we were teaching people and learning

1940
01:13:55,619 --> 01:14:00,059
and doing all this other [ __ ] and um we

1941
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:02,460
just busted everything open and

1942
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:04,739
everybody came together at once and

1943
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:07,158
really took it to the next level you

1944
01:14:04,738 --> 01:14:08,959
know everything

1945
01:14:07,158 --> 01:14:12,960
enzymes

1946
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:15,480
microbes fungus fertilizers ionic

1947
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:18,000
reactions everything

1948
01:14:15,479 --> 01:14:20,519
you know and so we put all that

1949
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,979
information in one package and yeah and

1950
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:24,900
I'm not gonna just tell everybody it

1951
01:14:22,979 --> 01:14:26,459
anymore you're gonna have to pay for it

1952
01:14:24,899 --> 01:14:27,779
because I don't want to do that anymore

1953
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:29,039
you know

1954
01:14:27,779 --> 01:14:30,719
but

1955
01:14:29,039 --> 01:14:33,359
you're working with the soil food web

1956
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:35,579
and one of the main things that makes

1957
01:14:33,359 --> 01:14:38,099
this all work is the fact that you have

1958
01:14:35,579 --> 01:14:40,439
to increase negative ionic surface area

1959
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:43,679
in your soil there you have to there's

1960
01:14:40,439 --> 01:14:45,299
only one in all this hydroponic [ __ ]

1961
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:47,219
they're cheating they're cheating the

1962
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:51,060
system by tricking the system with a

1963
01:14:47,219 --> 01:14:51,899
with with ions and anions okay it's a

1964
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:54,900
trick

1965
01:14:51,899 --> 01:14:58,019
so that's why the weed [ __ ] but

1966
01:14:54,899 --> 01:15:00,119
if we can increase negative ionic

1967
01:14:58,020 --> 01:15:02,580
surface area and how we do this is we

1968
01:15:00,119 --> 01:15:04,979
add those things into the soil compost

1969
01:15:02,579 --> 01:15:08,158
the humic material okay

1970
01:15:04,979 --> 01:15:10,079
earthworm castings humic material

1971
01:15:08,158 --> 01:15:12,899
um anything that has that that that

1972
01:15:10,079 --> 01:15:15,479
value like basalt rock dust for example

1973
01:15:12,899 --> 01:15:17,039
has a paramagnetic uh negative charge on

1974
01:15:15,479 --> 01:15:18,599
it and it's igneous rock it's every

1975
01:15:17,039 --> 01:15:21,300
freaking mineral known to man it's

1976
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:22,860
immediately uptakeable and

1977
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:24,480
you'll burn your plants with it if you

1978
01:15:22,859 --> 01:15:27,658
don't follow the directions

1979
01:15:24,479 --> 01:15:29,698
okay now there we go again we've just

1980
01:15:27,658 --> 01:15:32,279
increased in our negative ionic

1981
01:15:29,698 --> 01:15:33,599
you know everything so you're getting

1982
01:15:32,279 --> 01:15:35,880
more calcium you're getting more

1983
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:38,280
magnesium and all this system works

1984
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:40,619
better if you have those negative

1985
01:15:38,279 --> 01:15:43,139
attraction sites and it

1986
01:15:40,619 --> 01:15:45,059
I could go into this in more detail in

1987
01:15:43,140 --> 01:15:47,400
in another time but

1988
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:48,900
what I can tell you right now is the way

1989
01:15:47,399 --> 01:15:51,539
you can get this is through compost

1990
01:15:48,899 --> 01:15:54,299
earthworm castings and using those inert

1991
01:15:51,539 --> 01:15:56,579
materials like like Char for example

1992
01:15:54,300 --> 01:16:00,360
you know Char isn't humic material it

1993
01:15:56,579 --> 01:16:03,238
does it unfold to accept more ions it's

1994
01:16:00,359 --> 01:16:06,599
just a carbon 14 frame which will hold

1995
01:16:03,238 --> 01:16:09,178
ions okay

1996
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:12,300
the humic molecule this is what's weird

1997
01:16:09,179 --> 01:16:14,699
about it actually unfolds

1998
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:17,039
to accept more

1999
01:16:14,698 --> 01:16:19,559
so it's just this weird mechanism that

2000
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:21,960
like the whole Earth runs on it and you

2001
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:23,340
can look it up and read about it

2002
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:26,039
um some of the better studies come out

2003
01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:27,119
of Germany on it

2004
01:16:26,039 --> 01:16:29,939
um

2005
01:16:27,119 --> 01:16:31,979
yeah check it out you know

2006
01:16:29,939 --> 01:16:34,500
check it out

2007
01:16:31,979 --> 01:16:36,479
that's that's cool to hear I mean I I

2008
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:38,819
guess I would be interested to ask you

2009
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:41,279
are there any things which over the

2010
01:16:38,819 --> 01:16:43,079
years you've realized uh probably more

2011
01:16:41,279 --> 01:16:46,079
important I mean I guess the obvious one

2012
01:16:43,079 --> 01:16:48,420
is like inorganics watering when you do

2013
01:16:46,079 --> 01:16:49,979
it how much that's pretty important

2014
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:51,480
um are there any other things which you

2015
01:16:49,979 --> 01:16:54,658
think are like should really have

2016
01:16:51,479 --> 01:16:57,599
attention paid to them or not so much

2017
01:16:54,658 --> 01:16:59,579
it's really just that you know once you

2018
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:01,320
change the negative ionic surface area

2019
01:16:59,579 --> 01:17:03,899
in your soil your whole game Changes

2020
01:17:01,319 --> 01:17:07,859
Everything Changes

2021
01:17:03,899 --> 01:17:10,619
so whatever food you use is gonna

2022
01:17:07,859 --> 01:17:12,599
have an effect if I go to and buy

2023
01:17:10,619 --> 01:17:15,179
whatever at the grow store it's gonna

2024
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:18,179
it's gonna work if I go and I get some

2025
01:17:15,179 --> 01:17:21,179
horseshit it's gonna work too

2026
01:17:18,179 --> 01:17:23,219
you know as long as that mechanism is

2027
01:17:21,179 --> 01:17:26,039
there as long as that attraction as long

2028
01:17:23,219 --> 01:17:27,539
as those attraction sites are functional

2029
01:17:26,039 --> 01:17:29,158
you know as long as you have them in

2030
01:17:27,539 --> 01:17:31,260
there so when you see people with

2031
01:17:29,158 --> 01:17:33,179
growing in Cocoa cord oh how come my

2032
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:35,159
blood

2033
01:17:33,179 --> 01:17:37,560
it's in air material it doesn't even

2034
01:17:35,158 --> 01:17:39,359
have a negative charge on it man what

2035
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:41,580
are you doing

2036
01:17:39,359 --> 01:17:43,500
you know

2037
01:17:41,579 --> 01:17:45,300
it's that simple man

2038
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:48,119
I noticed when I was reading through

2039
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:49,739
some of the old posts I had seen that

2040
01:17:48,119 --> 01:17:51,779
there was at one point at least there

2041
01:17:49,738 --> 01:17:54,119
was some talk of you leaving icy mag

2042
01:17:51,779 --> 01:17:56,279
starting your own forum is that

2043
01:17:54,119 --> 01:17:58,500
something you ever want to pursue or not

2044
01:17:56,279 --> 01:18:01,019
so much no we did that's what happened

2045
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:02,698
they banned us because they thought they

2046
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:04,679
were they were spying on us in a private

2047
01:18:02,698 --> 01:18:08,579
group and I see mad we had an advanced

2048
01:18:04,679 --> 01:18:09,899
living soil uh private page you know and

2049
01:18:08,579 --> 01:18:12,059
there were mods in there and everything

2050
01:18:09,899 --> 01:18:15,599
and one of the mods knocked us out to

2051
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:17,280
like skip or somebody you know these

2052
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:19,800
guys are they're talking about going to

2053
01:18:17,279 --> 01:18:21,059
the Sea Depot because they they say we

2054
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:23,279
suck here

2055
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:25,320
you know this is when the sea Depot

2056
01:18:23,279 --> 01:18:27,359
opened up and whoever that what was that

2057
01:18:25,319 --> 01:18:29,519
guy's name I don't know but he ran off

2058
01:18:27,359 --> 01:18:31,738
with everybody's money or something but

2059
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:34,920
anyway he opened up the sea Depot and

2060
01:18:31,738 --> 01:18:36,539
and or whatever that that Forum was or

2061
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:39,000
whatever the hell that thing was called

2062
01:18:36,539 --> 01:18:40,439
and he made me a mod and made to other

2063
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,179
people mod and we had a big section

2064
01:18:40,439 --> 01:18:44,399
there and that's that's where we took

2065
01:18:42,179 --> 01:18:47,039
over the Forum again

2066
01:18:44,399 --> 01:18:48,899
but then that collapsed he got busted

2067
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:51,719
doing something or ripping people off or

2068
01:18:48,899 --> 01:18:54,899
some [ __ ] and then we created our own

2069
01:18:51,719 --> 01:18:57,840
website which got really big

2070
01:18:54,899 --> 01:18:58,738
super big massive members everybody knew

2071
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:01,020
about it

2072
01:18:58,738 --> 01:19:02,639
but it was Private because we get sick

2073
01:19:01,020 --> 01:19:04,620
of dealing with [ __ ] dumbasses and

2074
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:06,600
trolls you know if you're gonna come in

2075
01:19:04,619 --> 01:19:09,000
here and start [ __ ] you're out man

2076
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:10,320
you know and and people did get banned

2077
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:13,500
because they would do that they would

2078
01:19:10,319 --> 01:19:15,779
argue and fight and and just go against

2079
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:17,760
the progression of it so of course

2080
01:19:15,779 --> 01:19:19,979
you're getting [ __ ] banned so a lot

2081
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:21,719
of those problems reflect on me now

2082
01:19:19,979 --> 01:19:23,698
because of the people we banned back

2083
01:19:21,719 --> 01:19:25,679
then you know

2084
01:19:23,698 --> 01:19:28,439
like dank Frank and all those other

2085
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:30,779
disgruntled employee Vibe people

2086
01:19:28,439 --> 01:19:32,879
you know they their butt hurt because

2087
01:19:30,779 --> 01:19:34,559
they didn't get what they wanted out of

2088
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:36,300
it they didn't get they didn't get my

2089
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:38,159
seeds they didn't get this they didn't

2090
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:39,420
get that they didn't get to be a mod or

2091
01:19:38,158 --> 01:19:42,779
they you know

2092
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:45,359
it's some kind of uh entitlement issue

2093
01:19:42,779 --> 01:19:47,698
you know and they were never even hired

2094
01:19:45,359 --> 01:19:48,420
this is all volunteer [ __ ]

2095
01:19:47,698 --> 01:19:51,299
um

2096
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:53,640
yeah sure I can see people often get

2097
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:55,440
very passionate and uh involved in these

2098
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:57,179
sorts of things I've got a bit of a

2099
01:19:55,439 --> 01:19:58,919
longer question here to ask you but it

2100
01:19:57,179 --> 01:20:00,420
was one that sort of I was hoping to get

2101
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:02,940
around to and this seems like a good

2102
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:05,520
point to jump into it basically as I was

2103
01:20:02,939 --> 01:20:07,799
sort of doing some research for our chat

2104
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:09,719
um I I came across some posts of people

2105
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:12,060
who sort of said that their experiences

2106
01:20:09,719 --> 01:20:14,100
with you were a little bit questionable

2107
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:15,900
but then many of those same people would

2108
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:18,719
go on to put a post up and say oh you

2109
01:20:15,899 --> 01:20:20,399

50 percent of the time it's a positive

2175
01:22:36,238 --> 01:22:39,839
experience fifty percent of the time

2176
01:22:38,039 --> 01:22:41,760
it's a pain in the [ __ ] ass

2177

look yeah as someone who has sold seeds

2182
01:22:48,238 --> 01:22:52,919
themselves uh I certainly feel like

2183
01:22:50,399 --> 01:22:55,139
there are some very high expectations at

2184
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:56,520
times like I remember one guy he like

2185
01:22:55,140 --> 01:22:57,780
made payment on the seeds and like

2186
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:59,460
within an hour he's like where's the

2187
01:22:57,779 --> 01:23:00,960

01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:14,399
so what we do is we take orders we have

2194
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:17,219
a thing now where we take orders for two

2195
01:23:14,399 --> 01:23:19,738
weeks and then we pack seeds and we send

2196
01:23:17,219 --> 01:23:21,840
them to our distributor who then sends

2197
01:23:19,738 --> 01:23:24,479

2201
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:31,679
happy to work with them and they're

2202
01:23:30,238 --> 01:23:33,779
doing a good job and they're getting our

2203
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:35,699
[ __ ] out there and there's a lot less

2204
01:23:33,779 --> 01:23:37,679
Mix-Ups now

2205
01:23:35,698 --> 01:23:39,178
yeah that's awesome to hear and there

2206
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:40,500
you go for anyone who's keen on getting

2207
01:23:39,179 --> 01:23:42,960
some of your gear that sounds like a

2208
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:44,640
good spot to stop by do they have an

2209
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:46,800
Instagram or their primarily website

2210
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:48,539
sort of thing I believe they have a

2211
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:50,520
website and they have an Instagram page

2212
01:23:48,539 --> 01:23:52,079
and they distribute other people's seeds

2213
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:54,900
as well

2214
01:23:52,079 --> 01:23:57,420
yeah fantastic I found myself working

2215
01:23:54,899 --> 01:23:59,099
with seed banks who prioritize like

2216
01:23:57,420 --> 01:24:00,960
customer service and quick shipping has

2217
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:02,820
always worked really well

2218
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:04,800
yeah if you have a good relationship

2219
01:24:02,819 --> 01:24:07,380
with people and everything's flowing

2220
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:10,140
good and right everybody's happy man

2221
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:12,359
you know these guys get their seeds in a

2222
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:14,880
decent amount of time and

2223
01:24:12,359 --> 01:24:17,099
but you know sometimes weird [ __ ]

2224
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:19,859
happens you know

2225
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:22,440
as a a more personal question I was

2226
01:24:19,859 --> 01:24:26,158
lucky enough to be gifted uh some of

2227
01:24:22,439 --> 01:24:28,678
your nl5 Haze I believe it's the F4 it

2228
01:24:26,158 --> 01:24:30,719
could be the F5 I think it's the F4 I

2229
01:24:28,679 --> 01:24:32,340
wanted to know you got any tips for me

2230
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:34,198
any certain phenos you think I should

2231
01:24:32,340 --> 01:24:35,880
keep an eye out for what's your

2232
01:24:34,198 --> 01:24:39,719
recommendations

2233
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:41,460
the F4 is pro will probably probably be

2234
01:24:39,719 --> 01:24:43,439
pretty good but it's not as refined as

2235
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:45,300
the F6 you know because every time I I

2236
01:24:43,439 --> 01:24:47,158
go through them I go through a lot of

2237
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:48,480
numbers and I always get rid of the [ __ ]

2238
01:24:47,158 --> 01:24:50,698
you know there was that there was

2239
01:24:48,479 --> 01:24:53,339
intersex in that line from the beginning

2240
01:24:50,698 --> 01:24:55,859
and now F6 I don't see I don't see

2241
01:24:53,340 --> 01:24:57,480
intersex anymore

2242
01:24:55,859 --> 01:24:59,819
so that's good

2243
01:24:57,479 --> 01:25:03,779
so it's possible and therefore you might

2244
01:24:59,819 --> 01:25:06,779
see some nanner maybe but unlikely I

2245
01:25:03,779 --> 01:25:08,579
would say 99 no

2246
01:25:06,779 --> 01:25:11,880
you know but you're gonna see more

2247
01:25:08,579 --> 01:25:15,140
sativa Expressions back at F4

2248
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:18,000
uh that's got me excited

2249
01:25:15,140 --> 01:25:19,619
yeah and it's no joke man you know this

2250
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:23,279
is Herb that you like

2251
01:25:19,619 --> 01:25:24,840
it's gonna sit in your jar for maybe a

2252
01:25:23,279 --> 01:25:27,179
year because you're you know you're not

2253
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:29,940
gonna smoke it that much

2254
01:25:27,179 --> 01:25:31,859
you know oh you gotta be excited now

2255
01:25:29,939 --> 01:25:35,039
that's that's amazing

2256
01:25:31,859 --> 01:25:37,139
so oh and I was also gonna say I uh I

2257
01:25:35,039 --> 01:25:39,000
feel like as Growers people need to

2258
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:40,679
accept that every now and again you're

2259
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:42,300
gonna get a plan with a nano and that's

2260
01:25:40,679 --> 01:25:43,440
okay you know the world keeps turning

2261
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:45,119
it's all good

2262
01:25:43,439 --> 01:25:46,919
well here's a here's something that

2263
01:25:45,119 --> 01:25:49,260
people don't realize is that you can

2264
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:50,520
take these stable lines and and give

2265
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:53,219
them a little bit of stress and guess

2266
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:57,480
what happens oh man yeah

2267
01:25:53,219 --> 01:25:59,520
stress anything and and stuff man that

2268
01:25:57,479 --> 01:26:02,759
I've I've worked so hard on and I give

2269
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:04,739
it a little stress and boom you know

2270
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:08,219
it's just the nature of the Beast man

2271
01:26:04,738 --> 01:26:09,779
you know you can't you can't you can't

2272
01:26:08,219 --> 01:26:10,859
get rid of something that's part of it

2273
01:26:09,779 --> 01:26:12,779
yeah

2274
01:26:10,859 --> 01:26:15,420
you know and if you bring any condition

2275
01:26:12,779 --> 01:26:19,019
that's gonna wake that up it's gonna

2276
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:21,960
wake up you know certainly

2277
01:26:19,020 --> 01:26:23,880
look Let's uh let's go back to the

2278
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:26,819
question we used to start off the

2279
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:29,699
interviews with tell me about your very

2280
01:26:26,819 --> 01:26:31,259
first experience with cannabis

2281
01:26:29,698 --> 01:26:34,500
oh you know

2282
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:37,940
probably as a kid you know I start

2283
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:41,039
smoking herb in the 70s you know

2284
01:26:37,939 --> 01:26:44,099
back then parents smoked her but they're

2285
01:26:41,039 --> 01:26:45,719
kids it was like you know it wasn't so

2286
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:47,820
frowned upon you know people think oh

2287
01:26:45,719 --> 01:26:49,859
what was the 70s like well everybody

2288
01:26:47,819 --> 01:26:52,738
smoked pot man

2289
01:26:49,859 --> 01:26:54,238
everywhere you went everybody smoke pot

2290
01:26:52,738 --> 01:26:55,979
you know

2291
01:26:54,238 --> 01:26:58,979
so but I didn't tell my mom I was

2292
01:26:55,979 --> 01:27:01,319
smoking pot in fourth grade man you know

2293
01:26:58,979 --> 01:27:03,359
like go out with my friends after

2294
01:27:01,319 --> 01:27:06,179
pinching some Thai stick off them or

2295
01:27:03,359 --> 01:27:08,519
something and and and and go smoke it

2296
01:27:06,179 --> 01:27:11,158
after school with them and Chase ducks

2297
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:14,659
at the park or something you know play

2298
01:27:11,158 --> 01:27:17,879
football or frisbee or something

2299
01:27:14,658 --> 01:27:20,638
you know until we had to go home and eat

2300
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:22,500
and then I guess somewhere around sixth

2301
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:25,319
grade I went and lived with my dad my

2302
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:26,760
dad was way more heady you know biker he

2303
01:27:25,319 --> 01:27:28,319
was teaching he didn't give a [ __ ] he

2304
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:30,239
was like

2305
01:27:28,319 --> 01:27:30,899
whatever just don't make a habit out of

2306
01:27:30,238 --> 01:27:34,138
it

2307
01:27:30,899 --> 01:27:36,479
so you know we get big but when I was 13

2308
01:27:34,139 --> 01:27:39,420
14 I was getting bong hits for allowance

2309
01:27:36,479 --> 01:27:42,359
man every day dude would leave a bong

2310
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:44,158
hit on the counter for me and my brother

2311
01:27:42,359 --> 01:27:45,779
after we got on the bus because he

2312
01:27:44,158 --> 01:27:47,399
didn't want us he didn't put the weed

2313
01:27:45,779 --> 01:27:50,460
out before you know he got on the bus

2314
01:27:47,399 --> 01:27:51,420
but after school man we raised each

2315
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:54,779
other home

2316
01:27:51,420 --> 01:27:57,300
you know to get the bong first

2317
01:27:54,779 --> 01:27:59,460
I sure [ __ ] man and he wanted us to do

2318
01:27:57,300 --> 01:28:01,020
our chores first you know do the dishes

2319
01:27:59,460 --> 01:28:03,420
clean up the house vacuum and all this

2320
01:28:01,020 --> 01:28:05,100
other [ __ ] before we smoked our herb

2321
01:28:03,420 --> 01:28:08,060
because he knew you know if we smoked I

2322
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:08,060
heard we just sit there and go

2323
01:28:08,219 --> 01:28:13,380
so we we obliged in we did our chores

2324
01:28:11,219 --> 01:28:16,139
first before we smoked our herb and

2325
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:18,359
everything but that's how our lives were

2326
01:28:16,139 --> 01:28:21,239
we scored weed for our parents all

2327
01:28:18,359 --> 01:28:23,759
throughout our teenage years you know

2328
01:28:21,238 --> 01:28:25,738
yeah wow it does really make you realize

2329
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:28,020
it's been quite a shift in the dynamic

2330
01:28:25,738 --> 01:28:29,099
hasn't it it's a different it was a

2331
01:28:28,020 --> 01:28:31,139
different world growing up in the

2332
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:33,960
Pacific Northwest you know

2333
01:28:31,139 --> 01:28:35,460
it was it really was it was like we were

2334
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:37,319
just isolated from the rest of the world

2335
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:38,340
as far as like the Cannabis culture

2336
01:28:37,319 --> 01:28:39,899
thing went

2337
01:28:38,340 --> 01:28:42,360
you know that you had your cannabis

2338
01:28:39,899 --> 01:28:44,879
culture in California which was kind of

2339
01:28:42,359 --> 01:28:46,979
like the culture up here

2340
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:49,380
but I don't know we just had our own

2341
01:28:46,979 --> 01:28:52,500
little bubble up here you know

2342
01:28:49,380 --> 01:28:54,300
yeah it's very lucky indeed so if we

2343
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:57,359
move forward a little bit what

2344
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:59,460
stimulated you to do your first grow

2345
01:28:57,359 --> 01:29:02,099
well I'd grown an herb you know like I

2346
01:28:59,460 --> 01:29:03,719
said as a as a kid with my parents we

2347
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:05,880
just that's what we did

2348
01:29:03,719 --> 01:29:08,520
so I took care of the plants as they did

2349
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:11,760
we watered them

2350
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:14,580
but I didn't grow myself you know

2351
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:17,699
because I I'd left home and wanted to

2352
01:29:14,579 --> 01:29:19,198
just go be a person you know put on did

2353
01:29:17,698 --> 01:29:21,839
all that [ __ ] went to college Grateful

2354
01:29:19,198 --> 01:29:24,178
Dead and all that [ __ ] and and just my

2355
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:25,619
Fascination still lied in cannabis

2356
01:29:24,179 --> 01:29:27,420
you know I wanted to be one of these

2357
01:29:25,619 --> 01:29:29,340
guys I didn't realize it back then but I

2358
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:32,460
wanted to be one of these guys the white

2359
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:34,380
lab coat and working in in a lab and

2360
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:35,698
taking tissue cultures and doing all

2361
01:29:34,380 --> 01:29:37,260
this crazy [ __ ]

2362
01:29:35,698 --> 01:29:38,939
but I didn't realize back then that I

2363
01:29:37,260 --> 01:29:40,920
was working for the wrong team if I was

2364
01:29:38,939 --> 01:29:43,019
going to continue down that path

2365
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:45,179
you know what I mean

2366
01:29:43,020 --> 01:29:47,639
so I made a decision you know after all

2367
01:29:45,179 --> 01:29:51,060
several Grateful Dead shows

2368
01:29:47,639 --> 01:29:53,279
to to to freelance this and do it myself

2369
01:29:51,060 --> 01:29:55,320
you know what I mean

2370
01:29:53,279 --> 01:29:58,679
so I started you know I started breeding

2371
01:29:55,319 --> 01:30:00,719
probably oh 93 just throwing pollen

2372
01:29:58,679 --> 01:30:03,119
around making my own seeds just for

2373
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:04,380
environmental purposes because most of

2374
01:30:03,119 --> 01:30:06,420
the stuff that we were getting out of

2375
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:08,460
the seed banks or a cut from your buddy

2376
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:10,739
or whatever your half gooey cut you got

2377
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:13,739
it didn't make it man

2378
01:30:10,738 --> 01:30:16,619
you know we're up here we're getting

2379
01:30:13,738 --> 01:30:17,698
frosts in September we want to crop the

2380
01:30:16,619 --> 01:30:19,859
finishes

2381
01:30:17,698 --> 01:30:23,279
so that's what I started doing I started

2382
01:30:19,859 --> 01:30:26,339
breeding four crops that finished so by

2383
01:30:23,279 --> 01:30:28,319
2000 I had types that

2384
01:30:26,340 --> 01:30:31,020
you know that would could withstand

2385
01:30:28,319 --> 01:30:33,719
cellular damage of you know minus

2386
01:30:31,020 --> 01:30:37,920
whatever degrees and they would finish

2387
01:30:33,719 --> 01:30:40,279
in you know early October and

2388
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:42,899
you'd get a harvest

2389
01:30:40,279 --> 01:30:44,579
and what's one of the first Creations

2390
01:30:42,899 --> 01:30:46,259
you made where you were like really

2391
01:30:44,579 --> 01:30:48,119
proud of it and you're like [ __ ] I could

2392
01:30:46,260 --> 01:30:51,960
like sell this basically

2393
01:30:48,119 --> 01:30:54,179
oh I think it was uh I got uh what used

2394
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:56,460
to be called Eugene green

2395
01:30:54,179 --> 01:30:58,619
and I crossed it to an old Oregon

2396
01:30:56,460 --> 01:31:01,319
blueberry and then I crossed it to the

2397
01:30:58,619 --> 01:31:03,300
Alaskan [ __ ] to an old Alaskan

2398
01:31:01,319 --> 01:31:05,340
Thunder [ __ ] from up here that was it

2399
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:06,480
had been around a long time probably 30

2400
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:09,300
years

2401
01:31:06,479 --> 01:31:11,459
a guy grew at 7 000 feet in just a month

2402
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:13,800
you know some of the phenotypes finished

2403
01:31:11,460 --> 01:31:15,719
in July some of them finished in October

2404
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:17,460
some of them are two feet high some of

2405
01:31:15,719 --> 01:31:20,340
them are 14 feet high

2406
01:31:17,460 --> 01:31:22,920
you know but it was the real Alaskan

2407
01:31:20,340 --> 01:31:25,920
Thunder [ __ ] a nice red you know dark

2408
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:28,139
plants that that Alaskan smell and

2409
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:29,819
everything said I knew that that's what

2410
01:31:28,139 --> 01:31:31,560
I gotta work with if I want to bring

2411
01:31:29,819 --> 01:31:35,579
this modern

2412
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:37,679
flower into this bag

2413
01:31:35,579 --> 01:31:40,198
you know and I did

2414
01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:42,658
out of curiosity I think I'm just

2415
01:31:40,198 --> 01:31:44,339
probably a bit uneducated in this aspect

2416
01:31:42,658 --> 01:31:46,979
what do you think are the genetics

2417
01:31:44,340 --> 01:31:49,020
behind the uh ATF

2418
01:31:46,979 --> 01:31:51,359
oh it's like it's got a rush in it for

2419
01:31:49,020 --> 01:31:54,120
sure a rooter Alice but I don't think it

2420
01:31:51,359 --> 01:31:57,000
was a tribal you know like nowadays it

2421
01:31:54,119 --> 01:31:59,519
wasn't a a tribal drug type

2422
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:02,340
it was just a [ __ ] Rooter Alice

2423
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:04,199
nowadays you have Tribal drug drug types

2424
01:32:02,340 --> 01:32:07,139
that are autoflowers from as far north

2425
01:32:04,198 --> 01:32:09,419
as 50 50 degrees

2426
01:32:07,139 --> 01:32:11,699
and I got a bunch of them man you know

2427
01:32:09,420 --> 01:32:13,440
but Auto flowers don't fascinate me I

2428
01:32:11,698 --> 01:32:15,658
think that's just dumb you know it's

2429
01:32:13,439 --> 01:32:17,939
boring breeding it's boring

2430
01:32:15,658 --> 01:32:20,399
do you think to a certain extent that

2431
01:32:17,939 --> 01:32:22,619
orders are sort of always going to be

2432
01:32:20,399 --> 01:32:24,119
somewhat inferior to photo period or do

2433
01:32:22,619 --> 01:32:26,579
you think they will come a day where

2434
01:32:24,119 --> 01:32:29,939
they're a bit more equal playing field

2435
01:32:26,579 --> 01:32:32,579
I got a friend right now who last year

2436
01:32:29,939 --> 01:32:35,698
did nothing but breed autos

2437
01:32:32,579 --> 01:32:37,559
and the results were pretty neat man he

2438
01:32:35,698 --> 01:32:40,079
used a bunch of my stuff

2439
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:42,960
and I was like wow

2440
01:32:40,079 --> 01:32:44,340
that looks just like the original

2441
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:46,079
you know

2442
01:32:44,340 --> 01:32:47,940
so there's potential in it and there's

2443
01:32:46,079 --> 01:32:49,800
use in it absolutely

2444
01:32:47,939 --> 01:32:51,539
you know but I wouldn't say I'm like

2445
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:55,020
Jeff lowenfellas and I'm gonna predict

2446
01:32:51,539 --> 01:32:57,539
that's gonna be the wave of the future

2447
01:32:55,020 --> 01:32:58,800
yeah I remember when he uh said that on

2448
01:32:57,539 --> 01:33:00,359
the show I'm sure he said it other

2449
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:01,800
places as well but when he said it on

2450
01:33:00,359 --> 01:33:03,238
the show there was a few listeners who

2451
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:06,600
were like not sure that'll be the case

2452
01:33:03,238 --> 01:33:09,259
no I I gave him some other one by a

2453
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:12,300
Kazakhstan too to take up to Alaska

2454
01:33:09,260 --> 01:33:14,219
I don't know whatever happened to it but

2455
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:15,840
I'm pretty sure you know it did throw

2456
01:33:14,219 --> 01:33:17,399
off those Auto flower trades up there

2457
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:20,159
yeah

2458
01:33:17,399 --> 01:33:22,679
yeah nice nice nice nice nice

2459
01:33:20,158 --> 01:33:24,420
so I don't think I've asked you but I'd

2460
01:33:22,679 --> 01:33:27,239
be interested to know do you consider

2461
01:33:24,420 --> 01:33:28,739
yourself more of a concentrate or flower

2462
01:33:27,238 --> 01:33:30,479
guy

2463
01:33:28,738 --> 01:33:33,479
I like flowers man I don't smoke that

2464
01:33:30,479 --> 01:33:36,439
[ __ ] oh yeah you rip it you're a bong

2465
01:33:33,479 --> 01:33:38,819
guy or a joints or yeah

2466
01:33:36,439 --> 01:33:41,219
since I was like you know 14 years old

2467
01:33:38,819 --> 01:33:43,259
or some [ __ ] bong it up you know some

2468
01:33:41,219 --> 01:33:45,359
some period in my life somewhere in my

2469
01:33:43,260 --> 01:33:47,760
20s I thought joints was cool while I

2470
01:33:45,359 --> 01:33:49,679
was while I was driving concrete mixer

2471
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:52,199
or something you know

2472
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:54,719
but I can't even smoke a joint without

2473
01:33:52,198 --> 01:33:56,879
hacking now man you know

2474
01:33:54,719 --> 01:33:58,560
It's Paper I can't stand that paper man

2475
01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:00,659
you know

2476
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:03,360
in the dabs dude I'm just I'm just I'm

2477
01:34:00,658 --> 01:34:04,559
not into it man I get so much more out

2478
01:34:03,359 --> 01:34:08,519
of the flower

2479
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:11,940
so much more so much more pleasure so

2480
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:13,620
much more effect than this just big glob

2481
01:34:11,939 --> 01:34:15,419
of [ __ ]

2482
01:34:13,619 --> 01:34:17,639
you know

2483
01:34:15,420 --> 01:34:20,219
I think it's silly humans you know

2484
01:34:17,639 --> 01:34:21,659
always wanting more

2485
01:34:20,219 --> 01:34:23,219
yeah I think you just perfectly

2486
01:34:21,658 --> 01:34:25,319
expressed my feelings on that as well

2487
01:34:23,219 --> 01:34:27,060
like yeah I just get so much more out of

2488
01:34:25,319 --> 01:34:28,859
flowers and I never really Vibe with the

2489
01:34:27,060 --> 01:34:30,780
dabs but I think it's probably related

2490
01:34:28,859 --> 01:34:33,000
to tolerance and whatnot and I think

2491
01:34:30,779 --> 01:34:34,979
there's value to keeping your tolerance

2492
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:39,119
to dabs low

2493
01:34:34,979 --> 01:34:40,678
yeah I wouldn't I just why you know like

2494
01:34:39,119 --> 01:34:42,539
I said I can take one hit of black

2495
01:34:40,679 --> 01:34:44,880
Columbian and be

2496
01:34:42,539 --> 01:34:47,939
keyed up right you know

2497
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:49,440
function talk be

2498
01:34:47,939 --> 01:34:51,599
you know

2499
01:34:49,439 --> 01:34:53,460
so we sort of touched on this a little

2500
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:55,980
bit earlier but I'd love to just flesh

2501
01:34:53,460 --> 01:34:58,380
it out slightly more what was the last

2502
01:34:55,979 --> 01:35:01,319
thing you smoked that left a really

2503
01:34:58,380 --> 01:35:03,539
lasting impactful memory fee where you

2504
01:35:01,319 --> 01:35:06,899
were like wow that was neat

2505
01:35:03,539 --> 01:35:11,219
we'll Hawking by chocolate dye

2506
01:35:06,899 --> 01:35:14,279
yeah good good stuff man like right

2507
01:35:11,219 --> 01:35:18,239
there that's that's what I'm after

2508
01:35:14,279 --> 01:35:19,979
that's that's it man that's it you know

2509
01:35:18,238 --> 01:35:22,559
and I don't want to say it too loud but

2510
01:35:19,979 --> 01:35:25,500
I guess I just did you know because I

2511
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:27,480
don't got many seeds left but you know

2512
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:30,300
once you say that these people want them

2513
01:35:27,479 --> 01:35:32,099
it's the truth it's really nice herb

2514
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:35,039
dude you know it's like one hit and

2515
01:35:32,100 --> 01:35:37,260
you're like wow this is cool

2516
01:35:35,039 --> 01:35:39,719
like you feel like a little kid again

2517
01:35:37,260 --> 01:35:42,539
you know yeah it sounds like it could be

2518
01:35:39,719 --> 01:35:44,880
like very haze-esque

2519
01:35:42,539 --> 01:35:47,399
it's it's nice

2520
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:50,340
um some of the phenotypes are maybe too

2521
01:35:47,399 --> 01:35:53,819
potent you know for functionality

2522
01:35:50,340 --> 01:35:55,920
but most of them were pretty good and if

2523
01:35:53,819 --> 01:35:57,420
you find the right one so so what I'm

2524
01:35:55,920 --> 01:35:58,859
going to do is I'm just gonna I'm just

2525
01:35:57,420 --> 01:36:01,560
gonna do it I'm gonna make a blueberry

2526
01:35:58,859 --> 01:36:03,960
just because just because I can and

2527
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:06,780
because I have velvet Rush

2528
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:09,420
you know you know what that is

2529
01:36:06,779 --> 01:36:13,920
I was gonna ask I got a question tell me

2530
01:36:09,420 --> 01:36:13,920
about velvet rash okay

2531
01:36:15,119 --> 01:36:18,960
blue tie and it's the Brotherhood of

2532
01:36:17,219 --> 01:36:22,859
Eternal loves Highland blue tie and it

2533
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:25,920
was imported from 76 to 77 for 15 months

2534
01:36:22,859 --> 01:36:30,599
in military cargo shipments via plane

2535
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:31,679
that landed in 29 Palms okay

2536
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:35,159
yeah

2537
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:37,139
now when they distributed it it was the

2538
01:36:35,158 --> 01:36:39,359
best thing going around but it only

2539
01:36:37,139 --> 01:36:42,179
lasted for 15 months because when the

2540
01:36:39,359 --> 01:36:44,158
man got wind of it they shut it down

2541
01:36:42,179 --> 01:36:46,079
so that's why that

2542
01:36:44,158 --> 01:36:48,839
little amount of Highland bow tie was

2543
01:36:46,079 --> 01:36:51,198
around so collectors you know Mel Frank

2544
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:54,179
DJ whoever

2545
01:36:51,198 --> 01:36:55,439
obviously found out about it and got a

2546
01:36:54,179 --> 01:36:57,060
hold of it

2547
01:36:55,439 --> 01:36:59,519
you know

2548
01:36:57,060 --> 01:37:01,679
well anyway it was DJ who who crossed

2549
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:03,540
the Highland blue tie to The Afghani

2550
01:37:01,679 --> 01:37:07,079
number one the Kabul

2551
01:37:03,539 --> 01:37:09,329
it was mailed from Kabul in 79 to Mel

2552
01:37:07,079 --> 01:37:10,559
Frank you know

2553
01:37:09,329 --> 01:37:12,359
[Music]

2554
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:15,480
that's what it is

2555
01:37:12,359 --> 01:37:18,238
okay so what happened was

2556
01:37:15,479 --> 01:37:20,879
DJ worked the line

2557
01:37:18,238 --> 01:37:23,879
and somewhere back there in his workings

2558
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:25,920
gave some seed to Mel okay

2559
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:29,460
now when the Brotherhood had a barbecue

2560
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:31,199
in Eugene Oregon in 1986 Mel Frank was

2561
01:37:29,460 --> 01:37:34,198
there and so was coop

2562
01:37:31,198 --> 01:37:37,619
and so were other Brotherhood guys

2563
01:37:34,198 --> 01:37:41,158
so cute and Mel hit it off Mel gave

2564
01:37:37,619 --> 01:37:43,500
back to Brotherhood The Velvet Rush the

2565
01:37:41,158 --> 01:37:45,299
other half you know it was molested but

2566
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:46,198
the Highland blue tie got back to the

2567
01:37:45,300 --> 01:37:48,239
Brotherhood

2568
01:37:46,198 --> 01:37:50,339
so coot gave it to the Brotherhood down

2569
01:37:48,238 --> 01:37:51,658
in San Clemente and they took it in the

2570
01:37:50,340 --> 01:37:53,159
hills and they grew up for six or seven

2571
01:37:51,658 --> 01:37:55,379
years

2572
01:37:53,158 --> 01:37:57,779
and they said

2573
01:37:55,380 --> 01:37:59,400
it was amazing they said every color in

2574
01:37:57,779 --> 01:38:01,319
the rainbow was in the plants they were

2575
01:37:59,399 --> 01:38:04,198
nothing but Bud they looked like

2576
01:38:01,319 --> 01:38:06,299
Christmas trees they're probably 20 feet

2577
01:38:04,198 --> 01:38:08,819
tall

2578
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:10,739
um just monsters and they did that for

2579
01:38:08,819 --> 01:38:11,939
however many years five six years and

2580
01:38:10,738 --> 01:38:15,500
then put the seed

2581
01:38:11,939 --> 01:38:15,500
you know the seat away

2582
01:38:15,719 --> 01:38:21,658
for however long that was from 91 until

2583
01:38:18,619 --> 01:38:24,420
2010 when I got it

2584
01:38:21,658 --> 01:38:28,920
and opened them up and repopulated them

2585
01:38:24,420 --> 01:38:33,239
and yeah I did give it back to DJ okay

2586
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:35,940
like pretty quickly too like here man

2587
01:38:33,238 --> 01:38:38,459
you know no thanks no nothing

2588
01:38:35,939 --> 01:38:40,138
you know what I mean just whatever and I

IBL it and keep it as original

2602

2606
01:39:14,939 --> 01:39:17,819

2607
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:19,679
that [ __ ]

2608
01:39:17,819 --> 01:39:22,679
you know

2609
01:39:19,679 --> 01:39:24,779
can we expect to see that offering yeah

2610
01:39:22,679 --> 01:39:27,800
we'll do that this year

2611
01:39:24,779 --> 01:39:30,000
because I'm halfway through it

2612
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:32,039
that'll be neat for sure because I know

2613
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:34,260
a lot of people really want that like F1

2614
01:39:32,039 --> 01:39:36,779
blueberry not like the F5 or whatever

2615
01:39:34,260 --> 01:39:38,639
DJ's got it at well it's not that I'm

2616
01:39:36,779 --> 01:39:42,179
trying to copy the guy I just have a

2617
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:44,279
Fascination and how that happened and I

2618
01:39:42,179 --> 01:39:47,399
want to see it for myself I just want to

2619
01:39:44,279 --> 01:39:49,920
experience that for myself and through

2620
01:39:47,399 --> 01:39:54,179
my own hands not that I'm gonna oh I'm

2621
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:57,658
an American bunch of money yeah [ __ ] you

2622
01:39:54,179 --> 01:39:59,579
no it's not my trip man you know

2623
01:39:57,658 --> 01:40:02,759
I just I'm more I'm more into just

2624
01:39:59,579 --> 01:40:05,100
seeing the fascination of the line you

2625
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:06,480
know how these things work together the

2626
01:40:05,100 --> 01:40:08,880
way that oaxacan works with the

2627
01:40:06,479 --> 01:40:11,158
chocolate and the way the the the tie

2628
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:12,840
works with the Afghani in there and that

2629
01:40:11,158 --> 01:40:14,879
Afghan [ __ ] dude that's one of the

2630
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:16,619
shittiest afghans

2631
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:19,159
you know oh really

2632
01:40:16,619 --> 01:40:19,158
yeah

2633
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:23,279
see that that's really interesting for

2634
01:40:21,479 --> 01:40:25,379
me because I think the thing that you

2635
01:40:23,279 --> 01:40:27,479
consistently read about blueberry is

2636
01:40:25,380 --> 01:40:28,920
that people are like I want the early

2637
01:40:27,479 --> 01:40:30,658
version which had like you know the

2638
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:32,760
blueberry muffin sort of smell the new

2639
01:40:30,658 --> 01:40:34,559
one it doesn't even smell blueberry and

2640
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:36,060
I always wondered like why did he like

2641
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:37,560
he says oh you know I've read for the

2642
01:40:36,060 --> 01:40:39,900
effect not the flavor and it's like yeah

2643
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:41,460
but if you had blueberry muffin like why

2644
01:40:39,899 --> 01:40:43,619
would you expect on the old blueberry

2645
01:40:41,460 --> 01:40:46,380
this morning I smoked some old blueberry

2646
01:40:43,619 --> 01:40:49,079
by velvet Rush okay a back cross two

2647
01:40:46,380 --> 01:40:52,679
velvet Rush this [ __ ] Dynamite one

2648
01:40:49,079 --> 01:40:55,679
hit boom whoa I'm going to the hotel

2649
01:40:52,679 --> 01:40:59,699
you know whoa I'm here

2650
01:40:55,679 --> 01:41:02,158
yeah wow potent [ __ ] but there's not a

2651
01:40:59,698 --> 01:41:04,799
lot of berry flavor in it

2652
01:41:02,158 --> 01:41:06,599
it's it's kind of just Highland blue tie

2653
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:07,739
you know

2654
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:09,719
yeah

2655
01:41:07,738 --> 01:41:12,658
now the old Oregon blueberry which I

2656
01:41:09,719 --> 01:41:14,279
have had and have and worked with

2657
01:41:12,658 --> 01:41:16,979
I didn't never get any males out of the

2658
01:41:14,279 --> 01:41:18,420
old pack I got so that's why I didn't do

2659
01:41:16,979 --> 01:41:21,119
the line

2660
01:41:18,420 --> 01:41:22,679
but I did outcross two appropriate tides

2661
01:41:21,119 --> 01:41:25,859
and like I said I did the back cross to

2662
01:41:22,679 --> 01:41:28,380
Velvet rush just because

2663
01:41:25,859 --> 01:41:31,559
and are they available at the moment

2664
01:41:28,380 --> 01:41:32,880
yeah but there's intersex in the line

2665
01:41:31,560 --> 01:41:34,920
I'll tell you

2666
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:38,100
but the good ones are good you know

2667
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:40,560
they're good it's like one hit pow this

2668
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:41,579
is this is what blueberry is supposed to

2669
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:44,100
be

2670
01:41:41,579 --> 01:41:46,198
now somewhere in

2671
01:41:44,100 --> 01:41:47,639
I don't know when DJ did it but he put

2672
01:41:46,198 --> 01:41:49,618
another Indica in the blueberry and

2673
01:41:47,639 --> 01:41:52,319
that's that's what the world knew as

2674
01:41:49,618 --> 01:41:54,238
blueberry when it was released that nice

2675
01:41:52,319 --> 01:41:57,118
glossy leather leaf and I'm saying it

2676
01:41:54,238 --> 01:42:00,779
was an NL I think it was an NL

2677
01:41:57,118 --> 01:42:03,539
no one or nl5 or something

2678
01:42:00,779 --> 01:42:05,399
as in like just to confirm like as in he

2679
01:42:03,539 --> 01:42:06,779
had like a sort of blueberry clone and

2680
01:42:05,399 --> 01:42:08,279
then he hit something to that and then

2681
01:42:06,779 --> 01:42:10,559
those were sort of the seeds that you

2682
01:42:08,279 --> 01:42:13,319
think went out the whole profile changed

2683
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:15,840
from sativa to Indica like overnight

2684
01:42:13,319 --> 01:42:18,359
and the people were like huh

2685
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:21,900
you know what happened that's not the

2686
01:42:18,359 --> 01:42:24,779
Oregon blueberry sativa we know

2687
01:42:21,899 --> 01:42:26,339
yeah okay that was awesome to hear about

2688
01:42:24,779 --> 01:42:28,500
that everyone I recommend you go grab

2689
01:42:26,340 --> 01:42:30,300
those seeds um I did want to just jump

2690
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:31,319
to a different Cross of yours for a

2691
01:42:30,300 --> 01:42:33,779
moment

2692
01:42:31,319 --> 01:42:36,238
um because I had noticed that you

2693
01:42:33,779 --> 01:42:38,340
released the the Nigerian Sunshine a

2694
01:42:36,238 --> 01:42:40,618
while ago and that also used the the

2695
01:42:38,340 --> 01:42:43,500
blue moon rocks was that the same male

2696
01:42:40,618 --> 01:42:46,158
that you crossed to the one yep

2697
01:42:43,500 --> 01:42:48,779
it was the same male I used

2698
01:42:46,158 --> 01:42:51,899
on all the blue blue moon rocks

2699
01:42:48,779 --> 01:42:56,039
Crossings so that's why all those look

2700
01:42:51,899 --> 01:42:58,439
the same that big giant bog bubble gum

2701
01:42:56,039 --> 01:43:00,198
flower top you know

2702
01:42:58,439 --> 01:43:02,339
yeah yeah

2703
01:43:00,198 --> 01:43:04,138
nice and I mean would you be able to

2704
01:43:02,340 --> 01:43:05,760
give us any of the backstory on the

2705
01:43:04,139 --> 01:43:07,319
Nigerian I think Nigerians are

2706
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:09,060
Australian they're always well received

2707
01:43:07,319 --> 01:43:11,340
but hard to find info on

2708
01:43:09,060 --> 01:43:13,679
okay this Nigerian

2709
01:43:11,340 --> 01:43:15,719
is a Brotherhood Nigerian

2710
01:43:13,679 --> 01:43:19,679
um it was brought back from Nigeria in

2711
01:43:15,719 --> 01:43:21,960
1976 by a be a Brotherhood couple who

2712
01:43:19,679 --> 01:43:25,260
were fleeing persecution from the feds

2713
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:27,420
you know and went to Africa to look for

2714
01:43:25,260 --> 01:43:29,880
exotic textiles

2715
01:43:27,420 --> 01:43:33,239
and that's what they brought back now

2716
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:35,460
they grew it from seed and found that

2717
01:43:33,238 --> 01:43:37,618
particular cut that I had

2718
01:43:35,460 --> 01:43:39,679
and a couple and another one so there

2719
01:43:37,618 --> 01:43:43,979
were two cuts that they'd had since like

2720
01:43:39,679 --> 01:43:46,319
1978 or 79 kept as cuts

2721
01:43:43,979 --> 01:43:48,479
and I was like what

2722
01:43:46,319 --> 01:43:51,059
and there was nothing on earth like this

2723
01:43:48,479 --> 01:43:53,218
okay nothing on earth like this there's

2724
01:43:51,060 --> 01:43:56,280
a Nigerian out in California it's a Big

2725
01:43:53,219 --> 01:43:59,158
Sur somewhere that's the same one but

2726
01:43:56,279 --> 01:44:01,979
it's not the same one it's busted up

2727
01:43:59,158 --> 01:44:04,799
it's outcrossed

2728
01:44:01,979 --> 01:44:07,259
no I I know I know the cat who has this

2729
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:10,380
who he also had the Brotherhood Cruella

2730
01:44:07,260 --> 01:44:12,119
and he also had the sister the only

2731
01:44:10,380 --> 01:44:14,639
other living sister of the one in blue

2732
01:44:12,118 --> 01:44:16,799
Orca which they call Mary Poppins

2733
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:18,060
and at the time man I was like God I

2734
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:20,579
don't just want to take it all these

2735
01:44:18,060 --> 01:44:23,039
guys a [ __ ] like I'm just greedy

2736
01:44:20,579 --> 01:44:24,118
so I didn't oh no it's cool man it's

2737
01:44:23,039 --> 01:44:25,319
cool

2738
01:44:24,118 --> 01:44:26,939
you know

2739
01:44:25,319 --> 01:44:28,859
and now I'm just kicking myself in the

2740
01:44:26,939 --> 01:44:32,638
ass about it because I could have had

2741
01:44:28,859 --> 01:44:35,158
that Cruella and Mary Poppins and

2742
01:44:32,639 --> 01:44:37,739
but the Nigerian was lost okay it was a

2743
01:44:35,158 --> 01:44:39,479
76 Nigerian it was beautiful one hit man

2744
01:44:37,738 --> 01:44:42,000
you're on a Rocket Ride like you've

2745
01:44:39,479 --> 01:44:45,238
never been on your life

2746
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:48,179
and when I outcrossed it to um

2747
01:44:45,238 --> 01:44:50,099
and a former employee lost the cut so I

2748
01:44:48,179 --> 01:44:53,460
don't have it it killed it lost it gone

2749
01:44:50,100 --> 01:44:55,800
so anything I had is the blue moon rocks

2750
01:44:53,460 --> 01:44:58,139
and and everything every time I get into

2751
01:44:55,800 --> 01:44:59,279
that line I'm always looking for that

2752
01:44:58,139 --> 01:45:01,319
Nigerian

2753
01:44:59,279 --> 01:45:04,859
you know

2754
01:45:01,319 --> 01:45:08,639
um there's a guy uh boy forget his name

2755
01:45:04,859 --> 01:45:11,759
uh Synergy genetics on Instagram

2756
01:45:08,639 --> 01:45:15,179
he is a nice expression of a Nigerian

2757
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:18,480
sunshine with that Nigerian expression

2758
01:45:15,179 --> 01:45:20,779
popping out nice and big if you wanna if

2759
01:45:18,479 --> 01:45:24,000
you want to see what you're looking at

2760
01:45:20,779 --> 01:45:27,420
there we go we'll have to go suss that

2761
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:30,300
out I mean if we quickly jump to another

2762
01:45:27,420 --> 01:45:33,359
strand that I think uh is quite notable

2763
01:45:30,300 --> 01:45:35,219
I'd be really grateful to hear your

2764
01:45:33,359 --> 01:45:37,139
thoughts on Cherry Bomb you know like

2765
01:45:35,219 --> 01:45:38,760
the the infamous Maui Wowie sort of

2766
01:45:37,139 --> 01:45:40,440
variety it's it's not when you find a

2767
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:42,900
lot of info on but you hear it whispered

2768
01:45:40,439 --> 01:45:45,719
about it by the heads

2769
01:45:42,899 --> 01:45:47,638
yeah Mr Green jeans gave me the line he

2770
01:45:45,719 --> 01:45:50,279
you know he gave me the permission to

2771
01:45:47,639 --> 01:45:51,960
breed and sell it and I don't know why

2772
01:45:50,279 --> 01:45:53,698
what happened to the guy he seemed

2773
01:45:51,960 --> 01:45:55,198
dropped off the Earth man for a number

2774
01:45:53,698 --> 01:45:57,178
of years and people thought he was dead

2775
01:45:55,198 --> 01:45:59,219
or something well he wasn't dead

2776
01:45:57,179 --> 01:46:01,440
we don't know what happened

2777
01:45:59,219 --> 01:46:02,880
but anyway he said here the line's yours

2778
01:46:01,439 --> 01:46:04,859
so I'm like okay

2779
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:07,618
now there's always been intersex in

2780
01:46:04,859 --> 01:46:10,198
Cherry Bomb okay it's a real Maui Wowie

2781
01:46:07,618 --> 01:46:12,359
it's a it's a it's it's a oaxacan by a

2782
01:46:10,198 --> 01:46:14,279
Brotherhood Afghani

2783
01:46:12,359 --> 01:46:16,559
it's Brotherhood wahawkin by Brotherhood

2784
01:46:14,279 --> 01:46:18,800
Afghan that's what it is there's no tie

2785
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:18,800
in it

2786
01:46:18,899 --> 01:46:21,839
um

2787
01:46:20,100 --> 01:46:23,400
what can I tell you about it it's mostly

2788
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:26,100
sativa

2789
01:46:23,399 --> 01:46:29,158
and the reason that they think all these

2790
01:46:26,100 --> 01:46:32,760
Maui's you know most Maui's in fact all

2791
01:46:29,158 --> 01:46:34,738
Maui's have intersex problems

2792
01:46:32,760 --> 01:46:36,480
now they say it's because of the city

2793
01:46:34,738 --> 01:46:39,539
lights when they were breeding it back

2794
01:46:36,479 --> 01:46:40,979
in the 70s now I just don't know you

2795
01:46:39,539 --> 01:46:42,899
know it could be

2796
01:46:40,979 --> 01:46:45,419
but anyway the lion carries in her sex

2797
01:46:42,899 --> 01:46:46,979
and since I got a hold of it I've read

2798
01:46:45,420 --> 01:46:49,440
it for 10 years

2799
01:46:46,979 --> 01:46:51,059
and every time I get in there I try to

2800
01:46:49,439 --> 01:46:53,939
get rid of that [ __ ] man

2801
01:46:51,060 --> 01:46:55,980
you know so now we're sitting pretty

2802
01:46:53,939 --> 01:46:58,259
good we're sitting pretty good with our

2803
01:46:55,979 --> 01:47:01,319
Cherry Bomb it's it's pretty clean I

2804
01:46:58,260 --> 01:47:03,600
like it but it's but it's just Cherry

2805
01:47:01,319 --> 01:47:06,719
it's just cherry pie it's just a it's

2806
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:09,179
just a Maui it's not there's no tie in

2807
01:47:06,719 --> 01:47:12,480
it there's no

2808
01:47:09,179 --> 01:47:14,399
it's it's what I call medium duty herb

2809
01:47:12,479 --> 01:47:16,618
you know stuff you'd give your mom or

2810
01:47:14,399 --> 01:47:17,638
your dad and you know and not not wig

2811
01:47:16,618 --> 01:47:22,519
them out

2812
01:47:17,639 --> 01:47:25,079
novelty stuff here Mom have smelly wowie

2813
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:27,900
that's that's so interesting because I

2814
01:47:25,079 --> 01:47:29,760
think like I I'd be interested to ask

2815
01:47:27,899 --> 01:47:31,500
you earlier you mentioned that you know

2816
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:35,520
the Brotherhood was sort of like a combo

2817
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:37,618
of like bikers and Surfers and so do you

2818
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:39,600
feel like the genetics like the breeding

2819
01:47:37,618 --> 01:47:41,880
itself was mostly done by sort of the

2820
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:43,619
more Surfer side of bowl or it was

2821
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:46,079
literally by a mixture

2822
01:47:43,618 --> 01:47:47,698
yeah it was it was straight up hippies

2823
01:47:46,079 --> 01:47:50,340
and these weren't just hippies man these

2824
01:47:47,698 --> 01:47:52,019
were freaks you know they're

2825
01:47:50,340 --> 01:47:55,440
they had some far out philosophies

2826
01:47:52,020 --> 01:47:58,800
they're chowing on LSD and DMT and they

2827
01:47:55,439 --> 01:48:01,979
were you know but they were the biggest

2828
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:04,619
Distributors of the hash and herb and

2829
01:48:01,979 --> 01:48:07,138
LSD on the coast they had a pretty big

2830
01:48:04,618 --> 01:48:09,719
organization and they were

2831
01:48:07,139 --> 01:48:12,779
they're doing it

2832
01:48:09,719 --> 01:48:14,939
but by 1971 they were all busted up CIA

2833
01:48:12,779 --> 01:48:16,920
got in there and got him

2834
01:48:14,939 --> 01:48:19,198
that's why they all fled

2835
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:22,500
you know and the only reason that this

2836
01:48:19,198 --> 01:48:24,059
stuff keeps popping up oh 76.77 blah

2837
01:48:22,500 --> 01:48:25,679
blah blah it's because they would meet

2838
01:48:24,060 --> 01:48:28,080
up later and say hey let's do it again

2839
01:48:25,679 --> 01:48:30,960
let's take one more run around the track

2840
01:48:28,079 --> 01:48:33,079
that's that's nice I mean we're gonna

2841
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:35,460
loop back but before we do you mentioned

2842
01:48:33,079 --> 01:48:37,800
7677 and it just sprung a thought to

2843
01:48:35,460 --> 01:48:41,219
mind what's your thoughts on the whole

2844
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:44,520
Uncle Fester skunk story

2845
01:48:41,219 --> 01:48:45,899
I don't know man the plant kinda looks

2846
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:47,699
like an rks

2847
01:48:45,899 --> 01:48:49,799
but I don't believe that the lineage

2848
01:48:47,698 --> 01:48:52,618
goes back to 68. I don't [ __ ] believe

2849
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:55,260
it because

2850
01:48:52,618 --> 01:48:58,859
none of it adds up okay the only thing

2851
01:48:55,260 --> 01:49:01,980
that adds up is the leaf morphology and

2852
01:48:58,859 --> 01:49:04,198
the fact that it may be from bikers

2853
01:49:01,979 --> 01:49:06,479
but it doesn't match with the rest of

2854
01:49:04,198 --> 01:49:10,439
the stories and the skunk isn't the

2855
01:49:06,479 --> 01:49:11,698
skunk that that fits the skunk

2856
01:49:10,439 --> 01:49:13,799
you know

2857
01:49:11,698 --> 01:49:16,979
some people say oh yeah man it's it's

2858
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:18,900
good you know but it's it's not and I'm

2859
01:49:16,979 --> 01:49:20,579
not trying to diss it or anything but I

2860
01:49:18,899 --> 01:49:22,198
don't think it's real that's just my

2861
01:49:20,579 --> 01:49:25,198
opinion

2862
01:49:22,198 --> 01:49:27,299
okay yeah sure

2863
01:49:25,198 --> 01:49:30,000
um I do oh I I remember now I wanted to

2864
01:49:27,300 --> 01:49:32,159
add in that uh kudos to you with the

2865
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:33,899
Cherry Bomb because I I did find some

2866
01:49:32,158 --> 01:49:35,759
posts from Mr Green jeans last night

2867
01:49:33,899 --> 01:49:37,618
when I was reading over to it and he

2868
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:39,539
quite emphatically says in all his posts

2869
01:49:37,618 --> 01:49:41,519
that he feels you improve the line from

2870
01:49:39,539 --> 01:49:42,539
when he gave it to you and he sort of

2871
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:44,280
talked he didn't he didn't mention

2872
01:49:42,539 --> 01:49:45,600
stability which is interesting but he

2873
01:49:44,279 --> 01:49:47,039
just sort of generally says it's better

2874
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:49,619
so I guess that's what he was talking

2875
01:49:47,039 --> 01:49:51,479
about well when I got it there was a lot

2876
01:49:49,618 --> 01:49:54,118
of sativa expressions and like I said

2877
01:49:51,479 --> 01:49:56,579
when I when I breed I try to breed man

2878
01:49:54,118 --> 01:49:58,439
I'm not growing in a [ __ ] shoe box in

2879
01:49:56,579 --> 01:50:00,300
an apartment somewhere I'm gonna go and

2880
01:49:58,439 --> 01:50:02,819
we're gonna bust open a bunch of seed

2881
01:50:00,300 --> 01:50:04,920
and we're gonna do a proper selection

2882
01:50:02,819 --> 01:50:07,319
so when I saw that there was all these

2883
01:50:04,920 --> 01:50:10,139
sativa Expressions I was like oh what

2884
01:50:07,319 --> 01:50:12,840
happened to the Indica expressions

2885
01:50:10,139 --> 01:50:14,400
I want to put that back in there

2886
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:17,699
I want to balance that out a little bit

2887
01:50:14,399 --> 01:50:20,399
more you know what I mean so luckily I

2888
01:50:17,698 --> 01:50:22,500
found a nice looking male [ __ ] Cherry

2889
01:50:20,399 --> 01:50:24,420
Bomb man you know that had a nice fat

2890
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:25,738
Indica profile and I said okay here we

2891
01:50:24,420 --> 01:50:27,658
go boom

2892
01:50:25,738 --> 01:50:30,059
so that you know it brought the Indica

2893
01:50:27,658 --> 01:50:33,599
back into the line and now and now we're

2894
01:50:30,060 --> 01:50:36,000
now we're a little more resin you know

2895
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:37,619
hell yeah look while we're on the topic

2896
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:39,840
I'd love to ask you are there any

2897
01:50:37,618 --> 01:50:42,359
specific characteristics that you look

2898
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:45,600
for as a sign of a good male

2899
01:50:42,359 --> 01:50:48,779
uh males are really deceptive you know

2900
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:52,079
because they're all they all look good

2901
01:50:48,779 --> 01:50:54,179
they all have a tendency to look good

2902
01:50:52,079 --> 01:50:56,100
you can't really tell until you really

2903
01:50:54,179 --> 01:50:57,658
put it through the paces until you get

2904
01:50:56,100 --> 01:51:01,139
it up and you beat it up a little bit

2905
01:50:57,658 --> 01:51:03,960
you know what I mean damage it run into

2906
01:51:01,139 --> 01:51:06,300
it smack it around you know damage it is

2907
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:09,239
what I do to see how how well that Vigor

2908
01:51:06,300 --> 01:51:10,800
continues if it's gonna lie to me I'm

2909
01:51:09,238 --> 01:51:12,479
gonna know right away

2910
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:15,719
they're tricky man they're tricky

2911
01:51:12,479 --> 01:51:18,000
they'll do things you would not believe

2912
01:51:15,719 --> 01:51:21,060
you'll be looking down here for all for

2913
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:22,380
six months pulling males

2914
01:51:21,060 --> 01:51:24,420
and then

2915
01:51:22,380 --> 01:51:27,980
six months later look up there's a male

2916
01:51:24,420 --> 01:51:31,260
that somehow snuck around your your site

2917
01:51:27,979 --> 01:51:32,879
and climbed up a [ __ ] tree and put a

2918
01:51:31,260 --> 01:51:35,219
big flower head above everybody and went

2919
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:37,079
boom

2920
01:51:35,219 --> 01:51:40,260
that's pretty neat

2921
01:51:37,079 --> 01:51:42,179
it's it's quite deceptive it's like

2922
01:51:40,260 --> 01:51:45,239
these things have minds of their own I'm

2923
01:51:42,179 --> 01:51:47,579
telling you okay but a good male is

2924
01:51:45,238 --> 01:51:50,099
they're they're usually easy to find

2925
01:51:47,579 --> 01:51:52,920
you know because they like to express

2926
01:51:50,100 --> 01:51:54,900
thems they're like yeah they're usually

2927
01:51:52,920 --> 01:51:58,199
they usually look pretty good so I

2928
01:51:54,899 --> 01:52:02,719
usually have like 10 20 good males I'm

2929
01:51:58,198 --> 01:52:06,658
like oh no you know which one do I use

2930
01:52:02,719 --> 01:52:09,060
so I'll tell you what I I often use two

2931
01:52:06,658 --> 01:52:10,979
males on one female

2932
01:52:09,060 --> 01:52:12,719
yeah I think that can be an interesting

2933
01:52:10,979 --> 01:52:15,419
breeding technique and I think there's a

2934
01:52:12,719 --> 01:52:18,480
lot of reasons for doing that for sure

2935
01:52:15,420 --> 01:52:20,399
um I I guess to ask specifically a lot

2936
01:52:18,479 --> 01:52:22,859
of breeders commonly will say oh you

2937
01:52:20,399 --> 01:52:25,079
know I feel like the most vigorous

2938
01:52:22,859 --> 01:52:27,539
fastest growing males

2939
01:52:25,079 --> 01:52:29,460
um that can be a a more hemp trait than

2940
01:52:27,539 --> 01:52:31,380
a drug trait do you sort of disagree

2941
01:52:29,460 --> 01:52:33,179
with that is there a standard process

2942
01:52:31,380 --> 01:52:35,940
you go through of putting them through

2943
01:52:33,179 --> 01:52:39,779
the gauntlet so to speak yeah it's it's

2944
01:52:35,939 --> 01:52:42,000
that's just rumor man because just you

2945
01:52:39,779 --> 01:52:45,420
know you could have a male that'll just

2946
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:47,100
boom boom boom and just blow big fat

2947
01:52:45,420 --> 01:52:48,359
Leafs all over the place and he'd just

2948
01:52:47,100 --> 01:52:49,980
be a monster

2949
01:52:48,359 --> 01:52:51,839
you know and everything he does and

2950
01:52:49,979 --> 01:52:54,178
every female he touches no matter what

2951
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:56,340
it is is always good

2952
01:52:54,179 --> 01:52:58,980
that's like 805 Hayes you know you take

2953
01:52:56,340 --> 01:53:01,319
any any nl5 Hayes good male and touch

2954
01:52:58,979 --> 01:53:05,579
anything with it and it's [ __ ] bomb

2955
01:53:01,319 --> 01:53:07,139
so it's about 50 50 on that you know yes

2956
01:53:05,579 --> 01:53:08,158
and no

2957
01:53:07,139 --> 01:53:11,639
sure

2958
01:53:08,158 --> 01:53:12,779
and uh just as a sort of one I probably

2959
01:53:11,639 --> 01:53:14,400
should have asked back when we were

2960
01:53:12,779 --> 01:53:16,559
talking about grow mediums but I think

2961
01:53:14,399 --> 01:53:18,899
you'd have a great answer for this do

2962
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:20,880
you use the same general sort of soil

2963
01:53:18,899 --> 01:53:23,879
mix slash approach to Growing when you

2964
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:25,500
say grow like a land race variety versus

2965
01:53:23,880 --> 01:53:27,118
say something more a little more modern

2966
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:29,100
or do you find you have to factor in

2967
01:53:27,118 --> 01:53:31,019
that sensitivity

2968
01:53:29,100 --> 01:53:34,619
it's all the same

2969
01:53:31,020 --> 01:53:37,080
it's I I use the same soil on everything

2970
01:53:34,618 --> 01:53:40,079
the traits that I recognize that that

2971
01:53:37,079 --> 01:53:43,618
are different are like drought tolerance

2972
01:53:40,079 --> 01:53:46,979
you know like okay that one is from

2973
01:53:43,618 --> 01:53:49,618
cyanide that doesn't get water today

2974
01:53:46,979 --> 01:53:51,178
because it's not gonna like it don't

2975
01:53:49,618 --> 01:53:54,359
give it water

2976
01:53:51,179 --> 01:53:56,460
you know those are the the growing the

2977
01:53:54,359 --> 01:53:58,738
things that I see it's just

2978
01:53:56,460 --> 01:54:02,520
environmental conditions

2979
01:53:58,738 --> 01:54:04,738
not more trait driven stuff because they

2980
01:54:02,520 --> 01:54:07,080
all pro they all behave the same as

2981
01:54:04,738 --> 01:54:09,178
cannabis you know

2982
01:54:07,079 --> 01:54:11,158
they flower they they grow the flower

2983
01:54:09,179 --> 01:54:12,840
they die

2984
01:54:11,158 --> 01:54:14,000
yeah sure

2985
01:54:12,840 --> 01:54:16,860
sure so

2986
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:20,639
I uh I I took a look at the website and

2987
01:54:16,859 --> 01:54:22,738
I noticed that the 2022 menu

2988
01:54:20,639 --> 01:54:24,840
um looked like it was a lot more tighter

2989
01:54:22,738 --> 01:54:27,718
sort of more focused a little scaled

2990
01:54:24,840 --> 01:54:29,699
back than say the 2021 menu which was a

2991
01:54:27,719 --> 01:54:31,380
bit more comprehensive was there any

2992
01:54:29,698 --> 01:54:33,299
particular reason you decided you want

2993
01:54:31,380 --> 01:54:34,679
to sort of focus on a smaller number of

2994
01:54:33,300 --> 01:54:35,820
varieties I mean it was still quite a

2995
01:54:34,679 --> 01:54:37,319
few I think it was like 10 or something

2996
01:54:35,819 --> 01:54:39,238
you know not not a small number by any

2997
01:54:37,319 --> 01:54:41,099
means but was there a reason you wanted

2998
01:54:39,238 --> 01:54:43,319
to scale things back and just focus on

2999
01:54:41,100 --> 01:54:45,900
these specific lines a little more no

3000
01:54:43,319 --> 01:54:47,880
just getting tired man you know

3001
01:54:45,899 --> 01:54:49,799
I I figured well

3002
01:54:47,880 --> 01:54:51,600
everybody's you know a couple years ago

3003
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:53,940
I figured Well everybody's doing this I

3004
01:54:51,600 --> 01:54:57,960
better get out there and bust some ass

3005
01:54:53,939 --> 01:55:00,238
I better get out there and just kick ass

3006
01:54:57,960 --> 01:55:02,039
so I did you know two three years in a

3007
01:55:00,238 --> 01:55:04,799
row just kicked ass

3008
01:55:02,039 --> 01:55:06,779
you know woke up micro dosed every day

3009
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:08,699
ate a good breakfast you know drinking

3010
01:55:06,779 --> 01:55:10,819
spring water running around half [ __ ]

3011
01:55:08,698 --> 01:55:13,678
naked and just yeah

3012
01:55:10,819 --> 01:55:15,359
moving pots around soil just throwing

3013
01:55:13,679 --> 01:55:17,279
around like there's no tomorrow you know

3014
01:55:15,359 --> 01:55:19,920
breeding this breeding that I mean

3015
01:55:17,279 --> 01:55:22,679
there's a there's a point where

3016
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:24,840
every day I'm going out in Braden and

3017
01:55:22,679 --> 01:55:27,118
it's becoming a monotonous task where

3018
01:55:24,840 --> 01:55:28,520
you're like okay I gotta go do this and

3019
01:55:27,118 --> 01:55:30,839
you're out there and you're you're

3020
01:55:28,520 --> 01:55:32,639
rubbing stems your chicken Leaf

3021
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:35,219
morphology you're doing all this [ __ ] in

3022
01:55:32,639 --> 01:55:37,579
the Sun and it's just like it's a job

3023
01:55:35,219 --> 01:55:37,579
man

3024
01:55:37,859 --> 01:55:42,719
you know yeah and and after a couple

3025
01:55:40,319 --> 01:55:45,179
years of going on it on that scale like

3026
01:55:42,719 --> 01:55:47,819
I did you know that's epic that's like a

3027
01:55:45,179 --> 01:55:49,920
world [ __ ] record two years in a row

3028
01:55:47,819 --> 01:55:52,259
after two years after two years of that

3029
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:54,300
dude I was like oh my God

3030
01:55:52,260 --> 01:55:57,960
this year you know I have all these

3031
01:55:54,300 --> 01:55:59,420
projects I just need to to calm down

3032
01:55:57,960 --> 01:56:02,279
you know

3033
01:55:59,420 --> 01:56:04,380
so I did I just I just scaled back for

3034
01:56:02,279 --> 01:56:05,880
my own health really

3035
01:56:04,380 --> 01:56:08,039
you know because I'm just running too

3036
01:56:05,880 --> 01:56:10,380
hard man you know

3037
01:56:08,039 --> 01:56:11,939
totally understandable and I I think a

3038
01:56:10,380 --> 01:56:13,199
lot of people may not be aware I I

3039
01:56:11,939 --> 01:56:15,118
certainly wasn't

3040
01:56:13,198 --> 01:56:18,059
um that you you sort of do a lot of your

3041
01:56:15,118 --> 01:56:20,158
work off grid is that correct yeah all

3042
01:56:18,060 --> 01:56:21,780
of my work is off-grid now yeah okay

3043
01:56:20,158 --> 01:56:24,000
that's really interesting just because

3044
01:56:21,779 --> 01:56:24,899
yeah yeah I got out probably five years

3045
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,760
ago

3046
01:56:24,899 --> 01:56:27,539
just just said no I'm not doing this

3047
01:56:26,760 --> 01:56:30,840
anymore

3048
01:56:27,539 --> 01:56:33,479
got out on the land and you know

3049
01:56:30,840 --> 01:56:35,460
now we're doing domes [ __ ]

3050
01:56:33,479 --> 01:56:37,019
how do you find that lifestyle you feel

3051
01:56:35,460 --> 01:56:38,219
like it's really conducive to sort of

3052
01:56:37,020 --> 01:56:40,080
what you're doing and how you want to

3053
01:56:38,219 --> 01:56:42,300
live

3054
01:56:40,079 --> 01:56:44,519
that's the only lifestyle for me yeah

3055
01:56:42,300 --> 01:56:47,460
it's it's the only way for me man

3056
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:49,199
I drink spring water every day you know

3057
01:56:47,460 --> 01:56:51,800
I get my water from the spring you know

3058
01:56:49,198 --> 01:56:55,079
it's not beautiful

3059
01:56:51,800 --> 01:56:57,000
breathe clean air at least 25 2500 feet

3060
01:56:55,079 --> 01:56:59,340
up on top of a mountain you know I mean

3061
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:00,238
I had no neighbors there's nobody around

3062
01:56:59,340 --> 01:57:02,460
me

3063
01:57:00,238 --> 01:57:04,738
I get neighbors you know but you can't

3064
01:57:02,460 --> 01:57:07,319
see them yeah

3065
01:57:04,738 --> 01:57:09,059
just Forest a nice first Forest that I'm

3066
01:57:07,319 --> 01:57:12,960
in you know

3067
01:57:09,060 --> 01:57:14,520
the dream yeah it's pretty nice a lot

3068
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:16,260
you know it's harder to come by nowadays

3069
01:57:14,520 --> 01:57:18,480
that's for sure

3070
01:57:16,260 --> 01:57:20,820
you know it's a lot of people wanting it

3071
01:57:18,479 --> 01:57:22,198
it's a lot of work though man I wake up

3072
01:57:20,819 --> 01:57:23,340
and I bust ass every day and that's

3073
01:57:22,198 --> 01:57:26,819
another thing people don't understand

3074
01:57:23,340 --> 01:57:29,900
man I'm off grid you know I gotta work

3075
01:57:26,819 --> 01:57:32,219
to live I'm not sitting around online

3076
01:57:29,899 --> 01:57:35,219
okay I gotta answer this guy's question

3077
01:57:32,219 --> 01:57:36,840
because he needs to know

3078
01:57:35,219 --> 01:57:39,000
you know

3079
01:57:36,840 --> 01:57:40,739
priorities yeah

3080
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:42,420
that's it yeah you know what you made me

3081
01:57:40,738 --> 01:57:44,059
just feel so lazy because it's like I

3082
01:57:42,420 --> 01:57:46,139
could just sit here all day and like

3083
01:57:44,060 --> 01:57:47,940
water's still gonna be there when I want

3084
01:57:46,139 --> 01:57:49,920

3085
01:57:47,939 --> 01:57:52,678
well yeah you know and I'm pretty fit

3086
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:54,179
too you know because of this

3087
01:57:52,679 --> 01:57:56,460
you know I get out there and throw [ __ ]

3088
01:57:54,179 --> 01:57:59,399
around and [ __ ] you know

3089
01:57:56,460 --> 01:58:01,679
pretty fit so it keeps me fit keeps me

3090
01:57:59,399 --> 01:58:03,598
healthy it keeps me active it's

3091
01:58:01,679 --> 01:58:05,300
everything you know

3092
01:58:03,599 --> 01:58:07,619
it's a lifestyle

3093
01:58:05,300 --> 01:58:10,440
truly truly

3094
01:58:07,618 --> 01:58:13,439
and I know you know the biggest thing is

3095
01:58:10,439 --> 01:58:14,819
I never see a stoplight okay I could

3096
01:58:13,439 --> 01:58:17,839
drive miles and miles and miles and

3097
01:58:14,819 --> 01:58:21,059
never see a stoplight yeah you know

3098
01:58:17,840 --> 01:58:24,420
that's interesting I uh

3099
01:58:21,060 --> 01:58:27,139
I was I was gonna say I I normally ask

3100
01:58:24,420 --> 01:58:30,599
breeders whether they feel it's

3101
01:58:27,139 --> 01:58:33,420
necessary to be active on the Instagram

3102
01:58:30,599 --> 01:58:35,159
scene in order to sort of be a breeder

3103
01:58:33,420 --> 01:58:36,779
in the current market so I'd really like

3104
01:58:35,158 --> 01:58:38,939
to hear your your opinions not just

3105
01:58:36,779 --> 01:58:40,198
because you're obviously not as invested

3106
01:58:38,939 --> 01:58:41,638
as others but more importantly because

3107
01:58:40,198 --> 01:58:44,579
you're off the grid like I'm sure that's

3108
01:58:41,639 --> 01:58:46,800
an additional hurdle it's the internet's

3109
01:58:44,579 --> 01:58:48,118
[ __ ] you know you you don't get good

3110
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:49,860
bandwidth you can't load pictures

3111
01:58:48,118 --> 01:58:51,179
sometimes your messages don't come

3112
01:58:49,859 --> 01:58:54,598
through or sometimes you don't get your

3113
01:58:51,179 --> 01:58:55,800
emails until two days later you know I

3114
01:58:54,599 --> 01:58:57,300
have an antenna booster and everything

3115
01:58:55,800 --> 01:58:58,500
it's just how it is out in the middle of

3116
01:58:57,300 --> 01:59:00,179
nowhere they don't have the signal

3117
01:58:58,500 --> 01:59:01,500
strength you know

3118
01:59:00,179 --> 01:59:03,618
so

3119
01:59:01,500 --> 01:59:05,939
yeah

3120
01:59:03,618 --> 01:59:08,339
that's real

3121
01:59:05,939 --> 01:59:10,618
do you feel like it detrimentally

3122
01:59:08,340 --> 01:59:12,119
affects your ability to interact with

3123
01:59:10,618 --> 01:59:13,618
the market or you think like no I can

3124
01:59:12,118 --> 01:59:16,500
still interact with the market it's just

3125
01:59:13,618 --> 01:59:18,779
you know once a week no because because

3126
01:59:16,500 --> 01:59:21,479
the way these apps are set up they have

3127
01:59:18,779 --> 01:59:22,439
advertising priority of bandwidth

3128
01:59:21,479 --> 01:59:25,559
okay

3129
01:59:22,439 --> 01:59:28,738
Instagram priority man they got ads to

3130
01:59:25,560 --> 01:59:30,659
run you're gonna get through

3131
01:59:28,738 --> 01:59:33,899
now I may not be able to post pictures

3132
01:59:30,658 --> 01:59:35,759
when I want but I can eventually do it I

3133
01:59:33,899 --> 01:59:38,698
just gotta wait for the bandwidth to

3134
01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:43,500
come rolling around again and then we'll

3135
01:59:38,698 --> 01:59:45,839
do it so but like you said do these guys

3136
01:59:43,500 --> 01:59:49,859
have to be on here and at this point in

3137
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:52,860
the game yes and no if you don't make a

3138
01:59:49,859 --> 01:59:55,319
present you're not gonna be seen

3139
01:59:52,859 --> 01:59:57,000
you're gonna get buried in the in in the

3140
01:59:55,319 --> 01:59:58,738
marketing you're gonna get buried people

3141
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:00,840
aren't gonna know you're there you go

3142
01:59:58,738 --> 02:00:04,019
you could be out here for 10 15 20 years

3143
02:00:00,840 --> 02:00:06,300
man and get buried under all this stuff

3144
02:00:04,020 --> 02:00:07,920
nobody even know you're there if you

3145
02:00:06,300 --> 02:00:09,960
don't make a presence

3146
02:00:07,920 --> 02:00:12,420
so yeah you gotta you gotta have a

3147
02:00:09,960 --> 02:00:14,039
presence you know you have to have some

3148
02:00:12,420 --> 02:00:16,920
kind of presence

3149
02:00:14,039 --> 02:00:19,319
yeah certainly I guess the the follow-up

3150
02:00:16,920 --> 02:00:21,899
to that I wanted to ask is do you feel

3151
02:00:19,319 --> 02:00:25,139
any level of how shall I say like

3152
02:00:21,899 --> 02:00:26,879
disillusion with sort of the way the

3153
02:00:25,139 --> 02:00:28,560
market trends are going you know at the

3154
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:31,859
moment we're very much in the thick of

3155
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:33,840
the the mylar bag hype culture is there

3156
02:00:31,859 --> 02:00:35,579
any part of the way that the trajectory

3157
02:00:33,840 --> 02:00:37,199
of the scenes going that sort of has you

3158
02:00:35,579 --> 02:00:39,599
a bit bummed or do you think like no

3159
02:00:37,198 --> 02:00:41,460
it's fine it's just doing its thing

3160
02:00:39,599 --> 02:00:43,139
well you know

3161
02:00:41,460 --> 02:00:45,658
a lot of the times I can predict what's

3162
02:00:43,139 --> 02:00:47,699
going to happen next but lately it's

3163
02:00:45,658 --> 02:00:50,658
been really kind of chaotic with the

3164
02:00:47,698 --> 02:00:54,178
marketing thing it's really

3165
02:00:50,658 --> 02:00:57,359
which way is anything gonna go

3166
02:00:54,179 --> 02:01:00,300
you know it's it's a it's pretty loud

3167
02:00:57,359 --> 02:01:02,819
out there with noise

3168
02:01:00,300 --> 02:01:05,820
with products and people pumping this

3169
02:01:02,819 --> 02:01:07,799
and people pumping that it's like I feel

3170
02:01:05,819 --> 02:01:09,539
sorry for the consumer man

3171
02:01:07,800 --> 02:01:11,880
because they're getting hit with so much

3172
02:01:09,539 --> 02:01:15,960
misinformation they don't know what to

3173
02:01:11,880 --> 02:01:18,300
do I have more people now asking me what

3174
02:01:15,960 --> 02:01:19,859
they want from me and I have to tell

3175
02:01:18,300 --> 02:01:21,840
them what they want from me then what

3176
02:01:19,859 --> 02:01:23,819
they come to me and want

3177
02:01:21,840 --> 02:01:26,279
I gotta tell them all you want you want

3178
02:01:23,819 --> 02:01:30,439
the Mazar guillero oh you want the haze

3179
02:01:26,279 --> 02:01:32,880
oh you want you know it's kind of weird

3180
02:01:30,439 --> 02:01:35,098
yeah you know what that's actually like

3181
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:36,779
a really unique perspective that I I

3182
02:01:35,099 --> 02:01:39,119
think I'm gonna have to pay more thought

3183
02:01:36,779 --> 02:01:41,219
to because yeah I think I think it is

3184
02:01:39,118 --> 02:01:42,719
hard as a newbie

3185
02:01:41,219 --> 02:01:44,340
um or someone who's just entering the

3186
02:01:42,719 --> 02:01:46,800
market to know yeah like what like

3187
02:01:44,340 --> 02:01:49,619
what's true what's false uh where do I

3188
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:51,960
what what's correct they don't know

3189
02:01:49,618 --> 02:01:53,939
they don't know because there's so much

3190
02:01:51,960 --> 02:01:56,880
noise there's so much misinformation

3191
02:01:53,939 --> 02:01:59,219
there's so much marketing they can see

3192
02:01:56,880 --> 02:02:01,020
that people are just trying to sell a

3193
02:01:59,219 --> 02:02:02,460
product and that they don't give a [ __ ]

3194
02:02:01,020 --> 02:02:03,840
about you

3195
02:02:02,460 --> 02:02:06,300
you know

3196
02:02:03,840 --> 02:02:08,219
yeah you know it's it's interesting that

3197
02:02:06,300 --> 02:02:10,320
you you mentioned that because I one of

3198
02:02:08,219 --> 02:02:12,359
the criticisms I had heard of this show

3199
02:02:10,319 --> 02:02:14,340
in fact is that

3200
02:02:12,359 --> 02:02:15,779
um you know people might listen to

3201
02:02:14,340 --> 02:02:17,400
certain things and yeah take it for

3202
02:02:15,779 --> 02:02:19,800
gospel when really it's just one

3203
02:02:17,399 --> 02:02:21,779
person's account of things and it's not

3204
02:02:19,800 --> 02:02:22,980
necessarily true and I I guess that's

3205
02:02:21,779 --> 02:02:25,319
actually sort of one of the reasons why

3206
02:02:22,979 --> 02:02:27,598
I started the show is that I I never

3207
02:02:25,319 --> 02:02:29,519
Proclaim anything as 100 truth I'm just

3208
02:02:27,599 --> 02:02:31,319
trying to share everyone's stories and

3209
02:02:29,520 --> 02:02:33,540
then you can pick and choose what you

3210
02:02:31,319 --> 02:02:35,399
think is sort of the real deal

3211
02:02:33,539 --> 02:02:36,899
um but but it's interesting because yeah

3212
02:02:35,399 --> 02:02:39,118
a lot of people do

3213
02:02:36,899 --> 02:02:41,939
take what they read online is like 100

3214
02:02:39,118 --> 02:02:44,279
the truth and yeah maybe there's other

3215
02:02:41,939 --> 02:02:45,419
aspects of the story which you know like

3216
02:02:44,279 --> 02:02:47,340
like what we were talking about earlier

3217
02:02:45,420 --> 02:02:50,940
when people maybe read a bad review

3218
02:02:47,340 --> 02:02:53,940
online and they don't understand exactly

3219
02:02:50,939 --> 02:02:55,678
yep they have no idea they're missed

3220
02:02:53,939 --> 02:02:58,500
they're all the information that they're

3221
02:02:55,679 --> 02:03:02,219
putting out there is false they have no

3222
02:02:58,500 --> 02:03:04,800
clue nothing and and the the reality is

3223
02:03:02,219 --> 02:03:06,599
it there was a you know if you if you're

3224
02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:08,340
gonna get trolled by somebody that wants

3225
02:03:06,599 --> 02:03:09,719
you not to succeed they're gonna do it

3226
02:03:08,340 --> 02:03:11,400
if they don't have nothing better to do

bit of a joke we need a we need to breed

3253

3257
02:04:17,698 --> 02:04:20,960

3258
02:04:21,179 --> 02:04:26,399
you know climbing up your coattails and

3259
02:04:23,819 --> 02:04:28,319
you know trying to empty your pockets or

3260
02:04:26,399 --> 02:04:31,339
something you know while you're while

3261
02:04:28,319 --> 02:04:34,259
you're giving water to your kid

3262
02:04:31,340 --> 02:04:34,860
I feel you I feel you okay

3263
02:04:34,260 --> 02:04:37,380
um

3264
02:04:34,859 --> 02:04:39,299
I had I had one question that uh it

3265
02:04:37,380 --> 02:04:42,239
might be a little bit of a funny one but

3266
02:04:39,300 --> 02:04:43,679
I I found an old Forum post and I'm not

3267
02:04:42,238 --> 02:04:45,118
sure if it was tongue-in-cheek or what

3268
02:04:43,679 --> 02:04:47,639
but I was hoping you could give us the

3269
02:04:45,118 --> 02:04:49,500
backstory where you had said that uh you

3270
02:04:47,639 --> 02:04:51,420
were selling some seeds the blue Walker

3271
02:04:49,500 --> 02:04:53,460
Hayes crossed the Velvet rush it was

3272
02:04:51,420 --> 02:04:56,039
listed as fifty thousand dollars cash

3273
02:04:53,460 --> 02:04:57,960
only I was like oh that's got to be a

3274
02:04:56,039 --> 02:05:00,479
funny story what's the backstory behind

3275
02:04:57,960 --> 02:05:03,118
that oh it just did that's what my

3276
02:05:00,479 --> 02:05:05,579
competitors do they'll get my [ __ ] cross

3277
02:05:03,118 --> 02:05:07,738
it to what I have what I'm doing and

3278
02:05:05,579 --> 02:05:09,840
then go sneak around on Instagram it's

3279
02:05:07,738 --> 02:05:13,559
just some auction and try to sell it for

3280
02:05:09,840 --> 02:05:15,460
some ridiculous the high price you know

3281
02:05:13,560 --> 02:05:17,400
so I'm like oh

3282
02:05:15,460 --> 02:05:19,800
[Music]

3283
02:05:17,399 --> 02:05:23,039
10 million dollars

3284
02:05:19,800 --> 02:05:26,820
and honestly bro I don't think any cut

3285
02:05:23,039 --> 02:05:29,359
is worth more than 500 nothing

3286
02:05:26,819 --> 02:05:29,359
never

3287
02:05:30,118 --> 02:05:38,698
because I have so met so much genetic

3288
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:40,980
potential in my library

3289
02:05:38,698 --> 02:05:42,899
I can do anything

3290
02:05:40,979 --> 02:05:46,379
yeah you've got you've definitely got

3291
02:05:42,899 --> 02:05:50,299
the base palette to to mix the colors

3292
02:05:46,380 --> 02:05:53,099
and and in effect Terps everything

3293
02:05:50,300 --> 02:05:55,560
it's just you know

3294
02:05:53,099 --> 02:05:57,300
every if you ever what every breeder

3295
02:05:55,560 --> 02:05:58,860
wants they just want to be turned loose

3296
02:05:57,300 --> 02:06:01,800
and

3297
02:05:58,859 --> 02:06:03,719
and to breed you know it's it's always

3298
02:06:01,800 --> 02:06:05,820
the fantasy of every

3299
02:06:03,719 --> 02:06:09,060
serious breeders just let me add them

3300
02:06:05,819 --> 02:06:11,099
let me let me out there put me to work

3301
02:06:09,060 --> 02:06:12,599
you know I want to I want to move

3302
02:06:11,099 --> 02:06:15,119
through a selection I want to select out

3303
02:06:12,599 --> 02:06:16,920
of ten thousand parents man

3304
02:06:15,118 --> 02:06:19,380
yeah nice

3305
02:06:16,920 --> 02:06:21,239
look I'll uh I'll I'll bring it up

3306
02:06:19,380 --> 02:06:23,400
because I think this was actually one of

3307
02:06:21,238 --> 02:06:25,678
the things which I saw recently and it

3308
02:06:23,399 --> 02:06:27,899
stimulated me in a message it was um I

3309
02:06:25,679 --> 02:06:30,239
think you put a post up relating to some

3310
02:06:27,899 --> 02:06:32,698
of the comments uh Todd McCormick had

3311
02:06:30,238 --> 02:06:34,379
made about skunk and uh for the

3312
02:06:32,698 --> 02:06:36,359
listeners of the show they would know we

3313
02:06:34,380 --> 02:06:37,500
had Todd on recently

3314
02:06:36,359 --> 02:06:39,059
um I just want to put it out there I

3315
02:06:37,500 --> 02:06:40,859
like Todd I felt like I learned a lot

3316
02:06:39,060 --> 02:06:42,659
during that chat I would love to know

3317
02:06:40,859 --> 02:06:44,039
you know what was sort of some of the

3318
02:06:42,658 --> 02:06:45,839
issues you took with some of the

3319
02:06:44,039 --> 02:06:47,099
statements he made about the roadkill

3320
02:06:45,840 --> 02:06:50,039
skunk

3321
02:06:47,099 --> 02:06:52,199
oh I don't know I don't I'm not I'm not

3322
02:06:50,039 --> 02:06:53,760
recalling anything on roadkill skunk I

3323
02:06:52,198 --> 02:06:56,939
think most of the Flack I'm getting from

3324
02:06:53,760 --> 02:06:59,099
the Todd Camp is the nl1 stuff every

3325
02:06:56,939 --> 02:07:01,500
time I post at Neville's n01 man I get

3326
02:06:59,099 --> 02:07:03,300
an army of [ __ ] trolls from Todd's

3327
02:07:01,500 --> 02:07:06,719
camp

3328
02:07:03,300 --> 02:07:11,760
and I'm like no okay

3329
02:07:06,719 --> 02:07:14,279
Greg knew that nl1 was sent to Amsterdam

3330
02:07:11,760 --> 02:07:17,159
and Neville put a napkin or a Hindu on

3331
02:07:14,279 --> 02:07:19,738
it and send it back everybody knows that

3332
02:07:17,158 --> 02:07:22,138
for years we knew that Howard marks

3333
02:07:19,738 --> 02:07:23,519
knows that everybody knows it you just

3334
02:07:22,139 --> 02:07:27,118
can't come along and change the

3335
02:07:23,520 --> 02:07:29,880
narrative oh that never happened

3336
02:07:27,118 --> 02:07:32,579
every time I post no one man I get that

3337
02:07:29,880 --> 02:07:35,219
[ __ ] you know

3338
02:07:32,579 --> 02:07:38,039
so I'm just over it so Dwight all these

3339
02:07:35,219 --> 02:07:39,539
people that know the truth just keep

3340
02:07:38,039 --> 02:07:40,920
saying the truth

3341
02:07:39,539 --> 02:07:44,039
over and over

3342
02:07:40,920 --> 02:07:46,980
and Greg even says so himself man

3343
02:07:44,039 --> 02:07:49,639
he says it says it himself listen to the

3344
02:07:46,979 --> 02:07:49,638
interview people

3345
02:07:49,738 --> 02:07:54,899
no I'm not making it I'm not making any

3346
02:07:51,658 --> 02:07:56,638
claims about anything I'm just I'm just

3347
02:07:54,899 --> 02:08:00,319
experiencing

3348
02:07:56,639 --> 02:08:03,420
everything else everybody is you know so

3349
02:08:00,319 --> 02:08:06,000
and just for clarification

3350
02:08:03,420 --> 02:08:09,060
um when you say Greg's interview that is

3351
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:11,520
that the one he did with Matt riot

3352
02:08:09,060 --> 02:08:12,360
oh yeah I'm not sure which which one it

3353
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:15,360
was

3354
02:08:12,359 --> 02:08:17,939
but um yeah he says it he says it

3355
02:08:15,359 --> 02:08:19,738
himself okay yeah sure well for anyone

3356
02:08:17,939 --> 02:08:21,539
who's Keen to to listen I think that

3357
02:08:19,738 --> 02:08:23,698
might have been um the the Breeders

3358
02:08:21,539 --> 02:08:24,539
Syndicate podcast with Greg so check it

3359
02:08:23,698 --> 02:08:26,638
out

3360
02:08:24,539 --> 02:08:28,560
interesting okay so I I guess it sounds

3361
02:08:26,639 --> 02:08:30,359
like it's it's not so much that there's

3362
02:08:28,560 --> 02:08:32,580
any sort of real beef there's just a

3363
02:08:30,359 --> 02:08:34,738
discrepancy and and you feel like

3364
02:08:32,579 --> 02:08:37,198
there's more people from his Camp coming

3365

02:09:28,738 --> 02:09:34,559
and set it back okay

3388
02:09:31,800 --> 02:09:36,000
that's when Greg or whoever and they

3389
02:09:34,560 --> 02:09:39,119
crossed it out to a bunch of [ __ ] and

3390
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:40,679
then sent it back uh yeah okay so it was

3391
02:09:39,118 --> 02:09:43,698
like a back and forth sort of thing for

3392
02:09:40,679 --> 02:09:43,699
a while just like we do

3393
02:09:45,779 --> 02:09:49,738
totally totally totally okay cool cool

3394
02:09:47,819 --> 02:09:52,380
so you know Neville did the work because

3395
02:09:49,738 --> 02:09:54,779
Neville handled the genetics that's why

3396
02:09:52,380 --> 02:09:56,699
Greg was working with it

3397
02:09:54,779 --> 02:09:59,519
yeah sure

3398
02:09:56,698 --> 02:10:01,079
we actually had a fan submitted question

3399
02:09:59,520 --> 02:10:05,219
about

3400
02:10:01,079 --> 02:10:07,019
um one of your nl5bx is so I uh yeah

3401
02:10:05,219 --> 02:10:09,118
enough I pays so it might be a good time

3402
02:10:07,020 --> 02:10:10,560
to bring it up but um our listener

3403
02:10:09,118 --> 02:10:13,139
basically wanted to know if you had any

3404
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:16,320
information on what they or you called

3405
02:10:13,139 --> 02:10:17,520
the pine box release of the nl5 back

3406
02:10:16,319 --> 02:10:19,859
cross

3407
02:10:17,520 --> 02:10:22,679
oh that's just one of the parents that

3408
02:10:19,859 --> 02:10:26,219
had a really nice Pony smell

3409
02:10:22,679 --> 02:10:27,420
you know how the nl5s had that Pine lime

3410
02:10:26,219 --> 02:10:29,639
kind of thing

3411
02:10:27,420 --> 02:10:31,260
it just really really notable on that

3412
02:10:29,639 --> 02:10:34,260
one

3413
02:10:31,260 --> 02:10:35,760
nice okay cool I mean they they also had

3414
02:10:34,260 --> 02:10:38,699
a follow-up question where they were

3415
02:10:35,760 --> 02:10:42,300
wondering how potent is the nl5 cross

3416
02:10:38,698 --> 02:10:46,500
Haze F5 oh I don't know if we've talked

3417
02:10:42,300 --> 02:10:48,779
about the F5 only the F4 and F6 um yeah

3418
02:10:46,500 --> 02:10:49,979
I didn't release a lot of F5s it's kind

3419
02:10:48,779 --> 02:10:50,639
of crazy

3420
02:10:49,979 --> 02:10:52,859
um

3421
02:10:50,639 --> 02:10:55,618
yeah only a few packs of those went out

3422
02:10:52,859 --> 02:10:57,658
of the F5 I don't know why I just didn't

3423
02:10:55,618 --> 02:11:01,679
do a big breeding of it

3424
02:10:57,658 --> 02:11:04,500
but um is it his thing it's an IBL so

3425
02:11:01,679 --> 02:11:07,319
you're gonna see the same traits of the

3426
02:11:04,500 --> 02:11:09,118
nl5 haze line every time you're gonna

3427
02:11:07,319 --> 02:11:10,559
have Indica Expressions that finish

3428
02:11:09,118 --> 02:11:12,359
earlier and you're going to have Haze

3429
02:11:10,560 --> 02:11:15,300
Expressions to finish later

3430
02:11:12,359 --> 02:11:17,698
and we all know that the haze expression

3431
02:11:15,300 --> 02:11:19,260
expressions are the ones that we tend to

3432
02:11:17,698 --> 02:11:21,479
favor

3433
02:11:19,260 --> 02:11:23,219
because the Indica ones are more dull

3434
02:11:21,479 --> 02:11:24,839
boring

3435
02:11:23,219 --> 02:11:28,859
you know

3436
02:11:24,840 --> 02:11:31,020
ugly plants small buds they get mold but

3437
02:11:28,859 --> 02:11:33,179
Daniel 5 Hayes line itself doesn't

3438
02:11:31,020 --> 02:11:36,420
really get mold

3439
02:11:33,179 --> 02:11:38,279
in in any of the nl5 hazes say across

3440
02:11:36,420 --> 02:11:40,079
the different Generations were there any

3441
02:11:38,279 --> 02:11:43,079
of the generations where you felt like

3442
02:11:40,079 --> 02:11:45,599
you were getting the the incense or like

3443
02:11:43,079 --> 02:11:48,238
the church sort of smell from it

3444
02:11:45,599 --> 02:11:51,000
yeah absolutely man all through it all

3445
02:11:48,238 --> 02:11:52,618
through all of the lines you know F1 F2

3446
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,760
all the way through it the back crosses

3447
02:11:52,618 --> 02:11:55,380
everything

3448
02:11:53,760 --> 02:11:58,020
you know I've done I've pretty much

3449
02:11:55,380 --> 02:12:00,480
chopped it up into little pieces and and

3450
02:11:58,020 --> 02:12:02,040
took those expressions and isolated them

3451
02:12:00,479 --> 02:12:03,779
and bred them out

3452
02:12:02,039 --> 02:12:05,880
this purple expression I brought out

3453
02:12:03,779 --> 02:12:07,198
this liquor licorice expression I

3454
02:12:05,880 --> 02:12:08,520
brought out this expression not

3455
02:12:07,198 --> 02:12:09,719
expression

3456
02:12:08,520 --> 02:12:11,760
you know

3457
02:12:09,719 --> 02:12:13,920
so you can individually you can access

3458
02:12:11,760 --> 02:12:15,960
those expressions if that's what your

3459
02:12:13,920 --> 02:12:17,399
favor in those lines

3460
02:12:15,960 --> 02:12:21,359
you know

3461
02:12:17,399 --> 02:12:24,118
yeah sure sure as a as a follow-up how

3462
02:12:21,359 --> 02:12:26,399
does the the blue Orca Haze compared to

3463
02:12:24,118 --> 02:12:28,859
say the nl5 haze just because they are

3464
02:12:26,399 --> 02:12:31,019
sort of similar in some respects

3465
02:12:28,859 --> 02:12:32,039
Lyrica Hayes man it's like the best weed

3466
02:12:31,020 --> 02:12:35,040
on Earth

3467
02:12:32,039 --> 02:12:37,679
it's like it's like ml5 Haze went to

3468
02:12:35,039 --> 02:12:39,300
heaven and

3469
02:12:37,679 --> 02:12:41,840
came back and said hey we're all going

3470
02:12:39,300 --> 02:12:41,840
to heaven now

3471
02:12:42,599 --> 02:12:46,860
um it cleans it up quite a bit it takes

3472
02:12:44,819 --> 02:12:49,559
the teeth chattering out of it it takes

3473
02:12:46,859 --> 02:12:51,960
that the the harsh vibe off of it it

3474
02:12:49,560 --> 02:12:54,840
takes but one thing it does it really

3475
02:12:51,960 --> 02:12:57,618
creates a pretty powerful introspective

3476
02:12:54,840 --> 02:13:00,779
behavior and this is really

3477
02:12:57,618 --> 02:13:02,698
unique man because most people that that

3478
02:13:00,779 --> 02:13:04,500
it get those phenotypes will say the

3479
02:13:02,698 --> 02:13:07,259
same thing and I said the same thing

3480
02:13:04,500 --> 02:13:09,300
forever you know you think Kelly I

3481
02:13:07,260 --> 02:13:11,820
missed was good you think this was good

3482
02:13:09,300 --> 02:13:14,699
you think that was good

3483
02:13:11,819 --> 02:13:15,960
smoke this get on this and you're not

3484
02:13:14,698 --> 02:13:18,658
going to come off it for two years

3485
02:13:15,960 --> 02:13:20,039
because nothing's better

3486
02:13:18,658 --> 02:13:22,379
nothing

3487
02:13:20,039 --> 02:13:24,420
it's like there's nothing better

3488
02:13:22,380 --> 02:13:27,420
no matter what

3489
02:13:24,420 --> 02:13:29,099
you know yeah it's the truth

3490
02:13:27,420 --> 02:13:31,260
there's other types out there that are

3491
02:13:29,099 --> 02:13:32,460
that are that will give it a run for the

3492
02:13:31,260 --> 02:13:33,840
money I'll be like yeah I want to smoke

3493
02:13:32,460 --> 02:13:37,260
that too

3494
02:13:33,840 --> 02:13:39,420
but you know I know what it does and the

3495
02:13:37,260 --> 02:13:41,159
people that the people that grow and

3496
02:13:39,420 --> 02:13:42,960
have those those cuts know what it does

3497
02:13:41,158 --> 02:13:44,759
too and they're out there

3498
02:13:42,960 --> 02:13:46,679
you can access these cuts that people

3499
02:13:44,760 --> 02:13:48,239
have that they've kept

3500
02:13:46,679 --> 02:13:50,399
you know if you do the research on Blue

3501
02:13:48,238 --> 02:13:51,658
ARCA Hayes you will you will find the

3502
02:13:50,399 --> 02:13:55,098
information

3503
02:13:51,658 --> 02:13:57,658
they put this [ __ ] out for over 10 years

3504
02:13:55,099 --> 02:13:59,880
nice I you know that brings us to the

3505
02:13:57,658 --> 02:14:01,920
next question really nicely in that I

3506
02:13:59,880 --> 02:14:03,779
noticed a lot of people sort of talking

3507
02:14:01,920 --> 02:14:06,480
about their experiences of growing at

3508
02:14:03,779 --> 02:14:08,219
the pure blue Orca Haze and I think a

3509
02:14:06,479 --> 02:14:10,319
lot of them sort of got the impression

3510
02:14:08,219 --> 02:14:13,319
that it was going to be like a mostly

3511
02:14:10,319 --> 02:14:14,698
Haze sort of line is that how you would

3512
02:14:13,319 --> 02:14:16,439
describe it like what should people

3513
02:14:14,698 --> 02:14:17,219
expect if they're gonna grow that one

3514
02:14:16,439 --> 02:14:19,500
out

3515
02:14:17,219 --> 02:14:22,020
no I just named it trans we

3516
02:14:19,500 --> 02:14:23,460
traditionally name lineages

3517
02:14:22,020 --> 02:14:25,980
you know

3518
02:14:23,460 --> 02:14:28,319
this and that

3519
02:14:25,979 --> 02:14:31,799
there's a predominantly a large amount

3520
02:14:28,319 --> 02:14:34,019
of haze in that in that breeding yeah so

3521
02:14:31,800 --> 02:14:36,719
we got blue Orga hey every time anybody

3522
02:14:34,020 --> 02:14:40,320
puts nl5 on anything it's always a haze

3523
02:14:36,719 --> 02:14:43,618
you know what I mean this Haze that Haze

3524
02:14:40,319 --> 02:14:45,359
butt run pays whatever you know

3525
02:14:43,618 --> 02:14:47,578
tobacco Haze

3526
02:14:45,359 --> 02:14:49,799
okay so people can sort of expect like a

3527
02:14:47,578 --> 02:14:52,559
mixture of like some sativa some Indica

3528
02:14:49,800 --> 02:14:55,020
sort of stuff yep same thing as in all

3529
02:14:52,560 --> 02:14:57,719
five Haze man really because blue Orca

3530
02:14:55,020 --> 02:14:59,760
is a kandahara and a tie

3531
02:14:57,719 --> 02:15:01,618
so you're putting the same ingredients

3532
02:14:59,760 --> 02:15:03,900
in but

3533
02:15:01,618 --> 02:15:07,439
it kind of really enhances it

3534
02:15:03,899 --> 02:15:10,439
like next level enhancement you know

3535
02:15:07,439 --> 02:15:12,238
yeah nice we've got a few more questions

3536
02:15:10,439 --> 02:15:13,859
from our listeners before we sort of get

3537
02:15:12,238 --> 02:15:15,959
on the tail end of things as we are

3538
02:15:13,859 --> 02:15:18,299
getting there but uh they wanted to know

3539
02:15:15,960 --> 02:15:19,500
what's your experience with the Lamb's

3540
02:15:18,300 --> 02:15:20,639
breath and do you think it's still

3541
02:15:19,500 --> 02:15:24,319
around

3542
02:15:20,639 --> 02:15:24,319
yeah man well

3543
02:15:24,599 --> 02:15:29,460
the lounge bread that I have was given

3544
02:15:26,779 --> 02:15:31,859
Vibes Collective gave it to me they had

3545
02:15:29,460 --> 02:15:33,840
it for whatever time long they said they

3546
02:15:31,859 --> 02:15:35,698
had they got it from Bushman

3547
02:15:33,840 --> 02:15:37,980
the reggae artist

3548
02:15:35,698 --> 02:15:40,198
because it was in their family since mid

3549
02:15:37,979 --> 02:15:42,539
60s or something like that

3550
02:15:40,198 --> 02:15:45,238
anyway Vibes Collective they got a hold

3551
02:15:42,539 --> 02:15:47,219
of it they got it in Spain they lost it

3552
02:15:45,238 --> 02:15:49,439
somehow

3553
02:15:47,219 --> 02:15:50,460
no

3554
02:15:49,439 --> 02:15:52,919
um

3555
02:15:50,460 --> 02:15:54,899
somebody had a pack from them and they

3556
02:15:52,920 --> 02:15:56,940
gave it to me and I grew them out and I

3557
02:15:54,899 --> 02:16:00,299
repopulated them they're like wow cool

3558
02:15:56,939 --> 02:16:02,638
thanks man blah blah blah and so I gave

3559
02:16:00,300 --> 02:16:04,500
him that gave it back to him

3560
02:16:02,639 --> 02:16:06,900
and they said just keep it just it's

3561
02:16:04,500 --> 02:16:10,500
yours man

3562
02:16:06,899 --> 02:16:14,039
so apparently it's a real land spread

3563
02:16:10,500 --> 02:16:15,539
and the 77 Jamaican I had have is is far

3564
02:16:14,039 --> 02:16:18,539
superior

3565
02:16:15,539 --> 02:16:21,719
if you've seen pictures of that

3566
02:16:18,539 --> 02:16:24,118
which was taken out of the field in 77.

3567
02:16:21,719 --> 02:16:26,039
by a friend

3568
02:16:24,118 --> 02:16:27,479
that's interesting and I guess one of

3569
02:16:26,039 --> 02:16:29,519
the reasons I was curious about this was

3570
02:16:27,479 --> 02:16:31,678
because I had seen you a photo it looks

3571
02:16:29,520 --> 02:16:33,239
glorious and uh what I thought was

3572
02:16:31,679 --> 02:16:35,219
interesting was whenever I talked to

3573
02:16:33,239 --> 02:16:38,459
people about Lamb's breath Lamb's bread

3574
02:16:35,218 --> 02:16:40,379
they all say oh you know no the one

3575
02:16:38,459 --> 02:16:42,358
you're looking at it's actually Lamb's

3576
02:16:40,379 --> 02:16:44,699
bread sour d however that goes around

3577
02:16:42,359 --> 02:16:46,079
but people call it lamb spread are you

3578
02:16:44,700 --> 02:16:47,460
confident like yeah that's that's

3579
02:16:46,079 --> 02:16:49,739
probably not the case

3580
02:16:47,459 --> 02:16:51,478
absolutely man I'm pretty confident that

3581
02:16:49,739 --> 02:16:53,579
I have a hundred percent Jamaican

3582
02:16:51,478 --> 02:16:55,799
pre-1980 hybrid man

3583
02:16:53,579 --> 02:16:57,659
so I crossed those two together and I

3584
02:16:55,799 --> 02:17:01,018
called it the hinkster bread and I I

3585
02:16:57,659 --> 02:17:03,959
gave a 20 portion out of every pack to

3586
02:17:01,019 --> 02:17:06,420
the hingster movement of Rastafari

3587
02:17:03,959 --> 02:17:08,159
which is Earl China Smith who was reggae

3588
02:17:06,420 --> 02:17:09,659
he's one of the greatest reggae

3589
02:17:08,159 --> 02:17:11,638
guitarists ever he's Bob Marley's

3590
02:17:09,659 --> 02:17:13,739
guitarist blah blah blah blah yeah wow

3591
02:17:11,638 --> 02:17:16,699
that's that's a beautiful sentiment to

3592
02:17:13,739 --> 02:17:20,099
give back to the community and the and

3593
02:17:16,700 --> 02:17:22,139
the land and it's back on the island and

3594
02:17:20,099 --> 02:17:24,239
they've told me they've wild fired it

3595
02:17:22,138 --> 02:17:25,739
across the island [ __ ] yeah that's

3596
02:17:24,239 --> 02:17:28,679
awesome to hear

3597
02:17:25,739 --> 02:17:30,840
it's funny because yeah

3598
02:17:28,679 --> 02:17:33,120
Dwight told me that hit they they went

3599
02:17:30,840 --> 02:17:35,880
to Jamaica years ago to go check out the

3600
02:17:33,120 --> 02:17:37,740
Maroons back in the 80s or 90s or

3601
02:17:35,879 --> 02:17:39,119
something and they say they didn't have

3602
02:17:37,739 --> 02:17:40,920
nothing then

3603
02:17:39,120 --> 02:17:43,679
and that's that's the story too because

3604
02:17:40,920 --> 02:17:45,659
I asked the rosters man hey go to the

3605
02:17:43,679 --> 02:17:47,398
Maroons go check out what people have

3606
02:17:45,659 --> 02:17:50,579
there's nothing out there

3607
02:17:47,398 --> 02:17:53,819
you know it's gone that's a real shame

3608
02:17:50,579 --> 02:17:55,920
isn't it seeing our seeing Greenhouse go

3609
02:17:53,819 --> 02:17:58,079
there and like some kind of super Safari

3610
02:17:55,920 --> 02:17:59,280
Mission I'm sorry man but there's

3611
02:17:58,079 --> 02:18:02,959
nothing there

3612
02:17:59,280 --> 02:18:02,960
I just put it back on the island

3613
02:18:03,299 --> 02:18:08,218
he's gonna go and find my stuff and pull

3614
02:18:06,058 --> 02:18:10,799
it out of the bushes somewhere look what

3615
02:18:08,218 --> 02:18:12,959
we found it

3616
02:18:10,799 --> 02:18:15,239
it could trade him a bunch of Easter

3617
02:18:12,959 --> 02:18:18,058
eggs for it you know

3618
02:18:15,239 --> 02:18:20,099
well it does make me wonder why because

3619
02:18:18,058 --> 02:18:21,959
like I try to get over to like the

3620
02:18:20,099 --> 02:18:23,519
states sort of once a year maybe go to

3621
02:18:21,959 --> 02:18:26,579
the emerald cup just to keep my finger

3622
02:18:23,519 --> 02:18:28,139
on the pulse and I I always see Ari in

3623
02:18:26,579 --> 02:18:30,959
there and he's always welcome with

3624
02:18:28,138 --> 02:18:33,420
smiles and handshakes and I'm like why

3625
02:18:30,959 --> 02:18:35,398
it's just the name man like I said it's

3626
02:18:33,420 --> 02:18:38,040
marketing if you have a name or anything

3627
02:18:35,398 --> 02:18:40,500
you know what I mean who was it what was

3628
02:18:38,040 --> 02:18:42,660
it uh oh

3629
02:18:40,500 --> 02:18:45,179
what happened to Howard marks man didn't

3630
02:18:42,659 --> 02:18:47,638
he pay like sixty thousand dollars just

3631
02:18:45,179 --> 02:18:51,299
south whoever it was uses likeness until

3632
02:18:47,638 --> 02:18:53,819
he died or some [ __ ] oh Shanty Baba with

3633
02:18:51,299 --> 02:18:56,638
Mr Nice you know it's just

3634
02:18:53,819 --> 02:18:59,579
it's everything's for sale it seems

3635
02:18:56,638 --> 02:19:02,098
sure I put like a very sort of specific

3636
02:18:59,579 --> 02:19:03,420
type of question do you think that for

3637
02:19:02,099 --> 02:19:05,460
example you know we already brought it

3638
02:19:03,420 --> 02:19:08,099
up the greenhouse seed crew do you think

3639
02:19:05,459 --> 02:19:10,619
that there is some onus on them for like

3640
02:19:08,099 --> 02:19:13,579
the way they have arguably [ __ ]

3641
02:19:10,620 --> 02:19:13,579
various land races

3642
02:19:14,040 --> 02:19:16,760
I think it's [ __ ] up

3643
02:19:17,879 --> 02:19:21,959
going into these

3644
02:19:20,040 --> 02:19:23,939
reasons and leaving [ __ ] behind

3645
02:19:21,959 --> 02:19:26,339
that's [ __ ] up dude

3646
02:19:23,939 --> 02:19:28,800
you know that's that's culturally that's

3647
02:19:26,340 --> 02:19:31,500
like colonialism man that's like

3648
02:19:28,799 --> 02:19:32,699
Christopher Columbus [ __ ] man

3649
02:19:31,500 --> 02:19:36,179
totally

3650
02:19:32,700 --> 02:19:38,939
get over it get out get out you know get

3651
02:19:36,179 --> 02:19:41,099
the [ __ ] out of here it's not proper

3652
02:19:38,939 --> 02:19:42,898
it's immoral

3653
02:19:41,099 --> 02:19:44,398
I was yeah I was trying to explain it to

3654
02:19:42,898 --> 02:19:45,659
a friend who's not really involved in

3655
02:19:44,398 --> 02:19:47,039
cannabis so they sort of didn't

3656
02:19:45,659 --> 02:19:49,859
understand it and I was like look it's

3657
02:19:47,040 --> 02:19:51,660
almost like the the trademarking in a

3658
02:19:49,859 --> 02:19:53,700
way like they go there they get the pure

3659
02:19:51,659 --> 02:19:54,959
then they pollute it and then they're

3660
02:19:53,700 --> 02:19:56,399
the only ones with the pure it's like

3661
02:19:54,959 --> 02:19:57,478
they've got a copyright on it or

3662
02:19:56,398 --> 02:19:59,099
something like they're the only ones who

3663
02:19:57,478 --> 02:20:00,959
have got it and then on top of that

3664
02:19:59,100 --> 02:20:02,340
they're not it's not like they're

3665
02:20:00,959 --> 02:20:04,919
releasing the lines like if they

3666
02:20:02,340 --> 02:20:06,120
released pure stuff from Greenhouse you

3667
02:20:04,920 --> 02:20:07,500
could be like oh well you know there's

3668
02:20:06,120 --> 02:20:08,460
some Merit but they're not even doing

3669
02:20:07,500 --> 02:20:10,439
that

3670
02:20:08,459 --> 02:20:12,478
though the truth is man is when they

3671
02:20:10,439 --> 02:20:14,880
left with when they when those guys all

3672
02:20:12,478 --> 02:20:17,159
split off and got you know

3673
02:20:14,879 --> 02:20:19,739
with what they got from Neville

3674
02:20:17,159 --> 02:20:21,719
it wasn't as good as what it was

3675
02:20:19,739 --> 02:20:23,639
and we all know that

3676
02:20:21,719 --> 02:20:26,219
I know it

3677
02:20:23,639 --> 02:20:29,398
because my haze is better my haze is

3678
02:20:26,219 --> 02:20:32,159
better than their their theirs

3679
02:20:29,398 --> 02:20:34,139
yeah yeah interesting stuff I I we could

3680
02:20:32,159 --> 02:20:36,359
probably Riff on it forever

3681
02:20:34,139 --> 02:20:38,340
um one of the the other questions we got

3682
02:20:36,359 --> 02:20:39,840
from one of our listeners was uh are you

3683
02:20:38,340 --> 02:20:41,880
able to give us any information in

3684
02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:45,359
regards to like the Terps or the yields

3685
02:20:41,879 --> 02:20:47,459
on the Congo cut used in the Congo cross

3686
02:20:45,359 --> 02:20:50,220
BP Congo

3687
02:20:47,459 --> 02:20:52,199
that was really an interesting plan

3688
02:20:50,219 --> 02:20:55,679
and I got it from

3689
02:20:52,200 --> 02:20:59,939
through a trade from some guy in Africa

3690
02:20:55,680 --> 02:21:02,120
who was there and collected it himself

3691
02:20:59,939 --> 02:21:02,120
um

3692
02:21:02,459 --> 02:21:06,419
greasy

3693
02:21:05,340 --> 02:21:09,299
super

3694
02:21:06,420 --> 02:21:11,460
um it has a lot of haze features like

3695
02:21:09,299 --> 02:21:14,818
it's the grease and the stem and the

3696
02:21:11,459 --> 02:21:17,339
that that Carillon Indian scent

3697
02:21:14,818 --> 02:21:18,779
that there's there's only one plant on

3698
02:21:17,340 --> 02:21:20,639
the earth that smells like Hayes and

3699
02:21:18,780 --> 02:21:23,460
it's a corellan Indian

3700
02:21:20,639 --> 02:21:25,019
now some Africans have that scent too

3701
02:21:23,459 --> 02:21:26,759
and this was one of them

3702
02:21:25,020 --> 02:21:29,399
you know

3703
02:21:26,760 --> 02:21:31,620
so when you come across that and any

3704
02:21:29,398 --> 02:21:32,398
types out here on Earth you're on to

3705
02:21:31,620 --> 02:21:33,960
something

3706
02:21:32,398 --> 02:21:35,099
you know

3707
02:21:33,959 --> 02:21:37,559
yeah

3708
02:21:35,100 --> 02:21:39,000
that's Nate that's Nate

3709
02:21:37,559 --> 02:21:40,619
um I mean we sort of touched on it

3710
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:42,600
earlier but I'd love to just get a

3711
02:21:40,620 --> 02:21:44,939
definitive answer

3712
02:21:42,600 --> 02:21:47,220
um what what's your thoughts on how

3713
02:21:44,939 --> 02:21:48,780
Greg's Northern Lights compares to your

3714
02:21:47,219 --> 02:21:49,920
one do you think they're more similar

3715
02:21:48,780 --> 02:21:51,960
than different

3716
02:21:49,920 --> 02:21:54,420
okay I'm just gonna say it man I think

3717
02:21:51,959 --> 02:21:58,858
it's fake I think it's it's a marketing

3718
02:21:54,420 --> 02:22:01,500
play I think it's not real okay

3719
02:21:58,859 --> 02:22:03,720
here we go are you ready

3720
02:22:01,500 --> 02:22:06,420
long time ago I had a conversation with

3721
02:22:03,719 --> 02:22:09,239
kit with chem dog okay and he told me

3722
02:22:06,420 --> 02:22:12,420
that it's not a tie it's not a Hawaiian

3723
02:22:09,239 --> 02:22:15,119
it was a Java Indonesian and they called

3724
02:22:12,420 --> 02:22:17,340
it and I've heard of this before too and

3725
02:22:15,120 --> 02:22:19,979
other guys have come at me Yep they're

3726
02:22:17,340 --> 02:22:22,260
saying yep that's what it is it's a job

3727
02:22:19,978 --> 02:22:24,299
it was it's supposed to be extinct now

3728
02:22:22,260 --> 02:22:26,818
it was called they called it the Java

3729
02:22:24,299 --> 02:22:30,000
lime green and they described it as

3730
02:22:26,818 --> 02:22:32,760
clayon sticks and when I saw this stuff

3731
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:35,818
out of that back cross I was like holy

3732
02:22:32,760 --> 02:22:38,520
[ __ ] I had never seen nothing like this

3733
02:22:35,818 --> 02:22:41,340
in my entire [ __ ] life it was like

3734
02:22:38,520 --> 02:22:43,979
Clay on sticks like clay you could

3735
02:22:41,340 --> 02:22:45,960
smoosh it like clay

3736
02:22:43,978 --> 02:22:47,938
you know wow

3737
02:22:45,959 --> 02:22:50,219
so

3738
02:22:47,939 --> 02:22:52,380
with that armed with that information I

3739
02:22:50,219 --> 02:22:54,420
began to dissect it you know what I mean

3740
02:22:52,379 --> 02:22:56,759
once I figured that out that oh it's not

3741
02:22:54,420 --> 02:22:58,200
a tie it doesn't behave like a tie and

3742
02:22:56,760 --> 02:23:01,079
Neville doubted that too because it

3743
02:22:58,200 --> 02:23:04,920
didn't behave like a tie okay

3744
02:23:01,079 --> 02:23:07,020
so now we know that Herbie did nl5 and

3745
02:23:04,920 --> 02:23:10,859
it was a Java lime green whether he

3746
02:23:07,020 --> 02:23:13,859
admits it or not other people have okay

3747
02:23:10,859 --> 02:23:16,680
that's what separates that

3748
02:23:13,859 --> 02:23:17,640
now what was back to the other part of

3749
02:23:16,680 --> 02:23:21,239
your question

3750
02:23:17,639 --> 02:23:23,579
oh Greg's in L5 so what I think they did

3751
02:23:21,239 --> 02:23:25,799
was that whatever the story was about

3752
02:23:23,579 --> 02:23:27,978
the seeds being the sister's freezer or

3753
02:23:25,799 --> 02:23:27,978
whatever

3754
02:23:28,120 --> 02:23:32,040
[Music]

3755
02:23:29,540 --> 02:23:34,620
these are the original blah blah blah I

3756
02:23:32,040 --> 02:23:36,720
think they did have that but they pulled

3757
02:23:34,620 --> 02:23:40,620
it out and they just crossed it to any

3758
02:23:36,719 --> 02:23:44,099
tide to try in the hopes of having nl5

3759
02:23:40,620 --> 02:23:46,439
again didn't work okay I got several

3760
02:23:44,100 --> 02:23:48,780
pictures of these plants I got a hold of

3761
02:23:46,439 --> 02:23:50,398
Greg's five before other people did

3762
02:23:48,780 --> 02:23:52,739
okay

3763
02:23:50,398 --> 02:23:55,318
through some Trading

3764
02:23:52,739 --> 02:23:57,898
and they're pretty hey they're pretty

3765
02:23:55,318 --> 02:23:59,279
it's either no one or it's hey okay

3766
02:23:57,898 --> 02:24:02,939
because that's what they did they used

3767
02:23:59,280 --> 02:24:06,260
No One by a mysterious tie

3768
02:24:02,939 --> 02:24:09,180
you can't fool me okay

3769
02:24:06,260 --> 02:24:10,800
yeah wow interesting stuff that's that's

3770
02:24:09,180 --> 02:24:13,079
really cool to hear that thanks thanks

3771
02:24:10,799 --> 02:24:15,000
for the inside scoop that's my opinion I

3772
02:24:13,079 --> 02:24:17,219
could be wrong

3773
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:20,340
but I'm probably not yeah sure no I get

3774
02:24:17,219 --> 02:24:23,039
that so I mean while we're on the topic

3775
02:24:20,340 --> 02:24:24,420
of nl5 haze we had a viewer submit a

3776
02:24:23,040 --> 02:24:27,359
question

3777
02:24:24,420 --> 02:24:28,620
um I'm hoping it won't ruffle anyone's

3778
02:24:27,359 --> 02:24:30,899
feathers it's not going to ruffle yours

3779
02:24:28,620 --> 02:24:32,939
but um without so he says without

3780
02:24:30,898 --> 02:24:35,879
throwing the guy under the bus I'd like

3781
02:24:32,939 --> 02:24:38,460
to hear his experience on dealing with

3782
02:24:35,879 --> 02:24:41,459
uh Mob seeds I understand that mob

3783
02:24:38,459 --> 02:24:43,619
advertisers as that he has a pure

3784
02:24:41,459 --> 02:24:46,619
Acapulco Gold but it might actually be

3785
02:24:43,620 --> 02:24:47,520
some nl5 hybrid I don't care you ready

3786

3797
02:25:11,280 --> 02:25:17,760
well he got up here

3798
02:25:13,379 --> 02:25:20,398
he showed up with a U-Haul some lights

3799
02:25:17,760 --> 02:25:22,079
and a box full of uh

3800
02:25:20,398 --> 02:25:26,639
weed

3801
02:25:22,079 --> 02:25:29,100
in baby jars that was so old

3802
02:25:26,639 --> 02:25:31,439
it was like you know it looked yellow

3803
02:25:29,100 --> 02:25:33,960
all of it

3804
02:25:31,439 --> 02:25:36,120
and even he'd open up and say I don't

3805
02:25:33,959 --> 02:25:37,978
smoke it but here

3806
02:25:36,120 --> 02:25:39,479
and I'm like what

3807
02:25:37,978 --> 02:25:40,619
what are you doing carrying all this

3808
02:25:39,478 --> 02:25:42,179
[ __ ] around and you don't even smoke

3809
02:25:40,620 --> 02:25:43,560
weed

3810
02:25:42,180 --> 02:25:45,898
it was like it was it was really

3811
02:25:43,559 --> 02:25:47,459
puzzling to us because this guy kind of

3812
02:25:45,898 --> 02:25:50,219
sold himself as somebody and then when

3813
02:25:47,459 --> 02:25:52,318
he shows up he's somebody else okay

3814
02:25:50,219 --> 02:25:54,179
now he's like

3815
02:25:52,318 --> 02:25:55,619
well I don't know I don't know if we

3816
02:25:54,180 --> 02:25:57,120
have enough money to do this as a man

3817
02:25:55,620 --> 02:25:59,040
don't worry about the money I can get

3818
02:25:57,120 --> 02:26:00,540
the money okay

3819
02:25:59,040 --> 02:26:02,399
look we're just gonna do this don't

3820
02:26:00,540 --> 02:26:04,260
worry about it he starts copping out oh

3821
02:26:02,398 --> 02:26:06,358
no no it's and I think a lot of it he

3822
02:26:04,260 --> 02:26:09,000
starts asking questions about Sue

3823
02:26:06,359 --> 02:26:10,680
where's coot live cool you know you

3824
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:13,020
could tell this guy's on a we start

3825
02:26:10,680 --> 02:26:15,059
figuring out he's just on a mission to

3826
02:26:13,020 --> 02:26:17,159
get genetics

3827
02:26:15,059 --> 02:26:18,898
because he didn't want to agree halfway

3828
02:26:17,159 --> 02:26:20,159
through the night he's like oh I don't

3829
02:26:18,898 --> 02:26:22,920
want to do this I don't think we got

3830
02:26:20,159 --> 02:26:25,439
enough money and he starts asking

3831
02:26:22,920 --> 02:26:27,000
information about how hey how can we get

3832
02:26:25,439 --> 02:26:28,859
these cuts

3833
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:31,318

3834
02:26:28,859 --> 02:26:33,059
and I told you I said hey man this guy's

3835
02:26:31,318 --> 02:26:35,818
kind of weird

3836
02:26:33,059 --> 02:26:38,459
anyway that night he takes off in the

3837
02:26:35,818 --> 02:26:40,739

02:28:00,719 --> 02:28:07,139
and then he takes Coots information that

3873
02:28:04,079 --> 02:28:09,059
he said don't don't go and do this I'm

3874
02:28:07,139 --> 02:28:12,599
just sharing this information with you

3875
02:28:09,059 --> 02:28:14,219
he took enzyme tea recipe and went and

3876
02:28:12,600 --> 02:28:16,318
[ __ ] sold it

3877
02:28:14,219 --> 02:28:18,239
just a douchebag dude this guy's a

3878
02:28:16,318 --> 02:28:21,779
douchebag have I ever seen that guy

3879
02:28:18,239 --> 02:28:23,939
again man I'm gonna peel him so hard

3880
02:28:21,780 --> 02:28:26,579
just appealing

3881
02:28:23,939 --> 02:28:28,859
yeah look that that's uh that's crazy

3882
02:28:26,579 --> 02:28:31,379
you know you hear stories about cuttings

3883
02:28:28,859 --> 02:28:34,079
getting stolen and stuff and I mean yeah

3884
02:28:31,379 --> 02:28:36,179
it's really frustrating stuff I bet no

3885
02:28:34,079 --> 02:28:38,100
that didn't over the next 10 years the

3886
02:28:36,180 --> 02:28:39,720
guy's releasing all your [ __ ]

3887
02:28:38,100 --> 02:28:41,220
your [ __ ] saying that he has the one and

3888
02:28:39,719 --> 02:28:42,779
all this other [ __ ]

3889
02:28:41,219 --> 02:28:44,398
you know and anytime anybody anybody

3890
02:28:42,780 --> 02:28:47,939
confronts him it's just

3891
02:28:44,398 --> 02:28:49,920
ignore crickets and that's how a lot of

3892
02:28:47,939 --> 02:28:51,720
these guys behave it's like you confront

3893
02:28:49,920 --> 02:28:53,159
them and there's no accountability

3894
02:28:51,719 --> 02:28:56,039
you know

3895
02:28:53,159 --> 02:28:58,020
yeah I know that uh coot and him had had

3896
02:28:56,040 --> 02:29:00,780
a falling out so I guess that sort of

3897
02:28:58,020 --> 02:29:03,420
lends itself to what you're saying

3898
02:29:00,780 --> 02:29:06,060
yeah that's all these falling outs with

3899
02:29:03,420 --> 02:29:07,920
Coots is is it has a lot to do with coot

3900
02:29:06,059 --> 02:29:10,398
in his medical condition

3901
02:29:07,920 --> 02:29:10,398
okay okay

3902
02:29:10,500 --> 02:29:13,398
um

3903
02:29:11,340 --> 02:29:17,280
I remember one time rolling up there and

3904
02:29:13,398 --> 02:29:19,799
he'd been laying he had back surgery

3905
02:29:17,280 --> 02:29:21,720
okay because he broke his back and he

3906
02:29:19,799 --> 02:29:24,059
could barely walk

3907
02:29:21,719 --> 02:29:26,398
and he's laid there in this [ __ ] back

3908
02:29:24,059 --> 02:29:28,139
rotten out for however long on [ __ ]

3909
02:29:26,398 --> 02:29:30,059
opiates before if any you did anything

3910
02:29:28,139 --> 02:29:31,680
about it I mean sometimes he'd be on the

3911
02:29:30,059 --> 02:29:33,659
ball sometimes a guy would be just like

3912
02:29:31,680 --> 02:29:35,760
half dead

3913
02:29:33,659 --> 02:29:37,799
and like I said the last time I talked

3914
02:29:35,760 --> 02:29:39,600
to him he had a heart attack and didn't

3915
02:29:37,799 --> 02:29:42,779
know who the hell we were

3916
02:29:39,600 --> 02:29:44,939
said we lost his lost his collection or

3917
02:29:42,780 --> 02:29:47,340
whatever we're like what what are you

3918
02:29:44,939 --> 02:29:49,079
talking about you know

3919
02:29:47,340 --> 02:29:51,719
no clue

3920
02:29:49,079 --> 02:29:54,299
I would like to to get to his wife one

3921
02:29:51,719 --> 02:29:56,039
day and tell her hey you know we've

3922
02:29:54,299 --> 02:29:57,779
we don't know what's going on here but

3923
02:29:56,040 --> 02:30:00,319
we don't have really have any hard

3924
02:29:57,780 --> 02:30:03,359
feelings here you know

3925
02:30:00,318 --> 02:30:05,818
yeah yeah look I mean it sounds like a

3926
02:30:03,359 --> 02:30:08,220
medically complicated situation and you

3927
02:30:05,818 --> 02:30:09,539
know obviously we wish Kudo the best but

3928
02:30:08,219 --> 02:30:11,459
um yeah it sounds like it would be hard

3929
02:30:09,540 --> 02:30:13,500
for you with things sort of changing

3930
02:30:11,459 --> 02:30:16,318
depending on his mood if that was how it

3931
02:30:13,500 --> 02:30:18,180
was we we actually had a really good

3932
02:30:16,318 --> 02:30:19,739
question that I'm I'm a bit bummed I

3933
02:30:18,180 --> 02:30:20,700
didn't come up with it myself to be

3934
02:30:19,739 --> 02:30:22,379
honest

3935
02:30:20,700 --> 02:30:24,899
um from one of our listeners and they

3936
02:30:22,379 --> 02:30:29,398
said do you have any secret inputs or

3937
02:30:24,898 --> 02:30:31,139
advice for producing nice healthy seeds

3938
02:30:29,398 --> 02:30:33,059
and grow organic

3939
02:30:31,139 --> 02:30:36,000
use the soil food web

3940
02:30:33,059 --> 02:30:37,920
you know that's that's it

3941
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:39,959
yeah sure and you reckon just you know

3942
02:30:37,920 --> 02:30:42,059
your standard Organics repertoire is

3943
02:30:39,959 --> 02:30:45,379
going to give you some nice seeds well

3944
02:30:42,059 --> 02:30:45,379
here let me give you a soil recipe

3945
02:30:47,398 --> 02:30:54,420
Pete one part perlite one part compost

3946
02:30:51,239 --> 02:30:57,119
and earthworm castings in three equal

3947
02:30:54,420 --> 02:30:59,879
portions this is the Cornell University

3948
02:30:57,120 --> 02:31:01,979
potting mix that's always been around

3949
02:30:59,879 --> 02:31:04,559
that they buried because of

3950
02:31:01,978 --> 02:31:06,898
petrochemical Industry back in the 30s

3951
02:31:04,559 --> 02:31:09,898
this is the secret behind all your

3952
02:31:06,898 --> 02:31:11,939
potting mixes hell yeah I uh I

3953
02:31:09,898 --> 02:31:14,459
definitely use that General combo Okay

3954
02:31:11,939 --> 02:31:16,139
add any food you want add any calcium

3955
02:31:14,459 --> 02:31:19,559
you want add any whatever you want

3956
02:31:16,139 --> 02:31:21,898
that's the base mix that's the mechanism

3957
02:31:19,559 --> 02:31:23,760
that's the battery you're building a

3958
02:31:21,898 --> 02:31:25,379
battery okay

3959
02:31:23,760 --> 02:31:27,059
yeah I like that that's a good analogy

3960
02:31:25,379 --> 02:31:29,159
charging the seed

3961
02:31:27,059 --> 02:31:31,260
well it's it's the soil is like a

3962
02:31:29,159 --> 02:31:33,539
battery it has those those ionic charges

3963
02:31:31,260 --> 02:31:36,000
in it and when we when we when we were

3964
02:31:33,540 --> 02:31:38,760
when the plant gets in there it works

3965
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:42,059
with it through its Exodus

3966
02:31:38,760 --> 02:31:43,978
they're they're ionic It Wants What It

3967
02:31:42,059 --> 02:31:46,439
Wants it's like okay I need calcium boom

3968
02:31:43,978 --> 02:31:48,719
it sends the signal and it happens yeah

3969
02:31:46,439 --> 02:31:50,460
nice it releases it from the it releases

3970
02:31:48,719 --> 02:31:53,519
it from the negative attraction site and

3971
02:31:50,459 --> 02:31:54,739
tail takes it you know molecularly get

3972
02:31:53,520 --> 02:31:57,540
into that

3973
02:31:54,739 --> 02:31:59,520
once you learn about that all this gross

3974
02:31:57,540 --> 02:32:02,340
[ __ ] just Falls away man and you're like

3975
02:31:59,520 --> 02:32:04,200
you're just growing herb yeah

3976
02:32:02,340 --> 02:32:05,939
that's some great food for thought I

3977
02:32:04,200 --> 02:32:07,500
like that I hadn't heard that uh battery

3978
02:32:05,939 --> 02:32:09,059
analogy but it certainly actually makes

3979
02:32:07,500 --> 02:32:10,739
sense so that's really neat another

3980
02:32:09,059 --> 02:32:13,559
question we got from the listeners was

3981
02:32:10,739 --> 02:32:18,119
uh someone's sitting on a pack of your

3982
02:32:13,559 --> 02:32:20,398
uh Cascadian Frost cross UW hash plant

3983
02:32:18,120 --> 02:32:21,600
um any tips on that one what they might

3984
02:32:20,398 --> 02:32:24,920
be able to expect

3985
02:32:21,600 --> 02:32:24,920
oh those are pretty good man

3986
02:32:26,280 --> 02:32:31,560
you know highly Medical

3987
02:32:28,500 --> 02:32:34,200
you know good stoner stoner weed ain't

3988
02:32:31,559 --> 02:32:36,000
nobody gonna complain about that

3989
02:32:34,200 --> 02:32:38,220
I love it I love it well there you go

3990
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:39,780
whoever sent that one in I'm sorry I

3991
02:32:38,219 --> 02:32:41,459
don't have your name on hand right now

3992
02:32:39,780 --> 02:32:45,000
but crack those bad boys they're

3993
02:32:41,459 --> 02:32:48,000
sounding good so nice you know me and me

3994
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:49,500
and a buddy work these and we both did a

3995
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:53,280
good job

3996
02:32:49,500 --> 02:32:55,439
lovely so second last question uh sorry

3997
02:32:53,280 --> 02:32:56,939
last question before we get into our

3998
02:32:55,439 --> 02:32:58,920
quick fire questions which is sort of

3999
02:32:56,939 --> 02:33:00,898
the final five or so but one of our

4000
02:32:58,920 --> 02:33:03,000
listeners wanted to know if you had any

4001
02:33:00,898 --> 02:33:05,539
sort of info about the Thunder [ __ ]

4002
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,540
Hayes

4003
02:33:05,639 --> 02:33:11,398
um what that is it's

4004
02:33:08,219 --> 02:33:13,858
um AK beans brains Matt nuska and

4005
02:33:11,398 --> 02:33:15,959
pharmacies

4006
02:33:13,859 --> 02:33:18,120
um sheberg and Afghani which is from

4007
02:33:15,959 --> 02:33:21,478
Land race uh

4008
02:33:18,120 --> 02:33:23,160
you know I forget the damn name land

4009
02:33:21,478 --> 02:33:25,260
race collections or whatever it was egg

4010
02:33:23,159 --> 02:33:28,920
now oh yeah

4011
02:33:25,260 --> 02:33:30,239
yeah land race exchange yes

4012
02:33:28,920 --> 02:33:32,219
um

4013
02:33:30,239 --> 02:33:34,680
it's crossed together I think AK did it

4014
02:33:32,219 --> 02:33:37,139
send it back to Mike Mike

4015
02:33:34,680 --> 02:33:39,120
send them to me

4016
02:33:37,139 --> 02:33:42,599
um I said yeah I just Bob just put them

4017
02:33:39,120 --> 02:33:45,359
on top of my Alaskan by you know Hayes

4018
02:33:42,600 --> 02:33:46,979
you know get get all those alaskans in

4019
02:33:45,359 --> 02:33:49,620
there together and see what they do

4020
02:33:46,978 --> 02:33:53,719
that's awesome get them all together and

4021
02:33:49,620 --> 02:33:56,700
playing together and uh so with a haze

4022
02:33:53,719 --> 02:33:59,219
and it's just a novelty it wasn't a

4023
02:33:56,700 --> 02:34:01,020
serious breed it was a novelty just to

4024
02:33:59,219 --> 02:34:03,239
put the alaskans together

4025
02:34:01,020 --> 02:34:05,819
you know I didn't really work it much

4026
02:34:03,239 --> 02:34:07,139
it's just a novelty but yeah it's

4027
02:34:05,818 --> 02:34:09,898
probably good

4028
02:34:07,139 --> 02:34:12,000
that's awesome to hear I think novelty

4029
02:34:09,898 --> 02:34:14,039
strains can be cool to be honest but um

4030
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:16,920
that's good so we're on to our sort of

4031
02:34:14,040 --> 02:34:19,200
final rundown of questions so first one

4032
02:34:16,920 --> 02:34:20,879
being out of all the plants you've ever

4033
02:34:19,200 --> 02:34:23,340
grown I know there's probably countless

4034
02:34:20,879 --> 02:34:25,199
is there one specific one that you

4035
02:34:23,340 --> 02:34:26,880
really miss that you think back on at

4036
02:34:25,200 --> 02:34:27,960
night and think man if only I still had

4037
02:34:26,879 --> 02:34:31,318
that one

4038
02:34:27,959 --> 02:34:32,879
at 76 Nigerian man

4039
02:34:31,318 --> 02:34:35,699
yeah

4040
02:34:32,879 --> 02:34:37,978
yeah what a kick in the ass that was you

4041
02:34:35,700 --> 02:34:40,380
know and what a kicking it ass was lose

4042
02:34:37,978 --> 02:34:42,539
it too

4043
02:34:40,379 --> 02:34:44,219
like I always think about that I always

4044
02:34:42,540 --> 02:34:47,640
think about that plant man because it

4045
02:34:44,219 --> 02:34:50,398
was so unique you know it was just

4046
02:34:47,639 --> 02:34:52,760
absolutely unique nothing like it

4047
02:34:50,398 --> 02:34:56,219
beautiful

4048
02:34:52,760 --> 02:34:58,439
and that's a great answer and the next

4049
02:34:56,219 --> 02:35:00,599
question is sort of a bit similar but a

4050
02:34:58,439 --> 02:35:03,659
little bit different at the same time do

4051
02:35:00,600 --> 02:35:05,640
you have one specific memory of cannabis

4052
02:35:03,659 --> 02:35:07,260
that to you is the most memorable it

4053
02:35:05,639 --> 02:35:08,760
might not necessarily be the strongest

4054
02:35:07,260 --> 02:35:10,739
weed or anything but it's just for

4055
02:35:08,760 --> 02:35:13,200
whatever reason it's memorable

4056
02:35:10,739 --> 02:35:15,539
yeah doing five-year mandatory minimum

4057
02:35:13,200 --> 02:35:17,220
for growing weed

4058
02:35:15,540 --> 02:35:19,979
that's a pretty good answer that's

4059
02:35:17,219 --> 02:35:21,539
memorable [ __ ] right there five years in

4060
02:35:19,978 --> 02:35:24,000
[ __ ] prison man

4061
02:35:21,540 --> 02:35:25,920
out of curiosity when you got really and

4062
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:27,659
by the way thank you for your time um

4063
02:35:25,920 --> 02:35:28,920
when you got released what was the first

4064
02:35:27,659 --> 02:35:30,299
thing you smoked you must have been

4065
02:35:28,920 --> 02:35:33,540
thinking about it like man I'm gonna

4066
02:35:30,299 --> 02:35:36,000
puff on this one as soon as I get out

4067
02:35:33,540 --> 02:35:37,200
um actually I was really serious when I

4068
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:39,478
got out because I didn't want to go back

4069
02:35:37,200 --> 02:35:40,920
in so I didn't smoke you know because I

4070
02:35:39,478 --> 02:35:43,679
had to do drug testing I was on I got

4071
02:35:40,920 --> 02:35:45,960
five or five okay buried a bus and

4072
02:35:43,680 --> 02:35:47,520
[ __ ] grew a bunch of weed in it and

4073
02:35:45,959 --> 02:35:49,500
they got cracked you know somebody

4074
02:35:47,520 --> 02:35:52,680
knocked on me because they got popped

4075
02:35:49,500 --> 02:35:54,600
anyway that's how it goes but when I got

4076
02:35:52,680 --> 02:35:56,280
out I was like oh I don't want to smoke

4077
02:35:54,600 --> 02:35:57,120
weed or grow weed I'm gonna be a good

4078
02:35:56,280 --> 02:35:58,920
boy

4079
02:35:57,120 --> 02:36:01,439
because I was getting drug tested right

4080
02:35:58,920 --> 02:36:03,120
yeah but then I moved I got a parole

4081
02:36:01,439 --> 02:36:04,739
officer who was real cool it's like hey

4082
02:36:03,120 --> 02:36:07,680
man I'm not gonna drug test you just

4083
02:36:04,739 --> 02:36:10,318
[ __ ] smoke I'm like okay

4084
02:36:07,680 --> 02:36:11,939
so it was game on you know started

4085
02:36:10,318 --> 02:36:14,159
growing again right away went and got a

4086
02:36:11,939 --> 02:36:16,380
loan from a friend

4087
02:36:14,159 --> 02:36:19,260
you know while on parole

4088
02:36:16,379 --> 02:36:21,478
so I started the seed company and it was

4089
02:36:19,260 --> 02:36:25,620
growing on parole

4090
02:36:21,478 --> 02:36:28,619
wow bless that parole officer

4091
02:36:25,620 --> 02:36:30,479
so five five [ __ ] years of dealing

4092
02:36:28,620 --> 02:36:32,520
with these [ __ ] trolls and being on

4093
02:36:30,478 --> 02:36:34,879
parole man I there's some people I just

4094
02:36:32,520 --> 02:36:38,640
wanted to [ __ ] murder you know

4095
02:36:34,879 --> 02:36:40,500
gosh I can imagine all right well let's

4096
02:36:38,639 --> 02:36:43,260
go to the other end of the spectrum now

4097
02:36:40,500 --> 02:36:45,540
what was something that you were excited

4098
02:36:43,260 --> 02:36:47,219
to try people had talked it up to you

4099
02:36:45,540 --> 02:36:49,380
and then you finally tried it and you

4100
02:36:47,219 --> 02:36:51,799
were like oh is that it

4101
02:36:49,379 --> 02:36:54,299
Cuban black Haze

4102
02:36:51,799 --> 02:36:56,759
are you gonna ruffle some feathers there

4103
02:36:54,299 --> 02:36:58,679
it's just it's not it's not what I

4104
02:36:56,760 --> 02:37:00,960
expected it's just it's just another

4105
02:36:58,680 --> 02:37:03,479
variant of nl5 haze

4106
02:37:00,959 --> 02:37:05,579
because I have a million of them you

4107
02:37:03,478 --> 02:37:07,559
know yeah look I can only imagine you

4108
02:37:05,579 --> 02:37:09,600
you probably do in fact it's neat it's

4109
02:37:07,559 --> 02:37:12,000
cool I mean I appreciated it sure

4110
02:37:09,600 --> 02:37:15,000
certainly I'm not dissing it in any way

4111
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:18,299
I'm just saying that it wasn't what it I

4112
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:21,000
expected it's not it's pretty cool but

4113
02:37:18,299 --> 02:37:22,858
you know like I said I got all Pockets

4114
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:25,040
full of that stuff

4115
02:37:22,859 --> 02:37:27,720
sure sure so

4116
02:37:25,040 --> 02:37:29,340
let's say I'm gonna go drop you off on a

4117
02:37:27,719 --> 02:37:31,379
desert island and you can only take

4118
02:37:29,340 --> 02:37:32,939
three strains with you to grow for the

4119
02:37:31,379 --> 02:37:34,978
rest of time what three are you gonna

4120
02:37:32,939 --> 02:37:37,079
take they can be either clones or packs

4121
02:37:34,978 --> 02:37:40,619
of seeds if you want to do some breeding

4122
02:37:37,079 --> 02:37:42,420
the one nazarbate Guero and then all

4123
02:37:40,620 --> 02:37:43,680
five hairs hell yeah you feel like you

4124
02:37:42,420 --> 02:37:44,700
could probably make most things from

4125
02:37:43,680 --> 02:37:47,939
those

4126
02:37:44,700 --> 02:37:51,000
yeah it's all there that's everything

4127
02:37:47,939 --> 02:37:53,159
you know yeah nice everything you want

4128
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:54,840
okay so on on the other end of the

4129
02:37:53,159 --> 02:37:56,879
spectrum you're gonna drop someone off

4130
02:37:54,840 --> 02:37:58,439
on this desert island and you're not a

4131
02:37:56,879 --> 02:37:59,879
big fan of them you know maybe one of

4132
02:37:58,439 --> 02:38:01,859
these people who's given you grief over

4133
02:37:59,879 --> 02:38:02,879
the years what are you gonna leave them

4134
02:38:01,859 --> 02:38:06,260
with

4135
02:38:02,879 --> 02:38:06,259
animal five Haze

4136
02:38:07,200 --> 02:38:11,340
just the one

4137
02:38:09,180 --> 02:38:13,500
and blue Orca Haze so they get to know

4138
02:38:11,340 --> 02:38:15,540
themselves a little bit better

4139
02:38:13,500 --> 02:38:17,879
oh that's nice I like that you know the

4140
02:38:15,540 --> 02:38:20,280
introspective angle that's good yeah

4141
02:38:17,879 --> 02:38:22,259
it'll help you you know help your

4142
02:38:20,280 --> 02:38:24,960
problem

4143
02:38:22,260 --> 02:38:27,840
so if there was one person and you could

4144
02:38:24,959 --> 02:38:29,938
select alive or dead who you could have

4145
02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:32,219
a in-depth conversation with about

4146
02:38:29,939 --> 02:38:33,840
cannabis who would you want to have a

4147
02:38:32,219 --> 02:38:36,420
sit-down chat with

4148
02:38:33,840 --> 02:38:37,680
probably never man

4149
02:38:36,420 --> 02:38:40,379
you know

4150
02:38:37,680 --> 02:38:42,300
I can't really think of anybody else

4151
02:38:40,379 --> 02:38:45,539
I talked to his best friend every day

4152
02:38:42,299 --> 02:38:47,398
and that's almost the same thing but

4153
02:38:45,540 --> 02:38:49,439
it'd be really interesting to pick his

4154
02:38:47,398 --> 02:38:51,000
mind and and because I kind of have the

4155
02:38:49,439 --> 02:38:53,818
same thought patterns he did back in

4156
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:55,559
1985 as far as hybridization goes he was

4157
02:38:53,818 --> 02:38:57,059
a breeder and he knew what he was doing

4158
02:38:55,559 --> 02:38:59,639
and I know what the [ __ ] I'm doing too

4159
02:38:57,059 --> 02:39:01,500
with it there's a method to this madness

4160
02:38:59,639 --> 02:39:03,779
so we're on the same path we're doing

4161
02:39:01,500 --> 02:39:07,139
the same thing so in a way you could say

4162
02:39:03,780 --> 02:39:09,359
I'm continuing his work and so is Dwight

4163
02:39:07,139 --> 02:39:12,119
we're both continuing his legacy by

4164
02:39:09,359 --> 02:39:14,220
selecting exactly how he did

4165
02:39:12,120 --> 02:39:15,899
and by using his cues and what the

4166
02:39:14,219 --> 02:39:17,340
information that he left behind and the

4167
02:39:15,898 --> 02:39:19,799
information I'm getting from Dwight and

4168
02:39:17,340 --> 02:39:22,439
the information that I have

4169
02:39:19,799 --> 02:39:26,478
you know I I agree with you I think I

4170
02:39:22,439 --> 02:39:26,479
would definitely pick never if whenever

4171
02:39:30,299 --> 02:39:34,858
the emotion involved it's been that way

4172
02:39:32,700 --> 02:39:37,859
since the beginning

4173
02:39:34,859 --> 02:39:39,659
it's it's like a curse you know

4174
02:39:37,859 --> 02:39:41,640
that's a good angle

4175
02:39:39,659 --> 02:39:44,398
I haven't heard that yeah

4176
02:39:41,639 --> 02:39:47,279
so on to our final question for the

4177
02:39:44,398 --> 02:39:49,019
interview if you had a time machine and

4178
02:39:47,280 --> 02:39:51,479
you could go back anywhere in history

4179
02:39:49,020 --> 02:39:53,399
any place to collect either seeds or

4180
02:39:51,478 --> 02:39:54,420
clones where would you go and what would

4181
02:39:53,398 --> 02:39:56,639
you collect

4182
02:39:54,420 --> 02:39:58,500
well I'd probably show up in Laguna

4183
02:39:56,639 --> 02:40:01,079
Beach and see what those guys had in

4184
02:39:58,500 --> 02:40:04,159
their surfboards

4185
02:40:01,079 --> 02:40:06,539
in 1971.

4186
02:40:04,159 --> 02:40:07,739
yeah that's a nice mixture because you

4187
02:40:06,540 --> 02:40:10,140
could like get access to different

4188
02:40:07,739 --> 02:40:13,619
things at the same time well this was

4189
02:40:10,139 --> 02:40:16,379
pre-soviet war stuff too you know

4190
02:40:13,620 --> 02:40:17,220
yum I can only imagine the Afghans they

4191
02:40:16,379 --> 02:40:19,500
had

4192
02:40:17,219 --> 02:40:21,539
oh they're different you know that's why

4193

from I see mag all the way up through

4268
