no we love it we love it and first

79
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:43,339
question of the day what have you been

80
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,340
smoking on recently

81
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:48,959
um well you know what just before I got

82
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:51,000
onto this uh I uh was smoking some mum

83
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,878
mum gooey

84
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,620
I always spoke to mom always start off

85
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:58,079
with Mom doing

86
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:02,099
um no I'll tell you here's a reason why

87
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,739
and and I will get right into this

88
00:04:02,098 --> 00:04:06,298
Dewey's one of those things that's a

89
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:08,039
little bit configured different than

90
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:10,920
most cannabis is

91
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:12,900
and this is just one of the plants that

92
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:15,958
that came out of that run that was just

93
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:18,899
so unusual and different and unique and

94
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:21,060
what I found is is that it has a couple

95
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:24,319
of different qualities it only runs

96
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:28,560
about 18 percent

97
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:31,500
so you know it's not a you know a

98
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,660
Thumper as far as that goes but what it

99
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,519
but people always comment how strong it

100
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,280
is and how much stronger it feels like

101
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:39,599
that and that's because of the

102
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:41,939
arrangement

103
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,500
of all of the different chemicals that

104
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:48,719
are in the GUI that are line up just so

105
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:52,439
and it gives it that perfect mix between

106
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,000
body and mind and you can feel it uh in

107
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:56,639
different different ways and at

108
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,819
different times plus it has that uh

109
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:02,400
um effect of being kind of it

110
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:04,319
exciting in the morning and mellowing in

111
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:06,779
the evening it's got it all as far as

112
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:09,060
that goes and then you can exacerbate

113
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:11,159
all of those by going ahead and

114
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:13,800
adjusting the picking times because it

115
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,680
has a wide window and even let it go as

116
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,960
late as 10 weeks which is really long

117
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,478
for that plant because they normally

118
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:24,659
start harvesting about six and a half so

119
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:26,099
I mean oh yeah it's a very fast plant uh

120
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,960
which is something I like and which is

121
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,340
what I build into all of my stuff I

122
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:31,258
really try and make them quick because

123
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:34,739
turn around it's time to get it going

124
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:36,240
next so anyway yeah gooey is a is always

125
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:39,360
a standard

126
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,340
um but then you know you can we can take

127
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,340
you know some of these things like this

128
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:46,978
and we'll turn it into you know these

129
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:48,839
purple beautiful black things you know

130
00:05:46,978 --> 00:05:50,819
and we'll just you know let all that go

131
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:52,619
just keep on going and getting to work

132
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:54,240
and doing other things but you know that

133
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,319
black stuff I just showed you is the

134
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,879
latest thing that people have been

135
00:05:55,319 --> 00:06:00,899
seeing on Instagram it's the black

136
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:02,819
wrapper and it is amazing smoke it's got

137
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:07,319
it all it's got the taste that you would

138
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:09,659
just die for you can uh feel the nice

139
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:11,279
warmth of a nice balanced high that

140
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,960
comes from it I'm really excited about

141
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:14,698
it and I'm happy to bring it and add it

142
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,918
to the black lines that I'm developing

143
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:19,199
now so the next thing is to take that

144
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:21,779
big ass bud that I just showed you and

145
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,280
convert the size instruction from the

146
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:25,198
other into that and get rid of

147
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:28,019
everything else about that big butt

148
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,120
because basically it's it's a it's a

149
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:31,918
cute little smoke that means nothing so

150
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,100
but the structure is wonderful and so

151
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:37,680
we're going to use that and turn other

152
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:40,439
varieties that have everything

153
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,759
and give it that structure and that way

154
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:44,160
it'll be good for

155
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,439
um one of the I'm just developing for uh

156
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,780
this is kind of like an offshoot I was

157
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:50,759
developing for a company in Colorado

158
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:53,159
that's coming up with automated

159
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:56,639
harvesting equipment and they wanted me

160
00:06:53,160 --> 00:07:01,199
to design plants that were you know

161
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:02,759
applicable to that machinery and this is

162
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,580
one of the designs that we're we're

163
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:07,620
going to give to them but we're going to

164
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:09,839
replace all the genetics in it except

165
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,360
for that structure so because it's easy

166
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:14,399
to trim and it's you know it does it was

167
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,620
a quick Harvest a lot of good things

168
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:19,138
about it just wasn't good smoke you know

169
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,459
so but that's not a big deal we'll deal

170
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:23,160
with that

171
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:24,359
so anyway that's where we're at and

172
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,500
that's where that you know that's where

173
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,439
we're going and that's what I've been

174
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,680
smoking lately is those things and hey I

175
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:33,300
love it and I want you too

176
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:36,418
that's beautiful I've I've been enjoying

177
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:38,639
myself browsing your Instagram quite uh

178
00:07:36,418 --> 00:07:40,740
heavily over the past few days and is

179
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,319
that the uh the Syrian you were posting

180
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:46,680
about yeah that was that is a Syrian

181
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:49,800
that's almost gotten 20 000 likes in

182
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,900
that picture incredible looking plan the

183
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,879
structure is phenomenal it's beautiful

184
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:56,279
and it was like it was a gift given to

185
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:59,759
me uh to try those genetics from over

186
00:07:56,279 --> 00:08:01,918
there and you know uh I kind of tend to

187
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,740
think this is more of a service crop for

188
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:06,359
a multiple things not really so much it

189
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,918
may have been I don't think it was

190
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,500
developed for drug I think it was more

191
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:12,418
for other other they use it for various

192
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:16,800
other things you know I think this was a

193
00:08:12,418 --> 00:08:21,418
c hired CBD lower THC has a nice smell

194
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:24,478
has a a pleasant kind of a

195
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:26,038
oldie you know folksy kind of a taste to

196
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:28,620
it that you remember from way back when

197
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:30,180
when dope wasn't very strong which I

198
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,219
really kind of want to get into a little

199
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:35,759
bit you know people look back and they

200
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:37,440
say oh back in the day all the old ties

201
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,299
and stuff that you used to have that

202
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,560
like this one here which is a very old

203
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:41,240
tie

204
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,799
um

205
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,919
they they were so much better and so

206
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:48,599
much stronger no they were

207
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:50,039
they you know they weren't they they

208
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,899
were just

209
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:53,639
um for the the time they were the

210
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:55,379
strongest there was and you hadn't

211
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:57,899
experienced when you were used to three

212
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:59,458
and four and six percent THC and

213
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:01,740
brickweed then all of a sudden you come

214
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:04,439
up with something from Hawaii that's 10

215
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,839
and 12. it's gonna knock your socks off

216
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,720
well that was kind of how it was with

217
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,940
those you know those plants but

218
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,399
intervention over time breeding with

219
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,380
people doing selective breeding they've

220
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,080
gotten those THC numbers up artificially

221
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:21,480
that didn't happen it does not happen in

222
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:23,040
nature nature kind of goes the opposite

223
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,240
direction

224
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:26,819
um

225
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,180
um man has selected that so we just got

226
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:33,180
to keep that boat cruising right along

227
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:35,939
yeah I wholeheartedly agree and I mean

228
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:38,219
brought up the tie there because I I

229
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:41,220
wanted to ask you I had seen in some of

230
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,540
your New Creations you were using a

231
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,180
parent that I think you were just

232
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:46,860
labeled as Old Tie is that a new one or

233
00:09:45,179 --> 00:09:47,879
uh something you've been using for a

234
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,379
while

235
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:56,159
no it's actually a blend it was a Thai

236
00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:58,860
crossed with a pineapple tie and uh the

237
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:02,338
oh the top the Old Tie was a was

238
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:04,379
basically a pretty old variety that

239
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:06,180
um I had had around in storage for a

240
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:08,338
while and had made some seeds to kind of

241
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:11,219
just keep it going but it hadn't really

242
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:13,220
worked it and now I started growing this

243
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:16,860
out again this is the black tie that

244
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:19,200
came from uh that set and it's a guy

245
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:22,680
it's a traditional look this is the way

246
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,220
that you know they used to grow and uh

247
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:28,799
this is how I remember most ties going

248
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:30,839
this is not the best example but within

249
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:34,199
the genetics there are better ones so

250
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:36,899
I'm gonna just slowly draw those out and

251
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,459
so yeah the pineapple I thought was

252
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:40,679
really nice the only problem with the

253
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:43,199
pineapple pie was is that the pineapple

254
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:45,299
smell and flavor came in really strong

255
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,920
at week three and then by week five it's

256
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:50,879
kind of gone on and drifted on something

257
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:53,519
else and I hate that so I have a fix for

258
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:55,860
that and I'm working on that there you

259
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,379
go I mean recently we had some guests on

260
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,879
who have been uh maybe working with Thai

261
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:01,679
themselves and one of the thing was

262
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:03,539
which sort of came out regularly was

263
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:06,059
people talk about this love for the

264
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:07,799
Colombian influence in the top sorry in

265
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:09,439
the haze my apologies people have been

266
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:12,240
talking about Hayes

267
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,860
the tie and the haze yeah yeah and I

268
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,500
guess what I'm interested in hearing

269
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:20,100
from you is do you see a lot of Thai

270
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:23,899
expression in your Haze lines or oh yeah

271
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:27,060
oh oh yes oh yes

272
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:29,220
as a matter of fact the old Mendo Hayes

273
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:31,259
mother which is like I don't know a

274
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:36,000
dozen years old now

275
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:38,639
um I use her all the time as a as a in a

276
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,159
whole host of ways and it's because of

277
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:43,559
the heavy tie expression she's got it's

278
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:46,019
lanky it doesn't you know it spreads

279
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:48,119
it's got a lot of you know it's got a

280
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:50,519
lot of lowland tie kind of Expressions

281
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,620
to it that from what I've seen uh from

282
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:55,440
what I remember back in the day too uh

283
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,720
same kind of thing only this one plant

284
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,760
out of this set from the old Hayes

285
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:03,360
Brothers stuff that was up from a guy up

286
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:06,000
in Mendocino it is just phenomenal in

287
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,919
its expression and every time I every

288
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,139
time you know people hear me say that

289
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:12,120
they kind of yeah okay fine and every

290
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:14,399
time they actually smell it in person

291
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:21,240
and see it in person it blows their mind

292
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:23,879
because it's so pungently lime vodka

293
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:26,659
um yeah you know and it gets all it gets

294
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:30,899
the resin structure and the

295
00:12:26,659 --> 00:12:33,600
High bright uh Terps from the Thai side

296
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:35,458
that's definitely from that so I see a

297
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,320
lot of it in there and I and that's one

298
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:39,199
of the reasons why I like using it the

299
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:42,120
other thing I like using it is because

300
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,519
this this guy when he did it he trained

301
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:47,100
it so that it was a Mendocino Harvest

302
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:48,778
Time and so he went for a quick Harvest

303
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,959
time because they get rain up there

304
00:12:48,778 --> 00:12:56,100
faster so he selected for that before he

305
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:58,679
passed on God bless him and um we uh we

306
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:02,399
now celebrate his his work with that one

307
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:04,259
plant uh in the Arsenal as something

308
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,419
that it was the only one I found that

309
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:08,639
was like that but it was an exceptional

310
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:10,379
thing that's why I tell people you've

311
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,500
got to search through all those seeds to

312
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:16,259
find out really special one and then

313
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:19,620
hold on to it and use it because what

314
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:23,338
I'd use the old Mendo Haze for a lot is

315
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:27,720
amplification it has the ability to go

316
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:30,660
in and take another strange turf and

317
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,940
bring it forward and louder in that own

318
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:35,719
expression in its own expression so it

319
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:38,519
doesn't overwhelm it it may add a little

320
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,680
Ting at the end you know what I mean but

321
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:43,560
it's not going to be uh something that

322
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:45,239
overwhelms the in all cases not in some

323
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:46,739
cases it will overwhelm it you know and

324
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,720
that's just what you get in breeding

325
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:51,240
especially when I breed I want that

326
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,220
spread because my people are breeders

327
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,778
themselves and they want different

328
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,519
phenotypes to select from they don't

329
00:13:54,778 --> 00:13:57,720
like to get locked into something it's

330
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:01,019
something that's already been worked

331
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,519
that's their job you know so um so I

332
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:05,039
want to give them that spread and this

333
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:08,220
is is just really so great for that and

334
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:10,019
I use it as an amplifier to bring all

335
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:12,720
kinds of different Terps you know if you

336
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:14,820
want a nice gassy smell or something

337
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,680
like that and we well we can make it so

338
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:19,379
that it looks you know when you walk in

339
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:20,759
a room it kind of spilled gas all over

340
00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:22,078
yourself and what have you been doing

341
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:25,500
cycling

342
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:27,778
so yeah no it's uh it's it's definitely

343
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:31,139
a useful product and I believe that the

344
00:14:27,778 --> 00:14:32,458
tie is a it is responsible for that so

345
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:34,919
yes

346
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:37,679
brilliant I'm glad to hear someone who's

347
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:39,120
very fond of time myself I I'm very

348
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:40,739
reassured to hear that and you brought

349
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,379
up an interesting discussion point there

350
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:45,839
about the gas and I feel like in the

351
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:47,939
past few years gas has really come back

352
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,740
into fashion it's the popular thing and

353
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:51,300
so I'm wondering do you ever get people

354
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,698
who are like hey I want some gooey

355
00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:56,099
breeder that smells like pure gas

356
00:14:53,698 --> 00:14:58,559
oh yeah oh I get it all the time and I

357
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:01,139
tell them no because that's not what I'm

358
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:04,319
into I really don't like it I I and I'll

359
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:06,000
tell you why because mostly and this is

360
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,560
a good good thing to get into because I

361
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,320
was going to bring up gases and stuff

362
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:12,719
gases have only been popular since about

363
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,060
the late 80s when they first started

364
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,740
showing up and breeded material when

365
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:19,078
breeding first started to kind of

366
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:21,000
everybody started to realize that wow

367
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:23,099
you know a plant that's three feet tall

368
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,720
can be worth fifty thousand dollars you

369
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,940
know all of a sudden they started to get

370
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:31,079
that you know and and that's why now you

371
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:33,480
see this proliferation of and breeders

372
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:36,179
who frankly probably could you know

373
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:38,339
stand to do a little more education and

374
00:15:36,179 --> 00:15:40,019
and stop and get to know their stock

375
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:42,300
better a little bit first because I

376
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:45,659
always preach know the backgrounds of

377
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:48,120
your material make sure that you uh have

378
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:49,620
that fully in your mindset before you

379
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,480
start Crossing with other things and you

380
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:54,120
need to know both sides so you need to

381
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:56,459
know intimately both sides so that's why

382
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,620
I always tell people microbreeding helps

383
00:15:56,458 --> 00:16:02,518
you to learn those things a lot faster a

384
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:06,299
lot gets through it a lot uh safer and

385
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:07,679
with a more predictable outcome than you

386
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,359
know these these things that have come

387
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:12,059
about because and one of the reasons the

388
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,100
gas is so prevalent is because the gene

389
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:16,138
pool has been narrowed down so much with

390
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:19,079
people using other people's stuff that's

391
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:21,899
already successful now I understand that

392
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:24,179
and when you're talking grow setups and

393
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:26,759
millions of dollars in investment and

394
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:29,759
and and and what you're talking about in

395
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:32,399
this modern age uh going with a trident

396
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:35,819
true that's you know sold and produces

397
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,839
well before is a smart thing to do on

398
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,959
the surface

399
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:41,759
but everybody's doing that and all of a

400
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:44,578
sudden now people are starting to see a

401
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:48,120
glut in pot in the dispensaries they're

402
00:16:44,578 --> 00:16:50,338
starting to see a a backlog I know

403
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:53,399
several professional Growers who still

404
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:54,959
got last year's crop that they've got in

405
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:55,799
storage that they haven't been able to

406
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:58,859
turn

407
00:16:55,799 --> 00:17:00,539
and it's just because they're shit's

408
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:03,419
like everybody else's that's out there

409
00:17:00,539 --> 00:17:05,279
you want to fix that come up with new

410
00:17:03,419 --> 00:17:07,259
[ __ ] you want to come up with new [ __ ]

411
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:10,439
the way to do that is to use new

412
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:12,660
genetics now that's where the sticking

413
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:15,900
point is really difficult for a lot of

414
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:18,419
people a lot of people aren't me I was I

415
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:21,059
was a nerd weed nerd from way back and I

416
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:22,860
saved a lot of stuff and I had people go

417
00:17:21,058 --> 00:17:25,980
out and get a lot of stuff that came

418
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:28,500
from point of origin and did and that

419
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:32,339
really contributed a lot to the ability

420
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:33,359
plus I never integrated the mainstream

421
00:17:32,339 --> 00:17:36,899
stuff

422
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:38,639
into any of my word so when they anybody

423
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,860
gets any of my work

424
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,440
they're getting something that isn't in

425
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:46,019
the gene pool as a whole unless

426
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,759
somebody's used my work before because

427
00:17:46,019 --> 00:17:51,240
these are Composites a lot of different

428
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:53,339
stuff I've created so it that's a really

429
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,019
important thing when uh people are

430
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:58,079
trying to make a name for themselves in

431
00:17:55,019 --> 00:18:00,119
this business and become I'm at the tail

432
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:01,918
end of it right now I'm tired I'm old

433
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:04,199
I'm not going to last that much longer

434
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,759
this [ __ ] will kill me here you know one

435
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,440
of these days soon because you know

436
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:08,940
that's just how it is

437
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,820
um but

438
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:13,620
but the the new people coming up they

439
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:17,159
need to

440
00:18:13,619 --> 00:18:20,579
start seeking out those

441
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:24,120
pocket grows and those pocket areas in

442
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:26,939
the world that are still enclaves of um

443
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:29,279
of good genetics that are perhaps they

444
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:32,400
don't meet up to today's standards but

445
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:34,319
they hold the recessives that when bound

446
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,259
with the stuff that they're growing now

447
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:39,418
and stuff can awaken new stuff that's

448
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:40,259
buried deep and can't come out any other

449
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:42,538
way

450
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:44,700
that's the thing you gotta drive this

451
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:46,919
stuff forward the way that and that's

452
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:49,798
why background knowledge is so important

453
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:52,080
for the strains because a smart breeder

454
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:54,538
can therefore know exactly which

455
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:56,599
directions can know exactly which which

456
00:18:54,538 --> 00:19:00,839
well I should say exactly but

457
00:18:56,599 --> 00:19:02,699
approximately uh to a good degree what's

458
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:04,619
going to become dominant out of these

459
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,840
things and what you know if he's tried

460
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:09,058
to dig out something that's been there

461
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:11,939
from the past that hasn't been seen in a

462
00:19:09,058 --> 00:19:13,859
long time find something else that has

463
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,179
that genetic in it you know that's not

464
00:19:13,859 --> 00:19:17,519
expressed

465
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:18,900
made them and bring it forward and all

466
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:21,179
of a sudden they'll be right there for

467
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:24,900
you to use then make it dominant you

468
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:26,880
know and it's not hard it's just people

469
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:29,820
just need to take the time to do it but

470
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:32,400
it's going to help the new breeder in

471
00:19:29,819 --> 00:19:34,558
this day and age separate themselves and

472
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,860
it's a tall task because

473
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:40,619
you can't live my history for you know I

474
00:19:37,859 --> 00:19:43,079
I there's nobody that can start right

475
00:19:40,619 --> 00:19:45,959
now and have what I have and that's

476
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:47,819
scary and it's unfortunate but it's just

477
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,980
cold hard fact it's just another

478
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:52,500
scientific fact

479
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:54,960
and so that's why I like to get my stuff

480
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:57,058
out there to breeders to get it out into

481
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,340
the into there to start improving that

482
00:19:57,058 --> 00:20:01,139
gene pool or to change it at least to

483
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:03,298
something that's different that's that

484
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:06,960
they can market now

485
00:20:03,298 --> 00:20:08,940
having said that I want to get into the

486
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,679
um dispensary thing and what

487
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,058
dispensaries are taking and what and

488
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:13,919
they're what they're being driven by

489
00:20:12,058 --> 00:20:16,798
because that's one of the things that is

490
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,538
causing this bottleneck of genetics that

491
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,798
people are using because dispensaries

492
00:20:18,538 --> 00:20:22,859
don't want to take everything that

493
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:24,480
everybody grows if it's Airy if it's

494
00:20:22,859 --> 00:20:27,418
they don't want it

495
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,579
but I gotta I gotta tell you I have a

496
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:32,400
soft spot for Airy pot and I'll tell you

497
00:20:29,579 --> 00:20:34,439
why and I think it's more important that

498
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,080
the customer have the availability to be

499
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:39,120
able to get it than not and it the

500
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:42,899
reason is

501
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:43,500
when you smoke a bowl and you're smoking

502
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:47,340
um

503
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:48,900
let's say oh and you just you insert the

504
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:50,279
dispensary weed in there and put it in

505
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,740
there it's a nice hard nug and you put

506
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:55,200
it into a bowl you fire it off and you

507
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:57,720
have a few hits great hits those are

508
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,058
wonderful hits put the bowl down walk

509
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,200
away doing something else come back a

510
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:03,119
little while later think you'll finish

511
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,240
the bowl and you start smoking that

512
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:09,719
again and where is that same Buzz it's

513
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:12,660
not there it's not there why is it there

514
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:14,220
because you vaporized all the stuff that

515
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:16,500
was in there and those first few hits

516
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:19,500
and so you've got a really good strong

517
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:22,500
hit and now it's just converted and and

518
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:24,359
and and and past tense and you are not

519
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:28,980
getting what you had in those first few

520
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:31,619
bowls plus tastes like [ __ ] okay so who

521
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:32,579
wants that I have always advocated and

522
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:36,599
it's

523
00:21:32,579 --> 00:21:40,678
true proven fact that your THC levels

524
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:42,418
are more steady in looser pot plus you

525
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:44,759
get the chance to be able to load up

526
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:47,340
maybe two bowls instead of one but the

527
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:50,519
flavors there all the time and you enjoy

528
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:52,439
it better what's wrong with that and it

529
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:53,940
looks nice when you're getting instead

530
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,460
of getting a little nug like this it

531
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:58,440
costs you 50 bucks or whatever it is you

532
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:00,298
get an actual baggie that has you know

533
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,220
some substance to it and you feel like

534
00:22:00,298 --> 00:22:04,980
you've gotten something and it's more

535
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:07,558
enjoyable when have you ever gone into

536
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:10,679
the dispensary and seen these nugs and

537
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:13,379
seen the full crystals that you see on

538
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:17,038
let's say my plants that you that are on

539
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:19,799
Instagram those crystals I guarantee of

540
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:21,960
those crystals are still there on this

541
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:26,400
bud when it hits you know wherever it

542
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:28,798
hits and it's not there when those super

543
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,360
dense hard buds that they take and

544
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:32,400
they've processed and they've rolled

545
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:34,859
first to take off the you know so that

546
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:38,880
you you're missing all that that's

547
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:40,619
[ __ ] and it should be the the

548
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,480
customer's choice to be able to have

549
00:22:40,619 --> 00:22:44,939
that

550
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,460
dense weed or not and the only way to

551
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:49,200
change that is to make looser weed more

552
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,579
marketable and more palatable to the

553
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,100
public and make them understand that

554
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:55,859
this is to your benefit you're going to

555
00:22:53,099 --> 00:22:57,899
remember things that you haven't had you

556
00:22:55,859 --> 00:23:00,959
know since your first time smoking if

557
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:02,400
you're old and if you're not you're

558
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,558
going to experience things for the first

559
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,120
time that are you're going wow that's

560
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:08,579
really something you know that's really

561
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:10,199
good and you've you've tried some of my

562
00:23:08,579 --> 00:23:12,240
stuff you know what I'm talking about as

563
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,460
far as flavor goes well you know they

564
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,038
aren't real super dense but they're

565
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:20,340
they're they're driven towards that end

566
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:22,319
it's your enjoyment I'm working on and

567
00:23:20,339 --> 00:23:23,699
so that's where we want to be and that's

568
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:25,918
where I want every breeder to

569
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:28,140
concentrate and that's why this is so

570
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,659
important to do all of it is so

571
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:32,640
important to do so we need to change the

572
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:35,460
public perception we need to be able to

573
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,780
open up those avenues for more rows and

574
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,940
be able to make sure that they can still

575
00:23:36,779 --> 00:23:41,639
afford to make you know their payments

576
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:44,880
so you know just got to make good plans

577
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:48,659
to produce well and it's it's important

578
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:52,320
it's important we drive the industry the

579
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:54,900
industry needs to understand that that

580
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:57,899
everything that's done in a conscious

581
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:59,759
Breeder's effort is for the customer's

582
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:04,080
own good and then once they get that

583
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:06,179
we're on a compatible Road together and

584
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:07,918
moving this plant forward to the next

585
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:09,900
phase and I don't even know that next

586
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:12,179
phase is going to be

587
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:14,038
you know I I've taken it as far as I'm

588
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:16,919
going to go I'll tell you right now

589
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:18,779
I'm tired

590
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:21,299
look I wholeheartedly agree with

591
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:22,859
everything you've said and uh I wish we

592
00:24:21,298 --> 00:24:24,779
could snap our fingers and make it

593
00:24:22,859 --> 00:24:26,519
happen with that in mind I've been

594
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:28,798
thinking you know how can we get this

595
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:31,379
message out to the masses and the common

596
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:33,359
sort of feedback I hear from people who

597
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:36,240
work or own dispensaries is that

598
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:38,339
everything's so driven by numbers and

599
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,380
names and I'm sure you're you know very

600
00:24:38,339 --> 00:24:44,038
aware of this oh yeah so my question

601
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:46,440
becomes do we try to market the benefits

602
00:24:44,038 --> 00:24:48,720
of what you've been discussing to the

603
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:51,298
individual consumer who's maybe not so

604
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:54,000
plugged in or are the store owners and

605
00:24:51,298 --> 00:24:55,139
employees The Gatekeepers

606
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,880
well

607
00:24:55,140 --> 00:25:00,179
again you're talking apples and oranges

608
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,620
because the um The Gatekeepers so to

609
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:03,960
speak you know have it they have a job

610
00:25:01,619 --> 00:25:05,519
to do they have taxes to pay they have

611
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,620
overhead to deal with they've got

612
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:09,900
everything that they've got to deal with

613
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:11,339
as normal business and then some in the

614
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,798
Cannabis business the Cannabis business

615
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:15,779
is very the onus on the the owners of

616
00:25:13,798 --> 00:25:19,019
those places is just incredible and it's

617
00:25:15,779 --> 00:25:23,579
really an overburdened institution to

618
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:28,679
begin with but you know having said that

619
00:25:23,579 --> 00:25:32,639
um to deny the customer the choice

620
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:35,400
is to me the greater sin and so I think

621
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,679
that maybe this little talk will have

622
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:40,019
somebody just one person

623
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:42,659
and just experiment and try what I'm

624
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:45,000
saying maybe find a benefit and then

625
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:46,799
that gets tell two friends and they tell

626
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,778
two friends and then you've gotta you

627
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:51,298
know you've lit a fuse and and that's

628
00:25:48,778 --> 00:25:55,019
what you want to try and do again it's

629
00:25:51,298 --> 00:25:57,359
for their benefit I have nothing to gain

630
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:59,220
from advocating

631
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:02,240
something that isn't going to be a

632
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:05,339
commercially viable product other than

633
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,140
knowing that somebody was ended up

634
00:26:05,339 --> 00:26:08,399
enjoying it more than they would have a

635
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:10,799
commercial product

636
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,900
you know so that's how I look at this

637
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:16,079
kind of stuff I I don't look at it from

638
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:19,080
and and that's my flaw I understand that

639
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:21,418
my flaw is is that you know I'm looking

640
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:24,839
out for the customer over my

641
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:28,440
self-interest it comes back to you I

642
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:30,658
believe it comes back to you but

643
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,820
having said that you got to put food on

644
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:35,539
the table so it's a it's a really hard

645
00:26:32,819 --> 00:26:39,899
thing to balance but I think

646
00:26:35,538 --> 00:26:42,298
again a gram of pot is a gram of pot uh

647
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:45,080
in a dispensary in fact Graham you know

648
00:26:42,298 --> 00:26:47,940
is this big or is it this big

649
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:49,980
who cares I mean I know these people

650
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:52,620
have storage I know they could store you

651
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:54,659
know this kind of stuff and packaging

652
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:56,519
comes into play too I mean getting

653
00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:58,200
creative with the packaging I want to

654
00:26:56,519 --> 00:27:01,019
see Earth friendly packaging as much as

655
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:03,179
possible you know but again it all comes

656
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:05,038
into keeping that bud secure until that

657
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:07,740
person tears it apart for themselves and

658
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:10,679
I just I I just really think that the

659
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:12,900
customer has a benefit from being able

660
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:15,120
to have that choice I think they should

661
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:17,220
have that choice there are a lot of

662
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:19,859
young kids these days who won't smoke

663
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:21,240
loose Bud they just they look at it and

664
00:27:19,859 --> 00:27:24,538
they laugh you know

665
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:26,339
uh and roll it up for him and pass it to

666
00:27:24,538 --> 00:27:27,960
him and it's like oh damn what is this

667
00:27:26,339 --> 00:27:31,079
you know

668
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:34,259
oh it's that thing you just went over oh

669
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:36,058
oh well let's talk about this you know

670
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:38,220
and then you get them into conversation

671
00:27:36,058 --> 00:27:40,918
before you know it they're advocating

672
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:42,720
you know along your lines and they're

673
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:43,740
passing over and you know all of a

674
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,240
sudden they're telling you that they're

675
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:48,240
going to that bag that you gave them

676
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:50,038
over store-bought stuff until that bag's

677
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,839
gone before the store-bought stuff that

678
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:54,000
they spent money on is

679
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:57,240
that then you know you've done your job

680
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,759
that's it the empty the empty jar tells

681
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,980
no lies

682
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:03,720
so one of the one of the questions which

683
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:06,120
I often hear discussed in this sort of

684
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,740
General conversation is that like it

685
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:10,739
would be great to get these you know

686
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:13,079
really uh unique weed varieties to

687
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:14,880
people but because of the numbers it

688
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:16,259
makes it challenging and so I guess what

689
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,020
I'm wondering is do you think it's

690
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:21,058
possible to retain the unique elements

691
00:28:19,019 --> 00:28:22,980
of some of these more old world plants

692
00:28:21,058 --> 00:28:25,259
but maybe bump the numbers a little bit

693
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:27,000
not necessarily to like 30 or anything

694
00:28:25,259 --> 00:28:29,038
but just enough to get people more

695
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,019
interested while retaining those special

696
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:33,778
characteristics

697
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:36,538
well again uh you know it's really all

698
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:40,500
about the uniqueness of if somebody

699
00:28:36,538 --> 00:28:43,200
hasn't ever felt this arrangement of THC

700
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:45,900
molecules and the way that they are the

701
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,600
the cannonoids are just all arranged to

702
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:51,480
where they you know are different than

703
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:53,699
they've ever felt before though it gets

704
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:56,298
their attention mom always gets people's

705
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:59,360
attention she's 38 years old this year

706
00:28:56,298 --> 00:29:03,000
she always gets people's attention

707
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:05,038
because it feels different it doesn't

708
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,019
have to be stronger it has to be

709
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:09,179
arranged different and the only way to

710
00:29:07,019 --> 00:29:11,158
arrange things different is to have

711
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:13,100
different things to arrange in this kind

712
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:16,080
of a market setting at this point

713
00:29:13,099 --> 00:29:18,480
yeah a great answer a great answer there

714
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:20,759
you you mentioned earlier that you know

715
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,980
you were smoking on some gooey this

716
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:25,019
morning I wanted to quickly ask you do

717
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:27,058
you prefer the flower or the

718
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:30,599
concentrates you get from her

719
00:29:27,058 --> 00:29:32,460
you know what I I am not a and I get

720
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:34,079
[ __ ] for this all the time I don't smoke

721
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:36,720
a lot of concentrates for a couple of

722
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:39,599
different reasons one I'm 63 or years

723
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:42,538
old my lungs are like little raisins you

724
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:44,278
know right now so I I I I I I I can't

725
00:29:42,538 --> 00:29:46,500
smoke a lot of stuff like that that's

726
00:29:44,278 --> 00:29:47,759
going to kill it and make it even a like

727
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:50,099
a little

728
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:52,019
I don't know what they're crazing you

729
00:29:50,099 --> 00:29:54,619
know it's gonna be awful

730
00:29:52,019 --> 00:29:59,119
um but having said that

731
00:29:54,619 --> 00:30:01,259
my I I I can't get used to smoking

732
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:04,199
concentrates because then I can't

733
00:30:01,259 --> 00:30:07,558
evaluate what I'm doing and everything I

734
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:12,000
do I smoke everything I do every plant

735
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:15,538
you see I smoke and it's because I need

736
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,460
to know what it's doing I've saved it in

737
00:30:15,538 --> 00:30:19,619
case I will whoa you know that's good

738
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:23,819
you know I I need to you know explore

739
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:25,859
this more and and if it does that to me

740
00:30:23,819 --> 00:30:28,379
then I know it's something that is going

741
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:30,298
to be something you enjoy if it does it

742
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:31,919
to me with the amount I smoke you know

743
00:30:30,298 --> 00:30:34,079
the amount and what I do

744
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,240
if it does it to me I know it's

745
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:38,339
something that you folks want and so

746
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,079
that's why I don't go to concentrates

747
00:30:38,339 --> 00:30:41,459
and that's why I I'll smoke them

748
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:43,199
occasionally when they're given to me

749
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:45,179
you know as a gratuity or something I

750
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,399
just did the a couple of days ago to the

751
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:51,360
the Cannabis Cup winner from

752
00:30:47,398 --> 00:30:53,699
um 2017 he uh invited me over and then

753
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:56,459
and he just wants to get me into smoking

754
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:59,340
you know all the extracts and I'm like

755
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:01,740
okay yeah and then I'm done you know

756
00:30:59,339 --> 00:31:03,778
okay fine I don't know but I I it's

757
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:06,899
because it has a purpose I have a real

758
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:08,759
reason and if I didn't if I did the

759
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:11,038
other way because he tells me he doesn't

760
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:13,558
he doesn't smoke flowers anymore he's a

761
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:15,720
grower he's a professional and he

762
00:31:13,558 --> 00:31:18,359
doesn't smoke flowers anymore and to me

763
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,919
that's a flaw because you know the

764
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:22,619
concentrates are going to be good if the

765
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,179
flower is good so why do you need to in

766
00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:26,038
it you know if you need to smoke that

767
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:28,500
then stop smoking for a while and get

768
00:31:26,038 --> 00:31:30,359
back to square one and then start you

769
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:32,940
know getting into more different stuff

770
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:35,339
but you know you're not doing as much

771
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:37,558
damage to your lungs as far as the the

772
00:31:35,339 --> 00:31:39,898
tars and waxes that are in those

773
00:31:37,558 --> 00:31:43,558
concentrates you know they're they they

774
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:46,439
you know believe me I've been doing this

775
00:31:43,558 --> 00:31:48,359
a long time and I've smoked a lot of

776
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:51,899
different stuff and it doesn't do your

777
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:54,298
your body a lot of good so you've got I

778
00:31:51,898 --> 00:31:58,079
mean it does it's good for your body in

779
00:31:54,298 --> 00:32:00,538
certain ways not this way but it's for a

780
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:02,759
purpose it's for you

781
00:32:00,538 --> 00:32:05,579
yeah now look I wholeheartedly agree and

782
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:07,440
I made the switch to vaporizing only uh

783
00:32:05,579 --> 00:32:09,480
over a year ago now and I've never

784
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,519
looked back I appreciate flowers in in

785
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,720
such a more unique way and one of the

786
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,819
reasons why I brought up that question

787
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,640
about the concentrates with the mom is

788
00:32:14,819 --> 00:32:19,259
because I uh I I enjoyed that post on

789
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,880
your Instagram about that the machine

790
00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:24,000
you were looking for the hash oil

791
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:27,600
machine have you managed to find it oh

792
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,359
yes God bless people I tell you God

793
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:31,678
bless people I I I I I don't want to you

794
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:33,538
know name names and stuff on here

795
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:37,200
because they don't need that but there

796
00:32:33,538 --> 00:32:42,839
are people that just jump through hoops

797
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:45,000
and to get me machines and uh I'm uh I'm

798
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:48,119
just so grateful because it's such a

799
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,640
unique little uh goofy thing in today's

800
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:53,278
world they're really impractical and not

801
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:55,740
really a a thing I'm still gonna use it

802
00:32:53,278 --> 00:32:58,619
because it's what I grew up with and

803
00:32:55,740 --> 00:33:01,740
like I was telling a gentleman yesterday

804
00:32:58,619 --> 00:33:04,439
about when he asked me about it and I

805
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:06,298
said you know I had one of those back

806
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:09,298
when they first came out in high times

807
00:33:06,298 --> 00:33:10,500
and I think there were like 179 it was

808
00:33:09,298 --> 00:33:13,319
expensive you know it was really

809
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:15,960
expensive and so I ordered one and it

810
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:18,058
came uh all brown wrapped paper wrapped

811
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:20,278
and just you know just just discreet as

812
00:33:18,058 --> 00:33:23,819
all get out and

813
00:33:20,278 --> 00:33:26,220
um I made some really fun raw hash oils

814
00:33:23,819 --> 00:33:28,439
out out of it you know I didn't refine

815
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:31,558
it and make honey oils or anything just

816
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:33,419
raw hash oils but I was using old you

817
00:33:31,558 --> 00:33:35,398
know little flowers and and a lot of

818
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:37,380
stuff that that people were using it at

819
00:33:35,398 --> 00:33:39,959
that time with just leaves and and

820
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:41,580
whatnot and I now you know I'm gonna

821
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,319
throw in a bunch of the other stuff and

822
00:33:41,579 --> 00:33:45,480
I'd throw hash in there that I'd make

823
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:48,119
and everything and get it all in there

824
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:50,399
and then I take Thai sticks just like

825
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:52,459
these you know and I'd make sticks and

826
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:54,599
then I'd roll it in there and let it dry

827
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:56,460
and then I'd give them away his

828
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:59,339
Christmas presents every fall that was

829
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:02,340
my little thing and so it was it was a

830
00:33:59,339 --> 00:34:04,199
um every time I see one of those or I

831
00:34:02,339 --> 00:34:07,079
think about it in the fall I think oh I

832
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:09,440
wish I had one of those and Bam people

833
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:12,299
have come through and I am just

834
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:15,720
overjoyed and they are it's going to be

835
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:18,539
paid back very handsomely for it look

836
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:20,398
I'm glad to hear and uh part of the

837
00:34:18,539 --> 00:34:22,800
reason I asked that is because the

838
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:24,480
connoisseur hash scene has really seen a

839
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,700
Resurgence in the past few years it's

840
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,280
been great to see and I guess I'm

841
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:31,199
wondering for any of our Avid hashmaking

842
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,700
listeners out there are there any lines

843
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:34,858
of yours particularly that you think

844
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:37,219
would do well making some high quality

845
00:34:34,858 --> 00:34:37,219
hash

846
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:43,859
yeah yeah pick one I mean literally pick

847
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,980
one I I you don't have to I mean there

848
00:34:43,858 --> 00:34:48,239
are if they're looking for uh things

849
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:51,179
that are

850
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:52,979
oh gosh you know that's really that's

851
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:54,599
such a hard question because I can sit

852
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:57,119
here and I can think about

853
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:59,460
several of them that just stand out as

854
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:02,460
far as the resin quality but everything

855
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:04,740
is so close I I mean there the the

856
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:07,800
differences are nuancical they're not

857
00:35:04,739 --> 00:35:10,139
dramatic uh and that's intentional I

858
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:12,900
build in this heavy resin stuff to

859
00:35:10,139 --> 00:35:15,539
everything I do because that's how I

860
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:19,260
like it I need that in order to be able

861
00:35:15,539 --> 00:35:22,380
to have the the Terps overwhelm me and

862
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:26,400
to have the high be as pronounced in me

863
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:29,220
as I need it so uh any of the gooey bass

864
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:32,220
stuff is wonderful it uh comes you know

865
00:35:29,219 --> 00:35:36,539
like the pure guise and uh anything with

866
00:35:32,219 --> 00:35:38,759
mom in the front tends to be dominant in

867
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:41,820
that that way and those resin heads on

868
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:44,579
her I designed so that they were larger

869
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:46,800
because I kept choosing and every every

870
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:50,280
breeder really does need to just always

871
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,420
have their loop with them so that they

872
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:55,079
can check

873
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:57,180
everything and do measurements do size

874
00:35:55,079 --> 00:36:00,060
they test things look you use

875
00:35:57,179 --> 00:36:05,578
microscopes use loops and get in there

876
00:36:00,059 --> 00:36:07,799
and just be picky as hell and I'm

877
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:09,900
picking out what it is that you think is

878
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,240
just a little bit bigger or if you can

879
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:15,119
measure it Micron wise do it you know

880
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:18,059
and and that's that's how I got things

881
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:21,059
to be about two and a half times as

882
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:23,699
large as they started out in the in the

883
00:36:21,059 --> 00:36:26,099
other Lander stuff that I used to make

884
00:36:23,699 --> 00:36:28,919
gooey I just kept selecting for the

885
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:31,500
larger heads because it kept they kept

886
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:33,358
growing and I kept seeing that this was

887
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:37,199
a little a little more pronounced Plus

888
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:39,358
at the same time I got lucky and same

889
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:41,578
time those heads were getting larger the

890
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:43,920
stocks were getting longer well

891
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:48,119
everybody knows that the THC is located

892
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:50,400
on the skin of all of that and that

893
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:54,300
inside there is no THC it's all other

894
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:56,700
oils and and things but the skin so in

895
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:58,740
my mind increased the size of that

896
00:36:56,699 --> 00:37:02,879
bubble and you've increased the potency

897
00:36:58,739 --> 00:37:04,739
range yeah which is how it works out so

898
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,260
um those are the kind of things that I

899
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:10,139
think about uh when I'm I'm doing this

900
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:11,400
kind of thing and so uh we you when you

901
00:37:10,139 --> 00:37:16,019
have

902
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:17,160
um the uh psychonas those are very good

903
00:37:16,019 --> 00:37:18,838
for um

904
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:22,799
Ash production because they're really

905
00:37:18,838 --> 00:37:25,159
coarse uh the one that I liked this last

906
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,539
year was the Kings banner cross because

907
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:30,059
it kind of upped the game a little bit

908
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:32,579
with uh the king's Banner it was it is a

909
00:37:30,059 --> 00:37:34,078
Bruce Banner uh thing and I it was a

910
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:36,839
request

911
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:39,000
um done some people wanted that

912
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:41,460
particular strain cut with a few things

913
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,739
and and so I did and I did that for them

914
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:46,920
and then whatever I had left I went

915
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:49,618
ahead and I just was giving out mostly

916
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:51,900
to people for free but yeah I did sell

917
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:52,680
some of them I think or or Matt may have

918
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,900
a

919
00:37:52,679 --> 00:37:57,960
that may have sold the majority of it

920
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:59,519
but you know these little packages I

921
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,679
mean they can they hold a lot of good

922
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:05,579
stuff for people and I really want I

923
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:08,039
think that you'll uh be able to uh see

924
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:11,420
when you start growing uh that just

925
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:14,400
about anything I I do is made for

926
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:17,639
extraction and for

927
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:20,338
um people who want you know that Bold

928
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:23,279
Flavor forward kind of an experience

929
00:38:20,338 --> 00:38:26,039
so yeah I I I recommend anything with

930
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:28,019
Mom GUI I recommend anything with uh

931
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:30,239
midnight snow

932
00:38:28,019 --> 00:38:32,338
um all those are going to just just be

933
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:33,799
really well pronounced the psychonas are

934
00:38:32,338 --> 00:38:37,679
going to be real pronounced

935
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:40,680
the Hawaiians you name it you know it's

936
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:42,598
I I just like resin I'm just a resin guy

937
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:44,639
so you're not going to see it if it

938
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:46,980
doesn't produce like that

939
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:48,719
that's reassuring to hear and uh

940
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:50,579
interesting to hear about the king's

941
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:52,858
banno we'll come back to that in a few

942
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:54,359
questions but I wanted to ask you

943
00:38:52,858 --> 00:38:55,799
because you just gave me the perfect

944
00:38:54,358 --> 00:38:57,719
introduction there where you said you

945
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:01,019
know like things with the GUI at the

946
00:38:57,719 --> 00:39:03,059
front tend to be good with the resin uh

947
00:39:01,019 --> 00:39:06,059
some friends of mine and I were really

948
00:39:03,059 --> 00:39:07,639
lucky enough to be able to try a a

949
00:39:06,059 --> 00:39:11,400
midnight snow

950
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:14,098
c99 gooey hybrid you gave us a beautiful

951
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,300
beautiful plant hits all the all the

952
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:18,300
things you could want out of a good

953
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:21,180
plant and it got me thinking how did

954
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:24,000
that mail you selected out of the c99

955
00:39:21,179 --> 00:39:25,618
GUI how did that like what traits does

956
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,380
it pass on because as you said the GUI

957
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:30,420
is very dominant but then again a c99

958
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:32,480
probably pretty dominant as well how did

959
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:35,700
how did you find that one worked out

960
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:39,719
here's here's the thing I didn't produce

961
00:39:35,699 --> 00:39:41,699
the mom times c99 portion of that that

962
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:44,219
was done by Duke diamond and Duke

963
00:39:41,699 --> 00:39:46,439
Diamond did those and sent me God knows

964
00:39:44,219 --> 00:39:49,019
how many seed if oh five six thousand

965
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,700
seed he sent me to just to you know to

966
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:55,800
have to play around because he had used

967
00:39:50,699 --> 00:39:57,118
mom to make this cross and uh I I went

968
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:00,720
through

969
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:05,220
some of those things and uh I generally

970
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:07,679
only give those away as freebies because

971
00:40:05,219 --> 00:40:09,838
um it's not something that I made and

972
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:11,879
you know what I mean and and and and so

973
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:13,980
I can't make money off of somebody

974
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:18,300
else's hard work but I can certainly

975
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:20,880
pass on that work to other people for

976
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:24,960
them to experience his work and build

977
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:27,780
enjoy it uh but I found adding I did a

978
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,760
couple of crosses with that and one of

979
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:34,560
them was a mom times mom

980
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:37,200
times c99 and that quite frankly opened

981
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:39,960
up the recessives in the c99 and I got

982
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:43,078
quite a bit of interesting uh stuff in

983
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:46,740
there but before that Mom didn't

984
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:49,440
dominate but the c99 I

985
00:40:46,739 --> 00:40:51,000
I I got to be honest with you you

986
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,880
probably wouldn't have been my selection

987
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:57,599
of breeding for for something to use I

988
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:59,640
have never really found that special c99

989
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:02,400
that I've heard so much about over the

990
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:05,639
years and quite frankly I haven't really

991
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,920
looked that hard for any other breeders

992
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:12,059
work it's just not I've got too much

993
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:13,800
else of my own to do uh and I we all we

994
00:41:12,059 --> 00:41:15,719
all stand on the shoulders of those that

995
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:19,019
came before us I don't care who you are

996
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:20,939
we came from all those hard-working

997
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:23,338
people that that work before us to

998
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:24,358
create what you're using no matter what

999
00:41:23,338 --> 00:41:28,679
it is

1000
00:41:24,358 --> 00:41:30,598
to this day so it is only incumbent upon

1001
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:33,719
us to do the best we can going forward

1002
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:36,240
with that knowing that and being

1003
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:38,399
conscious always of that that you're not

1004
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:41,399
you're not the do-all end-all in this

1005
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:44,099
and that's why I everybody says well how

1006
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:46,619
can you stay so humble you know what I'm

1007
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:49,019
a tool of God and ask anybody who knows

1008
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:51,660
me they'll tell you I'm a tool and

1009
00:41:49,019 --> 00:41:55,019
that's the way it is so

1010
00:41:51,659 --> 00:41:57,118
is but you know what I'm blessed I'm

1011
00:41:55,019 --> 00:41:59,280
happy to have this experience I'm happy

1012
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:02,400
to be able to help people and I'm happy

1013
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:05,519
to be his guiding you know work in this

1014
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:10,079
so that others can go forward this is

1015
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:11,820
what it's for and c99 is I I think

1016
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:14,760
there's some stuff that people really

1017
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:17,700
like in it and and God bless them for it

1018
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:20,099
I I think he that he's an incredible guy

1019
00:42:17,699 --> 00:42:22,259
and I thank him very much for the

1020
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:24,240
opportunity to be able to give other

1021
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:26,520
people his work

1022
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:28,919
yeah that's interesting to hear you know

1023
00:42:26,519 --> 00:42:31,199
because I we got a lot of questions

1024
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:33,059
about the king's banner and why you

1025
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:34,319
chose to use that line can you give us a

1026
00:42:33,059 --> 00:42:36,960
little bit of a more fleshed out

1027
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:38,280
timeline of was it simply just that you

1028
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,440
had some friends requested or was there

1029
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:42,359
a little more that went into picking it

1030
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:45,059
no there were some actually some

1031
00:42:42,358 --> 00:42:46,619
professional um people that wanted yeah

1032
00:42:45,059 --> 00:42:48,659
and uh that was something I was

1033
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:50,220
commissioned to do

1034
00:42:48,659 --> 00:42:51,980
um with the understanding that I was

1035
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:55,679
going to you know give some of them away

1036
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:58,139
uh it makes a difference because uh it's

1037
00:42:55,679 --> 00:43:01,919
part of the BPS uh black Platinum

1038
00:42:58,139 --> 00:43:03,779
Society Set uh most people aren't aware

1039
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,579
of all that and it because it's an

1040
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:06,720
invite only for breeders around the

1041
00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:11,339
world

1042
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:13,980
um that paid for genetics to use in

1043
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:16,500
their own as their own and usually

1044
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:19,079
they're very trait specific things uh

1045
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:21,780
the king's Banner was chosen because it

1046
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:24,119
has a a few of the

1047
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:26,760
um recessives of some very old indicos

1048
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:29,039
in there that this this this company

1049
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:31,140
wanted to go ahead and have

1050
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:34,019
um and so they commissioned me to go

1051
00:43:31,139 --> 00:43:38,098
ahead and tie mom into that because

1052
00:43:34,019 --> 00:43:40,699
you know mom's got some excellent you

1053
00:43:38,099 --> 00:43:44,700
know you're getting five different

1054
00:43:40,699 --> 00:43:49,139
landris things in basically Landers not

1055
00:43:44,699 --> 00:43:51,358
Hawaiian but uh everything else is all

1056
00:43:49,139 --> 00:43:54,179
raw genetics and so there's a lot of

1057
00:43:51,358 --> 00:43:56,578
recessives that when you pair them with

1058
00:43:54,179 --> 00:43:59,159
other stuff that's old and way back that

1059
00:43:56,579 --> 00:44:01,019
was created you're gonna find some

1060
00:43:59,159 --> 00:44:03,118
recesses that match up and bring out

1061
00:44:01,019 --> 00:44:05,699
completely new stuff like I've mentioned

1062
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:07,920
before and so this was their thinking in

1063
00:44:05,699 --> 00:44:09,179
this that they wanted to have that

1064
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,639
spread

1065
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:13,559
um and that set of stuff because you

1066
00:44:11,639 --> 00:44:16,440
know they could deconstruct it very

1067
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:18,000
easily I mean there's methods to tear

1068
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:19,619
anything apart and get back to the

1069
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,858
individuals it's just if you want to

1070
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:24,720
take the time to do it well I I I'm past

1071
00:44:22,858 --> 00:44:26,759
that myself so I let others deal with

1072
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:28,199
that and they're one of them so they can

1073
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:30,180
go ahead and they can deconstruct that

1074
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:32,460
into the two separates and then they can

1075
00:44:30,179 --> 00:44:34,019
even take it further and separate GUI

1076
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:35,818
all the way back into each and

1077
00:44:34,019 --> 00:44:38,818
individual component

1078
00:44:35,818 --> 00:44:42,480
you know small numbers all numbers

1079
00:44:38,818 --> 00:44:44,699
yeah Okay and like in terms of future

1080
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,920
projects do you have any current plans

1081
00:44:44,699 --> 00:44:48,719
to maybe bring another sort of external

1082
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:51,900
genetic into the library and incorporate

1083
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:54,118
that or oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah uh

1084
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:56,818
um well the cerium was was uh one

1085
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:59,280
example there's also some old Lebanese

1086
00:44:56,818 --> 00:45:01,380
that I have recently been gifted that

1087
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,420
I'm looking forward to that come from

1088
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:06,780
the red regions you know so I'm really

1089
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:08,579
hoping for that uh I will know them

1090
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:10,800
because I've dealt with that kind of

1091
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:14,039
stuff when I lived in England I I saw a

1092
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:16,380
lot of material from

1093
00:45:14,039 --> 00:45:18,358
the the Middle East in there and so that

1094
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:23,220
I have some experience in that so I know

1095
00:45:18,358 --> 00:45:25,199
what to look for and uh I am also really

1096
00:45:23,219 --> 00:45:27,480
excited about the Colombian thing

1097
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:30,598
because while

1098
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:32,699
the Canada Exotics genetics are very

1099
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:35,579
popular now becoming now in Colombia

1100
00:45:32,699 --> 00:45:38,578
I've also discussed with some folks down

1101
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:41,099
there who are actively going into the

1102
00:45:38,579 --> 00:45:43,220
hills and going into it to find small

1103
00:45:41,099 --> 00:45:46,740
Growers breeders that have been using

1104
00:45:43,219 --> 00:45:49,858
these stocks in their families for

1105
00:45:46,739 --> 00:45:52,199
generations and that's what I want and

1106
00:45:49,858 --> 00:45:55,078
he's the gentleman that's over there

1107
00:45:52,199 --> 00:45:59,039
doing this for me uh has assured me that

1108
00:45:55,079 --> 00:46:00,900
he's uh looking at some very unique

1109
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:03,059
things that are have been growing for

1110
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:05,760
there for a long time the old punarotas

1111
00:46:03,059 --> 00:46:07,318
uh these kinds of things so I'm very

1112
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,780
excited to look into those because

1113
00:46:07,318 --> 00:46:11,519
pairing those with gooeys and stuff are

1114
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:14,460
going to bring out those old Colombians

1115
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:17,280
and and and the Mexican the Acapulco

1116
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:19,440
Gold that's in there it's going to bring

1117
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,420
those forward a lot and I those are

1118
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:24,720
really fun genetics those are really fun

1119
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:27,059
genetics yeah wow that sounds that

1120
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:29,818
sounds very special it you've got me

1121
00:46:27,059 --> 00:46:31,858
thinking on our most recent episode we

1122
00:46:29,818 --> 00:46:33,420
had Todd McCormick come on the show and

1123
00:46:31,858 --> 00:46:35,219
I'm not sure if you're familiar with his

1124
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:36,960
work he's been in the scene for quite a

1125
00:46:35,219 --> 00:46:39,419
while doing things here and there but

1126
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:41,099
recently he's paired up with Mel Frank

1127
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:43,079
and a few other people to bring some

1128
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:44,640
really old school gems back to the

1129
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:47,640
market and the one I wanted to ask you

1130
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:50,279
about specifically was he's got what he

1131
00:46:47,639 --> 00:46:53,159
considers to be an original haze from

1132
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:56,280
Sam the skunk man as well as most

1133
00:46:53,159 --> 00:46:58,618
specially original skunk one from Mel

1134
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:01,380
Frank and I thought to myself would you

1135
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:03,119
be interested in doing a pure GUI

1136
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:04,440
project using that skunk one if you

1137
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:06,358
could get access to it and were

1138
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:08,700
confident it was real

1139
00:47:06,358 --> 00:47:12,179
yeah I probably would because I used the

1140
00:47:08,699 --> 00:47:15,299
skunk one before I and the the skunk one

1141
00:47:12,179 --> 00:47:18,598
that I used was from the old sssc

1142
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:21,000
um back when it first was uh uh it was

1143
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:23,700
the first seed bank uh and that's that's

1144
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:26,039
uh that was the genetics that I used to

1145
00:47:23,699 --> 00:47:27,899
cube gooey originally because it has

1146
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:31,559
some of the same genetics in it that

1147
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:33,720
gooey does and so it was a good it was a

1148
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:36,119
good matchup and it was really easy to

1149
00:47:33,719 --> 00:47:38,639
work as far as that goes so yeah the

1150
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:42,240
original was very very malleable

1151
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:44,159
compared to later versions I don't I

1152
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:46,799
don't even recognize a skunk one now

1153
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:50,699
that that exists now I don't even

1154
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:52,740
recognize it I've seen it and it doesn't

1155
00:47:50,699 --> 00:47:56,338
have any of the characteristics that I

1156
00:47:52,739 --> 00:47:58,799
remember Sean Guam was a very very well

1157
00:47:56,338 --> 00:47:59,880
crafted seat I really enjoyed it really

1158
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,160
enjoyed it

1159
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:04,858
yeah look we might have to get you two

1160
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:08,338
in contact and as a follow-up he's also

1161
00:48:04,858 --> 00:48:10,858
been able to get um original seeds of

1162
00:48:08,338 --> 00:48:12,719
Northern Lights from um Seattle Greg

1163
00:48:10,858 --> 00:48:14,400
who's the guy who gave it to Neville

1164
00:48:12,719 --> 00:48:15,899
back in the day and it got me wondering

1165
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,818
would something like Northern Lights

1166
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:20,338
ever interest you or it's just too

1167
00:48:17,818 --> 00:48:24,239
Indica too nope nope I'll tell you why

1168
00:48:20,338 --> 00:48:27,539
because I don't want to offer that to to

1169
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:29,219
people it's different it because other

1170
00:48:27,539 --> 00:48:30,960
people are doing it other people have it

1171
00:48:29,219 --> 00:48:33,480
that's something that other people can

1172
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:36,000
do I want to stay as original as

1173
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:38,519
possible because that helps the public

1174
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,440
be more diverse and the more that I sit

1175
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:43,500
there and do exactly what I'm railing

1176
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:46,260
against by using other people's stuff is

1177
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:47,880
the hypocrisy would grow and grow and

1178
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:51,599
grow and and that's just not what I'm

1179
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:53,700
into I'm into diversity and making sure

1180
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:56,338
that we've got a selection of things

1181
00:48:53,699 --> 00:48:58,019
that just you can't get any other way

1182
00:48:56,338 --> 00:49:01,199
than other than keeping them separate

1183
00:48:58,019 --> 00:49:03,239
you really can't now I do a lot of inner

1184
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:07,078
breeding and stuff but I always have a

1185
00:49:03,239 --> 00:49:10,739
purpose for what I'm and this is my flaw

1186
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:13,740
I see nothing but holes I don't see the

1187
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:16,078
good stuff I see nothing but holes and

1188
00:49:13,739 --> 00:49:17,578
where and to me a hole needs to be

1189
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:20,039
filled and it needs to be fixed and I

1190
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:21,960
got to take care of that and you know

1191
00:49:20,039 --> 00:49:23,519
I'll use the black Raptor plant people

1192
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:26,338
were just freaking out over the black

1193
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:29,519
record fat how pretty it was all I saw

1194
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:32,099
was is that it had buds that were you

1195
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:34,800
know this long on top and then there was

1196
00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:37,680
a bunch of stock and nothing else and

1197
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:40,619
that's that's a dirty plant that's not

1198
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:43,199
you know that may work in indoor grows

1199
00:49:40,619 --> 00:49:45,539
and and where they trim off the bottoms

1200
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:47,159
to you know promote the stuff like the

1201
00:49:45,539 --> 00:49:50,818
production grows it may be good for that

1202
00:49:47,159 --> 00:49:53,519
but it in my mind it's it's it's a hole

1203
00:49:50,818 --> 00:49:55,980
that needs to be filled and so my

1204
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:58,920
problem has always been it always will

1205
00:49:55,980 --> 00:50:01,019
be that all I do is see holes in other

1206
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:03,780
people's work and it's an awful thing to

1207
00:50:01,019 --> 00:50:06,000
say it's an awful thing to have it's an

1208
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:08,099
awful thing to experience but I just

1209
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,500
can't smoke something and go wow that's

1210
00:50:08,099 --> 00:50:12,000
great I got to go hmm you know it's kind

1211
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:13,980
of acidic and a little harsh on the

1212
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,440
throat and doesn't the buzz comes on and

1213
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:19,260
really slow and I analyze it to death

1214
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:22,740
and this is one of the bad things about

1215
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:25,980
being at the uh the type of breeder that

1216
00:50:22,739 --> 00:50:28,799
I am is this this is this you just see

1217
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:32,280
nothing but holes conversely you guys

1218
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:33,839
all benefit from that I hope because I

1219
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,619
filled the holes and then you get the

1220
00:50:33,838 --> 00:50:37,078
stuff

1221
00:50:34,619 --> 00:50:40,260
you know but and you know for me it's

1222
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:41,839
just a series of uh misses and Strikes

1223
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:43,940
and

1224
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:46,380
towel

1225
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:50,480
we're lucky to have you and your unique

1226
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:53,880
perspective it's uh I I see it's awful

1227
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:56,039
oh little L that's okay though that's

1228
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:59,280
okay like I said somebody's got to do it

1229
00:50:56,039 --> 00:51:01,079
and I I I if I didn't enjoy it this is

1230
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:03,480
this is what I've done all my life I

1231
00:51:01,079 --> 00:51:05,700
have people have to understand I was 13

1232
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:08,519
when I started growing my own plants

1233
00:51:05,699 --> 00:51:10,199
because I moved around all the time I

1234
00:51:08,519 --> 00:51:12,000
was an Air Force brat I always had to

1235
00:51:10,199 --> 00:51:13,799
have a stash where am I going to have a

1236
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
stash and the only way you can do is to

1237
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:17,940
grow your own

1238
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:20,579
so that's what started all this you know

1239
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:23,099
and then that High Times ad that had the

1240
00:51:20,579 --> 00:51:24,900
first Colombian gold in it because they

1241
00:51:23,099 --> 00:51:27,359
couldn't sell the damn stuff in New York

1242
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:28,920
and I got hold of some of that pot that

1243
00:51:27,358 --> 00:51:31,619
Lit the fuse

1244
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:33,960
Outlet diffuse and then I started

1245
00:51:31,619 --> 00:51:35,519
reading it and the very first time that

1246
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:38,880
I ever had

1247
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:40,500
um two only two plants it was in Texas

1248
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:42,059
Arizona it's one of those I think it

1249
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:43,739
might have been Arizona had two plants

1250
00:51:42,059 --> 00:51:45,359
little plants and one of them died and

1251
00:51:43,739 --> 00:51:48,299
the only thing you got left was a female

1252
00:51:45,358 --> 00:51:50,279
and it grew seedless and I thought I'd

1253
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:53,160
invented something I started going what

1254
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:55,619
the hell is going this is fat oh my gosh

1255
00:51:53,159 --> 00:51:57,719
it was the best spot I ever had and then

1256
00:51:55,619 --> 00:51:59,818
I started reading about them and oh oh

1257
00:51:57,719 --> 00:52:01,799
the Chinese for 5 000 years I've been

1258
00:51:59,818 --> 00:52:04,259
doing it like this I'm not anything

1259
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:06,720
special at all and then the next year

1260
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:09,359
after that it was like super popular in

1261
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:12,118
in California they were making whole

1262
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:14,759
Houses full of it and you know oh yeah

1263
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:18,300
all this amazing seedless

1264
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:20,940
yeah yeah I lived through all that [ __ ]

1265
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:23,460
so it's it's a weird uh it's a weird

1266
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:25,200
life and I unfortunately that's the kind

1267
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:27,358
of perspective that I have to look at

1268
00:52:25,199 --> 00:52:30,539
everything through

1269
00:52:27,358 --> 00:52:33,960
yeah no a brilliant perspective

1270
00:52:30,539 --> 00:52:35,219
um and I wanted to to jump into some of

1271
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:36,900
the more technical breeding questions

1272
00:52:35,219 --> 00:52:38,399
but I just got one last Quick one for

1273
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:40,220
you that was submitted by quite a number

1274
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:43,500
of listeners and they wanted to know

1275
00:52:40,219 --> 00:52:45,779
have you ever been impressed by one of

1276
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:50,000
the more modern hype strains and if not

1277
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:50,000
what was the last thing to impress you

1278
00:52:51,858 --> 00:52:56,058
wow that's a good question

1279
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:01,318
um

1280
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:03,838
the only thing that comes to mind is

1281
00:53:01,318 --> 00:53:05,719
something that came out of Humboldt in

1282
00:53:03,838 --> 00:53:10,159
about

1283
00:53:05,719 --> 00:53:13,500
87.88 uh that really took me back it was

1284
00:53:10,159 --> 00:53:15,960
I I remember I was I was in a parking

1285
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:17,760
lot and a friend of mine and I smoked a

1286
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:21,539
bowl and I started to drive away and

1287
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:24,540
realized I forgot how to drive

1288
00:53:21,539 --> 00:53:28,318
um and that that was some Afghani based

1289
00:53:24,539 --> 00:53:32,699
material and that was the last time that

1290
00:53:28,318 --> 00:53:36,779
I was taken aback by by something uh in

1291
00:53:32,699 --> 00:53:39,838
many a year it's been many a year so no

1292
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:41,579
again I only see holes and and when I

1293
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:45,779
smoke the commercial stuff it's like

1294
00:53:41,579 --> 00:53:47,660
yeah you know a lot of it is high THC no

1295
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:50,640
soul

1296
00:53:47,659 --> 00:53:52,799
if somebody mentioned that online and I

1297
00:53:50,639 --> 00:53:55,618
thought that's very well put

1298
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:56,160
um because that's exactly how it is

1299
00:53:55,619 --> 00:53:59,579
um

1300
00:53:56,159 --> 00:54:02,279
uh I call it bottle rocket pot where

1301
00:53:59,579 --> 00:54:03,780
you're projected up and you're high as

1302
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:06,119
hell and then all of a sudden poof and

1303
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:09,300
it's gone and drifts away with the smoke

1304
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:11,400
and and it's just gone and I hate that

1305
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:14,220
that's that's

1306
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:16,858
and unfortunately the genetics are to me

1307
00:54:14,219 --> 00:54:19,318
like that but you see again I'm colored

1308
00:54:16,858 --> 00:54:22,259
by so much use and so many different

1309
00:54:19,318 --> 00:54:24,539
strains smoking all the time but it it

1310
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:26,280
it has to be

1311
00:54:24,539 --> 00:54:28,079
you know it just has to be something

1312
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:30,180
very unique that's going to take my body

1313
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:32,099
by surprise otherwise it's just another

1314
00:54:30,179 --> 00:54:35,399
thing that you know I've had a thousand

1315
00:54:32,099 --> 00:54:37,200
times so unfortunately I gotta say I

1316
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:40,019
probably know I haven't smoked very much

1317
00:54:37,199 --> 00:54:42,419
that I'm really impressed with I'm I'm

1318
00:54:40,019 --> 00:54:44,519
sad to say that because I I know that

1319
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:46,440
sounds really horrible and I'm not that

1320
00:54:44,519 --> 00:54:49,259
kind of person to want to come off like

1321
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:51,480
that it's just the truth

1322
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:53,640
note to fee I uh I had a sneaking

1323
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:56,760
suspicion you weren't gonna tell me you

1324
00:54:53,639 --> 00:54:59,400
were impressed by runs but that's okay

1325
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:01,140
um and it brings us to sort of how you

1326
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,338
go about creating strains yourself and

1327
00:55:01,139 --> 00:55:04,019
so the first question I wanted to ask

1328
00:55:02,338 --> 00:55:06,119
you is you were talking a little earlier

1329
00:55:04,019 --> 00:55:08,159
about you know these flavors that emerge

1330
00:55:06,119 --> 00:55:09,900
from your new lines and I I certainly

1331
00:55:08,159 --> 00:55:11,519
can agree with that having tried a few

1332
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:13,740
different ones and so my first question

1333
00:55:11,519 --> 00:55:16,318
is do you create lines with the

1334
00:55:13,739 --> 00:55:18,118
intention of sort of filling a flavor

1335
00:55:16,318 --> 00:55:22,159
profile you don't have

1336
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:25,260
yeah no no no I always have a Target

1337
00:55:22,159 --> 00:55:27,299
there's always a goal yeah I'm not I'm

1338
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:29,220
not hitting anything any plan with

1339
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:31,920
anything without a goal firmly in mind

1340
00:55:29,219 --> 00:55:33,539
for that plant and I know exactly what I

1341
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:35,338
want and I know what I want to bring

1342
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:37,619
forward and I know how I'm going to

1343
00:55:35,338 --> 00:55:39,659
bring it forward and I know what I need

1344
00:55:37,619 --> 00:55:42,720
to do in order to get that done the most

1345
00:55:39,659 --> 00:55:45,058
efficient way as possible and so and

1346
00:55:42,719 --> 00:55:48,118
this all goes back to knowing your

1347
00:55:45,059 --> 00:55:51,240
strains inside and out people will look

1348
00:55:48,119 --> 00:55:53,338
at at my stuff and they'll say well uh

1349
00:55:51,239 --> 00:55:55,259
you've got this combination over here

1350
00:55:53,338 --> 00:55:58,739
and this combination over here and

1351
00:55:55,260 --> 00:56:00,059
they're kind of the same thing and I I

1352
00:55:58,739 --> 00:56:02,399
can get one or the other and be all

1353
00:56:00,059 --> 00:56:03,540
right and be in the same no you're not

1354
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,338
you're going to get a completely

1355
00:56:03,539 --> 00:56:06,838
different thing from this than you were

1356
00:56:05,338 --> 00:56:08,279
over here even though they're using the

1357
00:56:06,838 --> 00:56:12,000
same genetics in different combinations

1358
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:14,819
why the target was different for this

1359
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:17,280
batch than it was for that now there's a

1360
00:56:14,818 --> 00:56:19,619
lot of unique flavors from the old

1361
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:22,859
African strain that I use for the

1362
00:56:19,619 --> 00:56:25,619
purples that that really come through

1363
00:56:22,858 --> 00:56:27,739
and levels of Spike devices and

1364
00:56:25,619 --> 00:56:30,900
different kinds of of

1365
00:56:27,739 --> 00:56:32,519
uh it's hard I want to stay away from

1366
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:34,858
the earthy flavors because those are

1367
00:56:32,519 --> 00:56:38,099
predominant everybody complains about

1368
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:41,519
your comments on earthiness I don't want

1369
00:56:38,099 --> 00:56:45,180
that I like the Moroccan spice bizarre

1370
00:56:41,519 --> 00:56:47,759
kind of uh of a thing and so I only

1371
00:56:45,179 --> 00:56:50,098
select for that kind of an effect from

1372
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:53,220
those genetics and that's what you're

1373
00:56:50,099 --> 00:56:56,400
going to get out of this and I hear this

1374
00:56:53,219 --> 00:56:58,618
all the time wow I've never tasted

1375
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:01,920
something like that before

1376
00:56:58,619 --> 00:57:04,400
Bingo that's what I'm after is that

1377
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:07,440
effect right there because

1378
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:11,579
more and more pots becoming less about

1379
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:13,920
being stoned and being super high than

1380
00:57:11,579 --> 00:57:17,880
it is about the whole consumption

1381
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:21,180
experience in itself and that's going to

1382
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:23,818
translate whether it be oils whether it

1383
00:57:21,179 --> 00:57:26,219
be resin whether it be flour whether it

1384
00:57:23,818 --> 00:57:30,599
be hash it it's all going to translate

1385
00:57:26,219 --> 00:57:33,299
over in that way in that form for you to

1386
00:57:30,599 --> 00:57:34,680
experience and that's the set that I

1387
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:37,260
want to be different from everything

1388
00:57:34,679 --> 00:57:40,980
else so when I'm designing something

1389
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:43,020
it's always with a whole kind of a

1390
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:45,358
mentality right there's a hole I'm

1391
00:57:43,019 --> 00:57:47,460
trying to get filled let me give you an

1392
00:57:45,358 --> 00:57:48,920
example

1393
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:52,679
foreign

1394
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:54,720
microbreeding you know these look like

1395
00:57:52,679 --> 00:57:58,379
little tiny plants that don't mean [ __ ]

1396
00:57:54,719 --> 00:58:02,098
and this particular batch doesn't but

1397
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:03,838
beyond that they show me in all these

1398
00:58:02,099 --> 00:58:07,019
different sections

1399
00:58:03,838 --> 00:58:11,219
they show me what this spread had and

1400
00:58:07,019 --> 00:58:13,259
how many were good to go and I want you

1401
00:58:11,219 --> 00:58:14,219
to look at this real close if people can

1402
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:17,339
look

1403
00:58:14,219 --> 00:58:20,159
look at this expression here and look at

1404
00:58:17,338 --> 00:58:24,358
this expression here they're off the

1405
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:27,000
same damn seed well WOW one's like a

1406
00:58:24,358 --> 00:58:29,880
drug you grow if you grow and you only

1407
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,260
get this expression what are you gonna

1408
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:34,680
do with that you're not going to look

1409
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:38,700
any further in that but microbreeding

1410
00:58:34,679 --> 00:58:42,539
shows you these different levels of

1411
00:58:38,699 --> 00:58:45,358
color different levels of resin and more

1412
00:58:42,539 --> 00:58:47,579
importantly the smell each one has their

1413
00:58:45,358 --> 00:58:49,920
own unique smell some of them are like

1414
00:58:47,579 --> 00:58:52,318
the others you know and some are very

1415
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:54,298
different and you're targeting whichever

1416
00:58:52,318 --> 00:58:56,279
trade it is that you're looking for in

1417
00:58:54,298 --> 00:58:58,500
that spectrum of what you're trying to

1418
00:58:56,280 --> 00:59:00,960
design for and then you choose that and

1419
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:03,179
you neglect everything else

1420
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:04,500
kill everything else

1421
00:59:03,179 --> 00:59:08,098
because

1422
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:10,500
and don't look back and people fall for

1423
00:59:08,099 --> 00:59:13,079
this all the time oh well this is pretty

1424
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:15,358
I want to you know maybe use that for

1425
00:59:13,079 --> 00:59:17,640
something else unless it's super

1426
00:59:15,358 --> 00:59:20,639
exceptional and you've got a target for

1427
00:59:17,639 --> 00:59:23,460
it everything else goes

1428
00:59:20,639 --> 00:59:25,858
so and that's the mentality that I live

1429
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:27,900
by and that's how and I wanted to bring

1430
00:59:25,858 --> 00:59:30,739
that up because the microbreeding thing

1431
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:35,160
am I that is microbreeding and what

1432
00:59:30,739 --> 00:59:38,939
microbreeding in this company is is

1433
00:59:35,159 --> 00:59:41,338
growing a lot of seeds taking them out

1434
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:43,559
after only letting them get so big so

1435
00:59:41,338 --> 00:59:46,739
you can have fast turnover you're not

1436
00:59:43,559 --> 00:59:49,260
waiting expression doesn't change all it

1437
00:59:46,739 --> 00:59:51,358
does is demonstrate what's in that seed

1438
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:53,760
and then you choose that and you take it

1439
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:56,279
to the next step that's why I never

1440
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:57,780
wrote the book because it's just that

1441
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:59,400
simple you're going to take it to the

1442
00:59:57,780 --> 01:00:01,440
next step to see whether it's a viable

1443
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:04,440
plant for the other purposes like

1444
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:06,838
production like you know how it does as

1445
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:09,659
far as a big plant goes but you've

1446
01:00:06,838 --> 01:00:12,659
eliminated a lot of trouble and a lot of

1447
01:00:09,659 --> 01:00:15,480
of uh unusable material a lot of time

1448
01:00:12,659 --> 01:00:18,000
money and space you've eliminated all of

1449
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:20,219
that and you've only focused on what is

1450
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,318
proper and right and good and you've had

1451
01:00:20,219 --> 01:00:24,719
it in record amount of time now you can

1452
01:00:22,318 --> 01:00:27,358
move forward and that's how I can do

1453
01:00:24,719 --> 01:00:28,919
things so fast people say how do you how

1454
01:00:27,358 --> 01:00:31,440
can you do this stuff so fast and how

1455
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:32,880
you could and and they think that I'm

1456
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:36,358
one of these people that doesn't test my

1457
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:38,220
lines this is how I test my lines you

1458
01:00:36,358 --> 01:00:40,798
know I see what I'm going to get I know

1459
01:00:38,219 --> 01:00:42,419
the numbers of the of the different how

1460
01:00:40,798 --> 01:00:43,739
much male and female I'm going to get

1461
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:46,380
which I want to get to in a second

1462
01:00:43,739 --> 01:00:48,358
because breeders can drive male and

1463
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:52,619
female percentages and I'm going to use

1464
01:00:48,358 --> 01:00:54,358
an example uh from an unlikely source

1465
01:00:52,619 --> 01:00:55,980
which is really interesting and I this

1466
01:00:54,358 --> 01:00:59,098
is something I experienced back when I

1467
01:00:55,980 --> 01:01:01,380
was a kid in Nebraska

1468
01:00:59,099 --> 01:01:03,838
they grow a lot of corn corn is

1469
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:07,318
everywhere and there's a lot of wild

1470
01:01:03,838 --> 01:01:10,199
hemp everywhere it's all over matter of

1471
01:01:07,318 --> 01:01:13,019
fact I used to hollow out the wild hemp

1472
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:15,239
Fields they were close to the corn and I

1473
01:01:13,019 --> 01:01:17,579
would plant Colombian seed and then go

1474
01:01:15,239 --> 01:01:19,558
in there and that was how I never had to

1475
01:01:17,579 --> 01:01:22,019
worry about you know growing anything I

1476
01:01:19,559 --> 01:01:23,280
would just and it would it back then I

1477
01:01:22,019 --> 01:01:25,559
would just seed with everything and

1478
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:27,660
males and females and all that but at

1479
01:01:25,559 --> 01:01:29,280
least you could nobody was stealing your

1480
01:01:27,659 --> 01:01:31,259
stuff and they were you know leave it

1481
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:33,298
alone and it looked basically the same

1482
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:35,940
because it was Colombian

1483
01:01:33,298 --> 01:01:37,980
um so you know it was a it was that was

1484
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:41,818
a good way but one of the things that

1485
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:43,679
was noticed by farmers in the area and I

1486
01:01:41,818 --> 01:01:46,619
had a conversation with one of them once

1487
01:01:43,679 --> 01:01:49,798
that kind of eluded me to this to notice

1488
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:54,960
this and is that there the there was an

1489
01:01:49,798 --> 01:01:59,699
increase in females adjacent to the corn

1490
01:01:54,960 --> 01:02:01,400
crops and the one deciding factor that I

1491
01:01:59,699 --> 01:02:04,679
could see that was different

1492
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:07,680
besides you know it being runoff which

1493
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:11,219
is another Factor but uh was nitrogen

1494
01:02:07,679 --> 01:02:13,798
and uh what it turned out to be and what

1495
01:02:11,219 --> 01:02:15,598
and nature kind of does this as a

1496
01:02:13,798 --> 01:02:16,980
survival kind of a thing and I can

1497
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:18,180
understand this because it makes perfect

1498
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:20,159
sense

1499
01:02:18,179 --> 01:02:21,980
in a nitrogen

1500
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:25,019
tree flower

1501
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:26,460
nitrogen-rich or nitrogen enhanced shall

1502
01:02:25,019 --> 01:02:28,380
we say setting

1503
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:31,740
Nature's gonna

1504
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:35,220
prefer females because the plants get

1505
01:02:31,739 --> 01:02:39,419
larger they can grow they can be more of

1506
01:02:35,219 --> 01:02:42,959
them and there's less need for males to

1507
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:45,599
be as proliferous and so Nature's over

1508
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:48,659
time and with the conditions being that

1509
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:52,380
way in a Landress setting you will see

1510
01:02:48,659 --> 01:02:54,719
this effect happen where they have an

1511
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:57,079
increase in female populations by

1512
01:02:54,719 --> 01:03:01,199
introducing a little bit of nitrogen

1513
01:02:57,079 --> 01:03:04,920
pre-flower than more than is normally in

1514
01:03:01,199 --> 01:03:06,058
the in the mix so just upping that a

1515
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:08,700
little bit

1516
01:03:06,059 --> 01:03:10,260
over time now it's different with

1517
01:03:08,699 --> 01:03:12,118
polyhybrids

1518
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:14,839
we'll get to that in a second I'm

1519
01:03:12,119 --> 01:03:18,180
speaking right now about Landers because

1520
01:03:14,838 --> 01:03:20,639
landers's show that variation in an

1521
01:03:18,179 --> 01:03:23,539
environment much more readily and

1522
01:03:20,639 --> 01:03:27,118
predictably as demonstrated by the plant

1523
01:03:23,539 --> 01:03:29,460
than the other polyhybrids poly hybrids

1524
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:31,260
you gotta know what's in it and know

1525
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:33,838
what's being expressed otherwise you get

1526
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:36,059
fooled and most people don't have that

1527
01:03:33,838 --> 01:03:38,519
knowledge so or they don't go to that

1528
01:03:36,059 --> 01:03:41,339
depth so so when we're speaking with

1529
01:03:38,519 --> 01:03:44,219
Landers it's easy to see this effect uh

1530
01:03:41,338 --> 01:03:46,858
take place and so I always like to tell

1531
01:03:44,219 --> 01:03:48,419
breeders that maybe you can over a

1532
01:03:46,858 --> 01:03:50,179
period of time when you're breeding

1533
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:53,460
these stocks again and again and again

1534
01:03:50,179 --> 01:03:56,279
you can up that percentage of females

1535
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:58,199
Express for your customers because most

1536
01:03:56,280 --> 01:04:00,839
of these people buying seed are looking

1537
01:03:58,199 --> 01:04:03,358
for females

1538
01:04:00,838 --> 01:04:05,099
um you know that you you want the best

1539
01:04:03,358 --> 01:04:08,519
for your customer again that's that's

1540
01:04:05,099 --> 01:04:11,720
what we're working for now I tend to go

1541
01:04:08,519 --> 01:04:14,818
for a 50 50 shot with mine because

1542
01:04:11,719 --> 01:04:17,578
breeders are my main people

1543
01:04:14,818 --> 01:04:19,440
but I like to tell breeders go ahead and

1544
01:04:17,579 --> 01:04:22,318
let's make these small adjustments like

1545
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:24,780
this uh and it makes a difference and so

1546
01:04:22,318 --> 01:04:26,519
learning that just first hand it was

1547
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:30,420
really kind of interesting to see that

1548
01:04:26,519 --> 01:04:31,920
effect in a raw Nature State and then

1549
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:34,200
you know to kind of figure it out and

1550
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:36,599
have it confirmed and plants are always

1551
01:04:34,199 --> 01:04:37,980
going to do what is best for them they

1552
01:04:36,599 --> 01:04:40,859
don't care about you they don't care

1553
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:42,599
about music people say oh they respond

1554
01:04:40,858 --> 01:04:44,460
to music no they don't they don't they

1555
01:04:42,599 --> 01:04:46,380
don't respond to music they they don't

1556
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:49,079
respond to vibration they don't do it

1557
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:51,059
they respond to whatever is best for the

1558
01:04:49,079 --> 01:04:54,000
plant and that's it and they've done

1559
01:04:51,059 --> 01:04:55,740
studies that back in the 70s they

1560
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,619
thought that plants were responding

1561
01:04:55,739 --> 01:05:00,419
better to rock music uh than they did to

1562
01:04:58,619 --> 01:05:02,039
anything else and stuff subsequent

1563
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:04,980
Studies have just proven all of that

1564
01:05:02,039 --> 01:05:08,279
double-blind tests yes it does not exist

1565
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:10,019
so keeping that in mind when you're

1566
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:12,180
growing this stuff is very important

1567
01:05:10,019 --> 01:05:14,818
whatever is the best for the plant is

1568
01:05:12,179 --> 01:05:17,879
what the plant is going to do and that

1569
01:05:14,818 --> 01:05:21,539
is going to affect its expression

1570
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:24,900
because microclimates make all the

1571
01:05:21,539 --> 01:05:27,480
difference and I use gooey as an example

1572
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:30,059
uh I've grown gooey for so long and I've

1573
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:32,460
grown hurt under so many different uh

1574
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:35,460
methods and styles of growing indoor

1575
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:38,220
outdoor deep water culture aeroponics

1576
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:41,579
everything I have used over the courses

1577
01:05:38,219 --> 01:05:44,098
of all this this stuff uh enhanced soils

1578
01:05:41,579 --> 01:05:46,980
you know unenhanced soil it does you

1579
01:05:44,099 --> 01:05:51,119
know all the every single thing that you

1580
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:53,039
do affects a different expression that's

1581
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:55,140
buried in that plant that is going to be

1582
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:57,119
the best for it and this is why people

1583
01:05:55,139 --> 01:05:59,039
say dialing in the plants is so

1584
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:00,838
important and I couldn't agree more you

1585
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:03,539
want to go ahead and dial this stuff in

1586
01:06:00,838 --> 01:06:05,039
and the only way to do that is to try

1587
01:06:03,539 --> 01:06:07,318
different things and see the reaction

1588
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:09,539
and get that stuff going because I'll

1589
01:06:07,318 --> 01:06:12,058
tell you right now there are some people

1590
01:06:09,539 --> 01:06:15,058
out there that take my stuff

1591
01:06:12,059 --> 01:06:17,339
and they can they do amazing things with

1592
01:06:15,059 --> 01:06:19,380
it that I could never do I could never

1593
01:06:17,338 --> 01:06:21,058
do it they're better at it than me

1594
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:21,780
they're better at growing my pop and

1595
01:06:21,059 --> 01:06:24,359
iron

1596
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:27,920
and that's fantastic and that's because

1597
01:06:24,358 --> 01:06:31,558
they've learned how to dial it in

1598
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:33,358
yeah a brilliant sentiment there and an

1599
01:06:31,559 --> 01:06:35,640
interesting discussion point about the

1600
01:06:33,358 --> 01:06:37,318
male to female ratios I'd be interested

1601
01:06:35,639 --> 01:06:39,960
to hear your opinions in terms of the

1602
01:06:37,318 --> 01:06:40,858
more modern polyhybrid strains do you

1603
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:42,780
think there's much you can do to

1604
01:06:40,858 --> 01:06:45,078
influence the sex ratios or it's pretty

1605
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:45,079
sad

1606
01:06:45,838 --> 01:06:50,338
um you know again you're gotta know the

1607
01:06:48,358 --> 01:06:52,199
backgrounds you have to know what's what

1608
01:06:50,338 --> 01:06:55,199
how these things are built and what

1609
01:06:52,199 --> 01:06:57,659
ratios that they were used in and and

1610
01:06:55,199 --> 01:07:01,558
whether they back crossed it any at all

1611
01:06:57,659 --> 01:07:02,960
uh that Crossing it has a a tendency to

1612
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:05,519
reinforce

1613
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:08,099
background recessive it doesn't bring

1614
01:07:05,519 --> 01:07:09,019
them necessarily forward

1615
01:07:08,099 --> 01:07:11,220
um

1616
01:07:09,019 --> 01:07:13,980
that's the thing that people think that

1617
01:07:11,219 --> 01:07:16,558
they're they're they're maybe bringing a

1618
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:18,539
recessive and making it dominant by back

1619
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:21,359
Crossing and that's not necessarily the

1620
01:07:18,539 --> 01:07:23,280
case especially with polyhybrids you

1621
01:07:21,358 --> 01:07:26,699
could just be shoving it back into the

1622
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:28,980
into the mix further uh again

1623
01:07:26,699 --> 01:07:31,139
the best way to bring about something

1624
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:33,900
that is unique and different and and

1625
01:07:31,139 --> 01:07:36,779
powerful and everything is probably by

1626
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:39,180
introducing an unfamiliar genetic that

1627
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:41,579
allows the recessives that it's made up

1628
01:07:39,179 --> 01:07:43,440
from to pair and become dominant in

1629
01:07:41,579 --> 01:07:45,480
there I keep going back to that but

1630
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:48,298
that's really the Crux of it Luther

1631
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:50,639
Burbank you know taught us all these

1632
01:07:48,298 --> 01:07:52,139
Basics and it's just what I live by I

1633
01:07:50,639 --> 01:07:54,960
live in the same county that moved

1634
01:07:52,139 --> 01:07:57,960
through Burbank used to live it and did

1635
01:07:54,960 --> 01:08:01,380
his work in I mean this is The Sweet

1636
01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:03,179
Spot in the global world it is the one

1637
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:05,880
place that he called the best place on

1638
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:09,179
Earth you know for growing as many

1639
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:11,099
different things as possible and so all

1640
01:08:09,179 --> 01:08:12,960
that mentality comes back to that kind

1641
01:08:11,099 --> 01:08:14,579
of thinking and and this is where I base

1642
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:16,739
everything on

1643
01:08:14,579 --> 01:08:18,900
yeah look I one of the things I remember

1644
01:08:16,738 --> 01:08:20,639
very vividly from our last discussion is

1645
01:08:18,899 --> 01:08:22,198
your fondness for Luther Burbank so

1646
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:25,319
that's good to see it still alive and

1647
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:27,838
well yeah always for the rest of my life

1648
01:08:25,319 --> 01:08:30,000
I mean the lessons that he teaches are

1649
01:08:27,838 --> 01:08:34,198
simple but they're direct and they're

1650
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:36,838
fully applicable to any single

1651
01:08:34,198 --> 01:08:40,678
first time grower on up to the seasoned

1652
01:08:36,838 --> 01:08:43,559
professional it's all applicable and you

1653
01:08:40,679 --> 01:08:45,838
know why you know the only other way

1654
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:48,060
that you could change things now and we

1655
01:08:45,838 --> 01:08:50,579
can get into that if you want is gene

1656
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:52,140
splicing uh they're doing some amazing

1657
01:08:50,579 --> 01:08:55,318
things with that now and they're

1658
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:57,239
inserting uh terp profiles that you know

1659
01:08:55,319 --> 01:08:58,859
just never existed in the in nature

1660
01:08:57,238 --> 01:09:00,358
before and they're doing that kind of

1661
01:08:58,859 --> 01:09:00,960
thing and

1662
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:04,440
um

1663
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:07,560
and then even right down to some of my

1664
01:09:04,439 --> 01:09:11,039
own silly little work with uh silver you

1665
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:13,739
know to to do female uh material

1666
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:15,119
um which by the way I want to give a

1667
01:09:13,738 --> 01:09:17,939
little tip to people who are trying to

1668
01:09:15,119 --> 01:09:21,119
make their own plow silver for uh making

1669
01:09:17,939 --> 01:09:24,178
females is use just one battery

1670
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:26,099
don't use three batteries and the reason

1671
01:09:24,179 --> 01:09:28,380
is is because you want those particles

1672
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:31,079
to be as small as possible and the more

1673
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:32,940
current you've got flowing the larger

1674
01:09:31,079 --> 01:09:34,619
those particles are going to be and so

1675
01:09:32,939 --> 01:09:36,298
they're taken up a lot better if you

1676
01:09:34,619 --> 01:09:38,759
take your time and let it go say

1677
01:09:36,298 --> 01:09:42,600
overnight rather than you know a few

1678
01:09:38,759 --> 01:09:44,399
hours with a a bunch of batteries

1679
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:47,579
um I find I have found much better

1680
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:50,818
effect uh in material that doesn't like

1681
01:09:47,579 --> 01:09:53,219
to do that like mom does not like to to

1682
01:09:50,819 --> 01:09:55,980
change sex even with the silver it's

1683
01:09:53,219 --> 01:09:57,779
very hard to get her to do it did it

1684
01:09:55,979 --> 01:10:01,259
much more readily with a smaller

1685
01:09:57,779 --> 01:10:03,738
molecule than a than a larger one but I

1686
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:06,079
use those kind of things in my own work

1687
01:10:03,738 --> 01:10:08,218
uh only to

1688
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:12,179
highlight certain

1689
01:10:08,219 --> 01:10:14,880
certain traits in a certain particular

1690
01:10:12,179 --> 01:10:18,060
um project per se it's not something

1691
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:19,980
that I normally do but I will do it in

1692
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:22,500
this instance but I want everybody to be

1693
01:10:19,979 --> 01:10:25,079
aware in States like less to use

1694
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:25,979
California as example I couldn't take

1695
01:10:25,079 --> 01:10:29,519
that

1696
01:10:25,979 --> 01:10:32,339
let's say I used a mom and old Mendo

1697
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:35,340
Hayes female that that I went ahead and

1698
01:10:32,340 --> 01:10:37,980
forced and I've got females see you

1699
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:40,199
can't enter that into the uh the plant

1700
01:10:37,979 --> 01:10:42,658
realm in California because it's

1701
01:10:40,198 --> 01:10:45,678
considered a GMO

1702
01:10:42,658 --> 01:10:49,139
so uh then the state is against

1703
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:51,300
GMOs so yeah and I understand that to a

1704
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:54,060
point is

1705
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:55,679
I'm wondering if everything and this is

1706
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:57,900
something that I don't know

1707
01:10:55,679 --> 01:11:00,600
I'm wondering if everything after that

1708
01:10:57,899 --> 01:11:03,299
that you go and convert back to normal

1709
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:06,300
you know regular genetics whether that's

1710
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:09,360
all considered GMO and it in my mind it

1711
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:10,920
seemed like it would be so uh be very

1712
01:11:09,359 --> 01:11:13,198
careful of that

1713
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:16,079
um if you're producing product to go

1714
01:11:13,198 --> 01:11:18,359
into the system uh be aware of that and

1715
01:11:16,079 --> 01:11:20,158
you know they can figure it out so I

1716
01:11:18,359 --> 01:11:21,299
mean they've got smarter people than me

1717
01:11:20,158 --> 01:11:22,219
that are dealing with this stuff that's

1718
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:25,079
for sure

1719
01:11:22,219 --> 01:11:26,579
so yeah look I'd love to talk about that

1720
01:11:25,079 --> 01:11:28,380
a little bit more because in the past

1721
01:11:26,579 --> 01:11:30,179
we've had some guests on who have spoken

1722
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:32,159
notably about one company called

1723
01:11:30,179 --> 01:11:34,739
molecular Farms they won the emerald Cup

1724
01:11:32,158 --> 01:11:36,539
in I believe 2017 and I guess what's

1725
01:11:34,738 --> 01:11:37,919
interesting about their win is that

1726
01:11:36,539 --> 01:11:40,500
they've got a few well-known people

1727
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:43,020
working for them and it's never been

1728
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:45,479
confirmed but what people hypothesize is

1729
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:47,520
that these guys have used maybe crispr

1730
01:11:45,479 --> 01:11:49,079
or something like that to do what you

1731
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:50,880
said and to create a very specific

1732
01:11:49,079 --> 01:11:53,340
turret profile and the reason people

1733
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:55,920
think this is because it was the first

1734
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:59,279
sample ever tested worldwide that had

1735
01:11:55,920 --> 01:12:01,619
zero mercy and people just thought Mercy

1736
01:11:59,279 --> 01:12:02,759
is one of the base terpenes people just

1737
01:12:01,619 --> 01:12:04,920
sort of thought it has to be and

1738
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:06,480
everything to an extent would you agree

1739
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:07,619
with that that if it's not there they

1740
01:12:06,479 --> 01:12:11,539
probably did do something on the

1741
01:12:07,619 --> 01:12:11,539
molecular level or not necessarily

1742
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:18,119
oh you know Nature's pretty freaky you

1743
01:12:15,779 --> 01:12:21,119
know you can come up with some really

1744
01:12:18,119 --> 01:12:23,698
interesting phenotypes that you know I I

1745
01:12:21,119 --> 01:12:27,300
I I can see something naturally skipping

1746
01:12:23,698 --> 01:12:30,139
a component uh whether

1747
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:32,699
they did that

1748
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:34,860
there's no way to tell I mean there's

1749
01:12:32,698 --> 01:12:36,779
really no way for me to tell I mean I

1750
01:12:34,859 --> 01:12:38,158
can't sit here and say well sure they

1751
01:12:36,779 --> 01:12:42,119
did that that's the only way that could

1752
01:12:38,158 --> 01:12:44,579
happen because no that's not true uh but

1753
01:12:42,119 --> 01:12:48,539
by the same token yeah it does seem a

1754
01:12:44,579 --> 01:12:51,719
little suspicious I have to say that but

1755
01:12:48,539 --> 01:12:54,179
beyond that what they should just be

1756
01:12:51,719 --> 01:12:56,939
quizzed on their methodology and finding

1757
01:12:54,179 --> 01:12:59,819
out you know how how it is that they

1758
01:12:56,939 --> 01:13:01,919
specifically did that if it's a trade

1759
01:12:59,819 --> 01:13:04,500
secret that only muddies the waters more

1760
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:06,779
doesn't it that's exactly the opposite

1761
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:09,060
of what I'm doing here exactly the

1762
01:13:06,779 --> 01:13:11,099
opposite and I'll tell you right now if

1763
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:13,500
you take like you know some of the

1764
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:15,000
hybrids that and and you that I made and

1765
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:17,460
you put them up against something that's

1766
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:19,920
been designed turquoise I bet you

1767
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:22,679
they're damn close just from selective

1768
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:26,158
breeding I'll bet you they're damn close

1769
01:13:22,679 --> 01:13:28,380
yeah so I you know I I think you can do

1770
01:13:26,158 --> 01:13:31,738
the lessons for that is I think you can

1771
01:13:28,380 --> 01:13:34,140
do it the natural right way you just

1772
01:13:31,738 --> 01:13:37,678
need to invest the time effort and and

1773
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:39,300
be as picky as all hell yeah I think

1774
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:41,699
that's the other like sort of

1775
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:43,679
alternative Theory I guess the follow-up

1776
01:13:41,698 --> 01:13:45,539
question to that is let's say that they

1777
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:49,020
had made some sort of genetically

1778
01:13:45,539 --> 01:13:51,479
modified line like that on face value

1779
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:53,520
you might sort of think well who cares

1780
01:13:51,479 --> 01:13:55,738
um but people have raised their concerns

1781
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:57,960
that what if there was the potential for

1782
01:13:55,738 --> 01:13:59,879
this to sort of be like

1783
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:01,980
um like The Strain Hunters thing where

1784
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:03,179
like this plant pollinates other plants

1785
01:14:01,979 --> 01:14:05,099
and then all of a sudden plants are

1786
01:14:03,179 --> 01:14:06,239
losing their ability to express mercy

1787
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:09,300
and do you think that's a reasonable

1788
01:14:06,238 --> 01:14:12,899
fear or it's maybe a bit far-fetched why

1789
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:14,699
not why not has anybody done any tests

1790
01:14:12,899 --> 01:14:16,139
on these plants to see if that's a trait

1791
01:14:14,698 --> 01:14:18,178
that gets passed on or if that's

1792
01:14:16,140 --> 01:14:22,199
genetically only set in seed that's

1793
01:14:18,179 --> 01:14:24,420
developed on the F1 you know and if

1794
01:14:22,198 --> 01:14:26,639
that's you know again methadone you

1795
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:28,319
don't know their methodology that's the

1796
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:29,760
missing link to that whole thing see

1797
01:14:28,319 --> 01:14:31,859
none of these questions could be

1798
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:33,840
answered without knowing first what

1799
01:14:31,859 --> 01:14:37,019
their methodology is if they stick to

1800
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:39,600
straight selection then you know and if

1801
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:41,580
that's true then yeah it's possible you

1802
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:43,980
know it's possible anything is possible

1803
01:14:41,579 --> 01:14:46,439
I mean you you can have plants that are

1804
01:14:43,979 --> 01:14:48,899
completely devoid of chlorophyll you

1805
01:14:46,439 --> 01:14:51,178
know in nature you know I mean

1806
01:14:48,899 --> 01:14:53,819
that's chlorophyll is a natural

1807
01:14:51,179 --> 01:14:57,060
component that's always there

1808
01:14:53,819 --> 01:14:59,519
well you know that's not true

1809
01:14:57,060 --> 01:15:01,920
and then you then when you look at stuff

1810
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:03,480
like the old colchicine treatments and

1811
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:06,179
stuff I think we talked about that last

1812
01:15:03,479 --> 01:15:08,639
time where you know you're stopping the

1813
01:15:06,179 --> 01:15:10,679
the division at the point of mitosis and

1814
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:12,780
you have double sets of chromosomes and

1815
01:15:10,679 --> 01:15:15,119
you know uh

1816
01:15:12,779 --> 01:15:17,698
all of that stuff nature takes care of

1817
01:15:15,119 --> 01:15:19,979
and it it will fix that kind of thing so

1818
01:15:17,698 --> 01:15:22,439
subsequent breedings and stuff will tell

1819
01:15:19,979 --> 01:15:25,799
the tale as to whether those components

1820
01:15:22,439 --> 01:15:28,379
have been set as a trait expression or

1821
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:30,779
not and my guess is is that if it's been

1822
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:32,640
manipulated naturally without

1823
01:15:30,779 --> 01:15:35,158
intervention further it's going to come

1824
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:37,860
back into normal because the plant will

1825
01:15:35,158 --> 01:15:38,759
fix that each and eggs are a lot older

1826
01:15:37,859 --> 01:15:41,698
than we are

1827
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:43,739
you know yeah so I just wanted to

1828
01:15:41,698 --> 01:15:45,359
quickly loop back to the microbreeding

1829
01:15:43,738 --> 01:15:46,559
for two seconds because I got two

1830
01:15:45,359 --> 01:15:48,839
questions that I think will help the

1831
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:50,640
listeners a bit the first one is when

1832
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:52,199
you do your little you know your test

1833
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:55,679
selection that you just showed us

1834
01:15:52,198 --> 01:15:57,779
shortly ago are you initiating flower

1835
01:15:55,679 --> 01:16:02,039
from seed like just going straight into

1836
01:15:57,779 --> 01:16:04,679
12 12. no no generally I'm letting them

1837
01:16:02,039 --> 01:16:07,079
get a little bit bigger only because

1838
01:16:04,679 --> 01:16:08,880
um there is a

1839
01:16:07,079 --> 01:16:11,158
a period

1840
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:13,079
that I believe and I don't know if this

1841
01:16:11,158 --> 01:16:15,000
is fact or not but it seems to be the

1842
01:16:13,079 --> 01:16:17,579
case with what many of the things I've

1843
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:19,619
made over the years is that plants

1844
01:16:17,579 --> 01:16:22,198
really need to be about two months old

1845
01:16:19,619 --> 01:16:25,260
in order to be able to fully express

1846
01:16:22,198 --> 01:16:27,000
everything that they're going to do but

1847
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:30,360
the ones that like the ones I showed you

1848
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:33,000
there they were just put into this into

1849
01:16:30,359 --> 01:16:35,219
the grouping and they had about a week's

1850
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:36,479
worth of growth and then they went into

1851
01:16:35,219 --> 01:16:39,179
flower

1852
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:41,698
um and that was just natural flowering a

1853
01:16:39,179 --> 01:16:43,440
lot of times it's done in a more

1854
01:16:41,698 --> 01:16:45,419
controlled environment

1855
01:16:43,439 --> 01:16:48,019
these little tests like this are really

1856
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:51,300
more just to see what's there and not to

1857
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:54,000
for real work like that one was just a

1858
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:55,980
very super small example of what it

1859
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,779
would normally be normally they'd be

1860
01:16:55,979 --> 01:17:00,178
large trays

1861
01:16:57,779 --> 01:17:01,679
all under artificial lights that can be

1862
01:17:00,179 --> 01:17:06,119
controlled with

1863
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:08,399
soil only uh and and cow [ __ ] no uh I

1864
01:17:06,119 --> 01:17:10,619
don't I don't like to use any uh

1865
01:17:08,399 --> 01:17:13,559
chemicals and I'll tell you why

1866
01:17:10,619 --> 01:17:15,300
um it changes the expression and I can't

1867
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:18,060
tell what the plants genetically is

1868
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:19,619
doing if I'm changing its expression it

1869
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:21,239
goes back to the environment you know

1870
01:17:19,619 --> 01:17:24,960
the environment affects everything you

1871
01:17:21,238 --> 01:17:27,238
do so when I'm looking for trade

1872
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:29,460
expression I want to be as basic as

1873
01:17:27,238 --> 01:17:31,139
possible and generic as possible

1874
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:32,520
everything gets the same light

1875
01:17:31,140 --> 01:17:34,980
everything gets the same water

1876
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:38,540
everything gets the same soil and air

1877
01:17:34,979 --> 01:17:42,718
okay show me what you have so that's

1878
01:17:38,539 --> 01:17:45,658
what I use and how I do it and

1879
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:47,520
I urge breeders when they're if they're

1880
01:17:45,658 --> 01:17:49,500
doing breeding and they're doing testing

1881
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:52,140
use pots

1882
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:54,539
you have to use pots you can't put them

1883
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:57,000
in the soil because there's too much

1884
01:17:54,539 --> 01:17:58,140
variable you can't put it in Hydroponics

1885
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,000
because then all of a sudden you're

1886
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:02,000
manipulating the environment beyond what

1887
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,939
it's naturally going to be you're not

1888
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:07,439
witnessing uptake correctly you're not

1889
01:18:04,939 --> 01:18:11,519
metabolizing correctly all these things

1890
01:18:07,439 --> 01:18:13,979
are changed so in pots with soil and cow

1891
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:16,560
[ __ ] tell you everything you need to

1892
01:18:13,979 --> 01:18:19,319
know for a test of the genetics and I

1893
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:24,380
really urge breeders to do that for a

1894
01:18:19,319 --> 01:18:26,579
number of reasons one you know pots

1895
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:28,859
you can go ahead and move if there's a

1896
01:18:26,579 --> 01:18:30,899
if there's a a let's say a rain event

1897
01:18:28,859 --> 01:18:34,079
outside and you're right in the last

1898
01:18:30,899 --> 01:18:35,579
throes of it you can move the pods if

1899
01:18:34,079 --> 01:18:37,380
they're in the ground you can't move

1900
01:18:35,579 --> 01:18:39,960
them you can only cover them covering

1901
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:43,859
them changes things you know it creates

1902
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:46,560
molds and possible powdery mildew and it

1903
01:18:43,859 --> 01:18:48,179
invites you know more things to live

1904
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:50,820
underneath it and be protected with the

1905
01:18:48,179 --> 01:18:54,000
plants and so that's all of that stuff

1906
01:18:50,819 --> 01:18:55,920
is affected by it so if you put them in

1907
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,359
pots and you put them everything gets

1908
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:59,279
the same treatment if they have to go

1909
01:18:57,359 --> 01:19:01,859
inside because of a weather event they

1910
01:18:59,279 --> 01:19:03,840
all go in together and so everything's

1911
01:19:01,859 --> 01:19:06,119
experiencing the same thing and you're

1912
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:08,159
going to get the truest expression and

1913
01:19:06,119 --> 01:19:09,840
know exactly what you're getting

1914
01:19:08,158 --> 01:19:11,519
naturally

1915
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:14,219
that you can do your work from from

1916
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:16,860
there and that's how I do it

1917
01:19:14,219 --> 01:19:19,679
and when you find something that excites

1918
01:19:16,859 --> 01:19:21,599
you and passes the tests do you try to

1919
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:23,340
re-vege it or you just pop more seeds

1920
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:25,980
and start from there

1921
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:29,039
no I Revenge that plan

1922
01:19:25,979 --> 01:19:30,539
no I I don't need to pop more seeds I

1923
01:19:29,039 --> 01:19:32,279
already I've already done that and I've

1924
01:19:30,539 --> 01:19:34,380
already seen a spread I've already made

1925
01:19:32,279 --> 01:19:37,019
it to selection now I want to see what

1926
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:39,179
that plant is going to do in the next

1927
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:41,340
phase which is production you know

1928
01:19:39,179 --> 01:19:43,920
full-size plant what it structures like

1929
01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:47,279
how it responds to different stimuli so

1930
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:50,279
I won't I'll take I'll revege that I'll

1931
01:19:47,279 --> 01:19:52,619
grow a number of the same plants and

1932
01:19:50,279 --> 01:19:55,679
then they go under different

1933
01:19:52,619 --> 01:19:58,319
sets of growing methods so that I can

1934
01:19:55,679 --> 01:20:00,359
see which one is Optimum and what they

1935
01:19:58,319 --> 01:20:02,639
do under each set that way I can speak

1936
01:20:00,359 --> 01:20:05,639
to you intelligently when you ask me a

1937
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:08,100
question about X doing this with this

1938
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:10,679
what's going to happen here's what's

1939
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:13,440
going to happen under that scenario and

1940
01:20:10,679 --> 01:20:14,880
I can speak intelligently about it if

1941
01:20:13,439 --> 01:20:18,658
you're not doing that as a breeder

1942
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:22,020
you're disservicing your clientele and

1943
01:20:18,658 --> 01:20:23,698
people on the seed buying end need to

1944
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:26,340
demand more of their breeders they need

1945
01:20:23,698 --> 01:20:28,799
to demand more accountability because

1946
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:31,260
there's too many genetics out there that

1947
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:33,360
are trash genetics that show Hermes in

1948
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:36,199
the second and third generations and

1949
01:20:33,359 --> 01:20:39,779
they just bomb uh or they pass on

1950
01:20:36,198 --> 01:20:41,219
horrible traits uh it just goes on and

1951
01:20:39,779 --> 01:20:42,719
on I think I can sit here and listen

1952
01:20:41,219 --> 01:20:45,480
[ __ ] all day long and I'm not going to

1953
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:48,179
do that we need to get past that and

1954
01:20:45,479 --> 01:20:51,359
that's up to you as a breeder

1955
01:20:48,179 --> 01:20:53,279
to correct and do deal with and the ones

1956
01:20:51,359 --> 01:20:55,559
and everybody says oh well I can't do

1957
01:20:53,279 --> 01:20:57,359
that look at how many look at your

1958
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:59,159
competition look at how many people

1959
01:20:57,359 --> 01:21:02,819
you're dealing with out there now as

1960
01:20:59,158 --> 01:21:05,939
seed breeders that I look think about me

1961
01:21:02,819 --> 01:21:09,059
I have been all of my life dealing with

1962
01:21:05,939 --> 01:21:12,539
an increasingly growing number of people

1963
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:15,900
getting into this business that I love

1964
01:21:12,539 --> 01:21:18,238
so much and muddying the waters so

1965
01:21:15,899 --> 01:21:19,738
thoroughly and I'm seeing it happen and

1966
01:21:18,238 --> 01:21:22,500
they're making money hand over fish

1967
01:21:19,738 --> 01:21:24,539
while I'm sitting there trying to do the

1968
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:27,658
right thing then it comes back to bite

1969
01:21:24,539 --> 01:21:29,279
them in the ass and I I don't know how

1970
01:21:27,658 --> 01:21:32,639
many times there's been great seed

1971
01:21:29,279 --> 01:21:34,738
companies they're gone now see ya

1972
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:37,560
look how long I've been around and

1973
01:21:34,738 --> 01:21:40,139
there's a reason is I'm thinking faster

1974
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:42,900
that's why that's why I'm still here

1975
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:46,560
because I'm a picky bastard I'm an old

1976
01:21:42,899 --> 01:21:49,079
crotchety [ __ ] and I like to think I

1977
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:51,659
know what I've experienced in life is

1978
01:21:49,079 --> 01:21:54,779
the right thing look you got my backing

1979
01:21:51,658 --> 01:21:57,839
just as a quick follow-up re-veging is

1980
01:21:54,779 --> 01:22:00,300
still a conversation and a subject area

1981
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:02,579
which is surprisingly

1982
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:04,199
um sparse with information I would love

1983
01:22:02,579 --> 01:22:05,880
to hear do you have any tips or tricks

1984
01:22:04,198 --> 01:22:08,579
for our listeners about how you read it

1985
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:10,739
yeah reventing is simple revenging is

1986
01:22:08,579 --> 01:22:13,019
absolutely simple the problem that

1987
01:22:10,738 --> 01:22:16,139
people do with reveging is they don't

1988
01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:17,940
leave enough material on the plant they

1989
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:20,940
don't leave enough material

1990
01:22:17,939 --> 01:22:22,799
give if it's a special plant is that

1991
01:22:20,939 --> 01:22:24,899
little bitty bud that's down there on

1992
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:26,699
the bottom worth anything to you as far

1993
01:22:24,899 --> 01:22:29,279
as in a bowl where it's going to be gone

1994
01:22:26,698 --> 01:22:31,319
or is it going to be worth it to you to

1995
01:22:29,279 --> 01:22:34,559
re-vege it and have the plants spring

1996
01:22:31,319 --> 01:22:37,559
from that which I will post some I'll

1997
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:40,320
have some pictures of of a few things

1998
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:42,840
that I've reveged throughout the year uh

1999
01:22:40,319 --> 01:22:44,939
that I can show what the effect is with

2000
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:48,719
the plant and I will post those up on

2001
01:22:44,939 --> 01:22:51,658
Instagram uh to show people how stuff

2002
01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:54,420
looks when it's it's done and what I do

2003
01:22:51,658 --> 01:22:56,460
is I normally reap

2004
01:22:54,420 --> 01:22:58,199
I dig up the plant if it's in the ground

2005
01:22:56,460 --> 01:23:00,480
if I have a ground plant and I want to

2006
01:22:58,198 --> 01:23:02,819
keep it I dig it up and I give it some

2007
01:23:00,479 --> 01:23:05,519
B1 and I put new soil around it and I

2008
01:23:02,819 --> 01:23:07,319
water the [ __ ] out of it and I leave

2009
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:09,420
enough green on there for it and then I

2010
01:23:07,319 --> 01:23:10,979
move it inside under 20 hours minimum of

2011
01:23:09,420 --> 01:23:14,100
life

2012
01:23:10,979 --> 01:23:16,439
and I don't like to use uh high

2013
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:18,719
intensity discharge lights for this I

2014
01:23:16,439 --> 01:23:20,819
like to use cool white fluorescent bulbs

2015
01:23:18,719 --> 01:23:22,020
and there's a reason for that it's 70

2016
01:23:20,819 --> 01:23:26,698
percent

2017
01:23:22,020 --> 01:23:28,320
uh blue 30 red and it produces you've

2018
01:23:26,698 --> 01:23:30,178
already got a root system so it doesn't

2019
01:23:28,319 --> 01:23:33,059
need the red so much it needs the blue

2020
01:23:30,179 --> 01:23:34,980
to be able to Leaf out and it those will

2021
01:23:33,060 --> 01:23:36,900
happen much faster because they don't

2022
01:23:34,979 --> 01:23:40,139
produce a lot of heat so you can have

2023
01:23:36,899 --> 01:23:42,299
the plants close to it and just go for

2024
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:43,739
it and you put it under 20 hours of

2025
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:45,719
light minimum

2026
01:23:43,738 --> 01:23:48,779
and we'll get to that in a second

2027
01:23:45,719 --> 01:23:49,560
because like gooey is a real problem

2028
01:23:48,779 --> 01:23:51,719
um

2029
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:56,159
gooey was under

2030
01:23:51,719 --> 01:23:58,319
24 hours of light for decades and so

2031
01:23:56,158 --> 01:24:01,379
anytime now you drop gooey anything

2032
01:23:58,319 --> 01:24:04,380
below without working it and really

2033
01:24:01,380 --> 01:24:06,239
being very careful and letting it go

2034
01:24:04,380 --> 01:24:09,119
down in increments that are very small

2035
01:24:06,238 --> 01:24:12,000
uh she'll just flower boom because she's

2036
01:24:09,119 --> 01:24:14,579
38 years old she's tired it's time is it

2037
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:16,560
is it time to flower now that's that's

2038
01:24:14,579 --> 01:24:18,719
what she's thinking all the time so

2039
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:20,340
there's a there's a I always tell people

2040
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:24,060
that because when you're re-veging and

2041
01:24:20,340 --> 01:24:26,279
you're using a 24 or a 20 hour at some

2042
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:28,500
point you want to work it back to a

2043
01:24:26,279 --> 01:24:30,539
normal life cycle that you can then move

2044
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:33,238
a plant outside if you want to without

2045
01:24:30,539 --> 01:24:34,439
it going off and flowering right away so

2046
01:24:33,238 --> 01:24:37,079
there's something stuff to think about

2047
01:24:34,439 --> 01:24:39,419
when you're doing re-veging but that's

2048
01:24:37,079 --> 01:24:42,119
the fastest way to revege a plant is

2049
01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:44,100
just to do exactly what I said little B1

2050
01:24:42,119 --> 01:24:45,658
a little nitrogen you want to give a

2051
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:48,900
little nitrogen you know if you want to

2052
01:24:45,658 --> 01:24:51,238
I I just use ammonium nitrate and just

2053
01:24:48,899 --> 01:24:54,119
go ahead and I just water a little bit

2054
01:24:51,238 --> 01:24:55,500
of that in because everything else is in

2055
01:24:54,119 --> 01:24:56,599
the fresh soil that it's going to need

2056
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:58,859
for

2057
01:24:56,600 --> 01:25:01,380
regenerating you just want to promote

2058
01:24:58,859 --> 01:25:02,939
that leaf growth and get it going so I

2059
01:25:01,380 --> 01:25:05,400
will post up pictures of that that show

2060
01:25:02,939 --> 01:25:09,539
just how easy that is and you can do it

2061
01:25:05,399 --> 01:25:11,819
at any stage I have saved gooey once

2062
01:25:09,539 --> 01:25:13,679
by I had harvested plants and not

2063
01:25:11,819 --> 01:25:16,500
realized that I didn't have any gooey

2064
01:25:13,679 --> 01:25:19,739
mom left and I just had Buds and I took

2065
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:21,979
a bud and I cut it and I put it in under

2066
01:25:19,738 --> 01:25:24,419
the 24 hour light in a glass of water

2067
01:25:21,979 --> 01:25:27,238
and I kept changing the water and doing

2068
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:29,760
it and I regenerated that bud and got

2069
01:25:27,238 --> 01:25:32,698
gooey mom back after you know almost

2070
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:35,460
losing her one year early way early on

2071
01:25:32,698 --> 01:25:37,259
so you can do anything with this stuff

2072
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:41,460
it just

2073
01:25:37,260 --> 01:25:43,500
takes diligence and vigilance and a

2074
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:45,539
little bit of love and caring and just

2075
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:46,979
giving at the plant What It Wants in

2076
01:25:45,539 --> 01:25:50,039
order for because the plant wants to

2077
01:25:46,979 --> 01:25:51,899
live trust me it doesn't want to die

2078
01:25:50,039 --> 01:25:53,819
you know so it's going to try and do

2079
01:25:51,899 --> 01:25:55,319
everything you can to live so all you

2080
01:25:53,819 --> 01:25:57,960
just got to do is make that happen and

2081
01:25:55,319 --> 01:26:01,259
that's the best way to do it that's an

2082
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:03,420
incredible story I've got to ask gooey

2083
01:26:01,260 --> 01:26:05,579
might be the oldest clone in terms of

2084
01:26:03,420 --> 01:26:08,460
like it's it's actual age that I'm aware

2085
01:26:05,579 --> 01:26:10,260
of in all those years have people people

2086
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:12,179
sometimes talk about like plants

2087
01:26:10,260 --> 01:26:13,860
deteriorating over time have you ever

2088
01:26:12,179 --> 01:26:18,300
seen anything like that

2089
01:26:13,859 --> 01:26:21,359
no and I I I've talked about this before

2090
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:23,400
um I don't believe that you can live

2091
01:26:21,359 --> 01:26:27,238
long enough to experience degration and

2092
01:26:23,399 --> 01:26:29,158
genetics uh from environmental uh I I

2093
01:26:27,238 --> 01:26:31,678
just don't believe that that's I've

2094
01:26:29,158 --> 01:26:34,799
never seen that what I have always seen

2095
01:26:31,679 --> 01:26:38,819
and what I do believe happens is micro

2096
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:42,179
climates affecting expression and people

2097
01:26:38,819 --> 01:26:43,859
are noticing those differences the soil

2098
01:26:42,179 --> 01:26:45,239
may be different the air may be

2099
01:26:43,859 --> 01:26:47,698
different the

2100
01:26:45,238 --> 01:26:50,099
um uh more moisture less moist you know

2101
01:26:47,698 --> 01:26:52,738
if you just got too moist of a of an

2102
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:55,020
environment resin is suppressed you know

2103
01:26:52,738 --> 01:26:56,638
you because the plant doesn't want to

2104
01:26:55,020 --> 01:27:00,360
mold so it's going to try and increase

2105
01:26:56,639 --> 01:27:01,619
air flow think of everything in terms of

2106
01:27:00,359 --> 01:27:04,559
what the plant

2107
01:27:01,619 --> 01:27:07,800
is trying to do and the plant is always

2108
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:09,600
trying to reproduce that's its thing and

2109
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:13,380
it wants to make as many of the little

2110
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:15,239
babies as it can and so you know

2111
01:27:13,380 --> 01:27:20,219
everything goes back to that it really

2112
01:27:15,238 --> 01:27:22,619
does and it so degration of genetics uh

2113
01:27:20,219 --> 01:27:25,260
most people are are of the common belief

2114
01:27:22,619 --> 01:27:27,840
that uh radiation you know is what

2115
01:27:25,260 --> 01:27:30,840
degrades genetics over a period of time

2116
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:32,639
uh that and the the ends of the

2117
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:34,980
chromosomes of course becoming small

2118
01:27:32,639 --> 01:27:37,920
well

2119
01:27:34,979 --> 01:27:43,019
when you take a cutting of a plant

2120
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:46,560
it's as old as that plant is

2121
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:49,020
in what the plant knows its life and I

2122
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:51,659
always tell people like gooey gooey just

2123
01:27:49,020 --> 01:27:54,900
thinks it's been one long day

2124
01:27:51,658 --> 01:27:57,719
and so I can take gooey and I can grow

2125
01:27:54,899 --> 01:28:00,779
her in any different of these different

2126
01:27:57,719 --> 01:28:04,198
scenarios and reproduce exactly what I

2127
01:28:00,779 --> 01:28:06,779
got all those years ago with the right

2128
01:28:04,198 --> 01:28:11,119
environment now I've always said my

2129
01:28:06,779 --> 01:28:15,539
favorite GUI is rock wool slabs General

2130
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:18,000
hydropolics nutrients under a high of a

2131
01:28:15,539 --> 01:28:21,000
metal halide like that's the favorite

2132
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:23,819
flavor and favorite expression that I

2133
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:25,920
like of the mom GUI and other

2134
01:28:23,819 --> 01:28:27,920
Expressions come out and they would they

2135
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:30,359
may be deemed as genetic

2136
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:33,600
degrations you know because they're not

2137
01:28:30,359 --> 01:28:36,420
Optimum for what you know that

2138
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:38,639
Target is you know and so that's what

2139
01:28:36,420 --> 01:28:41,158
people are experiencing I think you'd

2140
01:28:38,639 --> 01:28:44,039
have to live several hundred years

2141
01:28:41,158 --> 01:28:47,039
with the and you know there are tomatoes

2142
01:28:44,039 --> 01:28:49,560
let's say back from Roman times that are

2143
01:28:47,039 --> 01:28:52,319
still this is hundred and

2144
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:54,060
forty-year-old tomato plants uh that

2145
01:28:52,319 --> 01:28:56,399
have been kept alive and have been doing

2146
01:28:54,060 --> 01:28:58,800
for a very long time not Roman times but

2147
01:28:56,399 --> 01:29:01,619
they come from Roman genetics

2148
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:04,139
um Roman apples as they were called

2149
01:29:01,619 --> 01:29:07,439
um that you know they haven't degraded

2150
01:29:04,139 --> 01:29:08,460
and they're those those stocks are 140

2151
01:29:07,439 --> 01:29:13,259
years old

2152
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:15,840
so uh this this uh

2153
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:19,199
this notion I I think is

2154
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:21,600
I think a lot of times it can be

2155
01:29:19,198 --> 01:29:25,799
um something that explains poor breeding

2156
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:29,460
and and mass for breeding uh it masks

2157
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:32,100
poor growing it masks changes all these

2158
01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:34,020
different things are what people are I

2159
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:36,440
believe truly experiencing and they're

2160
01:29:34,020 --> 01:29:39,179
not experiencing genetic degration

2161
01:29:36,439 --> 01:29:41,519
yeah that's that's very interesting to

2162
01:29:39,179 --> 01:29:43,020
hear and I mean you spoke about making

2163
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:44,880
some babies in there I just wanted to

2164
01:29:43,020 --> 01:29:46,980
loop back for a moment you you actually

2165
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:49,199
mentioned you were making some feminized

2166
01:29:46,979 --> 01:29:51,119
seeds and you got me curious what was it

2167
01:29:49,198 --> 01:29:53,460
that stimulated you to look into this a

2168
01:29:51,119 --> 01:29:56,639
bit more than you had in the past

2169
01:29:53,460 --> 01:29:59,520
well it's it's only my own it's strictly

2170
01:29:56,639 --> 01:30:03,779
really from my own views I would give

2171
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:07,380
whatever I have left over away and one

2172
01:30:03,779 --> 01:30:10,800
of the things that uh I did notice is

2173
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:13,679
that I think I introduced a plant that I

2174
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:17,100
hadn't rinsed fully and let kept

2175
01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:19,319
segregated enough before it shed some

2176
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:22,860
other pollen that was actually the

2177
01:30:19,319 --> 01:30:25,139
father of the black Raptor uh got into

2178
01:30:22,859 --> 01:30:27,238
that mix and so I would never ever sell

2179
01:30:25,139 --> 01:30:29,460
those seeds as a result because you may

2180
01:30:27,238 --> 01:30:32,099
get a purple male out of there that you

2181
01:30:29,460 --> 01:30:34,500
know or or a purple female that that

2182
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:36,480
doesn't belong in that set and uh

2183
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:39,600
otherwise

2184
01:30:36,479 --> 01:30:43,619
the reason I made that is basically to

2185
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:46,500
Target certain traits which

2186
01:30:43,619 --> 01:30:51,479
worked out wonderfully that I can do

2187
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:55,619
some specific work with Mom

2188
01:30:51,479 --> 01:30:57,119
um dark desire and old Mendo Haze for

2189
01:30:55,619 --> 01:31:00,539
some refinement

2190
01:30:57,119 --> 01:31:02,698
portions of some very targeted aspects

2191
01:31:00,539 --> 01:31:04,079
of the traits that I want to see for

2192
01:31:02,698 --> 01:31:06,599
those lines and then I'm going to go

2193
01:31:04,079 --> 01:31:10,198
back and turn them back into regular

2194
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:12,600
seed and those I will make available to

2195
01:31:10,198 --> 01:31:15,198
folks to use but they will have very

2196
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:17,300
much highlighted traits that the people

2197
01:31:15,198 --> 01:31:20,219
really kind of

2198
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:23,340
concentrate on when they experience them

2199
01:31:20,219 --> 01:31:28,920
the most I want to bring those out even

2200
01:31:23,340 --> 01:31:32,100
more and this is just a cheat sheet fast

2201
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:34,260
way of genetically doing that is it's a

2202
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:35,820
cheaters way of of doing it and it

2203
01:31:34,260 --> 01:31:38,340
doesn't hurt anything it doesn't color

2204
01:31:35,819 --> 01:31:40,380
any genetics it doesn't it's just a fast

2205
01:31:38,340 --> 01:31:41,760
cheating way of eliminating half the

2206
01:31:40,380 --> 01:31:43,859
gene pool so that I don't have to deal

2207
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:45,539
with it my internet connection is

2208
01:31:43,859 --> 01:31:48,599
unstable it says I wonder what's going

2209
01:31:45,539 --> 01:31:50,760
on yeah I could still hear you great so

2210
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:52,860
so that's that's good to know I was

2211
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:53,880
interested in asking you you obviously

2212
01:31:52,859 --> 01:31:55,859
mentioned how you make your own

2213
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:58,679
colloidal silver solution have you ever

2214
01:31:55,859 --> 01:32:00,539
trialled STS so any preferences or it's

2215
01:31:58,679 --> 01:32:02,760
just what you chosen it works

2216
01:32:00,539 --> 01:32:04,500
no it's just because I could do it

2217
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:06,300
myself and I didn't have to deal with

2218
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:08,279
anything so that it was just the

2219
01:32:06,300 --> 01:32:09,960
quickest way that I can again I'm a

2220
01:32:08,279 --> 01:32:12,779
control freak as far as that goes I want

2221
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:15,300
to be able to be in control of all that

2222
01:32:12,779 --> 01:32:17,759
and that's just the easiest fastest one

2223
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:19,020
to use to come up with this and it

2224
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:21,239
doesn't genetically shift anything

2225
01:32:19,020 --> 01:32:22,980
people have said that it genetically

2226
01:32:21,238 --> 01:32:25,019
shifts things I think that what they're

2227
01:32:22,979 --> 01:32:27,178
seeing is recesses that are being made

2228
01:32:25,020 --> 01:32:29,520
dominant by

2229
01:32:27,179 --> 01:32:32,039
um introducing the gene sets that are

2230
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:35,219
available to the plant and a recessive

2231
01:32:32,039 --> 01:32:37,260
and recessive or are mixing in to become

2232
01:32:35,219 --> 01:32:39,179
a dominant and one of those dominants is

2233
01:32:37,260 --> 01:32:40,320
pornographism so you know I think that

2234
01:32:39,179 --> 01:32:42,960
that's what they're seeing is

2235
01:32:40,319 --> 01:32:44,759
expressions of that and they're saying

2236
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:46,859
that it's changing the genetics when no

2237
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:49,100
it's not changing the genetics because

2238
01:32:46,859 --> 01:32:51,479
the silvers are just uh

2239
01:32:49,100 --> 01:32:52,460
hormonal manipulators is all they are

2240
01:32:51,479 --> 01:32:54,839
they're they're

2241
01:32:52,460 --> 01:32:57,899
overwhelming the system the female

2242
01:32:54,840 --> 01:33:00,659
system and fooling it with a male

2243
01:32:57,899 --> 01:33:03,420
component so that it just grows male

2244
01:33:00,658 --> 01:33:05,698
so you know that's that's a simple just

2245
01:33:03,420 --> 01:33:07,880
a science thing you know it's just

2246
01:33:05,698 --> 01:33:10,259
yeah

2247
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:12,359
that's the reason I use it is just

2248
01:33:10,260 --> 01:33:14,460
because I can control it no I can

2249
01:33:12,359 --> 01:33:16,198
totally understand that one and just out

2250
01:33:14,460 --> 01:33:18,420
of curiosity when I was doing some

2251
01:33:16,198 --> 01:33:20,819
research for our discussion today I was

2252
01:33:18,420 --> 01:33:23,158
reading various Forum posts and seems

2253
01:33:20,819 --> 01:33:25,920
like people still just absolutely dying

2254
01:33:23,158 --> 01:33:28,379
to try the nor calgui themselves I'm

2255
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:30,480
wondering do you think an S1 would be

2256
01:33:28,380 --> 01:33:32,159
too recessively dominant to give them

2257
01:33:30,479 --> 01:33:34,619
that or is that something they might be

2258
01:33:32,158 --> 01:33:37,319
able to get in the future

2259
01:33:34,619 --> 01:33:40,380
you know uh just with the tests and

2260
01:33:37,319 --> 01:33:42,658
stuff I still find that it fragments uh

2261
01:33:40,380 --> 01:33:44,639
and it goes off into the in the in more

2262
01:33:42,658 --> 01:33:46,019
into the individuals than one would

2263
01:33:44,639 --> 01:33:48,659
think

2264
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:51,540
um I don't it's not as collective of a

2265
01:33:48,658 --> 01:33:54,479
thing the that's kind of the reason why

2266
01:33:51,539 --> 01:33:57,119
I went with the the S1 for the cubing

2267
01:33:54,479 --> 01:34:00,658
pure GUI and going back to it because I

2268
01:33:57,119 --> 01:34:03,119
can control that and and keep the mix

2269
01:34:00,658 --> 01:34:06,059
from from breaking apart

2270
01:34:03,119 --> 01:34:10,019
um and that's all just back to selection

2271
01:34:06,060 --> 01:34:12,480
so uh you know I'm working on another

2272
01:34:10,020 --> 01:34:15,960
set of of pure GUI in a different

2273
01:34:12,479 --> 01:34:18,119
fashion uh I want some aspects of it

2274
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:20,698
that I used to really love about the

2275
01:34:18,119 --> 01:34:22,260
individuals especially the Vietnamese

2276
01:34:20,698 --> 01:34:25,198
and the Thai

2277
01:34:22,260 --> 01:34:27,900
I want to bring those forward more and

2278
01:34:25,198 --> 01:34:30,359
so I've been kind of working with that

2279
01:34:27,899 --> 01:34:32,879
mindset and people have known this I've

2280
01:34:30,359 --> 01:34:36,179
been kind of leaning towards

2281
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:38,639
um a much more Far East expression than

2282
01:34:36,179 --> 01:34:41,639
I've gotten in gui's pure goodies from

2283
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:44,460
the past because they tend to you know

2284
01:34:41,639 --> 01:34:48,239
carry on some of that S1

2285
01:34:44,460 --> 01:34:51,239
um in their flavor in the Smoke uh it's

2286
01:34:48,238 --> 01:34:54,779
not bad by any means it's just not what

2287
01:34:51,238 --> 01:34:56,879
I'm tuned into getting so I'm now

2288
01:34:54,779 --> 01:34:58,380
working on a different pure GUI that it

2289
01:34:56,880 --> 01:35:00,719
might take a little longer to produce

2290
01:34:58,380 --> 01:35:04,079
but I think it's going to uh get a

2291
01:35:00,719 --> 01:35:08,158
better result and we're in the midst of

2292
01:35:04,079 --> 01:35:10,738
um a huge project here in Northern

2293
01:35:08,158 --> 01:35:13,158
California with a

2294
01:35:10,738 --> 01:35:16,198
large

2295
01:35:13,158 --> 01:35:19,259
grow legal grow operation that's coming

2296
01:35:16,198 --> 01:35:20,819
into to being and one of the aspects

2297
01:35:19,260 --> 01:35:24,119
that that's going to be is to be able to

2298
01:35:20,819 --> 01:35:25,859
open up the Exotic cuts the Exotic Cuts

2299
01:35:24,119 --> 01:35:27,539
has been something that I've been

2300
01:35:25,859 --> 01:35:29,339
telling people about for years but we've

2301
01:35:27,539 --> 01:35:32,039
been stalled because of Permitting and

2302
01:35:29,340 --> 01:35:34,679
all these other things but people will

2303
01:35:32,039 --> 01:35:37,679
actually be able to get Mom and old

2304
01:35:34,679 --> 01:35:40,800
Mendo Hayes and dark desire and all of

2305
01:35:37,679 --> 01:35:42,539
the stuff that I've been working on and

2306
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:45,539
that were are

2307
01:35:42,539 --> 01:35:48,359
the classics of my lines they will be

2308
01:35:45,539 --> 01:35:51,238
able to get those plants when that opens

2309
01:35:48,359 --> 01:35:52,799
up so we're actively we're we're just

2310
01:35:51,238 --> 01:35:55,198
waiting on

2311
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:58,139
the counties to do their thing and get

2312
01:35:55,198 --> 01:36:00,539
us open because I have a tendency to

2313
01:35:58,139 --> 01:36:03,300
believe that what I want to do is uh

2314
01:36:00,539 --> 01:36:05,819
offer those genetics to both home

2315
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:08,760
Growers and to professionals to be able

2316
01:36:05,819 --> 01:36:10,979
to uh use in their arsenals of growing

2317
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:13,199
and so that everybody's going to be able

2318
01:36:10,979 --> 01:36:16,198
to have a chance to experience by that

2319
01:36:13,198 --> 01:36:18,899
time maybe a 40-year 40 year old plant

2320
01:36:16,198 --> 01:36:21,178
yeah I did the math and I was like I

2321
01:36:18,899 --> 01:36:23,879
think sometime next late next year might

2322
01:36:21,179 --> 01:36:27,079
be the 40-year Mark is that right

2323
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:29,579
yeah it's no uh it will be let's see

2324
01:36:27,079 --> 01:36:33,359
this this

2325
01:36:29,579 --> 01:36:35,698
right around this time right now uh it's

2326
01:36:33,359 --> 01:36:39,539
going it was 38 years

2327
01:36:35,698 --> 01:36:42,178
and so it's about two more years to go I

2328
01:36:39,539 --> 01:36:44,939
would say before it gets to 40 but it's

2329
01:36:42,179 --> 01:36:48,840
uh it's been a amazing journey with her

2330
01:36:44,939 --> 01:36:51,479
I I just love that plant I really do I

2331
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:55,199
just love it because it's so

2332
01:36:51,479 --> 01:36:57,539
versatile uh the only thing that I would

2333
01:36:55,198 --> 01:37:00,839
say that I don't like about it is that

2334
01:36:57,539 --> 01:37:03,899
it's so thick and it's so heavy

2335
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:07,020
producing and the leaves kind of tend to

2336
01:37:03,899 --> 01:37:08,579
be easy to exaggerate if you feed just a

2337
01:37:07,020 --> 01:37:11,280
little bit too much nitrogen you'll get

2338
01:37:08,579 --> 01:37:14,658
a lot of heavy uh heavier than normal

2339
01:37:11,279 --> 01:37:18,119
Leaf growth uh in in some of the flowers

2340
01:37:14,658 --> 01:37:22,738
but everything everything I've seen 13

2341
01:37:18,119 --> 01:37:26,039
foot talls plants that have coal is this

2342
01:37:22,738 --> 01:37:30,238
big on top and they're as big as your

2343
01:37:26,039 --> 01:37:32,279
leg and thigh on the bottom just huge

2344
01:37:30,238 --> 01:37:35,039
buds just huge

2345
01:37:32,279 --> 01:37:36,479
a lot of Growers don't like that they

2346
01:37:35,039 --> 01:37:38,880
don't want that

2347
01:37:36,479 --> 01:37:41,519
it's too much work it's too much it's

2348
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:43,199
it's uh there's too much trimming to

2349
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:45,600
deal with and all that stuff and these

2350
01:37:43,198 --> 01:37:49,198
are the kind of things that you know the

2351
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:51,300
public would love to have it but it's

2352
01:37:49,198 --> 01:37:54,359
maybe not perfectly practical for an

2353
01:37:51,300 --> 01:37:55,560
industrial setting so you know I kind of

2354
01:37:54,359 --> 01:37:58,579
tend to think gooey is going to be

2355
01:37:55,560 --> 01:38:01,380
situated as a homegrown

2356
01:37:58,579 --> 01:38:03,000
plant that I think people can just enjoy

2357
01:38:01,380 --> 01:38:05,100
and we're gonna we're probably gonna

2358
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:09,539
Market it towards that you know to where

2359
01:38:05,100 --> 01:38:11,820
the home user and the small plant grower

2360
01:38:09,539 --> 01:38:14,399
you know maximizes their benefit by

2361
01:38:11,819 --> 01:38:15,899
getting that and then it's always gravy

2362
01:38:14,399 --> 01:38:17,819
on the top to have something that old

2363
01:38:15,899 --> 01:38:20,638
and spin around and you've heard about

2364
01:38:17,819 --> 01:38:22,559
and seen and and you've you know only

2365
01:38:20,639 --> 01:38:24,659
wish you could try I want that for

2366
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:27,000
everybody I really do even if I have to

2367
01:38:24,658 --> 01:38:30,119
do it for free I want it for everybody

2368
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:32,039
somehow yeah look you're you're a mind

2369
01:38:30,119 --> 01:38:33,539
reader when you brought up the Exotic

2370
01:38:32,039 --> 01:38:35,100
Cuts program I was going to ask you

2371
01:38:33,539 --> 01:38:37,079
about that but you did it for me but the

2372
01:38:35,100 --> 01:38:39,120
follow-up I had for that is we see

2373
01:38:37,079 --> 01:38:41,519
recently breeders are commonly

2374
01:38:39,119 --> 01:38:44,880
partnering up with uh bigger facilities

2375
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:47,100
to run larger numbers or to run their

2376
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:48,779
select Fino at a big volume so the

2377
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:50,340
masses can really experience like what

2378
01:38:48,779 --> 01:38:52,139
you're describing and I guess my

2379
01:38:50,340 --> 01:38:54,060
question is if you had a big facility

2380
01:38:52,139 --> 01:38:55,920
come to you and say hey we want to grow

2381
01:38:54,060 --> 01:38:57,539
something that's unique but it's still

2382
01:38:55,920 --> 01:39:00,600
going to have some appeal to the general

2383
01:38:57,539 --> 01:39:01,920
masses to sort of the hype Market is

2384
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:05,120
there anything that you think would fit

2385
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:05,119
that bill pretty nicely

2386
01:39:05,279 --> 01:39:12,119
oh yeah oh I have several that are are

2387
01:39:09,319 --> 01:39:14,460
tuned in just for that and that's

2388
01:39:12,119 --> 01:39:17,219
exactly what these people that I've

2389
01:39:14,460 --> 01:39:22,859
teamed up with are doing this is a full

2390
01:39:17,219 --> 01:39:24,300
Nursery uh size unit with with 10 000

2391
01:39:22,859 --> 01:39:25,259
square foot

2392
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:28,860
um

2393
01:39:25,260 --> 01:39:31,020
Grow rooms uh we're talking a very

2394
01:39:28,859 --> 01:39:35,399
industrial size

2395
01:39:31,020 --> 01:39:37,280
um outfit and they want to use my

2396
01:39:35,399 --> 01:39:41,638
genetics because

2397
01:39:37,279 --> 01:39:43,079
they can have an inroad into the

2398
01:39:41,639 --> 01:39:45,420
dispensaries and stuff it was something

2399
01:39:43,079 --> 01:39:47,399
that isn't available any other way and

2400
01:39:45,420 --> 01:39:49,139
this stuff is showy and pretty and plus

2401
01:39:47,399 --> 01:39:53,099
we're trying to in this County we're

2402
01:39:49,139 --> 01:39:55,800
trying to um get um the tourism aspect

2403
01:39:53,100 --> 01:39:58,440
of it going and you've seen my work with

2404
01:39:55,800 --> 01:40:01,320
the pinkleberry that's geared towards

2405
01:39:58,439 --> 01:40:04,138
that aspect because I want to have

2406
01:40:01,319 --> 01:40:05,658
you know fields that are showy and

2407
01:40:04,139 --> 01:40:08,760
beautiful and

2408
01:40:05,658 --> 01:40:11,099
photographic ready for the masses to be

2409
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:13,020
able to look at and it doesn't hurt that

2410
01:40:11,100 --> 01:40:14,159
those plants are also tasty flavorable

2411
01:40:13,020 --> 01:40:16,020
and strong

2412
01:40:14,158 --> 01:40:17,819
so um

2413
01:40:16,020 --> 01:40:19,980
this is the kind of the mindset that

2414
01:40:17,819 --> 01:40:21,658
we're going for because again we want to

2415
01:40:19,979 --> 01:40:25,019
benefit this community we want this

2416
01:40:21,658 --> 01:40:27,119
community to to draw attention like no

2417
01:40:25,020 --> 01:40:29,820
other and we kind of feel like we've got

2418
01:40:27,119 --> 01:40:33,359
a unique set to be able to do that and

2419
01:40:29,819 --> 01:40:35,819
offer and that's just one aspect of it

2420
01:40:33,359 --> 01:40:38,279
but boy you know designing those plants

2421
01:40:35,819 --> 01:40:40,859
I have the exact thing in mind I want to

2422
01:40:38,279 --> 01:40:42,920
look at a field of those and see nothing

2423
01:40:40,859 --> 01:40:45,738
but dark purple

2424
01:40:42,920 --> 01:40:50,819
plants with beautiful

2425
01:40:45,738 --> 01:40:53,519
effervescent fluorescent magenta pistols

2426
01:40:50,819 --> 01:40:56,819
and then the

2427
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:58,980
um water leaves all turn a bright orange

2428
01:40:56,819 --> 01:41:01,079
yellow bright orange and it'll make it

2429
01:40:58,979 --> 01:41:04,439
look like there's a field of Fire

2430
01:41:01,079 --> 01:41:06,779
and just gorgeous absolutely gorgeous

2431
01:41:04,439 --> 01:41:10,259
and this is what I'm fashioning these

2432
01:41:06,779 --> 01:41:12,840
lines to do is specifically that so they

2433
01:41:10,260 --> 01:41:14,520
are photo ready and yeah I've already

2434
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:16,500
built in all the other stuff the flavor

2435
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:19,739
and all the other stuff so that it's a

2436
01:41:16,500 --> 01:41:21,658
marketable product on top of that but

2437
01:41:19,738 --> 01:41:24,000
there's always holes to fill and we can

2438
01:41:21,658 --> 01:41:25,679
do better and we're continuing to go in

2439
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,698
that direction so that's what all this

2440
01:41:25,679 --> 01:41:29,520
is for

2441
01:41:26,698 --> 01:41:30,960
I love it a brilliant approach I had

2442
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:32,880
noticed on your Instagram you'd been

2443
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:34,380
posting some photos over the past few

2444
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:36,719
months of Australian you're calling

2445
01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:39,179
American sunshine and the thing which

2446
01:41:36,719 --> 01:41:40,859
really caught me about that one was do

2447
01:41:39,179 --> 01:41:43,560
you say it's got like a vanilla profile

2448
01:41:40,859 --> 01:41:46,500
to it which is quite an underrepresented

2449
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:48,300
sort of terpen profile how would you

2450
01:41:46,500 --> 01:41:50,639
describe it and do you think it might

2451
01:41:48,300 --> 01:41:52,739
get quite popular

2452
01:41:50,639 --> 01:41:55,260
oh well I'm I'm actually breeding with

2453
01:41:52,738 --> 01:41:59,039
it there's two uh females one purple and

2454
01:41:55,260 --> 01:42:00,659
one uh green I'll post them up on

2455
01:41:59,039 --> 01:42:02,760
Instagram as to what they look like at

2456
01:42:00,658 --> 01:42:06,179
the moment because uh they're just

2457
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:08,760
finishing up for those those runs right

2458
01:42:06,179 --> 01:42:11,699
now but the profiles of the of the

2459
01:42:08,760 --> 01:42:15,920
vanilla tend to fade away after week

2460
01:42:11,698 --> 01:42:19,079
nine but before week nine

2461
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:19,980
you're getting this distinct I I

2462
01:42:19,079 --> 01:42:23,460
actually

2463
01:42:19,979 --> 01:42:25,559
said here to well I think it was

2464
01:42:23,460 --> 01:42:26,880
Northstar who mentioned it

2465
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:28,320
um I said what are you getting off of

2466
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:30,118
this because I already had vanilla in

2467
01:42:28,319 --> 01:42:32,579
mind he says oh it smells vanilla you

2468
01:42:30,118 --> 01:42:34,500
know oh perfect there you go that's

2469
01:42:32,579 --> 01:42:36,420
exactly because I hadn't heard of a

2470
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:38,880
vanilla one before and I haven't really

2471
01:42:36,420 --> 01:42:40,500
come across anything like that but it's

2472
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:43,260
the first thing that comes to mind when

2473
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:45,779
I smell especially the green one the the

2474
01:42:43,260 --> 01:42:48,239
purple one is a little bit more spicy in

2475
01:42:45,779 --> 01:42:50,340
the back because of the the components

2476
01:42:48,238 --> 01:42:52,618
that it has from the colors

2477
01:42:50,340 --> 01:42:54,779
um but I could steer it back over and I

2478
01:42:52,618 --> 01:42:56,880
will do that and that's what I'm working

2479
01:42:54,779 --> 01:43:00,179
on now is to get those into some very

2480
01:42:56,880 --> 01:43:02,039
dependable vanilla flavors because then

2481
01:43:00,179 --> 01:43:04,618
you mix that with a nice coffee variety

2482
01:43:02,039 --> 01:43:06,658
you've got a latte

2483
01:43:04,618 --> 01:43:08,880
I was funny you mentioned that I was

2484
01:43:06,658 --> 01:43:10,738
curious to ask you because you got such

2485
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:13,440
experience with sort of creating these

2486
01:43:10,738 --> 01:43:16,198
new flavor profiles I remember that you

2487
01:43:13,439 --> 01:43:19,138
know the late sub cool rest in peace uh

2488
01:43:16,198 --> 01:43:20,579
often described creating strains and he

2489
01:43:19,139 --> 01:43:23,039
would say if you've got one that's

2490
01:43:20,579 --> 01:43:25,198
chocolate and one that's vanilla you

2491
01:43:23,039 --> 01:43:27,779
combine them together you got a latte

2492
01:43:25,198 --> 01:43:29,638
something like that would you say that

2493
01:43:27,779 --> 01:43:32,039
you sort of agree with that sort of

2494
01:43:29,639 --> 01:43:36,539
mindset or do you think it's unexpected

2495
01:43:32,039 --> 01:43:38,880
no it's it's this it's the clock is

2496
01:43:36,539 --> 01:43:40,920
wrong a broken clock is right twice a

2497
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:43,319
day kind of a syndrome that and I used

2498
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:45,719
to tell some that this is that you know

2499
01:43:43,319 --> 01:43:48,179
you can go ahead and you can have these

2500
01:43:45,719 --> 01:43:51,480
different expressions and

2501
01:43:48,179 --> 01:43:53,219
unless you lock that down and that's the

2502
01:43:51,479 --> 01:43:55,459
purpose of going ahead and re-veging

2503
01:43:53,219 --> 01:43:57,658
plants you

2504
01:43:55,460 --> 01:44:00,000
you've got to be able to lock that down

2505
01:43:57,658 --> 01:44:01,638
well if it's present and pronounced in

2506
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:04,679
the phenotype that you're dealing with

2507
01:44:01,639 --> 01:44:06,920
you've already got half of it going you

2508
01:44:04,679 --> 01:44:10,679
just need to make that a set a set thing

2509
01:44:06,920 --> 01:44:12,239
and that's not hard if you're using

2510
01:44:10,679 --> 01:44:15,420
other genetics that you use to create

2511
01:44:12,238 --> 01:44:18,000
this to go ahead and reset that dominant

2512
01:44:15,420 --> 01:44:20,399
intest and to keep it dominant you want

2513
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:22,380
to be able to do that and I use the same

2514
01:44:20,399 --> 01:44:25,019
things where that came from but that

2515
01:44:22,380 --> 01:44:26,940
means you got to know your backgrounds

2516
01:44:25,020 --> 01:44:28,920
or your stuff it all comes back to the

2517
01:44:26,939 --> 01:44:31,379
same thing these Basics that I tell

2518
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:33,380
people all the time and they they look

2519
01:44:31,380 --> 01:44:35,819
for these complicated

2520
01:44:33,380 --> 01:44:40,679
methods and how they do these things

2521
01:44:35,819 --> 01:44:43,139
it's simple selection and being picky

2522
01:44:40,679 --> 01:44:44,340
period end the subject I can do anything

2523
01:44:43,139 --> 01:44:47,520
I want

2524
01:44:44,340 --> 01:44:49,139
with a given set of genetics if it has

2525
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:52,260
something that I want to make it come

2526
01:44:49,139 --> 01:44:54,239
forward and anybody else can do the same

2527
01:44:52,260 --> 01:44:55,320
damn thing you just got to put the work

2528
01:44:54,238 --> 01:44:59,039
in

2529
01:44:55,319 --> 01:45:00,840
yeah certainly certainly we had a an

2530
01:44:59,039 --> 01:45:02,460
interesting question submitted by one of

2531
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:05,039
our listeners and I think it was sort of

2532
01:45:02,460 --> 01:45:06,600
inspired by our first discussion and it

2533
01:45:05,039 --> 01:45:08,698
seems like they they really took on

2534
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:10,380
board the point you made about how you

2535
01:45:08,698 --> 01:45:12,479
know you can take a certain trait you

2536
01:45:10,380 --> 01:45:14,279
like from this plant and improve it or

2537
01:45:12,479 --> 01:45:15,959
bring it to another cross and what they

2538
01:45:14,279 --> 01:45:18,059
were sort of wondering is let's just say

2539
01:45:15,960 --> 01:45:19,500
I've got like four base plants and I

2540
01:45:18,060 --> 01:45:21,659
like certain things about each of them

2541
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:23,279
and I want to sort of ultimately lead it

2542
01:45:21,658 --> 01:45:25,019
into one end strain where I'm

2543
01:45:23,279 --> 01:45:27,420
incorporating the things I like about

2544
01:45:25,020 --> 01:45:29,520
each into one thing do you think that

2545
01:45:27,420 --> 01:45:31,260
it's practically possible for someone to

2546
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:33,739
do that or logistically it would just

2547
01:45:31,260 --> 01:45:37,920
require a lot of work

2548
01:45:33,738 --> 01:45:40,019
it's going to require a lot of work it

2549
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:42,779
if you're willing to do the work then

2550
01:45:40,020 --> 01:45:45,239
you've got to have multiple plans of the

2551
01:45:42,779 --> 01:45:48,359
set of the same plant that you can use

2552
01:45:45,238 --> 01:45:50,759
to work with and do your your your r d

2553
01:45:48,359 --> 01:45:53,399
with and you've got to just go through

2554
01:45:50,760 --> 01:45:55,380
it to me and that's why I always tell

2555
01:45:53,399 --> 01:45:57,539
people when you're beginning and when

2556
01:45:55,380 --> 01:46:00,600
you're when you're not as sure about

2557
01:45:57,539 --> 01:46:03,359
your genetic stock

2558
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:06,060
concentrate on one trade don't

2559
01:46:03,359 --> 01:46:08,759
concentrate on anything else this is

2560
01:46:06,060 --> 01:46:10,739
again what you're describing is what I

2561
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:13,020
was telling you about oh this little

2562
01:46:10,738 --> 01:46:15,899
plant is prettier and I can save this

2563
01:46:13,020 --> 01:46:17,639
for another project no that's you're

2564
01:46:15,899 --> 01:46:18,719
that's getting that's you getting in

2565
01:46:17,639 --> 01:46:21,539
your own way

2566
01:46:18,719 --> 01:46:24,060
and so I always tell people it's better

2567
01:46:21,539 --> 01:46:26,579
to focus on one thing get it locked down

2568
01:46:24,060 --> 01:46:29,760
then move to the next thing if you want

2569
01:46:26,579 --> 01:46:32,519
to work on four plants that's great

2570
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:34,619
save copies of the other three work on

2571
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:36,420
the one get it right then move to the

2572
01:46:34,618 --> 01:46:38,099
next one because you're going to be a

2573
01:46:36,420 --> 01:46:39,960
lot more efficient you're going to get a

2574
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:41,880
lot more done and you're going to do it

2575
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:44,158
in a lot shorter time than if you're

2576
01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:45,779
trying to [ __ ] around with four plants

2577
01:46:44,158 --> 01:46:47,339
four different expressions and you're

2578
01:46:45,779 --> 01:46:49,439
trying to stabilize each one of those

2579
01:46:47,340 --> 01:46:51,659
expressions in a line

2580
01:46:49,439 --> 01:46:54,000
now I do it because

2581
01:46:51,658 --> 01:46:55,920
I'm you know I know my [ __ ] backwards

2582
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:58,340
and forwards as far as my genetics that

2583
01:46:55,920 --> 01:47:01,139
I'm working with I know those genetics

2584
01:46:58,340 --> 01:47:03,119
most people don't have that Luxury Plus

2585
01:47:01,139 --> 01:47:05,520
they're working with a lot of poly

2586
01:47:03,118 --> 01:47:07,019
hybrids in this industry that are you

2587
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:09,360
don't know what they're made of people

2588
01:47:07,020 --> 01:47:11,460
can say it's made of something when it's

2589
01:47:09,359 --> 01:47:14,460
totally different or that's what they

2590
01:47:11,460 --> 01:47:15,840
were told it was you know and it and it

2591
01:47:14,460 --> 01:47:18,840
isn't at all

2592
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:21,360
so it's better to do the work yourself

2593
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:24,360
and I always feel it's better to

2594
01:47:21,359 --> 01:47:26,219
concentrate on smaller chunks and get it

2595
01:47:24,359 --> 01:47:29,059
right it's like when you're cleaning

2596
01:47:26,219 --> 01:47:32,399
your house if your house is totally

2597
01:47:29,060 --> 01:47:34,139
[ __ ] up and totally needs cleaning and

2598
01:47:32,399 --> 01:47:36,059
you get overwhelmed looking at this

2599
01:47:34,139 --> 01:47:37,380
whole house not clean

2600
01:47:36,060 --> 01:47:39,300
stop

2601
01:47:37,380 --> 01:47:42,118
go over to this three foot little area

2602
01:47:39,300 --> 01:47:43,320
and clean it that's your task for the

2603
01:47:42,118 --> 01:47:46,920
day

2604
01:47:43,319 --> 01:47:48,840
next day the three foot next to it and

2605
01:47:46,920 --> 01:47:51,239
so on and so forth before you know it

2606
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:54,300
your house is clean you hadn't suffered

2607
01:47:51,238 --> 01:47:57,118
any and it's done perfectly

2608
01:47:54,300 --> 01:47:59,520
same thing

2609
01:47:57,118 --> 01:48:01,679
brilliant analogy just keeping it simple

2610
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:03,840
I like that and another one of our

2611
01:48:01,679 --> 01:48:06,000
listener submitted questions was how

2612
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:07,920
many seeds do you like to pop of one of

2613
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:11,880
your own lines before you feel satisfied

2614
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:14,819
you have a good idea of what's inside it

2615
01:48:11,880 --> 01:48:16,800
well if it's been a refined targeted

2616
01:48:14,819 --> 01:48:18,779
line I I you know I can get away with a

2617
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:21,239
dozen

2618
01:48:18,779 --> 01:48:22,859
you know it'll show me it'll show me the

2619
01:48:21,238 --> 01:48:24,839
spread of basically everything that's in

2620
01:48:22,859 --> 01:48:27,420
there you might get these recessive

2621
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:28,980
oddballs here and there but you know

2622
01:48:27,420 --> 01:48:30,480
that they aren't going to be something

2623
01:48:28,979 --> 01:48:33,718
that expresses

2624
01:48:30,479 --> 01:48:35,039
as readily as those other 11. you know

2625
01:48:33,719 --> 01:48:38,100
they're they're going to sh it's going

2626
01:48:35,039 --> 01:48:41,819
to show so I I just I tend to think that

2627
01:48:38,100 --> 01:48:43,440
now if you're doing R and D lines oh six

2628
01:48:41,819 --> 01:48:45,840
seven hundred seeds

2629
01:48:43,439 --> 01:48:48,299
you know I'm serious really and people

2630
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:49,739
people laugh and they say how do you do

2631
01:48:48,300 --> 01:48:52,020
that well you know when you're growing

2632
01:48:49,738 --> 01:48:54,419
little tiny plants it's not as much it's

2633
01:48:52,020 --> 01:48:55,679
it it's a lot easier than you think and

2634
01:48:54,420 --> 01:48:57,060
half of those are going to go away as

2635
01:48:55,679 --> 01:48:59,819
males anyway

2636
01:48:57,060 --> 01:49:02,580
you know and I don't chase males I never

2637
01:48:59,819 --> 01:49:04,799
chase males I and I always Advocate that

2638
01:49:02,579 --> 01:49:07,319
people don't chase males you know males

2639
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:08,880
are a tool the females are what you

2640
01:49:07,319 --> 01:49:10,738
chase and the females are what you

2641
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:14,639
refine and you everything is done to

2642
01:49:10,738 --> 01:49:16,618
refine that female don't chase males

2643
01:49:14,639 --> 01:49:18,840
period so what sort of guiding

2644
01:49:16,618 --> 01:49:20,698
principles do you use When selecting a

2645
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:22,020
male do you find the female that has the

2646
01:49:20,698 --> 01:49:24,539
qualities you want and then try to find

2647
01:49:22,020 --> 01:49:27,000
the male that matches up to it

2648
01:49:24,539 --> 01:49:29,340
it all goes back to what it is that I'm

2649
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:31,260
trying to do you know if I try to color

2650
01:49:29,340 --> 01:49:33,179
it okay does that mail Shield color

2651
01:49:31,260 --> 01:49:35,699
dependably is it going to pass it on

2652
01:49:33,179 --> 01:49:37,739
does it come from a color line that has

2653
01:49:35,698 --> 01:49:39,658
color already built in or is the color

2654
01:49:37,738 --> 01:49:42,959
recessive and only showing in that one

2655
01:49:39,658 --> 01:49:45,118
phenotype it all goes back to targeted

2656
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:48,239
results as far as what you want to do

2657
01:49:45,118 --> 01:49:51,719
and how you want it to be expressed that

2658
01:49:48,238 --> 01:49:53,158
that's all you choosing and knowing the

2659
01:49:51,719 --> 01:49:54,300
background and using that background

2660
01:49:53,158 --> 01:49:56,339
like that

2661
01:49:54,300 --> 01:49:59,279
yeah

2662
01:49:56,340 --> 01:50:02,400
so I believe you're currently working on

2663
01:49:59,279 --> 01:50:04,979
an old Mendo Haze back cross and I had

2664
01:50:02,399 --> 01:50:07,079
me wondering what traits about the old

2665
01:50:04,979 --> 01:50:08,459
Mendo Haze you really like and which do

2666
01:50:07,079 --> 01:50:09,658
you think could maybe be improved a

2667
01:50:08,460 --> 01:50:12,539
little

2668
01:50:09,658 --> 01:50:15,839
well I already did that and that cross

2669
01:50:12,539 --> 01:50:18,539
fix that but the the Mendo Hayes has a

2670
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:21,300
hell of a stretch to it and I didn't

2671
01:50:18,539 --> 01:50:23,819
like all that elongation so I kind of

2672
01:50:21,300 --> 01:50:28,739
kept the elongation because it was

2673
01:50:23,819 --> 01:50:32,519
easier to to fill the empty spaces than

2674
01:50:28,738 --> 01:50:34,319
it was to uh stop the elongation

2675
01:50:32,520 --> 01:50:36,659
um so I took the easy path in that

2676
01:50:34,319 --> 01:50:40,259
direction so you get big plants that are

2677
01:50:36,658 --> 01:50:41,099
sativa base and there's a lot less

2678
01:50:40,260 --> 01:50:43,619
um

2679
01:50:41,100 --> 01:50:46,260
stem you know a lot more

2680
01:50:43,618 --> 01:50:48,019
Fuller flowers larger flowers the flower

2681
01:50:46,260 --> 01:50:51,539
sizes increased

2682
01:50:48,020 --> 01:50:54,300
there is a marker that I use which was

2683
01:50:51,539 --> 01:50:56,519
the dark desire as a color marker so

2684
01:50:54,300 --> 01:50:58,980
with it when I was cubing that I was

2685
01:50:56,520 --> 01:51:01,380
steering away from that color marker and

2686
01:50:58,979 --> 01:51:03,658
then gooey is in there also because of

2687
01:51:01,380 --> 01:51:05,400
the resin expression but she's in the

2688
01:51:03,658 --> 01:51:09,299
back end

2689
01:51:05,399 --> 01:51:13,379
um with um uh and that was used with a

2690
01:51:09,300 --> 01:51:16,500
pure GUI was used for that not Mom GUI

2691
01:51:13,380 --> 01:51:19,560
so it was the uh

2692
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:21,600
um the mail that I did that for only to

2693
01:51:19,560 --> 01:51:24,840
increase the resin size on there which

2694
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:26,159
indeed it it I and I can again show

2695
01:51:24,840 --> 01:51:27,539
people on Instagram I wish I had

2696
01:51:26,158 --> 01:51:29,460
examples right here that I could bring

2697
01:51:27,539 --> 01:51:31,738
up because I have examples of all this

2698
01:51:29,460 --> 01:51:33,420
stuff where I can show you the

2699
01:51:31,738 --> 01:51:36,299
difference between the the old Mendo

2700
01:51:33,420 --> 01:51:39,239
Hayes mother and the improved version

2701
01:51:36,300 --> 01:51:42,119
and what it does and how much better it

2702
01:51:39,238 --> 01:51:44,579
is as far as a overall grower experience

2703
01:51:42,118 --> 01:51:45,439
from that point but it still has the

2704
01:51:44,579 --> 01:51:48,380
bright

2705
01:51:45,439 --> 01:51:52,439
overwhelmingly bright flavors the 24

2706
01:51:48,380 --> 01:51:54,960
minimum THC is still there

2707
01:51:52,439 --> 01:51:58,198
um all those familiar flavors that I

2708
01:51:54,960 --> 01:52:00,118
talk about when I when I take the lime

2709
01:51:58,198 --> 01:52:02,099
and the Vodka those are very pronounced

2710
01:52:00,118 --> 01:52:04,618
and everything is there it's just a

2711
01:52:02,100 --> 01:52:06,600
fuller plant that produces better Bud

2712
01:52:04,618 --> 01:52:07,679
and bigger bud and has you know it's

2713
01:52:06,600 --> 01:52:10,199
cleaner

2714
01:52:07,679 --> 01:52:12,300
so you know it's more refined it's

2715
01:52:10,198 --> 01:52:15,178
basically that's all that is but then

2716
01:52:12,300 --> 01:52:18,239
there's the color marker in there just

2717
01:52:15,179 --> 01:52:19,679
for my own work but yeah you know if

2718
01:52:18,238 --> 01:52:21,539
someone were to cross it with a

2719
01:52:19,679 --> 01:52:23,279
recessive color all of a sudden they'd

2720
01:52:21,539 --> 01:52:25,139
get kids that are all kinds of different

2721
01:52:23,279 --> 01:52:26,880
colors and that'd be that's always a fun

2722
01:52:25,139 --> 01:52:28,920
surprise you know it's not a it's it's

2723
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:31,679
like a little genetic Time Bomb but it's

2724
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:34,440
a good one not a bad one like her you

2725
01:52:31,679 --> 01:52:36,899
know that kind of thing very nice and I

2726
01:52:34,439 --> 01:52:39,599
mean I ran one of subcool's breeding

2727
01:52:36,899 --> 01:52:42,658
theories by you and so I'd love to run

2728
01:52:39,600 --> 01:52:44,760
one of DJ shorts by you which is he

2729
01:52:42,658 --> 01:52:47,039
always spoke about he liked to have the

2730
01:52:44,760 --> 01:52:49,199
more sativa of the two plants in the

2731
01:52:47,039 --> 01:52:51,060
cross being the female he never really

2732
01:52:49,198 --> 01:52:52,618
explained why that was have you ever

2733
01:52:51,060 --> 01:52:55,039
found anything like that or got any

2734
01:52:52,618 --> 01:52:55,039
thoughts

2735
01:52:55,439 --> 01:53:01,559
uh you know again I think it's more a

2736
01:52:58,520 --> 01:53:04,199
strange specific in that instance but I

2737
01:53:01,560 --> 01:53:06,719
mean yeah if you're dealing with hybrids

2738
01:53:04,198 --> 01:53:09,419
and stuff I I tend to lean towards the

2739
01:53:06,719 --> 01:53:12,179
sativas myself only because one they're

2740
01:53:09,420 --> 01:53:15,239
bigger uh they tend to be Fuller you

2741
01:53:12,179 --> 01:53:17,819
know with a lot better production uh and

2742
01:53:15,238 --> 01:53:19,500
I I just like to high better as far as

2743
01:53:17,819 --> 01:53:20,519
that goes it's a brighter more

2744
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:22,920
pronounced

2745
01:53:20,520 --> 01:53:26,460
kind of high that fits my personality

2746
01:53:22,920 --> 01:53:28,679
and that's the thing uh that's all very

2747
01:53:26,460 --> 01:53:31,139
s person specific stuff that you're

2748
01:53:28,679 --> 01:53:33,420
talking about there somebody who else

2749
01:53:31,139 --> 01:53:35,639
who tries that may go and go for the

2750
01:53:33,420 --> 01:53:38,219
Indica side because it that's what they

2751
01:53:35,639 --> 01:53:41,880
favor and their brain craves kind of

2752
01:53:38,219 --> 01:53:44,399
thing so it it all comes back to me is

2753
01:53:41,880 --> 01:53:46,139
to I want everybody to have the choice I

2754
01:53:44,399 --> 01:53:50,339
want you to be able to choose what's

2755
01:53:46,139 --> 01:53:53,219
best for you and so yeah I I I like to

2756
01:53:50,340 --> 01:53:55,920
have a a spread on the things that I do

2757
01:53:53,219 --> 01:53:58,980
for breeders I like to have that spread

2758
01:53:55,920 --> 01:54:01,739
I myself choose the sativa sides more

2759
01:53:58,979 --> 01:54:04,879
but you know me I'm a Thai Vietnamese

2760
01:54:01,738 --> 01:54:08,879
Colombian you know I'm old school Mexico

2761
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:10,739
I like those I I just have fond memories

2762
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:13,020
of them and I just feel like they're

2763
01:54:10,738 --> 01:54:14,819
more efficient at giving me the type of

2764
01:54:13,020 --> 01:54:16,739
vibe that I'm looking for

2765
01:54:14,819 --> 01:54:19,618
I'm not into sedative

2766
01:54:16,738 --> 01:54:22,259
yeah you know I'm Into You Know euphoric

2767
01:54:19,618 --> 01:54:25,139
and and psychoactive those are the kind

2768
01:54:22,260 --> 01:54:27,659
of highs I like I like clean I like to

2769
01:54:25,139 --> 01:54:30,359
be able to to like go go to Hawaii smoke

2770
01:54:27,658 --> 01:54:32,579
a nice sativa bowl and then go out and

2771
01:54:30,359 --> 01:54:34,679
enjoy the day not sit there on the beach

2772
01:54:32,579 --> 01:54:35,519
and veg and bacon and sand and get a

2773
01:54:34,679 --> 01:54:38,100
sunburn

2774
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:39,780
yeah here here I can agree with that one

2775
01:54:38,100 --> 01:54:41,460
other thing which just came to mind when

2776
01:54:39,779 --> 01:54:42,960
you were talking about that is DJ Short

2777
01:54:41,460 --> 01:54:44,520
commented and it's very much a personal

2778
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:46,859
thing he said oh yeah I really like

2779
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:48,840
smoking flour that's been seeded I feel

2780
01:54:46,859 --> 01:54:52,198
like there's some sort of slight changes

2781
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:54,480
in cedared Bud versus Cincy yeah do you

2782
01:54:52,198 --> 01:54:56,579
fall into that category or not really no

2783
01:54:54,479 --> 01:54:59,279
I don't I don't like smoking the flowers

2784
01:54:56,579 --> 01:55:00,899
to me it gets harsh and it's just you

2785
01:54:59,279 --> 01:55:03,000
know I don't like it I don't like it

2786
01:55:00,899 --> 01:55:05,219
because again

2787
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:08,399
what happens when it's making seed is

2788
01:55:05,219 --> 01:55:11,100
the plant stops THC production and what

2789
01:55:08,399 --> 01:55:13,379
THC is available there goes into

2790
01:55:11,100 --> 01:55:16,440
post-tac products and you're getting a

2791
01:55:13,380 --> 01:55:18,539
lot of of the degraded THC and that's

2792
01:55:16,439 --> 01:55:21,859
probably what he likes about it is that

2793
01:55:18,539 --> 01:55:25,319
that CBN kind of a feel that that

2794
01:55:21,859 --> 01:55:29,039
settling that that heaviness that

2795
01:55:25,319 --> 01:55:31,198
sedativeness that uh it's great for pain

2796
01:55:29,039 --> 01:55:33,600
kind of thing uh

2797
01:55:31,198 --> 01:55:35,339
um yeah I can see that as being

2798
01:55:33,600 --> 01:55:37,260
something that would be present in

2799
01:55:35,340 --> 01:55:40,020
seeded pot and I remember

2800
01:55:37,260 --> 01:55:41,820
plenty of seeded brick weed from back in

2801
01:55:40,020 --> 01:55:45,179
the day that was just thicker than [ __ ]

2802
01:55:41,819 --> 01:55:47,279
far as a high goes you know oh and

2803
01:55:45,179 --> 01:55:50,158
that's all to me is just degraded resin

2804
01:55:47,279 --> 01:55:51,899
is what that is so if you like that kind

2805
01:55:50,158 --> 01:55:54,960
of high let your plants sit around

2806
01:55:51,899 --> 01:55:57,779
what's what they do in in the hashmaking

2807
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:59,880
uh regions of the world is in the

2808
01:55:57,779 --> 01:56:02,639
especially in the poor regions they'll

2809
01:55:59,880 --> 01:56:04,679
just pile the plants in the corner and

2810
01:56:02,639 --> 01:56:07,199
let them sit for six months and then

2811
01:56:04,679 --> 01:56:09,960
they make the hash out of that and the

2812
01:56:07,198 --> 01:56:12,419
hash is very sedative very heavy you can

2813
01:56:09,960 --> 01:56:14,460
feel it a lot in the body and that's all

2814
01:56:12,420 --> 01:56:16,319
from just sitting around and just being

2815
01:56:14,460 --> 01:56:19,260
exposed and oxidizing you know that kind

2816
01:56:16,319 --> 01:56:21,179
of thing so it really kind of depends on

2817
01:56:19,260 --> 01:56:24,060
what your tastes are and where you're

2818
01:56:21,179 --> 01:56:26,639
going for but yeah degraded resin yeah

2819
01:56:24,060 --> 01:56:28,580
it's never been my I don't really care

2820
01:56:26,639 --> 01:56:32,340
for it as much as I like the bright

2821
01:56:28,579 --> 01:56:34,920
newer resin I'm always a new plant kind

2822
01:56:32,340 --> 01:56:36,960
of a guy but I think that's kind of my

2823
01:56:34,920 --> 01:56:38,880
thing from growing so much and having

2824
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:42,960
samples all the time I've just gotten

2825
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:44,760
into that that rail of fresh smoke all

2826
01:56:42,960 --> 01:56:47,520
the time because it never ends I mean

2827
01:56:44,760 --> 01:56:49,560
there's not a day that goes by that

2828
01:56:47,520 --> 01:56:51,659
there is something fresh and new that

2829
01:56:49,560 --> 01:56:53,400
I've never tried before that goes into

2830
01:56:51,658 --> 01:56:57,259
my lungs so

2831
01:56:53,399 --> 01:56:59,219
you know I I speak from that perspective

2832
01:56:57,260 --> 01:57:01,380
certainly and I mean if we're on the

2833
01:56:59,219 --> 01:57:02,880
other end of the spectrum of shore

2834
01:57:01,380 --> 01:57:04,500
flowering things you mentioned at the

2835
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:06,060
start that you you have a number of

2836
01:57:04,500 --> 01:57:07,679
lines that are quite quick and you know

2837
01:57:06,060 --> 01:57:10,320
the GUI can be harvested reasonably

2838
01:57:07,679 --> 01:57:12,239
early I guess my question is do you

2839
01:57:10,319 --> 01:57:14,698
think there's such a thing as too short

2840
01:57:12,238 --> 01:57:16,138
of a flowering time in the sense that if

2841
01:57:14,698 --> 01:57:19,319
I came to you and said hey I got this

2842
01:57:16,139 --> 01:57:20,819
line Freddy in 35 days people say oh

2843
01:57:19,319 --> 01:57:23,158
yeah but like the high probably won't

2844
01:57:20,819 --> 01:57:24,359
last that long or something like that do

2845
01:57:23,158 --> 01:57:26,219
you think that's true or do you think

2846
01:57:24,359 --> 01:57:28,979
you can get great high at a very short

2847
01:57:26,219 --> 01:57:31,739
flower time yeah you bet if you can trim

2848
01:57:28,979 --> 01:57:34,198
it down that much you bet and it's a

2849
01:57:31,738 --> 01:57:36,539
little that's really short but you know

2850
01:57:34,198 --> 01:57:38,658
that's almost just going off of auto

2851
01:57:36,539 --> 01:57:42,300
flowering kind of stuff

2852
01:57:38,658 --> 01:57:45,899
yeah I have some reservations uh myself

2853
01:57:42,300 --> 01:57:47,520
but that's there's nothing that says

2854
01:57:45,899 --> 01:57:49,618
that you can't have

2855
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:52,080
full product in a short period of time

2856
01:57:49,618 --> 01:57:54,679
nothing there's just no reason for it

2857
01:57:52,079 --> 01:57:58,198
doesn't make any sense

2858
01:57:54,679 --> 01:58:00,359
there is a the only thing that I can say

2859
01:57:58,198 --> 01:58:03,118
in that conflicts with that is my

2860
01:58:00,359 --> 01:58:04,500
two-month rule for plants is that if you

2861
01:58:03,118 --> 01:58:06,899
want to see a full expression you need

2862
01:58:04,500 --> 01:58:08,698
two months I equate that as the same

2863
01:58:06,899 --> 01:58:10,439
thing as a prepubescent girl being able

2864
01:58:08,698 --> 01:58:11,819
to get pregnant versus one that's gone

2865
01:58:10,439 --> 01:58:14,158
into puberty

2866
01:58:11,819 --> 01:58:16,679
she's just not ready yet you know and

2867
01:58:14,158 --> 01:58:19,319
she's just is not able to concede yet at

2868
01:58:16,679 --> 01:58:21,719
that age then she goes and gets old

2869
01:58:19,319 --> 01:58:25,198
enough boom she's mature and she can

2870
01:58:21,719 --> 01:58:28,319
reproduce it's the same kind of thing I

2871
01:58:25,198 --> 01:58:30,419
think that the genetics set up and are

2872
01:58:28,319 --> 01:58:33,179
able to establish themselves and express

2873
01:58:30,420 --> 01:58:34,500
themselves more completely in a slightly

2874
01:58:33,179 --> 01:58:36,719
older plant

2875
01:58:34,500 --> 01:58:39,060
so you've got and that's why I when I

2876
01:58:36,719 --> 01:58:41,039
microbreed if I'm going really fast and

2877
01:58:39,060 --> 01:58:43,260
I'm taking things really quick and

2878
01:58:41,039 --> 01:58:45,118
they're not made quite too much that's

2879
01:58:43,260 --> 01:58:48,599
the whole purpose of having a secondary

2880
01:58:45,118 --> 01:58:50,279
growth set you know as a test nothing is

2881
01:58:48,599 --> 01:58:52,679
said in stone where I've picked that

2882
01:58:50,279 --> 01:58:54,840
plant the first time it's just gone down

2883
01:58:52,679 --> 01:58:57,359
to the next stage is all you know

2884
01:58:54,840 --> 01:58:58,860
there's still a lot of evaluation and a

2885
01:58:57,359 --> 01:59:00,658
lot of rejects that come off of that

2886
01:58:58,859 --> 01:59:02,880
people look at the rejects that I do and

2887
01:59:00,658 --> 01:59:05,039
they go well Jesus is really nice why

2888
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:07,920
are you rejecting that sorry didn't hit

2889
01:59:05,039 --> 01:59:10,439
the mark for that it's out of here next

2890
01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:12,679
because Life's too short to mess around

2891
01:59:10,439 --> 01:59:15,178
with crappy genetics

2892
01:59:12,679 --> 01:59:16,618
and you just you just raised the topic

2893
01:59:15,179 --> 01:59:18,779
that you got some reservations around

2894
01:59:16,618 --> 01:59:20,399
Autos would you be able to tell us what

2895
01:59:18,779 --> 01:59:22,500
they might be

2896
01:59:20,399 --> 01:59:25,500
what do you mean well like would we ever

2897
01:59:22,500 --> 01:59:26,760
see a gooey Auto project in the works or

2898
01:59:25,500 --> 01:59:27,840
is just not something you're interested

2899
01:59:26,760 --> 01:59:30,739
in

2900
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:30,739
ah

2901
01:59:31,800 --> 01:59:38,340
I don't know I I I

2902
01:59:35,340 --> 01:59:38,340
uh

2903
01:59:38,760 --> 01:59:42,960
I don't know

2904
01:59:40,279 --> 01:59:45,479
see I'm so busy just doing but what I'm

2905
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:47,698
doing that and I've got so many irons in

2906
01:59:45,479 --> 01:59:51,419
the fire with all of the stuff like this

2907
01:59:47,698 --> 01:59:53,939
now adding more stuff is just I don't

2908
01:59:51,420 --> 01:59:56,940
know it's always a possibility I guess

2909
01:59:53,939 --> 01:59:59,579
you know I haven't considered it myself

2910
01:59:56,939 --> 02:00:04,439
as far as uh

2911
01:59:59,579 --> 02:00:07,260
a separate project goal thing to do uh

2912
02:00:04,439 --> 02:00:10,319
I do uh

2913
02:00:07,260 --> 02:00:13,079
I do want to be able to

2914
02:00:10,319 --> 02:00:15,658
bring the brand around I think that's my

2915
02:00:13,079 --> 02:00:18,920
main focus right now is to bring the

2916
02:00:15,658 --> 02:00:22,198
brand around to the public to

2917
02:00:18,920 --> 02:00:25,679
they're only just now kind of really

2918
02:00:22,198 --> 02:00:27,658
fully getting that it's different and

2919
02:00:25,679 --> 02:00:30,359
that it's not the same and people are

2920
02:00:27,658 --> 02:00:32,819
hearing stuff about it and that's the

2921
02:00:30,359 --> 02:00:34,859
really the main focus of my all my

2922
02:00:32,819 --> 02:00:36,299
attentions these last few years is kind

2923
02:00:34,859 --> 02:00:37,979
of getting that because I think it's

2924
02:00:36,300 --> 02:00:40,560
good for the public

2925
02:00:37,979 --> 02:00:42,138
I think and and so my heart and my

2926
02:00:40,560 --> 02:00:44,460
efforts are really

2927
02:00:42,139 --> 02:00:47,039
concentrating on that

2928
02:00:44,460 --> 02:00:48,719
yeah totally understandable you

2929
02:00:47,039 --> 02:00:50,519
mentioned earlier the the black Platinum

2930
02:00:48,719 --> 02:00:52,139
Society is somewhere where you get some

2931
02:00:50,520 --> 02:00:54,900
high quality genetics from I was

2932
02:00:52,139 --> 02:00:57,840
wondering no no no no

2933
02:00:54,899 --> 02:01:00,899
black Platinum Society is mine and

2934
02:00:57,840 --> 02:01:03,179
people get their genetics from me to use

2935
02:01:00,899 --> 02:01:05,098
in their lines some of the most famous

2936
02:01:03,179 --> 02:01:07,319
breeders that I'm not allowed to mention

2937
02:01:05,099 --> 02:01:11,940
because that's part of the black

2938
02:01:07,319 --> 02:01:14,158
platinum's uh society's uh rules are

2939
02:01:11,939 --> 02:01:16,079
that you know we don't discuss but one

2940
02:01:14,158 --> 02:01:19,138
of the other rules is that those they

2941
02:01:16,079 --> 02:01:22,079
can use those genetics as their own and

2942
02:01:19,139 --> 02:01:24,480
they don't have to promote them in with

2943
02:01:22,079 --> 02:01:26,639
uh my company or anything like that and

2944
02:01:24,479 --> 02:01:28,500
I always tell them might be a good idea

2945
02:01:26,639 --> 02:01:30,599
to tell people that they come from these

2946
02:01:28,500 --> 02:01:34,859
genetics because it just incites more

2947
02:01:30,599 --> 02:01:37,739
interest in that that genre or that that

2948
02:01:34,859 --> 02:01:39,598
area you know that that uniqueness and

2949
02:01:37,738 --> 02:01:42,598
stuff and that would draw more people in

2950
02:01:39,599 --> 02:01:45,119
to that just by virtue of that but it's

2951
02:01:42,599 --> 02:01:47,599
not a requisite and so no that's

2952
02:01:45,118 --> 02:01:50,098
something that

2953
02:01:47,599 --> 02:01:51,360
over the years I've invited you know

2954
02:01:50,099 --> 02:01:53,699
professional breeders and whether they

2955
02:01:51,359 --> 02:01:56,339
want to go ahead and do it most of them

2956
02:01:53,698 --> 02:01:58,019
approach me and then we go ahead and

2957
02:01:56,340 --> 02:02:00,420
talk and if it's all right then I'll go

2958
02:01:58,020 --> 02:02:02,040
ahead and I invite them in but uh no

2959
02:02:00,420 --> 02:02:04,319
those are that's something that comes

2960
02:02:02,039 --> 02:02:05,579
from me and goes out not other ways

2961
02:02:04,319 --> 02:02:08,219
coming in

2962
02:02:05,579 --> 02:02:10,319
sure yeah my mistake on that one I guess

2963
02:02:08,219 --> 02:02:12,480
my question I'm hoping is still going to

2964
02:02:10,319 --> 02:02:14,219
be just as relevant in that I'm

2965
02:02:12,479 --> 02:02:16,379
wondering you know you've obviously got

2966
02:02:14,219 --> 02:02:19,198
a very reputable collection of genetics

2967
02:02:16,380 --> 02:02:21,000
Joe keep your eye out for new land races

2968
02:02:19,198 --> 02:02:23,399
coming out in the sense that there are

2969
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:24,899
guys like Indian Land race exchange and

2970
02:02:23,399 --> 02:02:26,579
stuff like that who are doing these

2971
02:02:24,899 --> 02:02:29,519
trips and trying to Source it you keep

2972
02:02:26,579 --> 02:02:32,158
your finger on that pulse at all no I

2973
02:02:29,520 --> 02:02:33,920
don't and the reason I don't is because

2974
02:02:32,158 --> 02:02:36,839
of the same thing I've always said

2975
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:38,639
they're doing that and that's their

2976
02:02:36,840 --> 02:02:41,099
their

2977
02:02:38,639 --> 02:02:44,099
their selling point that I don't want to

2978
02:02:41,099 --> 02:02:47,360
mix my genetics in with that what I want

2979
02:02:44,099 --> 02:02:49,800
to do is I want to take raw genetics

2980
02:02:47,359 --> 02:02:52,139
whatever's left in the world which is

2981
02:02:49,800 --> 02:02:54,900
we've I've as we've talked before you

2982
02:02:52,139 --> 02:02:56,940
know the gene pool is shrinking ever and

2983
02:02:54,899 --> 02:03:00,059
ever more but you know you can still

2984
02:02:56,939 --> 02:03:03,238
find these little enclaves of of areas

2985
02:03:00,060 --> 02:03:06,420
where you can get Lander stuff that's

2986
02:03:03,238 --> 02:03:09,178
been bred by small farmers in very

2987
02:03:06,420 --> 02:03:10,920
remote areas and you can bring that

2988
02:03:09,179 --> 02:03:13,260
stuff forward and use that and that's

2989
02:03:10,920 --> 02:03:18,779
where my focus has been I have a friend

2990
02:03:13,260 --> 02:03:20,579
who's a producer in Hollywood and he

2991
02:03:18,779 --> 02:03:23,519
um also goes around and does stock

2992
02:03:20,579 --> 02:03:26,219
footage filming for

2993
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:27,960
um the you know the various industry you

2994
02:03:26,219 --> 02:03:29,099
know that he does stock footage you know

2995
02:03:27,960 --> 02:03:31,198
so

2996
02:03:29,099 --> 02:03:32,880
um in his travels he goes around and

2997
02:03:31,198 --> 02:03:35,399
he's the one that got me the African

2998
02:03:32,880 --> 02:03:38,340
he's gotten me some Jamaican material

2999
02:03:35,399 --> 02:03:39,960
before that was very old and and this is

3000
02:03:38,340 --> 02:03:43,440
the kind of stuff that he does he goes

3001
02:03:39,960 --> 02:03:45,779
and he searches out these areas to film

3002
02:03:43,439 --> 02:03:49,259
and it happens across these Growers

3003
02:03:45,779 --> 02:03:51,779
talks to them gets their confidence and

3004
02:03:49,260 --> 02:03:53,880
then sends me the material to use and

3005
02:03:51,779 --> 02:03:57,019
I've had great success with it that way

3006
02:03:53,880 --> 02:04:01,800
and I think that that just again

3007
02:03:57,020 --> 02:04:06,900
brings more diversity into this field

3008
02:04:01,800 --> 02:04:08,699
and allows more uh customer uh Advantage

3009
02:04:06,899 --> 02:04:10,618
I think customer advantages everything

3010
02:04:08,698 --> 02:04:12,960
and I think the only way to do it is to

3011
02:04:10,618 --> 02:04:16,198
get new stuff and that that gene pool is

3012
02:04:12,960 --> 02:04:19,618
shrinking what's fun is is that I all my

3013
02:04:16,198 --> 02:04:21,539
old stuff is that it's all old stuff and

3014
02:04:19,618 --> 02:04:23,399
and since I've kept it separate it's

3015
02:04:21,539 --> 02:04:26,099
available for folks to enjoy and that's

3016
02:04:23,399 --> 02:04:27,719
what's fun to me I really find that I

3017
02:04:26,099 --> 02:04:29,880
found that I find that so much fun

3018
02:04:27,719 --> 02:04:33,060
because I know how it was when I was a

3019
02:04:29,880 --> 02:04:34,679
kid experiencing these new things for

3020
02:04:33,060 --> 02:04:36,420
the first time and I just want to bring

3021
02:04:34,679 --> 02:04:39,239
that pleasure to people and I don't

3022
02:04:36,420 --> 02:04:41,158
think you can do it by mixing even no

3023
02:04:39,238 --> 02:04:43,319
matter how Landers C and everything are

3024
02:04:41,158 --> 02:04:45,420
that's somebody else let them benefit

3025
02:04:43,319 --> 02:04:48,359
from that let them benefit from that

3026
02:04:45,420 --> 02:04:51,480
Niche and enjoy that which they worked

3027
02:04:48,359 --> 02:04:53,639
very hard for you know now you if

3028
02:04:51,479 --> 02:04:56,098
somebody wants to take their material

3029
02:04:53,639 --> 02:04:57,539
and then they take some of my material

3030
02:04:56,099 --> 02:04:58,920
and they blend them together and they

3031
02:04:57,539 --> 02:05:01,920
come up with something unique for

3032
02:04:58,920 --> 02:05:04,739
themselves that's what we're here for

3033
02:05:01,920 --> 02:05:07,039
that's what we're here for

3034
02:05:04,738 --> 02:05:09,959
I remember uh seeing on your Instagram

3035
02:05:07,039 --> 02:05:12,960
you had mentioned that the Hawaiian

3036
02:05:09,960 --> 02:05:15,599
blush mother really special plant and

3037
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:17,460
something you were hoping to touch on I

3038
02:05:15,599 --> 02:05:19,260
was wondering what about it makes it so

3039
02:05:17,460 --> 02:05:22,260
special to you

3040
02:05:19,260 --> 02:05:24,060
oh the blush yeah the blush is is

3041
02:05:22,260 --> 02:05:26,880
actually a combination of a couple

3042
02:05:24,060 --> 02:05:30,659
different things and it comes from it

3043
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:32,340
there's an old family in Hawaii that has

3044
02:05:30,658 --> 02:05:34,920
some

3045
02:05:32,340 --> 02:05:37,319
quote unquote Hawaiian varieties that

3046
02:05:34,920 --> 02:05:39,779
they kept to themselves and only use for

3047
02:05:37,319 --> 02:05:42,658
themselves and I got some of their work

3048
02:05:39,779 --> 02:05:46,319
it's a composite still of old Island

3049
02:05:42,658 --> 02:05:48,658
strains I believe because I can see a

3050
02:05:46,319 --> 02:05:51,779
couple of different things in it but um

3051
02:05:48,658 --> 02:05:54,779
it is it is Harkens back to the older

3052
02:05:51,779 --> 02:05:58,219
Hawaiians with those very unique Eastern

3053
02:05:54,779 --> 02:06:01,019
flavors uh and and that bright

3054
02:05:58,219 --> 02:06:04,139
effervescent kind of a feel that you get

3055
02:06:01,020 --> 02:06:06,000
when you smoke uh a good Hawaiian for

3056
02:06:04,139 --> 02:06:10,440
the first time where it kind of grows

3057
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:12,840
and feels almost bubbly and effervescent

3058
02:06:10,439 --> 02:06:16,559
you know it really is uh that that kind

3059
02:06:12,840 --> 02:06:19,380
of a feel very alive awake

3060
02:06:16,560 --> 02:06:22,139
um no suppression and mood but very

3061
02:06:19,380 --> 02:06:24,719
almost psychoactive you know just very

3062
02:06:22,139 --> 02:06:26,819
for a younger person that doesn't have

3063
02:06:24,719 --> 02:06:29,579
as much THC in their system as someone

3064
02:06:26,819 --> 02:06:33,238
like me it could be very psychoactive

3065
02:06:29,579 --> 02:06:35,519
and very pleasurable and so using that

3066
02:06:33,238 --> 02:06:36,598
line that they gave me to be able to do

3067
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:39,739
that

3068
02:06:36,599 --> 02:06:43,579
um I mixed it with

3069
02:06:39,738 --> 02:06:43,579
what did I mix it with

3070
02:06:44,340 --> 02:06:50,960
it was a color marker that I used and I

3071
02:06:47,460 --> 02:06:50,960
don't think it had a name

3072
02:06:51,359 --> 02:06:54,719
but the color marker would go back to

3073
02:06:53,760 --> 02:06:57,119
Zen

3074
02:06:54,719 --> 02:06:59,099
the Zen would be the and that's a very

3075
02:06:57,118 --> 02:07:02,219
grapey kind of thing and I used to like

3076
02:06:59,099 --> 02:07:04,739
to use that for a lot of of the flavor

3077
02:07:02,219 --> 02:07:06,599
components that it had and I think that

3078
02:07:04,738 --> 02:07:08,879
that I think the Zen I haven't had my

3079
02:07:06,599 --> 02:07:12,779
notes with me I actually got my notes

3080
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:14,760
but um yeah it it it's a Zen cross and I

3081
02:07:12,779 --> 02:07:16,139
do believe it was Zen

3082
02:07:14,760 --> 02:07:17,940
times

3083
02:07:16,139 --> 02:07:21,060
um Kona sunset

3084
02:07:17,939 --> 02:07:24,000
cross with Zen and that's and that's why

3085
02:07:21,060 --> 02:07:27,599
it was Hawaiian blush because the the

3086
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:29,760
Hawaiian material that was the male that

3087
02:07:27,599 --> 02:07:32,880
I used with it was crossed into that

3088
02:07:29,760 --> 02:07:35,400
female uh of the blend and then that's

3089
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:37,800
where the Hawaiian blush came from it's

3090
02:07:35,399 --> 02:07:40,019
a pretty plant it's really pretty

3091
02:07:37,800 --> 02:07:42,000
I actually Reve that and say that I

3092
02:07:40,020 --> 02:07:45,060
seated the [ __ ] out of it and then I I

3093
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:47,279
revenged it just so that I could grow it

3094
02:07:45,060 --> 02:07:48,960
again because it you know I see these

3095
02:07:47,279 --> 02:07:52,439
dark purples and stuff all the time that

3096
02:07:48,960 --> 02:07:53,698
I do and you just kind of get yeah tired

3097
02:07:52,439 --> 02:07:56,339
of them and then you see something that

3098
02:07:53,698 --> 02:07:59,158
has a nice red here to it like the Reds

3099
02:07:56,340 --> 02:08:02,460
that I've used uh I've been trying to

3100
02:07:59,158 --> 02:08:04,679
develop it's uh those are just exciting

3101
02:08:02,460 --> 02:08:07,739
to me they're new and different showy

3102
02:08:04,679 --> 02:08:11,340
and big plants look really whoa you know

3103
02:08:07,738 --> 02:08:13,678
wow uh and I'm into that I'm into into

3104
02:08:11,340 --> 02:08:16,319
it it being a display I always wanted to

3105
02:08:13,679 --> 02:08:19,260
come up with a a landscaping company

3106
02:08:16,319 --> 02:08:20,880
that would tailor different pots for

3107
02:08:19,260 --> 02:08:23,219
different areas in your yard you could

3108
02:08:20,880 --> 02:08:24,900
have edges and you could have tall wispy

3109
02:08:23,219 --> 02:08:28,760
things and it would just be a beautiful

3110
02:08:24,899 --> 02:08:28,759
yard I always wanted to do that

3111
02:08:30,779 --> 02:08:36,479
I'm gonna convert them to perennials

3112
02:08:34,319 --> 02:08:39,299
well you know that would be nice

3113
02:08:36,479 --> 02:08:41,399
wouldn't it that would be nice yeah well

3114
02:08:39,300 --> 02:08:42,659
that's what everybody always says gooey

3115
02:08:41,399 --> 02:08:45,539
you know how can you make an annual

3116
02:08:42,658 --> 02:08:47,158
about perennial well you you just

3117
02:08:45,539 --> 02:08:49,738
control it

3118
02:08:47,158 --> 02:08:51,839
there you go and I mean while we're on

3119
02:08:49,738 --> 02:08:54,479
the topic of Hawaii one of our patreon

3120
02:08:51,840 --> 02:08:55,860
listeners would love to know if you

3121
02:08:54,479 --> 02:08:58,678
could tell us a little bit more about

3122
02:08:55,859 --> 02:09:00,598
your connection to Hawaii and if there

3123
02:08:58,679 --> 02:09:03,300
are any specific Hawaiian genetics you

3124
02:09:00,599 --> 02:09:06,179
feel really drawn to

3125
02:09:03,300 --> 02:09:08,940
oh I've always liked the big Islands

3126
02:09:06,179 --> 02:09:10,920
material Big Island material always had

3127
02:09:08,939 --> 02:09:12,419
the most punch to me the Maui's were

3128
02:09:10,920 --> 02:09:15,359
cute and bright and

3129
02:09:12,420 --> 02:09:17,760
uh nice and the the quiet electrics were

3130
02:09:15,359 --> 02:09:19,859
always really

3131
02:09:17,760 --> 02:09:22,800
amazing materials

3132
02:09:19,859 --> 02:09:24,658
uh but I don't know the Big Island

3133
02:09:22,800 --> 02:09:28,440
always had the punch to it that really

3134
02:09:24,658 --> 02:09:31,319
set it apart so that kona's the konos I

3135
02:09:28,439 --> 02:09:33,960
was gifted were another old strain that

3136
02:09:31,319 --> 02:09:37,380
has been kept on that island for all

3137
02:09:33,960 --> 02:09:41,039
these years and it's really resistant to

3138
02:09:37,380 --> 02:09:44,400
mold and it grew big and has flavorful

3139
02:09:41,039 --> 02:09:46,439
colas and the punches there I just

3140
02:09:44,399 --> 02:09:48,420
really enjoyed the Kona more than I

3141
02:09:46,439 --> 02:09:50,638
really probably enjoyed anything else

3142
02:09:48,420 --> 02:09:53,460
from Hawaii

3143
02:09:50,639 --> 02:09:55,199
interesting and I mean do you have any

3144
02:09:53,460 --> 02:09:57,300
specific history with Hawaii or it's

3145
02:09:55,198 --> 02:10:00,118
just somewhere you really like

3146
02:09:57,300 --> 02:10:02,460
no actually I have family over there uh

3147
02:10:00,118 --> 02:10:08,399
yeah and I I used to go over there quite

3148
02:10:02,460 --> 02:10:10,800
a bit plus uh uh the the uh on Oahu the

3149
02:10:08,399 --> 02:10:14,158
first dispensary in Hawaii they use some

3150
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:15,960
of my genetics uh so I have a kind of a

3151
02:10:14,158 --> 02:10:20,519
little bit of a

3152
02:10:15,960 --> 02:10:23,460
of a a soft spot for for just a life or

3153
02:10:20,520 --> 02:10:26,820
what it's given for Mom gooey all those

3154
02:10:23,460 --> 02:10:27,960
years ago with the first 1972 Maui wow

3155
02:10:26,819 --> 02:10:28,559
he's

3156
02:10:27,960 --> 02:10:30,899
um

3157
02:10:28,560 --> 02:10:33,780
that uh there's always that kind of

3158
02:10:30,899 --> 02:10:35,879
always was one of those special things

3159
02:10:33,779 --> 02:10:37,019
excuse me my dog needs to go out for a

3160
02:10:35,880 --> 02:10:39,659
second oh

3161
02:10:37,020 --> 02:10:43,199
yeah I had no idea he was there

3162
02:10:39,658 --> 02:10:46,259
yeah he's a 14 year old Dachshund

3163
02:10:43,198 --> 02:10:49,618
miniature doctor beautiful so he's a

3164
02:10:46,260 --> 02:10:52,560
good boy but um yeah I like Hawaii I

3165
02:10:49,618 --> 02:10:54,839
have always liked uh it it to me it was

3166
02:10:52,560 --> 02:10:56,639
always a very challenging place

3167
02:10:54,840 --> 02:10:58,500
for a number of reasons as far as

3168
02:10:56,639 --> 02:11:00,900
growing so it really always attracted my

3169
02:10:58,500 --> 02:11:02,639
attention to that because you really I

3170
02:11:00,899 --> 02:11:05,279
mean the way that Hawaiians

3171
02:11:02,639 --> 02:11:08,340
traditionally grew stuff is they would

3172
02:11:05,279 --> 02:11:10,800
put small plants out up in the hills and

3173
02:11:08,340 --> 02:11:13,380
they would let it go and they would come

3174
02:11:10,800 --> 02:11:15,960
back a few months later and harvest and

3175
02:11:13,380 --> 02:11:18,659
put another one in its place

3176
02:11:15,960 --> 02:11:21,618
um and that was always a very

3177
02:11:18,658 --> 02:11:24,179
interesting dance because of the the

3178
02:11:21,618 --> 02:11:27,299
police that were so Vigilant about

3179
02:11:24,179 --> 02:11:29,399
trying to do the eradications over there

3180
02:11:27,300 --> 02:11:31,920
was always something I always thought

3181
02:11:29,399 --> 02:11:33,539
was wrong so anyway anytime I go into

3182
02:11:31,920 --> 02:11:34,980
the back country I'd really take a few

3183
02:11:33,539 --> 02:11:38,060
seeds and I'd spread them around and

3184
02:11:34,979 --> 02:11:40,559
into the jungles and stuff just

3185
02:11:38,060 --> 02:11:42,599
I've had some people tell me they come

3186
02:11:40,560 --> 02:11:45,300
across the purple plants that I've never

3187
02:11:42,599 --> 02:11:48,179
seen oh okay yeah

3188
02:11:45,300 --> 02:11:50,639
I used to hide stuff I I I go to Hawaii

3189
02:11:48,179 --> 02:11:52,319
whenever I go to Hawaii I always have a

3190
02:11:50,639 --> 02:11:55,260
kind of a

3191
02:11:52,319 --> 02:11:57,479
a hunt for and I hide seeds on the

3192
02:11:55,260 --> 02:11:59,340
island that I give people Clues and they

3193
02:11:57,479 --> 02:12:01,618
go and they search them out and they

3194
02:11:59,340 --> 02:12:04,800
always find them that's a guy a little

3195
02:12:01,618 --> 02:12:06,960
treasure hunt yup yup yup it's always a

3196
02:12:04,800 --> 02:12:08,760
good time I always enjoy doing that and

3197
02:12:06,960 --> 02:12:11,099
I said anybody in the world that goes to

3198
02:12:08,760 --> 02:12:14,280
Hawaii can go there and get them they

3199
02:12:11,099 --> 02:12:16,440
usually make it worth their Wild

3200
02:12:14,279 --> 02:12:18,899
so that's always a fun thing to do in

3201
02:12:16,439 --> 02:12:21,178
Hawaii so yeah I like Hawaii that's

3202

help you out and you gave him that and

3218
02:12:58,198 --> 02:13:02,879
he grew those and then submitted it into

3219
02:13:00,319 --> 02:13:05,460
into uh

3220
02:13:02,880 --> 02:13:06,779
uh the magazine for them to print and

3221
02:13:05,460 --> 02:13:08,520
they ran it and

3222
02:13:06,779 --> 02:13:11,219
so that's

3223
02:13:08,520 --> 02:13:15,000
yeah and there's other references uh

3224
02:13:11,219 --> 02:13:16,439
there in one of the bet 100 best sativas

3225
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:19,020
in the world or something like gooey's

3226
02:13:16,439 --> 02:13:21,839
in there uh there's a there's a whole

3227
02:13:19,020 --> 02:13:23,760
bunch of books and things and I don't

3228
02:13:21,840 --> 02:13:25,078
know it goes on and on I'm just happy to

3229
02:13:23,760 --> 02:13:27,480
be able to give people something to

3230
02:13:25,078 --> 02:13:29,340
photograph and enjoy yeah that's cool to

3231
02:13:27,479 --> 02:13:31,439
hear that's cool to hear we had another

3232
02:13:29,340 --> 02:13:34,139
listener who asked if you had any tips

3233
02:13:31,439 --> 02:13:36,678
on taming really sativa dominant plants

3234
02:13:34,139 --> 02:13:36,679
indoors

3235
02:13:37,679 --> 02:13:40,340
yeah I

3236
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:45,599
it actually it's crazy plant like that

3237
02:13:42,960 --> 02:13:47,880
to grow plant lit method do the plantlet

3238
02:13:45,599 --> 02:13:51,239
method rather than growing full-size

3239
02:13:47,880 --> 02:13:53,760
plants drew a whole bunch of short

3240
02:13:51,238 --> 02:13:55,859
um cuttings and flower those out in Mass

3241
02:13:53,760 --> 02:13:57,900
create a whole carpet full of nothing

3242
02:13:55,859 --> 02:14:00,598
but Bud that ends up only getting about

3243
02:13:57,899 --> 02:14:04,078
three feet tall even on the stretchiest

3244
02:14:00,599 --> 02:14:07,139
stuff start out with two two inch clones

3245
02:14:04,078 --> 02:14:08,880
and flower them directly and even the

3246
02:14:07,139 --> 02:14:10,859
stretchiest plants will only get up to

3247
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:12,840
about you know two or two and a half

3248
02:14:10,859 --> 02:14:14,399
three feet and they'll just be nothing

3249
02:14:12,840 --> 02:14:17,760
but Bud

3250
02:14:14,399 --> 02:14:19,379
lovely I love it the next question I

3251
02:14:17,760 --> 02:14:21,599
actually got from your Instagram page

3252
02:14:19,380 --> 02:14:23,099
beautifully beautifully well thought out

3253
02:14:21,599 --> 02:14:25,920
worded question from one of your

3254
02:14:23,099 --> 02:14:28,078
followers and they wanted to know how do

3255
02:14:25,920 --> 02:14:30,239
breeders effectively work around the

3256
02:14:28,078 --> 02:14:32,279
reality that genetic expressions are

3257
02:14:30,238 --> 02:14:33,658
constantly moving and given change

3258
02:14:32,279 --> 02:14:35,759
especially given changes in

3259
02:14:33,658 --> 02:14:37,859
environmental conditions is this

3260
02:14:35,760 --> 02:14:39,780
something that washes out with the more

3261
02:14:37,859 --> 02:14:44,658
experienced when growing in breeding

3262
02:14:39,779 --> 02:14:44,658
lines or are there more nuances at it

3263
02:14:45,118 --> 02:14:48,658
you know it depends on what you're

3264
02:14:47,158 --> 02:14:51,000
talking about you're breeding with it

3265
02:14:48,658 --> 02:14:53,819
all comes back to the selection of

3266
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:55,198
genetics if you have wide based genetics

3267
02:14:53,819 --> 02:14:57,299
you're going to have wide-based

3268
02:14:55,198 --> 02:14:59,219
Expressions if you have narrow base

3269
02:14:57,300 --> 02:15:01,380
Expressions you're going to have narrow

3270
02:14:59,219 --> 02:15:06,420
Expressions come out that's just how it

3271
02:15:01,380 --> 02:15:09,500
is so my my biggest point I always tell

3272
02:15:06,420 --> 02:15:12,300
people is consistency in selection

3273
02:15:09,500 --> 02:15:15,319
consistency and environment and

3274
02:15:12,300 --> 02:15:18,480
consistency in your

3275
02:15:15,319 --> 02:15:21,479
methods of how you select what you're

3276
02:15:18,479 --> 02:15:23,879
looking for and you will always overcome

3277
02:15:21,479 --> 02:15:26,279
these nuancical things that can come up

3278
02:15:23,880 --> 02:15:28,078
yeah you can't control for an

3279
02:15:26,279 --> 02:15:30,719
environment that changes that's outside

3280
02:15:28,078 --> 02:15:33,719
so you know I always discourage people

3281
02:15:30,719 --> 02:15:36,480
from exclusively breeding outside it's

3282
02:15:33,719 --> 02:15:37,679
something you need to experience and you

3283
02:15:36,479 --> 02:15:39,899
need to do it

3284
02:15:37,679 --> 02:15:41,578
but it's not something that I think

3285
02:15:39,899 --> 02:15:43,799
people need to cut their teeth on I

3286
02:15:41,578 --> 02:15:45,299
think that it's easier to control an

3287
02:15:43,800 --> 02:15:47,760
indoor environment

3288
02:15:45,300 --> 02:15:49,440
where you are learning all those aspects

3289
02:15:47,760 --> 02:15:51,900
and are controlling what you're seeing

3290
02:15:49,439 --> 02:15:54,598
in this expressions of the plant that

3291
02:15:51,899 --> 02:15:56,279
you can then dependably go forward with

3292
02:15:54,599 --> 02:15:58,800
a breeding project that's going to give

3293
02:15:56,279 --> 02:16:02,099
you predictable and and Equitable

3294
02:15:58,800 --> 02:16:03,960
results that's just that's just it all

3295
02:16:02,099 --> 02:16:07,260
goes back to Simple Stuff folks you

3296
02:16:03,960 --> 02:16:09,179
don't make this stuff so complicated and

3297
02:16:07,260 --> 02:16:13,020
don't make it any more than it really

3298
02:16:09,179 --> 02:16:15,719
has to be but it comes back to what

3299
02:16:13,020 --> 02:16:18,540
you're selecting to use for your genetic

3300
02:16:15,719 --> 02:16:20,698
gene pool to work in Period

3301
02:16:18,539 --> 02:16:22,380
it's a lot of these things have the same

3302
02:16:20,698 --> 02:16:25,738
answer they really do

3303
02:16:22,380 --> 02:16:29,279
and I hate that I I hate that it's been

3304
02:16:25,738 --> 02:16:32,879
made to be believed to be so

3305
02:16:29,279 --> 02:16:34,739
uh I I it complicated there's there's

3306
02:16:32,879 --> 02:16:36,718
either two sets of ways of looking at

3307
02:16:34,739 --> 02:16:38,218
breeding from people who don't know

3308
02:16:36,718 --> 02:16:40,759
anything about breeding it seems like

3309
02:16:38,218 --> 02:16:43,319
it's an incredible

3310
02:16:40,760 --> 02:16:45,659
monumentous task and people who are

3311
02:16:43,319 --> 02:16:48,058
breeders but are lazy breeders think

3312
02:16:45,659 --> 02:16:49,439
that pollen chucking is the answer and

3313
02:16:48,058 --> 02:16:51,659
that you're going to hit it right you

3314
02:16:49,439 --> 02:16:54,239
know no matter what and both of those

3315
02:16:51,659 --> 02:16:57,119
are bad ways of looking at things you

3316
02:16:54,239 --> 02:16:59,159
know you that's not how you deal with it

3317
02:16:57,120 --> 02:17:02,280
yeah I understand where you're coming

3318
02:16:59,159 --> 02:17:04,859
from with that one so on to a slightly

3319
02:17:02,280 --> 02:17:06,599
different topic in the past we've had

3320
02:17:04,859 --> 02:17:08,939
some guests on who have discussed how

3321
02:17:06,599 --> 02:17:11,460
there's the emergence of now cannabis

3322
02:17:08,939 --> 02:17:13,800
specific pests like the Cannabis aphid

3323
02:17:11,459 --> 02:17:16,018
you may have heard of and this is just

3324
02:17:13,799 --> 02:17:18,539
one of possibly many cannabis specific

3325
02:17:16,019 --> 02:17:20,099
bugs that we're seeing come out of the

3326
02:17:18,540 --> 02:17:22,500
fact that cannabis has just been grown

3327
02:17:20,099 --> 02:17:24,540
on such large scales do you have any

3328
02:17:22,500 --> 02:17:27,959
thoughts on how we might try to prevent

3329
02:17:24,540 --> 02:17:30,840
more of these superbugs from emerging or

3330
02:17:27,959 --> 02:17:34,199
what can we do to combat it

3331
02:17:30,840 --> 02:17:36,780
boy that's a good question because you

3332
02:17:34,200 --> 02:17:40,500
know a breeder should be using bugs as

3333
02:17:36,780 --> 02:17:42,000
an indicator a breeder should be a bugs

3334
02:17:40,500 --> 02:17:44,579
for a breeder or something different

3335
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:45,420
than they are for anybody else

3336
02:17:44,579 --> 02:17:47,159
um

3337
02:17:45,420 --> 02:17:49,200
bugs tell you

3338
02:17:47,159 --> 02:17:51,539
what plants are

3339
02:17:49,200 --> 02:17:54,300
the preferred plants before they have

3340
02:17:51,540 --> 02:17:56,519
the plants are ever expressed if you

3341
02:17:54,299 --> 02:17:58,259
have a group of plants like this this

3342
02:17:56,519 --> 02:18:00,719
set right here that I just showed you

3343
02:17:58,260 --> 02:18:03,059
the microbreeding if I go through those

3344
02:18:00,718 --> 02:18:04,678
there will be plants that have more bugs

3345
02:18:03,058 --> 02:18:07,199
because they're outside and there will

3346
02:18:04,679 --> 02:18:09,478
be more plants with bugs on it that

3347
02:18:07,200 --> 02:18:11,280
wants to have more bugs are the ones

3348
02:18:09,478 --> 02:18:14,760
that are going to be sharper flavors

3349
02:18:11,280 --> 02:18:18,420
heavier Highs but more pronounced highs

3350
02:18:14,760 --> 02:18:21,540
the bugs know this before they even get

3351
02:18:18,420 --> 02:18:23,519
to this stage and so I always tell

3352
02:18:21,540 --> 02:18:25,320
people pay attention to bugs if you're a

3353
02:18:23,519 --> 02:18:27,540
breeder because they're telling you

3354
02:18:25,319 --> 02:18:29,879
they're pointing away early on

3355
02:18:27,540 --> 02:18:33,059
uh it's pretty amazing

3356
02:18:29,879 --> 02:18:34,558
having said that uh when you get into

3357
02:18:33,058 --> 02:18:37,199
commercial stuff

3358
02:18:34,558 --> 02:18:40,619
uh you're you're starting to become a

3359
02:18:37,200 --> 02:18:43,380
real issue with uh stuff like that

3360
02:18:40,620 --> 02:18:47,219
in indoor crops where they can have free

3361
02:18:43,379 --> 02:18:49,138
reign I've always found that

3362
02:18:47,218 --> 02:18:51,839
if I've had a problem with something

3363
02:18:49,138 --> 02:18:55,858
that I needed to control natural methods

3364
02:18:51,840 --> 02:18:57,420
seem to be as good as

3365
02:18:55,859 --> 02:19:00,899
um chemical methods

3366
02:18:57,420 --> 02:19:03,719
as far as oh let's say you know oil on

3367
02:19:00,898 --> 02:19:05,819
spider mites you know tends to do the

3368
02:19:03,718 --> 02:19:06,358
trick better than

3369
02:19:05,819 --> 02:19:08,939
um

3370
02:19:06,359 --> 02:19:11,040
spreading poisons around that linger and

3371
02:19:08,939 --> 02:19:13,800
stay in and seep into the plant and you

3372
02:19:11,040 --> 02:19:15,660
ingest it will ultimately but no I don't

3373
02:19:13,799 --> 02:19:18,239
have any magic answers for that but

3374
02:19:15,659 --> 02:19:19,700
again I'm not the right person to ask

3375
02:19:18,239 --> 02:19:21,840
for that

3376
02:19:19,700 --> 02:19:24,059
I'm really not

3377
02:19:21,840 --> 02:19:26,058
that's not my job my job is not

3378
02:19:24,058 --> 02:19:28,739
production my job is not producing

3379
02:19:26,058 --> 02:19:30,779
beautiful thick plants that are going to

3380
02:19:28,739 --> 02:19:33,659
be sold in stores and stuff that's not

3381
02:19:30,780 --> 02:19:36,899
my that's not my purpose my purpose is

3382
02:19:33,659 --> 02:19:40,679
to design this stuff so that you can

3383
02:19:36,898 --> 02:19:42,478
take it and do that end of it so I'm not

3384
02:19:40,679 --> 02:19:43,579
the best person to ask about stuff like

3385
02:19:42,478 --> 02:19:46,500
that

3386
02:19:43,579 --> 02:19:48,299
so I mean there's another sort of

3387
02:19:46,500 --> 02:19:50,879
similar discussion not really similar

3388
02:19:48,299 --> 02:19:52,619
but uh it's somewhat related I guess in

3389
02:19:50,879 --> 02:19:55,739
the sense that people are talking about

3390
02:19:52,620 --> 02:19:57,540
male sex stability and using these males

3391
02:19:55,739 --> 02:19:59,520
as pollen donors and I wanted to ask you

3392
02:19:57,540 --> 02:20:02,280
specifically have you ever bred with

3393
02:19:59,520 --> 02:20:04,319
males that show some amount of female

3394
02:20:02,280 --> 02:20:07,560
expression or do you think that's just

3395
02:20:04,319 --> 02:20:10,020
shitty intersex traits shouldn't use it

3396
02:20:07,559 --> 02:20:13,260
I I don't I don't use them I and

3397
02:20:10,020 --> 02:20:16,260
whenever I see it I I even I've I've

3398
02:20:13,260 --> 02:20:18,540
heard all the accolades about they tend

3399
02:20:16,260 --> 02:20:21,960
to fail you know favor female you know

3400
02:20:18,540 --> 02:20:24,720
expressions and and all of that and uh

3401
02:20:21,959 --> 02:20:28,639
to me it's dirty genetics it's just

3402
02:20:24,719 --> 02:20:32,519
dirty genetics because I don't care how

3403
02:20:28,639 --> 02:20:34,559
good the quality is or how it is if

3404
02:20:32,520 --> 02:20:37,579
you've got it in a mass and you're

3405
02:20:34,559 --> 02:20:40,559
trying to do something

3406
02:20:37,579 --> 02:20:42,600
on an industrial scale we're doing that

3407
02:20:40,559 --> 02:20:44,818
and yeah genetic like that in there

3408
02:20:42,600 --> 02:20:46,559
you're ruining that whole rock or you're

3409
02:20:44,818 --> 02:20:49,818
tainting that whole crop or you're

3410
02:20:46,559 --> 02:20:52,760
influencing that whole crop and to me

3411
02:20:49,818 --> 02:20:56,398
getting rid of any inner

3412
02:20:52,760 --> 02:20:59,398
intersexing at all is so important I

3413
02:20:56,398 --> 02:21:01,500
have done it for years dealing with when

3414
02:20:59,398 --> 02:21:03,659
Guru is being developed because the tie

3415
02:21:01,500 --> 02:21:05,639
had a tendency to show some

3416
02:21:03,659 --> 02:21:08,879
hermaphrodism if it was pushed any at

3417
02:21:05,639 --> 02:21:11,340
all and and that would be the case I had

3418
02:21:08,879 --> 02:21:13,978
to breed that out of subsequent gooey

3419
02:21:11,340 --> 02:21:15,780
stuff because you know even in uh even

3420
02:21:13,978 --> 02:21:18,119
in the the later stages of growing the

3421
02:21:15,780 --> 02:21:20,100
pure gooey and designing the pure GUI it

3422
02:21:18,120 --> 02:21:22,200
was very

3423
02:21:20,100 --> 02:21:25,380
um much something that I had to watch

3424
02:21:22,200 --> 02:21:27,359
for because recesses would merge and

3425
02:21:25,379 --> 02:21:28,739
they would come in and then you'd all of

3426
02:21:27,359 --> 02:21:31,020
a sudden you'd see expressions and it

3427
02:21:28,739 --> 02:21:33,359
would change uh sometimes you'd see them

3428
02:21:31,020 --> 02:21:36,720
very early other times you'd see them

3429
02:21:33,359 --> 02:21:39,659
really late in Flowery anything that

3430
02:21:36,719 --> 02:21:41,279
displayed anything like that at all was

3431
02:21:39,659 --> 02:21:43,260
immediately removed from the gene pool

3432
02:21:41,280 --> 02:21:45,300
that's how I do it

3433
02:21:43,260 --> 02:21:47,818
look on that topic of removing things

3434
02:21:45,299 --> 02:21:50,039
from the gene pool I know that you you

3435
02:21:47,818 --> 02:21:51,898
end up you know not releasing a good

3436
02:21:50,040 --> 02:21:53,939
majority of the things you end up making

3437
02:21:51,898 --> 02:21:55,978
because you decide oh you're not up to

3438
02:21:53,939 --> 02:21:57,960
scratch if you had to put a number on it

3439
02:21:55,978 --> 02:22:00,318
what percentage of crosses do you think

3440
02:21:57,959 --> 02:22:02,279
don't make the cut for you

3441
02:22:00,318 --> 02:22:04,920
95

3442
02:22:02,280 --> 02:22:07,680
wow very strict I like it

3443
02:22:04,920 --> 02:22:10,439
oh no no seriously I'm dead serious

3444
02:22:07,680 --> 02:22:12,840
about that almost everything that you

3445
02:22:10,439 --> 02:22:14,760
see won't make it past the second the

3446
02:22:12,840 --> 02:22:18,000
second uh

3447
02:22:14,760 --> 02:22:19,680
set of tests everything out there that I

3448
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:22,859
shown on Instagram and stuff is all

3449
02:22:19,680 --> 02:22:25,739
great first F1 material that

3450
02:22:22,859 --> 02:22:28,800
that you can see that particular strain

3451
02:22:25,739 --> 02:22:31,318
giving that particular expression but it

3452
02:22:28,799 --> 02:22:34,519
goes through another set of tests and

3453
02:22:31,318 --> 02:22:36,898
those are put through riggers for stress

3454
02:22:34,520 --> 02:22:40,939
for uh different

3455
02:22:36,898 --> 02:22:40,939
um uh types of of

3456
02:22:40,978 --> 02:22:46,500
uh tolerances for nutrient and stuff

3457
02:22:44,398 --> 02:22:48,719
like that because everybody knows I

3458
02:22:46,500 --> 02:22:50,219
don't like to spend money I'm cheap as

3459
02:22:48,719 --> 02:22:53,099
hell and so

3460
02:22:50,219 --> 02:22:55,318
I build in that economy into these

3461
02:22:53,100 --> 02:22:57,239
plants so that I get complaints all the

3462
02:22:55,318 --> 02:23:00,059
time about people saying that they they

3463
02:22:57,239 --> 02:23:02,520
my plants burn easy don't use as much

3464
02:23:00,059 --> 02:23:05,459
that's it they will produce just as much

3465
02:23:02,520 --> 02:23:08,340
with half of the nutrient and they're

3466
02:23:05,459 --> 02:23:10,199
designed to do that because I don't want

3467
02:23:08,340 --> 02:23:12,239
to spend a lot of money on nutrients and

3468
02:23:10,200 --> 02:23:14,819
expensive stuff when I don't need it and

3469
02:23:12,239 --> 02:23:17,398
I can get the same thing with half

3470
02:23:14,818 --> 02:23:19,619
so they're designed to be to be

3471
02:23:17,398 --> 02:23:22,139
sensitive like that because you don't

3472
02:23:19,620 --> 02:23:25,800
need that you know I'll save you money

3473
02:23:22,139 --> 02:23:29,939
again it's for the customer

3474
02:23:25,799 --> 02:23:31,438
gosh it's so easy an act of service it's

3475
02:23:29,939 --> 02:23:33,780
interesting you raised that point

3476
02:23:31,439 --> 02:23:36,180
because there's currently a discussion

3477
02:23:33,780 --> 02:23:38,399
on the Instagram Community about like

3478
02:23:36,180 --> 02:23:40,500
what is due diligence with testing and

3479
02:23:38,398 --> 02:23:42,358
and sort of to summarize that people are

3480
02:23:40,500 --> 02:23:44,040
like yeah it's all well and good if you

3481
02:23:42,359 --> 02:23:45,960
test your plants and get good results

3482
02:23:44,040 --> 02:23:47,700
but you've got to give it to the

3483
02:23:45,959 --> 02:23:49,559
shittest grower there is because they're

3484
02:23:47,700 --> 02:23:52,020
going to expose it to stuff you're not

3485
02:23:49,559 --> 02:23:54,659
gonna blah blah blah to me I wasn't so

3486
02:23:52,020 --> 02:23:56,220
sold on that idea do you think testing

3487
02:23:54,659 --> 02:23:57,478
things yourself and if it passes that's

3488
02:23:56,219 --> 02:24:00,920
good enough or do you think you really

3489
02:23:57,478 --> 02:24:00,920
have to stress it out a bit

3490
02:24:01,159 --> 02:24:04,859
great question and here's the answer

3491
02:24:03,299 --> 02:24:08,159
that's simple and I've already actually

3492
02:24:04,859 --> 02:24:10,079
touched on it again I don't use anything

3493
02:24:08,159 --> 02:24:15,420
but soil and cow [ __ ]

3494
02:24:10,079 --> 02:24:20,219
that's it so my stuff is all designed

3495
02:24:15,420 --> 02:24:21,960
around that basic mix because let's just

3496
02:24:20,219 --> 02:24:23,879
say that no one someone who doesn't know

3497
02:24:21,959 --> 02:24:25,500
and I've said this many times to many

3498
02:24:23,879 --> 02:24:27,420
people online before

3499
02:24:25,500 --> 02:24:28,920
that everything is geared towards the

3500
02:24:27,420 --> 02:24:31,920
person who doesn't know what they're

3501
02:24:28,920 --> 02:24:33,840
doing to still get Optimum results for

3502
02:24:31,920 --> 02:24:36,120
as little effort as they're going to put

3503
02:24:33,840 --> 02:24:37,680
into it because a lot of us know that

3504
02:24:36,120 --> 02:24:40,500
there's people out there that kill

3505
02:24:37,680 --> 02:24:42,059
plants they just kill them they kill

3506
02:24:40,500 --> 02:24:45,840
them with kindness they kill them with

3507
02:24:42,059 --> 02:24:49,219
with uh carrying they kill them with uh

3508
02:24:45,840 --> 02:24:54,478
um just an over sense of love and and

3509
02:24:49,219 --> 02:24:56,159
this is um designed for people who are

3510
02:24:54,478 --> 02:24:57,959
the other end of that spectrum they kill

3511
02:24:56,159 --> 02:24:59,579
them because they're lazy they're

3512
02:24:57,959 --> 02:25:01,500
killing them because they don't pay

3513
02:24:59,579 --> 02:25:03,840
attention to them they're killing them

3514
02:25:01,500 --> 02:25:06,780
because they didn't give them enough of

3515
02:25:03,840 --> 02:25:10,500
what it was to do what it is that's why

3516
02:25:06,780 --> 02:25:12,239
less less nutrients are needed and you

3517
02:25:10,500 --> 02:25:15,659
get the same expressions with full

3518
02:25:12,239 --> 02:25:18,539
plants big flowers nice resin good

3519
02:25:15,659 --> 02:25:22,200
flavor and it was just soil and couch

3520
02:25:18,540 --> 02:25:23,640
[ __ ] so I'm already designing for the

3521
02:25:22,200 --> 02:25:25,439
base

3522
02:25:23,639 --> 02:25:28,260
that you're talking about

3523
02:25:25,439 --> 02:25:30,300
and that people that's why I tell people

3524
02:25:28,260 --> 02:25:32,040
I tell you that there's people out there

3525
02:25:30,299 --> 02:25:33,898
that do amazing things with my stuff

3526
02:25:32,040 --> 02:25:35,760
that I can't even do

3527
02:25:33,898 --> 02:25:38,099
you know that's the other end of that

3528
02:25:35,760 --> 02:25:40,439
spectrum that they took it to that next

3529
02:25:38,100 --> 02:25:43,380
level that the plant was able to handle

3530
02:25:40,439 --> 02:25:46,620
and you and utilize the maximum and they

3531
02:25:43,379 --> 02:25:49,559
got even better than what would happen

3532
02:25:46,620 --> 02:25:51,720
if cow with cow [ __ ] and soil but

3533
02:25:49,559 --> 02:25:54,898
everything is geared towards couch and

3534
02:25:51,719 --> 02:25:57,478
soil so yeah I've already built in those

3535
02:25:54,898 --> 02:26:00,539
designs for these seeds that's exactly

3536
02:25:57,478 --> 02:26:04,379
what is is I'm meant to do is to make it

3537
02:26:00,540 --> 02:26:05,520
easy for the simplest person to get the

3538
02:26:04,379 --> 02:26:08,059
best results

3539
02:26:05,520 --> 02:26:12,120
so yeah yeah that's a

3540
02:26:08,059 --> 02:26:14,159
that's that that's what you do yeah and

3541
02:26:12,120 --> 02:26:16,079
look you just gave me a great segue

3542
02:26:14,159 --> 02:26:18,000
because you you spoke about people doing

3543
02:26:16,079 --> 02:26:20,039
really well with your work and you

3544
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:22,859
reference Joel of Northstar earlier and

3545
02:26:20,040 --> 02:26:24,000
I wanted to bring that out quickly and

3546
02:26:22,859 --> 02:26:26,880
just sort of ask

3547
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:28,318
I I see he does a lot of uh projects

3548
02:26:26,879 --> 02:26:30,659
with your lines in them and they look

3549
02:26:28,318 --> 02:26:32,699
great and it got me sort of wondering is

3550
02:26:30,659 --> 02:26:34,439
there any distinct differences between

3551
02:26:32,700 --> 02:26:36,899
your work like if he did a cross that

3552
02:26:34,439 --> 02:26:38,520
used two of your lines is that sort of

3553
02:26:36,898 --> 02:26:42,898
just like a gooey breeder strain in a

3554
02:26:38,520 --> 02:26:46,620
way yeah it is it's a let me let me let

3555
02:26:42,898 --> 02:26:48,659
me address that because Joel and and Jen

3556
02:26:46,620 --> 02:26:50,880
are just they're phenomenal people and

3557
02:26:48,659 --> 02:26:53,818
they really are they know what they're

3558
02:26:50,879 --> 02:26:57,959
doing they're good at what they do and

3559
02:26:53,818 --> 02:27:00,659
he's using a diverse enough genetic set

3560
02:26:57,959 --> 02:27:03,239
that he's making totally different stuff

3561
02:27:00,659 --> 02:27:05,340
than what I'm making he's going in a

3562
02:27:03,239 --> 02:27:07,318
different direction he does tend to have

3563
02:27:05,340 --> 02:27:09,120
a tendency to use some of the more

3564
02:27:07,318 --> 02:27:11,398
commercial stuff in his some of his

3565
02:27:09,120 --> 02:27:15,899
lines but not always

3566
02:27:11,398 --> 02:27:19,019
um and uh I just I I just really think

3567
02:27:15,898 --> 02:27:21,659
that he's got a different expression

3568
02:27:19,020 --> 02:27:23,760
up to the point where like let's call

3569
02:27:21,659 --> 02:27:27,659
let's just and he will say this too

3570
02:27:23,760 --> 02:27:29,100
dirty little secret is his one of his

3571
02:27:27,659 --> 02:27:30,959
most famous strains and it's actually

3572
02:27:29,100 --> 02:27:33,540
the one that I was speaking with with

3573
02:27:30,959 --> 02:27:35,099
Mark Emery talking about how he thought

3574
02:27:33,540 --> 02:27:38,939
that was some of the best part he's ever

3575
02:27:35,100 --> 02:27:41,040
tasted well that's dark desire and and

3576
02:27:38,939 --> 02:27:44,220
purple Mayhem and those are both mine

3577
02:27:41,040 --> 02:27:46,020
and Joel acknowledges that whenever he

3578
02:27:44,219 --> 02:27:47,818
you know somebody asked him he says well

3579
02:27:46,020 --> 02:27:51,420
basically it's a gooey strain you know

3580
02:27:47,818 --> 02:27:54,000
it's just he just maestroed it with the

3581
02:27:51,420 --> 02:27:56,280
masterful skill that he has into a

3582
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:58,079
wonderful set of selections that he

3583
02:27:56,280 --> 02:28:01,380
didn't you know was able to cross and do

3584
02:27:58,079 --> 02:28:04,620
it but you know I I support that kind of

3585
02:28:01,379 --> 02:28:06,420
thing I want him to you know he I think

3586
02:28:04,620 --> 02:28:09,240
he was even going to keep that going

3587
02:28:06,420 --> 02:28:10,739
just because he wanted to have that set

3588
02:28:09,239 --> 02:28:13,079
of genetics because it gets so much

3589
02:28:10,739 --> 02:28:15,299
attention it brings so much people into

3590
02:28:13,079 --> 02:28:17,818
the fold they get a little bit of gooey

3591
02:28:15,299 --> 02:28:19,739
breeder that they've heard about and

3592
02:28:17,818 --> 02:28:21,779
it's he makes it much more readily

3593
02:28:19,739 --> 02:28:23,159
available than I do and so they get a

3594
02:28:21,780 --> 02:28:25,439
little bit of that but then they get to

3595
02:28:23,159 --> 02:28:27,840
experience his stuff and his and his

3596
02:28:25,439 --> 02:28:30,059
things that he's designed in conjunction

3597
02:28:27,840 --> 02:28:32,100
with that and and then so he benefits

3598
02:28:30,059 --> 02:28:34,978
from that and I think that that's just

3599
02:28:32,100 --> 02:28:37,559
exactly what I gave him the genetics

3600
02:28:34,978 --> 02:28:39,358
because they're good people uh I love

3601
02:28:37,559 --> 02:28:41,639
them to death and I want him to be

3602
02:28:39,359 --> 02:28:43,680
successful and somebody's got to carry

3603
02:28:41,639 --> 02:28:46,019
this [ __ ] on when I croak I mean really

3604
02:28:43,680 --> 02:28:48,000
I mean he's I was kind of hoping that

3605
02:28:46,020 --> 02:28:50,220
he'd help carry the mantle among other

3606
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:52,439
breeders you know and just keep it going

3607
02:28:50,219 --> 02:28:55,879
and keep the brand alive

3608
02:28:52,439 --> 02:28:59,280
so you know but he's tired

3609
02:28:55,879 --> 02:29:02,639
those guys work their butts off I mean

3610
02:28:59,280 --> 02:29:03,359
Jen's in Philadelphia right now uh at a

3611
02:29:02,639 --> 02:29:05,519
show

3612
02:29:03,359 --> 02:29:09,239
so they're far flung they go to New

3613
02:29:05,520 --> 02:29:10,680
Jersey uh to go to shows and uh the last

3614
02:29:09,239 --> 02:29:13,680
one they tried to do there was canceled

3615
02:29:10,680 --> 02:29:14,760
but I mean uh you know it cost them a

3616
02:29:13,680 --> 02:29:16,439
bunch of money but they're out there

3617
02:29:14,760 --> 02:29:18,960
getting it trying to get it done you

3618
02:29:16,439 --> 02:29:20,880
know and and I admire that they work

3619
02:29:18,959 --> 02:29:23,579
well together they're a good team and I

3620
02:29:20,879 --> 02:29:24,719
think that they're somebody that people

3621
02:29:23,579 --> 02:29:27,180
ought to uh

3622
02:29:24,719 --> 02:29:29,279
experience more of their stuff yeah

3623
02:29:27,180 --> 02:29:30,600
definitely I've always looked at their

3624
02:29:29,280 --> 02:29:32,280
work and thought it looks really

3625
02:29:30,600 --> 02:29:34,800
interesting and there's unique

3626
02:29:32,280 --> 02:29:36,060
combinations in there and you sort of

3627
02:29:34,799 --> 02:29:38,099
just touched on you know yeah as a

3628
02:29:36,059 --> 02:29:39,898
community we've we've had some some

3629
02:29:38,100 --> 02:29:42,059
struggles you know with shows being

3630
02:29:39,898 --> 02:29:44,519
canceled things like that it affects

3631
02:29:42,059 --> 02:29:46,139
everyone in different ways and sort of

3632
02:29:44,520 --> 02:29:48,180
something I realized they were parallels

3633
02:29:46,139 --> 02:29:51,299
with is during covert we've also had a

3634
02:29:48,180 --> 02:29:53,639
sort of a cannabis plant covered in the

3635
02:29:51,299 --> 02:29:56,099
sense that the hot plate and virus has

3636
02:29:53,639 --> 02:29:57,959
really taken a Stranglehold on the

3637
02:29:56,100 --> 02:29:59,760
community over the past two years that

3638
02:29:57,959 --> 02:30:01,318
we've been dealing with covert I know

3639
02:29:59,760 --> 02:30:03,300
you don't bring in a lot of genetics to

3640
02:30:01,318 --> 02:30:05,519
your library but have you had any

3641
02:30:03,299 --> 02:30:10,379
experiences with it at all

3642
02:30:05,520 --> 02:30:12,000
nope not a thing not a thing nope very

3643
02:30:10,379 --> 02:30:14,099
lucky very lucky I guess a good reason

3644
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:15,898
why to keep your stuff to you and don't

3645
02:30:14,100 --> 02:30:18,180
bring external in

3646
02:30:15,898 --> 02:30:20,760
well you know and I also too I I do

3647
02:30:18,180 --> 02:30:23,220
Harden everything so that you know it's

3648
02:30:20,760 --> 02:30:25,739
within itself it's very strong so that

3649
02:30:23,219 --> 02:30:27,539
it can withstand you know attacks and

3650
02:30:25,739 --> 02:30:30,299
you know when people sit there and say

3651
02:30:27,540 --> 02:30:32,100
oh you know it attracts powdery mildew

3652
02:30:30,299 --> 02:30:34,679
and stuff yeah there are some genetics

3653
02:30:32,100 --> 02:30:37,559
in there that are prone to that

3654
02:30:34,680 --> 02:30:40,559
unfortunately mom GUI in her later

3655
02:30:37,559 --> 02:30:43,559
periods of life has become

3656
02:30:40,559 --> 02:30:46,619
uh much more prone to possibly getting

3657
02:30:43,559 --> 02:30:48,478
it but if you control the bloom then it

3658
02:30:46,620 --> 02:30:51,720
it might as well not have it you know as

3659
02:30:48,478 --> 02:30:53,818
far as that goes and so I just figure uh

3660
02:30:51,719 --> 02:30:54,840
at this stage with her age and

3661
02:30:53,818 --> 02:30:57,898
everything and the way the

3662
02:30:54,840 --> 02:31:01,040
susceptibility is uh that you just kind

3663
02:30:57,898 --> 02:31:03,898
of gotta control it rather than try to

3664
02:31:01,040 --> 02:31:06,060
breed it out of it because quite frankly

3665
02:31:03,898 --> 02:31:08,699
there are just some things that follow

3666
02:31:06,059 --> 02:31:10,619
along the very desirable lines that

3667
02:31:08,700 --> 02:31:13,620
you're you're gonna it's gonna take a

3668
02:31:10,620 --> 02:31:16,979
while to breed out specifically and keep

3669
02:31:13,620 --> 02:31:18,960
the good stuff and yeah I've had a mixed

3670
02:31:16,978 --> 02:31:21,179
results with doing that with plants

3671
02:31:18,959 --> 02:31:27,079
where there's some stuff that you just

3672
02:31:21,180 --> 02:31:27,079
can't you can't get rid of and in in in

3673
02:31:27,379 --> 02:31:31,559
gooey stuff powdery mildew can be an

3674
02:31:30,299 --> 02:31:33,840
issue

3675
02:31:31,559 --> 02:31:36,239
now other people have had it had really

3676
02:31:33,840 --> 02:31:37,859
great success in mold prone environments

3677
02:31:36,239 --> 02:31:40,079
with their

3678
02:31:37,859 --> 02:31:43,439
um you know they say it's very strong

3679
02:31:40,079 --> 02:31:45,120
so I I you know I I can't speak to that

3680
02:31:43,439 --> 02:31:47,639
because I can't see it you know and

3681
02:31:45,120 --> 02:31:50,700
that's anecdotal at best

3682
02:31:47,639 --> 02:31:54,119
um so I can only speak from what I see

3683
02:31:50,700 --> 02:31:57,000
and that's there that's it in a nutshell

3684
02:31:54,120 --> 02:31:58,800
yeah sure makes sense makes sense

3685
02:31:57,000 --> 02:32:00,898
so I was curious I've seen you've been

3686
02:31:58,799 --> 02:32:02,938
posting recently about a strain called

3687
02:32:00,898 --> 02:32:04,920
Island fire and I remember a few years

3688
02:32:02,939 --> 02:32:07,020
back I grew out one of your freebies

3689
02:32:04,920 --> 02:32:09,059
called Island mix and it was beautiful

3690
02:32:07,020 --> 02:32:11,159
Australian very tropical great structure

3691
02:32:09,059 --> 02:32:13,559
I was wondering did the island mix

3692
02:32:11,159 --> 02:32:18,659
somehow make it into the island fire

3693
02:32:13,559 --> 02:32:22,920
nope nope that that Island fire uses the

3694
02:32:18,659 --> 02:32:27,119
same genetics uh that went into

3695
02:32:22,920 --> 02:32:29,100
uh uh the Kona sunset uh in in the pure

3696
02:32:27,120 --> 02:32:33,020
Kona I do believe

3697
02:32:29,100 --> 02:32:36,600
uh went into Island fire along with a

3698
02:32:33,020 --> 02:32:42,079
subset from the death grip line that was

3699
02:32:36,600 --> 02:32:45,359
really purple uh it had a really strong

3700
02:32:42,079 --> 02:32:47,359
initial feel to it like it would just

3701
02:32:45,359 --> 02:32:50,159
grab you and Shake you right off the bat

3702
02:32:47,359 --> 02:32:54,659
and then leave a very very noticeable

3703
02:32:50,159 --> 02:32:57,719
long-lasting Buzz to it and uh so I use

3704
02:32:54,659 --> 02:33:01,680
that uh and

3705
02:32:57,719 --> 02:33:05,279
I I I got the balance right I think

3706
02:33:01,680 --> 02:33:07,318
it's just a little bit hairy still Leaf

3707
02:33:05,280 --> 02:33:10,079
wise for me

3708
02:33:07,318 --> 02:33:12,539
um as a whole so I I was had hopes of

3709
02:33:10,079 --> 02:33:14,520
releasing that line and now I'm thinking

3710
02:33:12,540 --> 02:33:17,460
I'm going to refine it a little bit more

3711
02:33:14,520 --> 02:33:19,939
and get rid of some of the because the

3712
02:33:17,459 --> 02:33:22,679
best plants are a little leafy I think

3713
02:33:19,939 --> 02:33:24,120
for my taste and you could trim it out

3714
02:33:22,680 --> 02:33:26,340
and it would be fine and it's beautiful

3715
02:33:24,120 --> 02:33:31,079
stuff very very

3716
02:33:26,340 --> 02:33:33,898
distinct coloring uh towering huge colas

3717
02:33:31,079 --> 02:33:37,020
uh very nice but

3718
02:33:33,898 --> 02:33:39,000
it still needs a little more work

3719
02:33:37,020 --> 02:33:42,180
so it's look it's good to hear it's it's

3720
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:44,159
almost there and yeah

3721
02:33:42,180 --> 02:33:45,960
another one of our patreon submitted

3722
02:33:44,159 --> 02:33:47,639
questions was they were wondering what

3723
02:33:45,959 --> 02:33:49,799
are the genetics behind the black rafter

3724
02:33:47,639 --> 02:33:51,420
and what sort of traits would crosses

3725
02:33:49,799 --> 02:33:52,559
with black Raptor and it bring to the

3726
02:33:51,420 --> 02:33:54,299
table I think they're trying to figure

3727
02:33:52,559 --> 02:33:55,379
out which cross is going to be best for

3728
02:33:54,299 --> 02:33:58,619
them

3729
02:33:55,379 --> 02:34:01,139
black Raptors based on uh midnight snow

3730
02:33:58,620 --> 02:34:04,740
and black raptor is basically a dark

3731
02:34:01,139 --> 02:34:09,019
midnight snow but it has a definite uh

3732
02:34:04,739 --> 02:34:12,299
heavier feel to it it's really aromatic

3733
02:34:09,020 --> 02:34:15,659
uh the flavors are along the same lines

3734
02:34:12,299 --> 02:34:18,719
but the the Raptor's a lot heavier

3735
02:34:15,659 --> 02:34:21,359
um and I use the uh people might

3736
02:34:18,719 --> 02:34:23,898
remember a lemon purple male that I had

3737
02:34:21,359 --> 02:34:27,479
that was just about black

3738
02:34:23,898 --> 02:34:30,358
uh and a beautiful

3739
02:34:27,478 --> 02:34:34,438
sunning kind of a expression of coal a

3740
02:34:30,359 --> 02:34:38,040
black Cola really long I love that plant

3741
02:34:34,439 --> 02:34:40,979
as far as that goes and it is that that

3742
02:34:38,040 --> 02:34:42,899
plant I crossed with

3743
02:34:40,978 --> 02:34:46,199
a

3744
02:34:42,898 --> 02:34:49,199
midnight snow dark desire

3745
02:34:46,200 --> 02:34:53,220
old Mendo Haze and gooey

3746
02:34:49,200 --> 02:34:55,859
and that made the flavor really

3747
02:34:53,219 --> 02:34:59,159
pronounced and really heavy as far as a

3748
02:34:55,859 --> 02:35:03,659
bright in your face kind of a of a

3749
02:34:59,159 --> 02:35:08,700
flavor and then use them the male purple

3750
02:35:03,659 --> 02:35:11,459
uh lemon purple in and mix with that and

3751
02:35:08,700 --> 02:35:16,200
then that one was the father of the

3752
02:35:11,459 --> 02:35:18,318
black Raptor and it was hit to a pure

3753
02:35:16,200 --> 02:35:18,319
um

3754
02:35:18,540 --> 02:35:23,760
um midnight snow

3755
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:27,239
so it set the color it set the flavor

3756
02:35:23,760 --> 02:35:31,680
and it just deepened the smell deepened

3757
02:35:27,239 --> 02:35:34,260
the the effect and midnight snow is

3758
02:35:31,680 --> 02:35:35,760
already around 24 I think black backer

3759
02:35:34,260 --> 02:35:39,659
is a little higher

3760
02:35:35,760 --> 02:35:41,520
but it's really a nice a nice I always

3761
02:35:39,659 --> 02:35:43,978
like it in the morning because it's it's

3762
02:35:41,520 --> 02:35:45,540
such a bright it's like it's not it's

3763
02:35:43,978 --> 02:35:47,279
not doesn't taste like orange juice but

3764
02:35:45,540 --> 02:35:49,280
it has that same effect as drinking your

3765
02:35:47,280 --> 02:35:51,420
glass of orange juice it's really bright

3766
02:35:49,280 --> 02:35:54,420
effervescent in the mouth and really

3767
02:35:51,420 --> 02:35:58,200
opens your eyes and gets your day going

3768
02:35:54,420 --> 02:35:59,818
oh lovely lovely another interesting uh

3769
02:35:58,200 --> 02:36:02,399
sort of genetic component I'd seen you

3770
02:35:59,818 --> 02:36:04,318
working with was the cinnamon that

3771
02:36:02,398 --> 02:36:06,478
caught my eye I'm like such a die-hard

3772
02:36:04,318 --> 02:36:08,519
cinnamon fan I was just wondering what

3773
02:36:06,478 --> 02:36:09,779
genetics are in that and is it truly

3774
02:36:08,520 --> 02:36:13,319
cinnamon

3775
02:36:09,780 --> 02:36:17,460
no no no it is not and the cinnamon

3776
02:36:13,318 --> 02:36:20,039
actually came not from The Taste but it

3777
02:36:17,459 --> 02:36:22,679
was described as cinnamon from the look

3778
02:36:20,040 --> 02:36:25,680
and color that it would come from

3779
02:36:22,680 --> 02:36:29,100
because it had a lot of Amber to the

3780
02:36:25,680 --> 02:36:31,620
resin right off the bat and so it was a

3781
02:36:29,100 --> 02:36:34,859
cinnamon color bud when you kind of

3782
02:36:31,620 --> 02:36:38,280
dried it and and got it ready but the

3783
02:36:34,859 --> 02:36:40,079
smell and taste were very bright uh very

3784
02:36:38,280 --> 02:36:43,380
floral

3785
02:36:40,079 --> 02:36:45,780
um kind of unique uh I I I really

3786
02:36:43,379 --> 02:36:48,059
enjoyed it and I do not remember where

3787
02:36:45,780 --> 02:36:51,239
the cinnamon came from I

3788
02:36:48,059 --> 02:36:54,119
it's I I had had that thing for years

3789
02:36:51,239 --> 02:36:56,879
and years and years and I don't remember

3790
02:36:54,120 --> 02:36:59,640
what its genetic makeup was or where it

3791
02:36:56,879 --> 02:37:02,519
came from it might have been given to me

3792
02:36:59,639 --> 02:37:05,879
um but no it did not it wasn't a

3793
02:37:02,520 --> 02:37:08,700
cinnamon profile and the flavor but God

3794
02:37:05,879 --> 02:37:10,139
darn it looked like cinnamon colored you

3795
02:37:08,700 --> 02:37:12,720
know with that

3796
02:37:10,139 --> 02:37:14,699
beautiful especially when you made Ash

3797
02:37:12,719 --> 02:37:17,459
out of it you you'd think it was

3798
02:37:14,700 --> 02:37:19,740
cinnamon there was that it was that dark

3799
02:37:17,459 --> 02:37:22,739
it was just under the wow of course

3800
02:37:19,739 --> 02:37:24,059
cinnamon no that's a resin so yeah

3801
02:37:22,739 --> 02:37:26,039
that's where the cinnamon came from

3802
02:37:24,059 --> 02:37:27,959
that's cool I love it when Australians

3803
02:37:26,040 --> 02:37:30,420
have like a sort of cool backstory to

3804
02:37:27,959 --> 02:37:32,279
them like that that's that's really neat

3805
02:37:30,420 --> 02:37:35,398
I was wondering I love to ask every

3806
02:37:32,280 --> 02:37:38,600
guest this question what seeds is gooey

3807
02:37:35,398 --> 02:37:38,599
excited to pop next

3808
02:37:40,139 --> 02:37:47,219
here's the deal uh

3809
02:37:43,818 --> 02:37:50,100
I I have a backlog of eight years right

3810
02:37:47,219 --> 02:37:52,139
now I've trimmed off two years I had ten

3811
02:37:50,100 --> 02:37:55,559
at the beginning of this year I've I've

3812
02:37:52,139 --> 02:37:59,039
cut down to eight years of backlog

3813
02:37:55,559 --> 02:38:00,840
and I make seed every year I don't know

3814
02:37:59,040 --> 02:38:02,700
how many different kinds I make it

3815
02:38:00,840 --> 02:38:04,920
depends on the year and what up what

3816
02:38:02,700 --> 02:38:06,899
it's for but you know if I'm doing stuff

3817
02:38:04,920 --> 02:38:09,600
for clients or something like that I'll

3818
02:38:06,898 --> 02:38:11,099
go ahead and I'll keep a portion of

3819
02:38:09,600 --> 02:38:12,840
those for my own use and that's always

3820
02:38:11,100 --> 02:38:14,818
agreed upon

3821
02:38:12,840 --> 02:38:16,859
um and I always tell them I won't be

3822
02:38:14,818 --> 02:38:20,219
releasing this in and of itself I'll

3823
02:38:16,859 --> 02:38:23,880
just be using it in genetic research so

3824
02:38:20,219 --> 02:38:26,579
uh uh I've got about eight years of

3825
02:38:23,879 --> 02:38:29,879
stuff with their stuff that I have never

3826
02:38:26,579 --> 02:38:32,939
mentioned and I have never told anybody

3827
02:38:29,879 --> 02:38:33,779
I've had yet just because it hasn't come

3828
02:38:32,939 --> 02:38:36,239
up

3829
02:38:33,780 --> 02:38:39,239
um it just it just hasn't come up and

3830
02:38:36,239 --> 02:38:40,859
and what I thought I'd do is I'm going

3831
02:38:39,239 --> 02:38:43,379
back to that old

3832
02:38:40,859 --> 02:38:46,800
working on this three foot area of space

3833
02:38:43,379 --> 02:38:48,839
to clean up I'm I'm dealing with a small

3834
02:38:46,799 --> 02:38:51,239
set of genetics and refining those and

3835
02:38:48,840 --> 02:38:53,040
getting those out to people and then I'm

3836
02:38:51,239 --> 02:38:55,439
going to be moving into this next stage

3837
02:38:53,040 --> 02:38:59,040
and doing and so people will see less

3838
02:38:55,439 --> 02:39:02,040
from me during that interim period and

3839
02:38:59,040 --> 02:39:03,899
I'm trying to avoid that so that's why

3840
02:39:02,040 --> 02:39:06,420
I'm working on the sets of genetics I am

3841
02:39:03,898 --> 02:39:09,478
the black lines those kinds of things

3842
02:39:06,420 --> 02:39:12,420
I'm working on those to be able to to

3843
02:39:09,478 --> 02:39:15,239
have something to tide people over while

3844
02:39:12,420 --> 02:39:17,460
I get this next set of things ready and

3845
02:39:15,239 --> 02:39:22,100
we'll see how far how many times I could

3846
02:39:17,459 --> 02:39:24,539
do this before I end up Six Feet Under

3847
02:39:22,100 --> 02:39:26,280
look I think you'll be around for a

3848
02:39:24,540 --> 02:39:27,120
while longer and we're all grateful for

3849
02:39:26,280 --> 02:39:29,579
that

3850
02:39:27,120 --> 02:39:32,520
one hopes one hopes well thank you and

3851
02:39:29,579 --> 02:39:34,978
you're very kind no certainly I think I

3852
02:39:32,520 --> 02:39:36,359
Echo the sentiment for everyone

3853
02:39:34,978 --> 02:39:37,799
um it's interesting because we've sort

3854
02:39:36,359 --> 02:39:39,960
of briefly touched on it a few times

3855
02:39:37,799 --> 02:39:41,579
throughout the episode but a lot of

3856
02:39:39,959 --> 02:39:44,398
people do complain it's sometimes hard

3857
02:39:41,579 --> 02:39:46,859
to get their hands on your work and I

3858
02:39:44,398 --> 02:39:48,420
guess the question becomes how do you

3859
02:39:46,859 --> 02:39:50,280
deal with banks do you wait for them to

3860
02:39:48,420 --> 02:39:52,079
approach you or you do you approach them

3861
02:39:50,280 --> 02:39:53,760
how does a breeder work in the current

3862
02:39:52,079 --> 02:39:56,340
landscape

3863
02:39:53,760 --> 02:39:58,978
oh well how breeders work is a different

3864
02:39:56,340 --> 02:40:01,500
question than how I do it and and and

3865
02:39:58,978 --> 02:40:06,840
and and I'll tell you right now I work

3866
02:40:01,500 --> 02:40:08,818
with a set of reps and I let them deal

3867
02:40:06,840 --> 02:40:11,280
with with distribution and everything

3868
02:40:08,818 --> 02:40:13,500
like that once I turn it over to a rep

3869
02:40:11,280 --> 02:40:16,079
it's their gig they can do whatever they

3870
02:40:13,500 --> 02:40:19,739
want however they want to do it as long

3871
02:40:16,079 --> 02:40:22,139
as they you know you highlight the brand

3872
02:40:19,739 --> 02:40:24,600
in a positive light as it should be

3873
02:40:22,139 --> 02:40:27,180
unless it doesn't deserve it if it

3874
02:40:24,600 --> 02:40:30,000
doesn't deserve it I want the rest to be

3875
02:40:27,180 --> 02:40:32,159
able to feel that and then say hey look

3876
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:34,260
out for this or he told me this or

3877
02:40:32,159 --> 02:40:37,500
because it does this we're going to give

3878
02:40:34,260 --> 02:40:40,139
you free this as a replacement to make

3879
02:40:37,500 --> 02:40:43,739
sure that you the customer are taken

3880
02:40:40,139 --> 02:40:47,699
care of and and so that kind of attitude

3881
02:40:43,739 --> 02:40:49,739
pervades everything that and so I don't

3882
02:40:47,700 --> 02:40:52,460
know uh you know

3883
02:40:49,739 --> 02:40:52,459
uh

3884
02:40:52,799 --> 02:40:58,858
I think I'm smoking gooey again

3885
02:40:56,239 --> 02:41:01,159
hit that one hit that one I love it I

3886
02:40:58,859 --> 02:41:01,159
love it

3887
02:41:02,180 --> 02:41:07,398
oh well

3888
02:41:04,978 --> 02:41:10,199
my wife is saying that it's about time

3889
02:41:07,398 --> 02:41:11,818
that's perfect

3890
02:41:10,200 --> 02:41:14,220
oh it was wonderful

3891
02:41:11,818 --> 02:41:15,779
yeah look I had I had one final question

3892
02:41:14,219 --> 02:41:19,559
for you that I was interested to hear

3893
02:41:15,780 --> 02:41:21,720
your take on outside of mom GUI there's

3894
02:41:19,559 --> 02:41:23,939
been a variety of different pure guis

3895
02:41:21,719 --> 02:41:26,459
and various sort of recombinations of

3896
02:41:23,939 --> 02:41:28,818
GUI which one is the most standout in

3897
02:41:26,459 --> 02:41:28,818
your mind

3898
02:41:30,379 --> 02:41:35,938
now again that's a weird question as far

3899
02:41:33,600 --> 02:41:39,359
as are you talking about other things

3900
02:41:35,939 --> 02:41:42,059
like there's an old goo

3901
02:41:39,359 --> 02:41:46,318
that comes from Santa Cruz that has been

3902
02:41:42,059 --> 02:41:49,978
around since the 70s and it's

3903
02:41:46,318 --> 02:41:52,859
different than gooey it's not it's not

3904
02:41:49,978 --> 02:41:56,039
gooey it's different now whether people

3905
02:41:52,859 --> 02:41:58,500
are still using that goo or not

3906
02:41:56,040 --> 02:42:01,680
um it has been described to me as being

3907
02:41:58,500 --> 02:42:03,600
really similar really similar I have

3908
02:42:01,680 --> 02:42:04,260
never

3909
02:42:03,600 --> 02:42:06,600
um

3910
02:42:04,260 --> 02:42:08,780
had it tested or anything like that

3911
02:42:06,600 --> 02:42:10,800
because sometimes you know we'll we'll

3912
02:42:08,780 --> 02:42:12,239
genetically test things to see if

3913
02:42:10,799 --> 02:42:15,059
they're related like you know somebody

3914
02:42:12,239 --> 02:42:17,818
was questioning after gooey and they

3915
02:42:15,059 --> 02:42:21,539
have shown that in subsequent tests that

3916
02:42:17,818 --> 02:42:24,180
Mom GUI is is the the mother

3917
02:42:21,540 --> 02:42:27,540
um so but that hasn't happened with uh

3918
02:42:24,180 --> 02:42:29,880
other goo strains since there's a lot of

3919
02:42:27,540 --> 02:42:32,040
people that name stuff you know they

3920
02:42:29,879 --> 02:42:34,438
don't they don't know you know what I

3921
02:42:32,040 --> 02:42:36,060
mean that uh especially the newer

3922
02:42:34,439 --> 02:42:37,920
breeders and whatnot

3923
02:42:36,059 --> 02:42:39,840
they don't bother to look up and see

3924
02:42:37,920 --> 02:42:41,340
what's active online or what's been

3925
02:42:39,840 --> 02:42:44,340
around a long time they'll just name

3926
02:42:41,340 --> 02:42:46,139
something something and then it gets its

3927
02:42:44,340 --> 02:42:48,719
own little traction and stuff going and

3928
02:42:46,139 --> 02:42:50,519
you know you have to be aware of that I

3929
02:42:48,719 --> 02:42:52,559
I think that's one of the fun things

3930
02:42:50,520 --> 02:42:55,380
that people can count on with Canada

3931
02:42:52,559 --> 02:42:57,239
Exotics and and this stuff is that this

3932
02:42:55,379 --> 02:42:59,398
genetics has been around a long time and

3933
02:42:57,239 --> 02:43:01,799
it has a long

3934
02:42:59,398 --> 02:43:04,619
history that people can follow and and

3935
02:43:01,799 --> 02:43:06,898
and that seems to be lacking in the

3936
02:43:04,620 --> 02:43:08,700
other kinds of Expressions that you're

3937
02:43:06,898 --> 02:43:12,059
speaking to you know you don't find that

3938
02:43:08,700 --> 02:43:14,460
history to be able to to you know Avail

3939
02:43:12,059 --> 02:43:16,859
yourself up and that makes a difference

3940
02:43:14,459 --> 02:43:19,199
so I I kind of tend to just fall back on

3941
02:43:16,859 --> 02:43:22,579
that whatever whenever people ask me

3942
02:43:19,200 --> 02:43:24,780
about other variations or other uh

3943
02:43:22,579 --> 02:43:27,120
materializations of something like that

3944
02:43:24,780 --> 02:43:30,239
I just kind of fall back on only what I

3945
02:43:27,120 --> 02:43:31,979
know and go from there yeah okay

3946
02:43:30,239 --> 02:43:33,119
brilliant and do you have time for one

3947
02:43:31,978 --> 02:43:35,699
last Quick One

3948
02:43:33,120 --> 02:43:38,939
sure so I would be interested to hear

3949
02:43:35,700 --> 02:43:42,120
what's your thoughts on how legalization

3950
02:43:38,939 --> 02:43:43,859
has turned out versus how you thought it

3951
02:43:42,120 --> 02:43:46,740
would go

3952
02:43:43,859 --> 02:43:49,559
oh well yeah I actually always thought

3953
02:43:46,739 --> 02:43:51,659
it would be a lot more uh streamlined

3954
02:43:49,559 --> 02:43:53,579
and uh

3955
02:43:51,659 --> 02:43:55,439
I knew that there was always going to be

3956
02:43:53,579 --> 02:43:58,978
a little bit of contention and a little

3957
02:43:55,439 --> 02:44:03,180
bit of of societal

3958
02:43:58,978 --> 02:44:04,619
um unrest around it as you transition

3959
02:44:03,180 --> 02:44:07,139
from a something that's been

3960
02:44:04,620 --> 02:44:10,020
traditionally illegal it always has been

3961
02:44:07,139 --> 02:44:11,398
and always was prospected to be that is

3962
02:44:10,020 --> 02:44:13,739
going to be illegal because it was

3963
02:44:11,398 --> 02:44:16,079
deemed bad you know War on Drugs kind of

3964
02:44:13,739 --> 02:44:19,799
thing that kind of stuff and then it uh

3965
02:44:16,079 --> 02:44:22,439
uh it started to shift and legalization

3966
02:44:19,799 --> 02:44:25,799
now I kind of think has gone and swung

3967
02:44:22,439 --> 02:44:29,340
the pendulum the other way too far where

3968
02:44:25,799 --> 02:44:32,279
it's over regulated it's over controlled

3969
02:44:29,340 --> 02:44:36,680
um over taxed over

3970
02:44:32,280 --> 02:44:39,899
um over produced and over bread with

3971
02:44:36,680 --> 02:44:42,420
too many holes in each of those systems

3972
02:44:39,898 --> 02:44:46,199
with different stuff falling through all

3973
02:44:42,420 --> 02:44:47,100
the time I think a more measured

3974
02:44:46,200 --> 02:44:48,659
um

3975
02:44:47,100 --> 02:44:51,540
type of

3976
02:44:48,659 --> 02:44:53,219
method needed to be used I think the

3977
02:44:51,540 --> 02:44:54,979
Genie's out of the bottle now and we've

3978
02:44:53,219 --> 02:44:58,438
got to kind of adjust to what we have

3979
02:44:54,978 --> 02:45:01,260
and correct the wrongs that are you know

3980
02:44:58,439 --> 02:45:02,818
present in the system now

3981
02:45:01,260 --> 02:45:04,439
because I think it's just a learning

3982
02:45:02,818 --> 02:45:06,719
curve I don't think we've ever been here

3983
02:45:04,439 --> 02:45:09,420
before and we don't you know we didn't

3984
02:45:06,719 --> 02:45:12,438
you knew kind of how Society was going

3985
02:45:09,420 --> 02:45:16,020
to go you just didn't know

3986
02:45:12,439 --> 02:45:18,420
which direction and how far how fast

3987
02:45:16,020 --> 02:45:19,979
and now we're seeing all of that right

3988
02:45:18,420 --> 02:45:22,020
now and I kind of just tend to think

3989
02:45:19,978 --> 02:45:24,500
that cooler heads will prevail

3990
02:45:22,020 --> 02:45:30,060
eventually and and and it'll settle in

3991
02:45:24,500 --> 02:45:32,939
we have a a plan with the legal material

3992
02:45:30,059 --> 02:45:35,059
that I'm trying to get set up where

3993
02:45:32,939 --> 02:45:37,680
we're going to provide

3994
02:45:35,059 --> 02:45:39,180
genetic stock for Vineyard people that

3995
02:45:37,680 --> 02:45:42,120
are wanting to convert a portion of

3996
02:45:39,180 --> 02:45:43,639
their land over and you know we want to

3997
02:45:42,120 --> 02:45:46,079
provide those

3998
02:45:43,639 --> 02:45:51,739
genetics and a consistent multi-year

3999
02:45:46,079 --> 02:45:51,739
contract kind of a thing and uh

4000
02:45:51,859 --> 02:45:59,120
we're you know you have to bounce in to

4001
02:45:56,700 --> 02:46:02,100
the system that's set up

4002
02:45:59,120 --> 02:46:05,220
with the reality that of what the future

4003
02:46:02,100 --> 02:46:07,200
may hold and the future may hold a very

4004
02:46:05,219 --> 02:46:11,699
low price you know and so all of our

4005
02:46:07,200 --> 02:46:15,060
pricing is based on 275 dollars a pound

4006
02:46:11,700 --> 02:46:17,819
and you're still able to do you know

4007
02:46:15,059 --> 02:46:19,500
make a good living uh on that kind of

4008
02:46:17,818 --> 02:46:22,139
number right now right now it's nowhere

4009
02:46:19,500 --> 02:46:25,020
near that here but it's nowhere near

4010
02:46:22,139 --> 02:46:27,119
where the Apex of how it used to be uh

4011
02:46:25,020 --> 02:46:29,280
you know over four thousand a pound it's

4012
02:46:27,120 --> 02:46:30,840
over near that either and a lot of the

4013
02:46:29,280 --> 02:46:32,640
people that got into the industry when

4014
02:46:30,840 --> 02:46:33,960
that was going on that was their target

4015
02:46:32,639 --> 02:46:35,818
they thought they were going to see it

4016
02:46:33,959 --> 02:46:38,519
was going to stay like that forever and

4017
02:46:35,818 --> 02:46:40,859
that's just not real so I think that the

4018
02:46:38,520 --> 02:46:43,220
pendulum is going to end up you know

4019
02:46:40,859 --> 02:46:47,399
being in the middle and we'll be okay

4020
02:46:43,219 --> 02:46:50,340
but uh uh until we vacillate through

4021
02:46:47,398 --> 02:46:52,139
this stuff and get and work back and and

4022
02:46:50,340 --> 02:46:53,818
all the entities that are against it

4023
02:46:52,139 --> 02:46:56,579
have their say and all the ones that are

4024
02:46:53,818 --> 02:46:59,519
for it Heather say you're I think we're

4025
02:46:56,579 --> 02:47:02,039
in for some tumultuous years

4026
02:46:59,520 --> 02:47:03,600
I really do I think the intelli gets all

4027
02:47:02,040 --> 02:47:05,939
settled and it gets normalized in the

4028
02:47:03,600 --> 02:47:08,579
federal government goes ahead and and

4029
02:47:05,939 --> 02:47:10,318
normalizes things and has one consistent

4030
02:47:08,579 --> 02:47:12,600
set of laws for it and they're governed

4031
02:47:10,318 --> 02:47:14,219
by the whole United States then you'll

4032
02:47:12,600 --> 02:47:16,680
see then you'll see you know real

4033
02:47:14,219 --> 02:47:18,000
progress until then fractionalization

4034
02:47:16,680 --> 02:47:20,520
and stuff like that are really an

4035
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:23,340
impediment really an impediment

4036
02:47:20,520 --> 02:47:25,500
some wise words there for sure

4037
02:47:23,340 --> 02:47:26,818
I think that just about brings us to the

4038
02:47:25,500 --> 02:47:28,260
end of things gooey were there any

produced and show people and uh I'm

4054

always always open to criticism I would

4055
02:48:08,760 --> 02:48:13,200
much rather hear people's negative

4056
02:48:11,459 --> 02:48:15,179
thoughts and stuff about material

4057
