with all that being said my first

18
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:05,570
question is how did you meet drover in I

19
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:12,269
met Joe B at Western State College in

20
00:01:05,569 --> 00:01:14,009
Gunnison Colorado in 1987 I clawed to a

21
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:18,810
few schools out in Colorado with the

22
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:21,780
only one I got into aka wasted state my

23
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:24,390
parents were real proud but this great

24
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,950
school I had a really fun time there and

25
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:30,090
I met him in the cafeteria I was just

26
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:33,900
going to get something to eat I didn't

27
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:35,820
really know anyone there and I saw him

28
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,000
sitting in a table with a couple other

29
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:40,828
of his friends that he came out from New

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,920
Jersey with and they had tie-dye

31
00:01:40,828 --> 00:01:46,859
t-shirts on Grateful Dead t-shirts so it

32
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,329
kind of journey over there and just went

33
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:52,978
over then just started talking to him

34
00:01:48,328 --> 00:01:54,449
and we've been friends ever since and so

35
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:56,099
it was a John who got you into the

36
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,859
Grateful Dead / you were a until the

37
00:01:56,099 --> 00:02:01,199
fold on I was already into it he was

38
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:03,539
already into it we both got into it in

39
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,329
high school I probably got into it my

40
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:09,250
freshman year in high school my brother

41
00:02:06,328 --> 00:02:12,359
was a big deadhead and

42
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:15,159
we lived I grew up in Connecticut so

43
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:19,360
there were a lot of shows right around

44
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:22,329
right around us within 2-3 hours many

45
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,310
places they used to play so I got to see

46
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:26,920
many many shows in high school so I was

47
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:32,530
a pretty big deadhead by the time I got

48
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:36,279
out to Western State okay awesome and so

49
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:38,110
before we get to that infamous show what

50
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:44,050
type of we were you guys smoking growing

51
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:47,530
up in Connecticut notes were lived about

52
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:51,280
an hour outside New York City so we've

53
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:55,090
got a lot of like strains from other

54
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:59,920
countries like Vietnam and you know

55
00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:03,430
Afghan bud and a lot of like taught real

56
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:05,349
Thai stick just a lot of different

57
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:09,150
different flavors that are smoking in

58
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:13,419
high school we got out to western state

59
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:16,180
the infamous P bud we found started

60
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:21,299
smoking that which is outdoor strain in

61
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:24,939
in Colorado a huge like forearm size

62
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:29,370
call us or you get like a pound just

63
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:34,300
folds little popcorn buds that were just

64
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:37,000
lime green and piney tasting and yeah

65
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:40,989
just really beautiful beautiful looking

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,539
pot awesome and so was this something

67
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:45,759
that was around when you had access to

68
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:48,669
the dog but Oh was it a full after that

69
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:53,549
it was before the before the dog but

70
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:59,289
enduring but you know I moved there in

71
00:03:53,550 --> 00:04:01,269
87 and the Peapod was around for since

72
00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:04,569
at least the early eighties I would

73
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:10,000
think my friend Rob would know a lot

74
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:13,060
more about that than me but it was

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,389
definitely before the dog bud yeah okay

76
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:18,759
so you know just kind of segue into the

77
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:21,399
dog bud what was that like for you guys

78
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:22,449
because you guys I think if what I read

79
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:25,149
was correct was the

80
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:27,810
had access to that for a wall before you

81
00:04:25,149 --> 00:04:31,929
know that fateful encounter at D Creek

82
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:38,769
we are actually not like it was so long

83
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:42,699
ago so I've talked to Joe and other

84
00:04:38,769 --> 00:04:46,769
people and got like the real just a

85
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:52,389
pound and a half came into Crested Butte

86
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:55,209
the summer of 91 and Jo Brand bought it

87
00:04:52,389 --> 00:05:01,209
I think he bought a pound of it or all

88
00:04:55,209 --> 00:05:05,949
of it guy approached him and because he

89
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:09,039
knew he Joe and would you know had money

90
00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:13,449
and yeah could get rid of it you know he

91
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:16,930
was kind of the Peapod man too so Joe

92
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:22,839
bought it you know he bought bought it

93
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:25,240
all and I think and so and we're going

94
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:29,409
on tour I'm not sure in like a couple

95
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:33,519
weeks or something so it was kind of you

96
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:36,130
know perfect and you know we're we kind

97
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:39,459
of took it he took it all on dead tour

98
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:40,839
which kind of pissed off a lot of people

99
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:43,329
in town because they couldn't they

100
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:45,959
couldn't get it but it was just

101
00:05:43,329 --> 00:05:50,109
absolutely amazing we had never seen

102
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:51,789
anything smell anything like it before

103
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:58,780
we're smoking a lot of people were

104
00:05:51,790 --> 00:06:01,410
smoking some indoor hash plant which is

105
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:05,259
called the pox scaly hash plant a puck

106
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:07,210
which is a pretty famous lot here in

107
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:11,170
Colorado I can tell you the story on

108
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:15,279
that one too but we were smoking bad m39

109
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:18,100
big bud skunk number one some good

110
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:19,839
indoor strains but we had never seen

111
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:26,020
anything like this or smelled anything

112
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:30,250
like this before we it was called when

113
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:33,069
Joe got it what it was called dog bud

114
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:35,439
because it after you smoked it

115
00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:36,269
it made you roll over like a dog that's

116
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:40,219
what

117
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:45,389
the meaning of the dog bird that I

118
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:49,139
remember it was so we we smelled it we

119
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:52,319
started calling a CEM weed because of

120
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:57,960
just the the odor off it it smelled

121
00:06:52,319 --> 00:07:01,650
chemical fuel just insane terpenes as

122
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:05,459
they say today it was just amazing the

123
00:07:01,649 --> 00:07:07,379
Smith the smell of it and so we started

124
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:10,918
calling a chem weed which kind of just

125
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:15,300
as a joke so we kind of changed the name

126
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:17,038
to chem weed and and then brought it not

127
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:20,250
sure exactly how much we brought on tour

128
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:23,579
but uh probably close to a pound on dead

129
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:25,829
tour and so um these are kind of the

130
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:26,839
days leading up tonight's show am I

131
00:07:25,829 --> 00:07:31,740
correct

132
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:34,679
yep weird that was summer of 91 so not

133
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:37,560
sure where the tour started but uh that

134
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,569
happened at I think there are two shows

135
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,060
in Deer Creek that happened at one of

136
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:45,750
those shows in Deer Creek I think that

137
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:48,780
was I think we were just smoking it

138
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:53,569
ourselves for the first shows and then

139
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:57,598
we we had split it up into eighths and

140
00:07:53,569 --> 00:08:02,218
and just decided to bust it out at Deer

141
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:04,769
Creek and it was yeah it was amazing

142
00:08:02,218 --> 00:08:09,779
because it was summertime too so like I

143
00:08:04,769 --> 00:08:11,490
said before is pretty dry weed in that

144
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:13,649
in that in the summer on dead tourists

145
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:20,759
though there were a lot of lucky people

146
00:08:13,649 --> 00:08:25,218
in that parking lot that death and so

147
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:27,930
when G mass G came up to you guys was it

148
00:08:25,218 --> 00:08:29,490
you know just just any old moment for

149
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:31,949
you or did you have some inkling ly you

150
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:33,599
know like a skunk VA mentions when he

151
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:35,099
was a first approached with the guy who

152
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,408
would give him the candle like he knew

153
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:39,000
that it was you know as the guy walked

154
00:08:37,408 --> 00:08:40,740
towards him he knew it was an important

155
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,750
contact you know did you feel the same

156
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,120
way about mask G or it was just kind of

157
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:48,470
an every since case it was just kind of

158
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:54,320
a well he was more friendly because

159
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:58,040
is so long ago but uh we we just started

160
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,530
selling it at our cat Joe's car at you

161
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:05,629

162
00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:09,319
Subaru and we started to just say kind

163
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:11,720
bud and one guy came up and he was just

164
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,850
like holy [ __ ] look at this stuff and he

165
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,160
ran off and brought up to people and

166
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:20,720
they ran off and brought up two people

167
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:26,509
we had like a line at our car to buy 8th

168
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:28,670
and G mask GE was one of them I think he

169
00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:31,669
bought one or two and came back and

170
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:35,679
bought some more put him and joe

171
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:38,990
exchanged numbers of the show there and

172
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:41,389
and then that's how they they stayed in

173
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:43,430
contacts them cell phones back then

174
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:45,769
souls more just you know on a piece of

175
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:51,169
paper and I'll call you when I get back

176
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:54,049
to let me get back all say did you um

177
00:09:51,169 --> 00:09:55,939
were you aware of the kind of the

178
00:09:54,049 --> 00:09:57,799
exchange that took place after that when

179
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,330
you guys got back and then Joe sent him

180
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:02,809
the stuff in the mail or you weren't

181
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:07,009
fully aware of fun I know I think he

182
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:08,750
said I'm some P but first and then send

183
00:10:07,009 --> 00:10:11,600
him to dog but and I'm sure we're all I

184
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:14,090
got old send it to him you know very

185
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,700
glad he did but you know because that

186
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:20,360
was that was it there was he never saw

187
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:23,509
it again the dog blood I've never seen

188
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:26,300
it since so it's probably a little like

189
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:30,409
don't send it to him but uh I think he

190
00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:33,229
said him two ounces and I had never seen

191
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:37,850
a seed in any of the stuff that I smoked

192
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:41,680
or anything if I did I I didn't save it

193
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:44,690
for sure but uh you know one of those

194
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:46,909
some of those buds receded so and Greg

195
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:50,780
fell and one of the ounces I guess I

196
00:10:46,909 --> 00:10:54,319
think Joe sent two ounces and one of the

197
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:57,049
ounces he found the thirteen seeds so

198
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,790
when he found those seeds did he mention

199
00:10:57,049 --> 00:11:01,169
to you that he found them straight away

200
00:10:58,789 --> 00:11:03,929
or was it more of just on the back

201
00:11:01,169 --> 00:11:08,549
thing you know what no cell phones back

202
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:13,528
then so we could kind of just lost touch

203
00:11:08,549 --> 00:11:15,689
with last year for years I didn't keep

204
00:11:13,528 --> 00:11:18,028
in touch with them at all

205
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:21,510
and Joe probably did a little bit but

206
00:11:18,028 --> 00:11:26,309
then you know just fell out it so out of

207
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:28,259
touch with them so yeah he can you know

208
00:11:26,309 --> 00:11:32,458
mask gee if you can get him on he can

209
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:37,169
definitely take it the story from there

210
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:40,078
finding the seeds and all that stuff we

211
00:11:37,169 --> 00:11:44,969
didn't really get back in touch with him

212
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:51,559
until you know oh five something like

213
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:56,839
that 2005 from just on the internet and

214
00:11:51,559 --> 00:12:01,619
seeing the Sour Diesel bud and from

215
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:04,620
Massachusetts and so Joe kind of put two

216
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:06,690
and two together and was online for a

217
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:12,509
couple of years trying to corroborate

218
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:15,230
this story of meeting mass G and sending

219
00:12:12,509 --> 00:12:19,110
them that and it being the dog bud and

220
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:21,720
and then I was back east and got a bag

221
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:26,250
of a Sour Diesel I'm like oh four or

222
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:27,720
something and called Joe jobra and

223
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:30,839
California was like this stuff smells

224
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:35,430
just like the dog bud and he was telling

225
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:42,149
me about this story online and finally I

226
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:48,719
guess JJ from top dog got mask G and Joe

227
00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:53,480
together and and yeah from then on they

228
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:56,339
they they reconnected and G sent him Joe

229
00:12:53,480 --> 00:13:02,300
you know for the remaining seats that he

230
00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:05,490
had left so that's how they got back

231
00:13:02,299 --> 00:13:07,409
yeah okay so I mean I got two little

232
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:08,909
questions so I mean that was the the

233
00:13:07,409 --> 00:13:11,879
whole reunion thing that people talk

234
00:13:08,909 --> 00:13:13,949
about exactly yeah and then the second

235
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:16,019
thought is does that mean that you know

236
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:17,850
essentially you and Joe we're just doing

237
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:20,250
your own thing for about ten years and

238
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:22,320
the chem dogs were in existence so to

239
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,009
speak but you weren't we didn't know

240
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,600
about him

241
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:32,340
no you're smoking Homer or anything so

242
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:37,920
it was nice to you know reconnect with

243
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:40,710
mass G and and those guys and and you

244
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:43,949
get those things you have those genetics

245
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:45,690
for sure so when you did kind of put the

246
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:47,160
story together slash you know at

247
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:49,980
whatever point you did believe it all

248
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:52,500
were you just like kind of surprised by

249
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:54,509
you know how many killer cuts had come

250
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:58,559
from those 13 seeds I was a little bit

251
00:13:54,509 --> 00:14:02,909
overwhelming at first it's crazy how

252
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:05,250
that one strain has changed the you know

253
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:07,709
the face of the weed world for sure it's

254
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:10,379
I mean I know we know that back then I

255
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:14,759
had never seen anything better than the

256
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:17,549
dog until you know we hooked back up

257
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:20,750
with mass G and got the you know the

258
00:14:17,549 --> 00:14:25,529
chem 91 and the D and you know and then

259
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:29,039
you know Gio popped the four and but

260
00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:32,159
yeah I mean ii just never seen anything

261
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:34,169
like it before otherwise yeah okay

262
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:36,029
and so when you were first exposed to

263
00:14:34,169 --> 00:14:45,139
all the chem dogs what was your initial

264
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:48,959
favorite I liked the 91 the best at

265
00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:51,929
first maybe the admission is how in what

266
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:55,920
order were you exposed to them in order

267
00:14:51,929 --> 00:14:58,709
I was exposed 90 or so we hooked back up

268
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:05,099
with mass G and I was in Connecticut and

269
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:07,230
I would meet him up at the Basketball

270
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:09,659
Hall of Fame in Springfield Mass such a

271
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:13,139
nice master he was just such a nice guy

272
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:15,929
that you know he drives you know I don't

273
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:17,879
know how long it was for him but we meet

274
00:15:15,929 --> 00:15:21,209
there and he'd have this package for me

275
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:26,240
you know of just all that Kem's and so I

276
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:26,240
got exposed to the 91 D

277
00:15:27,119 --> 00:15:35,189
yep see and then you know the chem cross

278
00:15:29,818 --> 00:15:38,368
is what he did the bubble cam and then I

279
00:15:35,188 --> 00:15:43,458
got exposed the chem sister but I liked

280
00:15:38,369 --> 00:15:46,439
the 91 at first the bet the best I

281
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:51,508
thought after years it kind of got the

282
00:15:46,438 --> 00:15:56,488
taste kind of faded but I've smoked some

283
00:15:51,509 --> 00:16:00,599
recently the last few years from from

284
00:15:56,489 --> 00:16:04,109
Duke and it's you know it's he brings

285
00:16:00,599 --> 00:16:06,809
the flavor out for sure yeah it's funny

286
00:16:04,109 --> 00:16:10,288
you mention that because um I mean when

287
00:16:06,808 --> 00:16:12,328
I first try I was surprised by how what

288
00:16:10,288 --> 00:16:13,379
you know weak or absent the flavor was

289
00:16:12,328 --> 00:16:15,538
but at the same time I was also

290
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:16,558
surprised by how it was more present

291
00:16:15,538 --> 00:16:18,239
than I thought it would be at the same

292
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:22,918
time I know that sounds very paradoxical

293
00:16:18,239 --> 00:16:26,939
but yeah the strength still there I mean

294
00:16:22,918 --> 00:16:29,879
it's still just as strong as but the D

295
00:16:26,938 --> 00:16:33,208
that is you know the smell is still

296
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:35,459
there the taste is still there it just

297
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:41,668
reeks I mean I know a lot of people love

298
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:44,248
that just rotten smelling funky you know

299
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:48,749
yuck smelling my wife calls it yuck yuck

300
00:16:44,249 --> 00:16:50,939
bud it just smells just nasty but a lot

301
00:16:48,749 --> 00:16:53,729
of people ate I love it a lot a lot of

302
00:16:50,938 --> 00:16:56,519
other people love it too and so do you

303
00:16:53,729 --> 00:16:58,499
find that the D is I don't know I refer

304
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:00,089
to is like more functional than the 91

305
00:16:58,499 --> 00:17:03,689
or do you think it's just still too

306
00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:05,818
crippling its crippling it's close to

307
00:17:03,688 --> 00:17:08,490
the 91 I think the 91 is probably the

308
00:17:05,818 --> 00:17:11,209
strongest of of all of them

309
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:14,578
it's got no ceiling and you just get

310
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:18,929
higher and higher and higher

311
00:17:14,578 --> 00:17:21,148
DS pretty close though yeah okay and so

312
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:23,519
I think stung mentioned that your now

313
00:17:21,148 --> 00:17:28,438
favorite is the D is that the truth

314
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:30,808
yeah yeah I I that's taken over and in

315
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:36,808
the years just the smell and the taste

316
00:17:30,808 --> 00:17:39,690
and but that 91 is a close close second

317
00:17:36,808 --> 00:17:41,048
and so I guess my question is why do you

318
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:44,499
think that

319
00:17:41,048 --> 00:17:46,989
sorry hit the D why do you think that

320
00:17:44,499 --> 00:17:48,579
the D has been able to maintain those

321
00:17:46,989 --> 00:17:51,149
characteristics of all the naughty ones

322
00:17:48,579 --> 00:17:51,148
fade it off

323
00:17:51,298 --> 00:18:01,118
it's not as old he popped that he popped

324
00:17:56,099 --> 00:18:07,569
Kim D in 2000 I believe so it's 9 years

325
00:18:01,118 --> 00:18:10,628
you know younger probably the you know

326
00:18:07,569 --> 00:18:14,108
the biggest reason I would think okay

327
00:18:10,628 --> 00:18:16,238
and so if we go back to the story /

328
00:18:14,108 --> 00:18:18,519
Heather the timeline so we just jump

329
00:18:16,239 --> 00:18:20,409
back to when G send Joe those further

330
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:22,659
beans obviously you were in the loop at

331
00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:23,559
that point we were really excited for

332
00:18:22,659 --> 00:18:27,669
what was going to come out of those

333
00:18:23,558 --> 00:18:29,798
beans yeah it was great Joe Brown was in

334
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:33,940
California I think I moved out there

335
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:40,648
moved in with them shortly after he got

336
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:44,288
those and so the wood chem 1 2 3 &amp; 4 4

337
00:18:40,648 --> 00:18:46,888
was you know the best Joe thought it was

338
00:18:44,288 --> 00:18:51,878
it's definitely the biggest producer of

339
00:18:46,888 --> 00:18:54,128
all the cams the DS you know probably

340
00:18:51,878 --> 00:18:59,648
close second

341
00:18:54,128 --> 00:19:04,269
and so Joe kind of picked that one out

342
00:18:59,648 --> 00:19:06,488
as the best one and you know it was

343
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:08,470
generous with it and gave it to you know

344
00:19:06,489 --> 00:19:11,798
a lot of people gave the one two and

345
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:13,960
three to a few people that think there's

346
00:19:11,798 --> 00:19:16,538
a couple people that have the three and

347
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:20,499
maybe one or two people that have chem 1

348
00:19:16,538 --> 00:19:26,769
&amp; 2 they were more from what I remember

349
00:19:20,499 --> 00:19:31,239
more though G like I was big I was a big

350
00:19:26,769 --> 00:19:35,349
producer smaller smaller buds but the

351
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:38,858
floor was the one that called the

352
00:19:35,349 --> 00:19:42,158
reunion feet out Joe named at that and

353
00:19:38,858 --> 00:19:45,158
it's it's it's everywhere and it's I

354
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:46,869
love it a lot of the people in the chem

355
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:50,409
family don't like it

356
00:19:46,868 --> 00:19:52,720
it's kind of funny it's but uh it's I

357
00:19:50,409 --> 00:19:56,190
like it it's it's good it's the

358
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:58,019
different smell from the rest

359
00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:00,450
which I think a lot of terms a lot of

360
00:19:58,019 --> 00:20:03,690
people off but I think it's it's it's

361
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:06,269
really strong for sure yeah I mean I

362
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:09,119
wasn't the biggest fan of it but um I

363
00:20:06,269 --> 00:20:13,909
think it's good one that they won adam

364
00:20:09,118 --> 00:20:16,769
dunk up this years I've seen something

365
00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:18,539
today it was the theis like it was like

366
00:20:16,769 --> 00:20:21,888
the Deaf it just not as good in taste

367
00:20:18,538 --> 00:20:25,348
wise it's different it's definitely a

368
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:29,668
different taste than than the others for

369
00:20:25,348 --> 00:20:30,528
sure but I think the strength is is is

370
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:33,570
right there

371
00:20:30,528 --> 00:20:35,038
yeah yeah sure I think with all of the

372
00:20:33,569 --> 00:20:40,589
chem notes that the strength is always

373
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:43,618
there so I've heard some rumors from

374
00:20:40,589 --> 00:20:45,959
some people that the the pheno one that

375
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:48,538
you just mentioned that that may have

376
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:52,139
been the plant which went on to be that

377
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:53,128
infamous jobra a 91 would you be able to

378
00:20:52,138 --> 00:20:56,248
shed new light on oh no you got any

379
00:20:53,128 --> 00:21:01,548
opinions on that on the job rather could

380
00:20:56,249 --> 00:21:05,308
Joe be 91 yeah I I'm not really sure

381
00:21:01,548 --> 00:21:06,929
where that one came from and uh I mean I

382
00:21:05,308 --> 00:21:08,999
kind of have an idea but I kind of

383
00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:13,559
really don't want to want to get into

384
00:21:08,999 --> 00:21:16,798
that it's no it's kind of confusing a

385
00:21:13,558 --> 00:21:21,269
confusing issue I really can't really

386
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:23,608
explain okay yeah well I mean maybe it's

387
00:21:21,269 --> 00:21:25,229
good though it's it's really good I know

388
00:21:23,608 --> 00:21:27,239
there's people here in Denver that have

389
00:21:25,229 --> 00:21:28,348
it yeah I mean there are people who

390
00:21:27,239 --> 00:21:29,700
still breed with it because they think

391
00:21:28,348 --> 00:21:32,329
it's that good you know obviously they

392
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:34,739
name it correctly but um but yeah I mean

393
00:21:32,329 --> 00:21:37,528
one of the things I find so interesting

394
00:21:34,739 --> 00:21:40,200
about it is there seems to have been so

395
00:21:37,528 --> 00:21:42,028
many fake 90 ones and I don't just mean

396
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,859
like outright fakers in some random

397
00:21:42,028 --> 00:21:46,589
person has it but as in like maybe

398
00:21:43,858 --> 00:21:48,808
someone close to the chem fam or even in

399
00:21:46,589 --> 00:21:50,220
the chem fam has a cut at one point and

400
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:51,148
they think it's the right one and that

401
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:54,960
it turns out it's not

402
00:21:51,148 --> 00:21:56,608
and just soon so like there's so many of

403
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,048
the ninety one out of all the cuts you

404
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,548
know it was the one which there would

405
00:21:58,048 --> 00:22:03,479
seem to be like the most replicas

406
00:21:59,548 --> 00:22:06,658
floating around yes I would have to say

407
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:07,660
it's the hardest one to get the original

408
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:10,510
you know the real

409
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:12,370
besides the warning too but of the ones

410
00:22:10,509 --> 00:22:16,089
that are out there think the 91 is

411
00:22:12,369 --> 00:22:18,369
definitely the toughest one to get if

412
00:22:16,089 --> 00:22:22,029
you know and I think a lot of people

413
00:22:18,369 --> 00:22:24,759
have I've ruined ruined a lot of

414
00:22:22,029 --> 00:22:26,889
people's day when they send me pictures

415
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:29,259
and I gotta just tell them that it's

416
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:32,020
definitely not it or it'll smoke me out

417
00:22:29,259 --> 00:22:35,680
on it and I have to tell them it's not

418
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:39,210
it but yeah it's definitely I would have

419
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:43,330
to say the hardest one to get and that's

420
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:46,870
you know thank God that you know Scott

421
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:48,429
VA as as protected that thing over these

422
00:22:46,869 --> 00:22:51,639
years for sure because it's a special

423
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:53,920
one just to kind of just point to bed

424
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,840
cuz I I don't know how but I get a lot

425
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,460
of messages people telling me the same

426
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:58,990
thing that they've got the real 91 I

427
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:02,500
don't know why they messaging me but I

428
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:05,200
said it's probably not it so my question

429
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:06,549
is has anyone you know like and I don't

430
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,380
mean to be rude to the people but like

431
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:10,450
just a random person not associated with

432
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:11,860
you really in any way has anyone ever

433
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:13,509
like sent you a photo and you were like

434
00:23:11,859 --> 00:23:17,549
hey that's the real deal or is it always

435
00:23:13,509 --> 00:23:19,690
like sorry bro it's pretty much always

436
00:23:17,549 --> 00:23:24,759
because it's you know it's one see

437
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:29,440
people I don't know so I know who kind

438
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:32,879
of has that cut out there but most of

439
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:36,610
the time it's it's no I mean I'll see it

440
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:40,360
on the internet you know and different

441
00:23:36,609 --> 00:23:42,729
you know different media web I'll see it

442
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:44,589
I'll be oh yeah that's it but uh most of

443
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:47,319
the people that send me pictures it's

444
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:51,490
not it's not it or smoke with me it's

445
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:53,649
not it yep and so what were your

446
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:55,089
thoughts on the initial cam dog hybrids

447
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:57,750
you mentioned the bubble cam I think

448
00:23:55,089 --> 00:24:01,059
another one she made was the dog waltz

449
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:04,680
how did you feel about that that's JJ's

450
00:24:01,059 --> 00:24:10,750
a fabulous fabulous

451
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:13,420
all the chem crosses are are great skunk

452
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:18,519
fears I see collect over skunk VA has

453
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:21,009
that uh cam Scout which is you know one

454
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:23,109
of the best crosses that I've

455
00:24:21,009 --> 00:24:27,099
one of the best chem crosses I've ever

456
00:24:23,109 --> 00:24:32,709
smoked chem D by I 95 is a really really

457
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:35,139
good chem cross but yeah they're they're

458
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:38,048
all good they really are if you have the

459
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:40,330
real Kim and so when you saw how good

460
00:24:38,048 --> 00:24:42,009
these were as breeding stock essentially

461
00:24:40,329 --> 00:24:44,918
did the thought ever cross your mind to

462
00:24:42,009 --> 00:24:47,710
do a bit of breeding yourself no I've

463
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:52,150
not really been interested in breeding I

464
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:56,110
let that to my buddies but I'm always

465
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:58,900
just been straight clone and kept

466
00:24:56,109 --> 00:25:04,418
mothers alive and it's kind of what I've

467
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:06,610
done preservation and never really

468
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:08,559
gotten into interested in breeding I've

469
00:25:06,609 --> 00:25:12,308
always had I was a golf course

470
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:15,329
superintendent for four years and so I

471
00:25:12,308 --> 00:25:19,298
always had a career and working you know

472
00:25:15,329 --> 00:25:22,329
80 hours a week and so I never really

473
00:25:19,298 --> 00:25:25,720
had the time growing was always just a

474
00:25:22,329 --> 00:25:28,869
really part-time all growing marijuana

475
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:32,350
was always a very part-time thing for me

476
00:25:28,869 --> 00:25:36,339
always did it but just part-time growing

477
00:25:32,349 --> 00:25:39,329
golf courses was my full-time gig yes

478
00:25:36,339 --> 00:25:41,769
okay cool how did you transition into

479
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:45,519
the job you have now which is that

480
00:25:41,769 --> 00:25:50,829
incredible edibles sorry I when my son

481
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:53,139
was born he's four now I we didn't

482
00:25:50,829 --> 00:25:57,279
really want to put him in daycare at

483
00:25:53,140 --> 00:26:00,520

484
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:05,109

and take care of Bobby for the first few

486
00:26:05,109 --> 00:26:13,000
years of his life and so this past year

487
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:15,339
he was old enough to go to we wanted to

488
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,980
get him into daycare and in nursery

489
00:26:15,339 --> 00:26:20,649
school and stuff so time for me to get

490
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:24,519
back to work I worked for early cannabis

491
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:27,940
for a little bit a great company in up

492
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:30,099
in Longmont and they do CBD so I was

493
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:31,920
working in their greenhouse and managing

494
00:26:30,099 --> 00:26:37,490
their

495
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:39,720
they're a garden supply store and then

496
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:43,319
wanted something a little more closer to

497
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:49,860
home and kind of put my name out there

498
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:51,928
and Derek contacted me and it was really

499
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:55,019
a company that I wanted to work for

500
00:26:51,929 --> 00:26:57,600
because they just have such a good

501
00:26:55,019 --> 00:27:00,839
reputation they just put out such a good

502
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:04,379
product they're there everywhere in the

503
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:07,019
state and I just wanted to work for a

504
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:12,210
good good company and things worked out

505
00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:13,918
and yeah very happy and so if we were to

506
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:17,519
kind of talk a bit more about the

507
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:19,500
edibles do you find that the chem dog

508
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:22,019
strains work specifically both edibles

509
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:23,789
or not really about potency is a lot of

510
00:27:22,019 --> 00:27:27,839
other factors involved in what strains

511
00:27:23,789 --> 00:27:31,168
make the good attitude not we're gonna

512
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:36,869
get um we're working on getting the chem

513
00:27:31,169 --> 00:27:40,370
for first in and start growing that and

514
00:27:36,869 --> 00:27:44,339
doing I think it'll work better with the

515
00:27:40,369 --> 00:27:47,159
live resin and the and the dabbing and

516
00:27:44,339 --> 00:27:50,839
the you know the oil I think it'll make

517
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:54,110
for a fantastic I smoked some come for

518
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:59,250
oil before and it's absolutely amazing

519
00:27:54,109 --> 00:28:02,729
so I think that's what we're gonna do

520
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:05,910
with the camphor yeah so I think it

521
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:08,759
works better better better for oil and

522
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:12,419
so I mean you know this may be out of

523
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:14,759
your kind of realm of scope but do you

524
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:17,460
find or ever get any feedback of the

525
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:20,669
strains that you're growing that they're

526
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:22,558
specifically good for edibles yeah

527
00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:25,980
that's something I wouldn't I wouldn't

528
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:30,678
know I just are I'm just locked in that

529
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:34,259
warehouse and growing grown the plants

530
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:36,179
but I I need to get to the other parts

531
00:28:34,259 --> 00:28:39,169
of the company but uh you just be

532
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:42,330
concentrating on the on the garden so

533
00:28:39,169 --> 00:28:45,509
yeah that would be someone else's

534
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:48,558
incredibles you'd have to ask

535
00:28:45,509 --> 00:28:54,690
what's good for you no candy bars and

536
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:56,759
yeah and that yep okay so when speaking

537
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:58,320
to skunk there was a funny moment he

538
00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:00,240
described where you know he got back on

539
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:02,700
the forums and you know he was kind of

540
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,440
unaware of how the community perceived

541
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,700
him in this sense it was you know as

542
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,950
like you know a very well-respected

543
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,538
figure do you ever feel that way about

544
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:11,100
yourself like do you ever have to pinch

545
00:29:09,538 --> 00:29:12,779
yourself and say like hey like I'm a bit

546
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:15,959
of a figure in the kind of a scene or do

547
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:18,918
you just not really view it that way i I

548
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:21,120
mean I I know I am but I don't really

549
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:24,870
view it that way I was just kind of just

550
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:28,918
living my life and that to me it doesn't

551
00:29:24,869 --> 00:29:32,428
seem that exciting but but we get you

552
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:35,490
know we had good times dead tour and met

553
00:29:32,429 --> 00:29:39,450
a lot of people and smoked a lot of weed

554
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:45,329
and saved a lot of strains and you know

555
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:48,750
so we just kind of live and living our

556
00:29:45,329 --> 00:29:51,808
life that's it but it's just amazing

557
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:56,179
that what I just get blown away on but

558
00:29:51,808 --> 00:30:01,490
on the on the weed that that dog bud

559
00:29:56,179 --> 00:30:05,850
just created I just it amazes me that

560
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:09,179
you know masterji found those seeds and

561
00:30:05,849 --> 00:30:11,308
in what became of them yes so I mean

562
00:30:09,179 --> 00:30:14,970
this is an interesting point I always

563
00:30:11,308 --> 00:30:17,038
think about is I think G was I think he

564
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:18,808
was 17 at the time of the concert and

565
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:21,538
maybe he was a Shane when he popped the

566
00:30:18,808 --> 00:30:23,250
since but he's young and but the thing

567
00:30:21,538 --> 00:30:25,980
which always stands out in my mind was

568
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:28,380
that um he was very young when he popped

569
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:29,909
those seeds and regardless if it was him

570
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:31,559
or friends close to him like you know

571
00:30:29,909 --> 00:30:34,289
those clones have managed to live on

572
00:30:31,558 --> 00:30:36,450
have you ever been like surprised or you

573
00:30:34,288 --> 00:30:38,609
know maybe more so impressed with how

574
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:40,409
someone that young was able to kind of

575
00:30:38,609 --> 00:30:41,819
hang on to things loosely for all that

576
00:30:40,409 --> 00:30:44,190
time because I just think that submit

577
00:30:41,819 --> 00:30:48,658
yeah it's amazing the inside he heard

578
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:51,419
that I like I said I could have we could

579
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:55,830
have had seeds you know and just

580
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:57,930
throwing them away he was one of those

581
00:30:55,829 --> 00:31:00,769
guys that went around and was

582
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:05,279
in precedes and at a young age which is

583
00:31:00,769 --> 00:31:09,450
you know pretty pretty impressive and to

584
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:14,099
do what he did with those seeds is is

585
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:17,250
very impressive in in my mind yeah and

586
00:31:14,099 --> 00:31:19,019
so have you ever really spoken to him

587
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:21,900
about how many people he actually gave

588
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:23,309
it out to because I mean I've heard from

589
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,780
a lot of people and you even mentioned

590
00:31:23,309 --> 00:31:27,240
it earlier yourself that gee just a

591
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:28,289
really nice guy and you know he he does

592
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,849
a lot for a lot of people and I've

593
00:31:28,289 --> 00:31:32,129
always heard that he was never a hoarder

594
00:31:29,849 --> 00:31:33,899
per se but at the same time I always

595
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:35,610
hear that you know like no one has the

596
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:37,470
real chem dog so it seems almost like

597
00:31:35,609 --> 00:31:39,539
paradoxical like the guy who's got the

598
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:43,100
real one seems to give it out but no one

599
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:47,460
has it at the same time I think they

600
00:31:43,099 --> 00:31:50,369
held him pretty tight in their circle

601
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:54,269
and you know I not totally sure you'd

602
00:31:50,369 --> 00:31:57,989
have to ask him on that one but just

603
00:31:54,269 --> 00:32:00,990
because it's just not you know it's just

604
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:02,660
not out there after 25 years you think

605
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:06,329
it would be out there a lot more but uh

606
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:08,220
yeah it's just not it's just not one of

607
00:32:06,329 --> 00:32:09,299
the conclusions I thought might have

608
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:11,309
been the case was that like the people

609
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:13,349
who was giving it to they they realized

610
00:32:11,309 --> 00:32:14,759
kind of the magnitude of the situation

611
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:16,549
and they decided not to give it out

612
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:20,279
because that could kind of explain that

613
00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:22,079
that could be it too you know if you get

614
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:24,569
something you're like oh my god this is

615
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:27,509
this is special I want to keep it you

616
00:32:24,569 --> 00:32:31,529
know for myself and you know a lot of

617
00:32:27,509 --> 00:32:33,539
people you know I'll take these and you

618
00:32:31,529 --> 00:32:38,339
know go make try to make money off them

619
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:43,950
and I you know I I don't really give

620
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:48,269
them to anyone so just out of respect

621
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:52,230
for those guys and just I don't want

622
00:32:48,269 --> 00:32:55,470
people to go take it and go make a ton

623
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:57,509
of money off itself yeah I I really

624
00:32:55,470 --> 00:33:00,720
don't give them out I get asked a lot

625
00:32:57,509 --> 00:33:03,900
but I just can't I'd spent all my time

626
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,819
at the post office may only mail in cuts

627
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:09,330
to people so

628
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:11,339
so how do you feel about people who are

629
00:33:09,329 --> 00:33:13,169
making money off it and more

630
00:33:11,339 --> 00:33:15,419
specifically especially when you're

631
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:18,810
pretty much 100% certain it's not even

632
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:21,210
real that's the part I don't like when

633
00:33:18,809 --> 00:33:23,669
you just using the name I mean anyone

634
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:28,049
can throw a name on something and trick

635
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:30,930
people and into buying their product the

636
00:33:28,049 --> 00:33:34,529
guys that put out a good product and

637
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:39,019
I've taken the chem dog strains and like

638
00:33:34,529 --> 00:33:42,240
JJ for instance and and made really good

639
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:44,160
quality genetics with them and you know

640
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,170
I think it's I think it's awesome I

641
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:50,040
think it's great the people that are

642
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:52,769
being deceitful and calling this chem 91

643
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:55,859
or calling this a chem whatever and chem

644
00:33:52,769 --> 00:34:00,299
whatever and not having real chem

645
00:33:55,859 --> 00:34:04,109
genetics and that that kind of rubs me

646
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:06,779
wrong yeah so I mean on that same note

647
00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:08,940
do you think that just generally

648
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:10,800
speaking we will be able to put the cam

649
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:13,110
dog into seed form or do you think it's

650
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,910
just one of those one in a millions and

651
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:16,620
you know even if you could find the

652
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:18,719
parents and do it than most of the seeds

653
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:21,839
may not come out as strong or you know

654
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:26,429
as similar yeah I personally I don't

655
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:29,910
think you're ever gonna get that you're

656
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:33,029
never gonna get you know exactly what

657
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:35,429
you know the clone is and I just don't

658
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:38,670
think that's possible I mean you can get

659
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:41,339
something close but I think's country is

660
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:43,110
working on something that's lucky dog

661
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:47,610
seeds that's what I that's what I'd be

662
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:50,099
waiting for his work but if you want

663
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:53,010
something close you know like start JJ's

664
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:55,610
star dogs are really strong and there's

665
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:58,170
a lot of crosses out there there that

666
00:34:55,610 --> 00:35:02,099
are really strong but you're not gonna

667
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:08,909
get you know the real the the chem 9uo

668
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:12,509
Nordik md or V Kemp for so yep with that

669
00:35:08,909 --> 00:35:14,309
in mind do you do you want to kind of cg

670
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:15,990
get into doing some seeds of his own

671
00:35:14,309 --> 00:35:18,090
because we've heard whispers and maybe

672
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:18,909
him doing something oh yeah I would love

673
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:23,050
it now that

674
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:24,819
you know Massachusetts it's legal he

675
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:29,170
told me is gonna he wanted to do

676
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:32,080
something so I think that would be you

677
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:35,559
know he deserves it the most he's really

678
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:37,989
the one that there wasn't for him you

679
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:42,009
know I don't want to be smoking don't be

680
00:35:37,989 --> 00:35:46,359
smoking the chem so yeah anything he

681
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:47,830
succeeds that makes me happy yeah yeah I

682
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:51,550
think I speak for everyone when we say

683
00:35:47,829 --> 00:35:55,119
that so you mentioned earlier that Joe

684
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:58,330
is online were you ever really going

685
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,949
online or not until the story kind of

686
00:35:58,329 --> 00:36:01,690
got pieced together and you realize that

687
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:04,569
there were people online who knew about

688
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:07,659
you I was I think I was online before

689
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:11,559
that I think I started on the overgrown

690
00:36:07,659 --> 00:36:18,789
and the icy mag and I just picked P but

691
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:22,710
as as my handle and then an icy mag this

692
00:36:18,789 --> 00:36:26,469
guy with that name high and lonesome

693
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:28,720
Virginia I believe he kind of laid out

694
00:36:26,469 --> 00:36:31,239
the whole chem dog 101 story on there

695
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:34,629
really really good pictures and the

696
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:36,579
whole story pretty pretty accurate you

697
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:39,340
know he did research and talked to

698
00:36:36,579 --> 00:36:44,110
everyone and that's kind of how the

699
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:47,670
whole and that was 15 15 years ago or

700
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:50,740
something so let's kind of have a whole

701
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:53,920
P bud and Joe brand an internet thing

702
00:36:50,739 --> 00:36:56,529
kinda kind of blew up yeah I was gonna

703
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,940
say that's actually an amazing threat

704
00:36:56,530 --> 00:37:00,220
for anyone who hasn't looked at it you

705
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:03,159
gotta go that's great and dog yeah you

706
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:06,069
can search Ken dog 101 and I see Meg and

707
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:08,319
it's that's about pictures and yeah Kim

708
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:10,360
dog one oh yeah it's got a lot of lays

709
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:14,080
out the whole story's got the pictures

710
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:16,030
just killer Joe Joe actually comments on

711
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,739
it just under like one of the first

712
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:19,090
comments he's like just under a guest

713
00:37:17,739 --> 00:37:21,099
profile like he didn't even have an

714
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:23,260
account at that point yeah it was like

715
00:37:21,099 --> 00:37:27,429
he's just like hey I'm that guy from the

716
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:28,710
story first and he basically post proof

717
00:37:27,429 --> 00:37:32,639
and it's like whoa

718
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:36,289
yeah that's Joe did a lotta I mean he

719
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:39,568
was on the internet for a few years

720
00:37:36,289 --> 00:37:40,770
trying to sell that's sell the story

721
00:37:39,568 --> 00:37:46,500
which was true

722
00:37:40,769 --> 00:37:48,568
and yeah finally it I mean he must have

723
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:52,079
said it so many so many times on the

724
00:37:48,568 --> 00:37:53,670
internet jumping into forums and saying

725
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:55,380
this is you know where it came from and

726
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:59,838
just got shut down for years and then

727
00:37:55,380 --> 00:38:02,190
finally got reconnected with mass G and

728
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:04,949
yeah vindication

729
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:07,528
yes so so after you did reconnect with

730
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:08,519
mass G through Joe B or whatever it

731
00:38:07,528 --> 00:38:10,559
might be

732
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:13,190
did you stay in contact with him or was

733
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:16,710
it still kind of a sporadic relationship

734
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:19,858
I've stayed contact with them since you

735
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:21,750
know oh six they've been you know we saw

736
00:38:19,858 --> 00:38:26,519
him at the dead shows last year in

737
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:28,588
Chicago and no talk talk a bunch of you

738
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:31,858
know texts and stuff like that so yeah

739
00:38:28,588 --> 00:38:35,429
we we keep in touch for sure and i you

740
00:38:31,858 --> 00:38:39,049
know i buy i buy a pipe from the you

741
00:38:35,429 --> 00:38:40,318
know every six months yeah

742
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:44,250
[Music]

743
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:47,308
so basically when when g went down due

744
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:48,750
to that whole res business we were you

745
00:38:47,309 --> 00:38:52,339
just peripheral to that or were you kind

746
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:56,880
of like I was pretty peripheral to that

747
00:38:52,338 --> 00:39:01,288
yeah those and I guess they got the last

748
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:05,309
couple seeds to the feds got the last

749
00:39:01,289 --> 00:39:08,099
link to seeds so which was too bad but

750
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:12,930
yeah I was kind of not really around in

751
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:15,119
them and so did you have any experience

752
00:39:12,929 --> 00:39:17,129
with the res because it's a like I mean

753
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:19,019
it's it's almost a taboo thing to talk

754
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:21,210
about res but at the same time what I

755
00:39:19,019 --> 00:39:22,679
find most interesting about it is for

756
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:24,358
all the negative things he's done

757
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:26,730
there's almost just as many people who

758
00:39:24,358 --> 00:39:29,250
want to talk about how good his chem dog

759
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:32,818
crosses were love people loved his cam

760
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:34,949
down crosses just go I only knew him

761
00:39:32,818 --> 00:39:39,808
just from the internet he's just a turd

762
00:39:34,949 --> 00:39:41,769
you know big attitude and you know

763
00:39:39,809 --> 00:39:46,030
wasn't afraid to

764
00:39:41,769 --> 00:39:49,989
get into it with people and but yeah he

765
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:55,600
made some good crosses but uh yeah just

766
00:39:49,989 --> 00:39:58,089
just a bad yeah bad just don't like to

767
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:01,630
talk and talk about the guys yeah yeah

768
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:04,480
now that's no worries when when G was in

769
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:05,829
jail I mean this might just be totally

770
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,659
unrelated but like I mean how did that

771
00:40:05,829 --> 00:40:09,909
affect Kem family I'm also like what

772
00:40:07,659 --> 00:40:11,199
we's Kem family just this loose term to

773
00:40:09,909 --> 00:40:14,469
you or is it actually something more

774
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:17,169
than that you know like it's like it's

775
00:40:14,469 --> 00:40:20,109
that's it's kind of loose term but it's

776
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:22,990
you know there's you know people that

777
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:26,530
know the story and that are involved in

778
00:40:22,989 --> 00:40:31,509
it and you know friends of geez friends

779
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:35,140
of know my JJ those guys but uh Joe's

780
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:37,630
but yeah that's kind of different groups

781
00:40:35,139 --> 00:40:40,629
of people I guess together that are

782
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:43,570
associated with it and so have you guys

783
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:44,769
ever thought about like maybe pushing is

784
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:46,630
not the right word but you know like

785
00:40:44,769 --> 00:40:48,639
creating a brand similar to the way

786
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:50,920
cookie fam have done it and you know in

787
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:52,739
my opinion they've almost detached

788
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:55,510
themselves from being a hundred percent

789
00:40:52,739 --> 00:40:57,489
associated with cannabis and it's more

790
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:58,900
just a brand now you know have you guys

791
00:40:57,489 --> 00:41:01,239
ever thought about that with the chemcam

792
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:05,710
not really I think about it all the time

793
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:08,409
yeah I would I would love to it's just

794
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:10,720
we're kind of all in different areas of

795
00:41:08,409 --> 00:41:16,509
the country and doing different things

796
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:20,739
and I've always had a career and just

797
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:22,810
you know just the the time but uh would

798
00:41:20,739 --> 00:41:28,379
love to some day would love to I know

799
00:41:22,809 --> 00:41:32,559
the messaging as the copywriter for that

800
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:37,240
got the names chem dog or chem family or

801
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:40,920
something so yeah you know yeah that was

802
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:40,919
funny Duke told us the story about how

803
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:47,710
pretty interesting so how do you feel

804
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,450
about chem dog being put into feminized

805
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:50,980
form regardless of which cutting it is

806
00:41:49,449 --> 00:41:53,019
because the reason why I asked that is

807
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:55,179
because it's one of those strains where

808
00:41:53,019 --> 00:41:57,489
you you really never find

809
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:59,318
real-deal chem 91 feminized or a

810
00:41:57,489 --> 00:42:00,639
real-deal chem d feminized do you think

811
00:41:59,318 --> 00:42:01,989
that's something which the chem pam has

812
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:02,949
thought about and thought like we don't

813
00:42:01,989 --> 00:42:04,389
want that to happen

814
00:42:02,949 --> 00:42:05,710
or it's just you guys thought they

815
00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:07,808
wouldn't like the seeds themselves

816
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:12,190
wouldn't turn out very good or what's

817
00:42:07,809 --> 00:42:15,730
your opinion on that I would love to see

818
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:19,659
it happen but I would like to see you

819
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:20,769
know skunk Pierre last year you know one

820
00:42:19,659 --> 00:42:25,058
of those guys do it

821
00:42:20,769 --> 00:42:28,389
not you know not no not anyone else so

822
00:42:25,059 --> 00:42:30,609
yeah well I think that's what is a

823
00:42:28,389 --> 00:42:32,949
really good reason to be getting skunk

824
00:42:30,608 --> 00:42:34,420
stuff because as far as I'm concerned

825
00:42:32,949 --> 00:42:35,919
like I don't know if I'd really trust

826
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:38,670
many people except for like you know you

827
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:45,068
and Tommy to be having a legitimate 91

828
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:48,849
yeah no I I would jump on the skunk EA's

829
00:42:45,068 --> 00:42:52,929
seeds actually my friend got some for me

830
00:42:48,849 --> 00:42:55,240
and at the Emerald cup which you were

831
00:42:52,929 --> 00:42:56,828
out at right yeah I was hanging out yeah

832
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:59,618
cool

833
00:42:56,829 --> 00:43:07,720
so he's got those in Durango for me so

834
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:10,809
next time I see him off so yeah it's I'm

835
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:13,539
excited I'm excited for those and I'm

836
00:43:10,809 --> 00:43:16,420
not a seed guy at all so yeah but I'm

837
00:43:13,539 --> 00:43:18,369
excited for this so this is a question

838
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:19,990
I've been asking ever in the chem fam

839
00:43:18,369 --> 00:43:21,519
and I think I might not actually get an

840
00:43:19,989 --> 00:43:23,289
answer into like an ostrich e himself

841
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:25,389
but I remember reading this post online

842
00:43:23,289 --> 00:43:26,920
that said that like I think it was from

843
00:43:25,389 --> 00:43:29,409
like G's point of view like he was

844
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:31,088
writing it and and he said that he

845
00:43:29,409 --> 00:43:32,649
always found that like can't intercept

846
00:43:31,088 --> 00:43:35,199
chem dog so I assumed maybe it means the

847
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:36,579
91 he said that always came out best if

848
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:38,139
you good organically but then in the

849
00:43:36,579 --> 00:43:40,450
later part of flour used like a

850
00:43:38,139 --> 00:43:42,338
synthetic PK booster and it really

851
00:43:40,449 --> 00:43:43,269
brought out the chem flavor do you know

852
00:43:42,338 --> 00:43:44,650
if there's any truth to that have you

853
00:43:43,269 --> 00:43:47,429
ever heard anyone say anything like that

854
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:50,818
or not you couldn't really comment on it

855
00:43:47,429 --> 00:43:56,440
yeah I couldn't really comment on that

856
00:43:50,818 --> 00:44:00,429
we had you I just know I I'm I'm not an

857
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:06,460
organic I mean I'm like 80% organic so

858
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:08,529
and I take I guess that taking it a lot

859
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:12,610
of people take it to 70 days

860
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:17,380
and you know Duke likes to take and I

861
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:20,980
think skunk va2 a lot you know shorter

862
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:24,760
than that like sixty days so they say

863
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:26,860
that really brings out the flavor let it

864
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:31,210
go too long gets more of a narcotic I

865
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:33,610
and the taste kind of kind of fade so I

866
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:35,590
got some now going in my basement that

867
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:38,140
I'm gonna take it sixty days this time

868
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:41,910
I've always taking it like 70 so I'm

869
00:44:38,139 --> 00:44:44,559
gonna give that a shot see what happens

870
00:44:41,909 --> 00:44:46,659
well I mean with that in mind what was

871
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:50,380
the strongest batch of 91 you've ever

872
00:44:46,659 --> 00:44:53,109
had and then who grew it I would have to

873
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:54,970
I mean just the first time I really

874
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:58,390
smoked it you know it was from a Jeep

875
00:44:54,969 --> 00:45:01,389
from gee so I'm gonna say from him just

876
00:44:58,389 --> 00:45:05,379
just you know memory is just like wow

877
00:45:01,389 --> 00:45:08,859
it's just so strong and just brought me

878
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:12,280
back to smoking that dog died in Crested

879
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:16,920
Butte on dead tour 1991 so I'd have to

880
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:22,210
say mass G's the best 91 I've smoked

881
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:23,650
with Tommy Tommy a close second yeah yep

882
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:26,230
have you ever have you ever tried on

883
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:28,059
skunks cuz i Tommy actually says the

884
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:31,449
heating's yeah I have five tribes

885
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:35,849
I've tried his in his is phenomenal -

886
00:45:31,449 --> 00:45:41,379
yeah yeah yeah but I've I've had more

887
00:45:35,849 --> 00:45:43,150
masteries and Tommy so yeah and so when

888
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:45,280
you I mean just going back to when you

889
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:47,860
were first smoking the 91 for example

890
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,750
with it was it just like I mean I try to

891
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:51,460
describe to people what smoking the 91

892
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:52,780
is like and I all I can say is like it's

893
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:54,820
just a different beast you know like

894
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:58,300
it's really just uncompelled or to a lot

895
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:59,500
of strains in many regards did you feel

896
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,880
that way at first like was there

897
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:02,500
anything that could compare to what it

898
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:06,280
all or was it just so foreign at the

899
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:09,219
time just because I had smoked you know

900
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:12,250
we smoked the dog but 91 that summer

901
00:46:09,219 --> 00:46:17,129
that was it and then you know I smoked

902
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:20,289
the 91 and not until like oh five so

903
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:23,260
yeah it was absolutely

904
00:46:20,289 --> 00:46:27,460
just amazing the narcotic high it has

905
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:29,890
and expand it that expand us in your

906
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:31,599
lungs where you try to hold it in and

907
00:46:29,889 --> 00:46:33,309
it's just like it's just growing and

908
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:37,118
expanding in your lungs and you got it

909
00:46:33,309 --> 00:46:40,599
just you got to blow it out and then

910
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:43,780
just instantly instantly high after it

911
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:47,858
it's just just strong it's just strong

912
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:49,690
strong weak yeah I mean the first time I

913
00:46:47,858 --> 00:46:52,929
had it I think I was kind of green dad

914
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:54,820
so I tell you understand what and it

915
00:46:52,929 --> 00:46:59,108
says you don't get immune to it there's

916
00:46:54,820 --> 00:47:03,750
no ceiling it's just it's great medicine

917
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:03,750
I mean if you have stomach problems or

918
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:11,980
you know anything like that it's it's

919
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:14,619
great for that so I mean the the dog but

920
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:17,500
you know that's often referenced as you

921
00:47:14,619 --> 00:47:19,329
know the parent or maybe just loosely as

922
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:21,460
like the closest thing to the chem dog

923
00:47:19,329 --> 00:47:23,500
at least back in the day but I mean you

924
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:25,240
also mention the Skelly hash plant which

925
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:27,880
is kind of a new cutlet to come on the

926
00:47:25,239 --> 00:47:29,259
scene where do you think the chem dog

927
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:35,890
originates from you know there's a lot

928
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:38,680
of debate the dog blood from people that

929
00:47:35,889 --> 00:47:40,960
have over the years that have asked the

930
00:47:38,679 --> 00:47:42,789
guys that brought it into crusted be

931
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:46,300
where it came from was like some valley

932
00:47:42,789 --> 00:47:50,710
in Oregon where it came from I don't

933
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:53,200
know it was being grown there indoors

934
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:57,369
there or not but that's why I heard it

935
00:47:53,199 --> 00:48:01,029
came from the Camus Camus Valley in

936
00:47:57,369 --> 00:48:04,210
Oregon I think is what it was called but

937
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:08,170
we still don't you know don't know for

938
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:16,590
sure where it came from the scaly hash

939
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:18,579
plan is that was from 1987 I believe

940
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:22,059
friends of friends went over to

941
00:48:18,579 --> 00:48:24,789
Amsterdam and brought bought some seeds

942
00:48:22,059 --> 00:48:28,789
just labeled hash when in a coffee shop

943
00:48:24,789 --> 00:48:33,679
in Amsterdam and brought him back

944
00:48:28,789 --> 00:48:35,869
to Leadville Colorado and I think there

945
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:39,529
are six seeds and this this one was the

946
00:48:35,869 --> 00:48:44,319
key was the keeper and yeah went to

947
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:47,120
Crested Butte and some guy named Skelly

948
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:49,580
that was his nickname was kind of the

949
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:52,329
guy that grew it was kind of a master of

950
00:48:49,579 --> 00:48:55,759
growing it and that's where it came

951
00:48:52,329 --> 00:49:00,460
scale we hashed plant yeah it was called

952
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:00,460
and then got I got renamed the talk

953
00:49:00,849 --> 00:49:06,860
because my friend would go over your

954
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:09,800
friend fatty will go over to my friend

955
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:12,950
Rob's house always goes you have any of

956
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:14,780
the puck do you need the puck farther

957
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:17,779
were like what the heck are you talking

958
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:21,620
about and Rob had kept his hash plan in

959
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:25,220
this fly-fishing container that holds

960
00:49:21,619 --> 00:49:28,429
flies it's like a plastic and it was

961
00:49:25,219 --> 00:49:31,069
black from the resin and they looked

962
00:49:28,429 --> 00:49:35,989
like a hockey puck so fatty would he

963
00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:39,289
just kind of named it the puck and so he

964
00:49:35,989 --> 00:49:41,359
must have spread that around I've lost

965
00:49:39,289 --> 00:49:45,139
contact with him but he must have spread

966
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:48,980
that around Colorado pretty pretty good

967
00:49:45,139 --> 00:49:51,230
and so when I got back I moved up here

968
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:54,050
to Denver and with a friend and he's

969
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:56,630
like oh yeah I got this string on this

970
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:59,990
hash plant strength he's like oh you

971
00:49:56,630 --> 00:50:02,150
need the puck and I just put two and two

972
00:49:59,989 --> 00:50:04,519
together I was like fatty he or just

973
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:06,320
he's one of the funniest guys I've ever

974
00:50:04,519 --> 00:50:08,030
met and he spread that word around

975
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:11,000
Colorado the puck so that kind of

976
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:16,720
changed the name of it but it's just an

977
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:20,869
old strong mother's really just strong

978
00:50:16,719 --> 00:50:22,939
strong strains yeah I mean it's another

979
00:50:20,869 --> 00:50:24,380
one that's in a league of its own yeah

980
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:27,230
it's just it's crazy

981
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:29,090
have you ever seen anything that maybe

982
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:30,469
you know the third trifecta or do you

983
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:32,200
think at the moment they know anyone in

984
00:50:30,469 --> 00:50:34,459
the Parker in a league of their own

985
00:50:32,199 --> 00:50:37,099
pretty much in the league your own and

986
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:39,800
then they always you know we smoked that

987
00:50:37,099 --> 00:50:42,650
hat we're smokin T bud and then the hash

988
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:45,460
plant Skelly ash went pop came

989
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:47,990
around and that just was just insane and

990
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:49,820
then we've really never compared

991
00:50:47,989 --> 00:50:55,839
anything to houseplant except the dog

992
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:58,850
bud so those two really are just the two

993
00:50:55,840 --> 00:51:02,829
strongest most incredible strains that

994
00:50:58,849 --> 00:51:06,409
I've ever seen yeah without a doubt

995
00:51:02,829 --> 00:51:08,840
so how do you deal with people trying to

996
00:51:06,409 --> 00:51:10,670
give you you know quite the real history

997
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:13,100
of the CHEM dog is it at the point now

998
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:14,840
where you've so many people try to tell

999
00:51:13,099 --> 00:51:19,039
you you know about your life you just

1000
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:21,260
don't even care anymore we just got into

1001
00:51:19,039 --> 00:51:25,579
the guy Instagram the other day about

1002
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:30,380
his uncle was his uncle at the kem dog

1003
00:51:25,579 --> 00:51:33,860
before mass G and it was always spelled

1004
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:37,579
d AWG and so yeah it's a you know a

1005
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:40,309
weekly monthly thing at least but I've

1006
00:51:37,579 --> 00:51:43,190
heard so many so many stories and so

1007
00:51:40,309 --> 00:51:45,500
many people's claims and it's just

1008
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:48,860
frustrating because we lived it and I

1009
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:53,000
know it's true you know it was our life

1010
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:54,890
and you know mass G's life and you know

1011
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,210
there's a guy there's last ye and you

1012
00:51:54,889 --> 00:52:00,109
know there's the guys that should get

1013
00:51:56,210 --> 00:52:03,050
credit for it and Joe brand and you know

1014
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:06,230
those guys won't people try to take

1015
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:09,010
credit for it it's that's pretty weak

1016
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:13,190
but uh it's I'm used to it now

1017
00:52:09,010 --> 00:52:14,900
yeah and so I mean it's probably a

1018
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:16,519
question a lot of people have asking is

1019
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:19,460
the Donnell thinking in their mind is

1020
00:52:16,519 --> 00:52:20,780
that Joe brands been seemingly absent

1021
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:22,760
from the scene for a while do you think

1022
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:25,220
he'll ever pop his head back up or maybe

1023
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:28,940
he's not interested so he's never really

1024
00:52:25,219 --> 00:52:33,199
been a you know Internet and out there

1025
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:36,440
kind of guy you know I hope someday he

1026
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:38,869
does but uh I tried to call him and see

1027
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:41,150
if he wanted to do do this interview but

1028
00:52:38,869 --> 00:52:43,190
uh I didn't get in touch with them but

1029
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:43,940
you know hopefully someday you know he

1030
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:46,700
will

1031
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:51,679
I love the guy and hope for the best one

1032
00:52:46,699 --> 00:52:54,529
for sure yeah and so maybe a little left

1033
00:52:51,679 --> 00:52:56,599
of the last question is you've been

1034
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:58,610
around long enough now that you've seen

1035
00:52:56,599 --> 00:53:00,860
come and go and you've probably seen far

1036
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:02,410
more quote fad strains than just blue

1037
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:04,730
trim and Girl Scout cookies

1038
00:53:02,409 --> 00:53:07,009
what do you think will stand the test of

1039
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:12,349
time and what do you think is hot right

1040
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:14,390
now that's gonna pass I mean I I'm

1041
00:53:12,349 --> 00:53:18,500
really starting to get into although

1042
00:53:14,389 --> 00:53:21,469
geez like TK and that's that V and you

1043
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:27,860
know I think those things are always be

1044
00:53:21,469 --> 00:53:29,779
around you know the headband and all

1045
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:33,200
those you know those good right I think

1046
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:37,130
TK and sfv are just two of the best OGS

1047
00:53:33,199 --> 00:53:40,099
out there and I think they'll don't

1048
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:42,500
stand the test of time and whatever

1049
00:53:40,099 --> 00:53:46,579
people can you know that Kemp Scout is

1050
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:49,610
amazing you know the state now JJ stuff

1051
00:53:46,579 --> 00:53:53,119
is amazing so there's a lot of people

1052
00:53:49,610 --> 00:53:57,200
getting more and more chem crosses out

1053
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:58,849
there and I think you know if you have a

1054
00:53:57,199 --> 00:54:02,329
good Kemp gross it'll stand the test of

1055
00:53:58,849 --> 00:54:04,069
time for sure and so I was gonna say it

1056
00:54:02,329 --> 00:54:08,469
is how does that stock Hill you've been

1057
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:13,120
raving about lineup to those it's good

1058
00:54:08,469 --> 00:54:16,909
it's good you know I'm not a big fan of

1059
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:18,859
this the Scots OGE or the rugby I mean I

1060
00:54:16,909 --> 00:54:22,670
think they're good but this star killers

1061
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:24,050
a step above it's it's it's right up

1062
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:27,019
there with with some of the better

1063
00:54:24,050 --> 00:54:31,039
orgies for sure and it's one big it's

1064
00:54:27,019 --> 00:54:34,550
one multiple multiple awards to so this

1065
00:54:31,039 --> 00:54:38,329
is my first time growing it so um I'm

1066
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:43,280
excited to see I get about 30 more days

1067
00:54:38,329 --> 00:54:45,559
on that so we'll see so have you got a

1068
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,540
little seed library of your own I mean

1069
00:54:45,559 --> 00:54:49,429
you probably do but the question is what

1070
00:54:47,539 --> 00:54:50,599
what's the next thing you're excited to

1071
00:54:49,429 --> 00:54:52,039
pop because I'm always interested to

1072
00:54:50,599 --> 00:54:53,769
know you know like what are you

1073
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:57,110
personally interested to get going soon

1074
00:54:53,769 --> 00:55:00,130
go give people get me seeds all the time

1075
00:54:57,110 --> 00:55:02,780
so I do have a pretty good selection

1076
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:05,180
what I do is just because I don't have

1077
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:08,240
really the space and the time as I give

1078
00:55:05,179 --> 00:55:10,219
them to good good friends and have that

1079
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:13,459
are into you know pop and see

1080
00:55:10,219 --> 00:55:17,329
and and then they'll find good stuff and

1081
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:21,500
then I can get clothes of that or or or

1082
00:55:17,329 --> 00:55:27,170
whatever but uh these Kendall acam seats

1083
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:31,608
I got which is chem D by 95 my buddy

1084
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:35,030
just pops some of them and so yeah we'll

1085
00:55:31,608 --> 00:55:38,559
see all right he actually harvested some

1086
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:42,530
of that and it turned out great so uh

1087
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:46,099
but yeah mostly i i i give seeds to a

1088
00:55:42,530 --> 00:55:48,050
couple good buddies and and they they

1089
00:55:46,099 --> 00:55:51,769
pop and then you see what we get

1090
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:55,460
yeah and so in terms of your personal

1091
00:55:51,769 --> 00:55:57,170
garden you like kind of like just a few

1092
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:58,220
strains and they're your staples you

1093
00:55:57,170 --> 00:56:00,650

1097
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:13,909
the one i like just I'm growing now just

1098
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:17,358
for you know personal these were before

1099
00:56:13,909 --> 00:56:19,699
I grow for income so when I was going

1100
00:56:17,358 --> 00:56:21,108
for income it was more one strain and

1101
00:56:19,699 --> 00:56:25,730
you know the money strain the big

1102
00:56:21,108 --> 00:56:29,989
producer now I grow a nice you know nice

1103
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:37,820
variety so I got you know SF vtk star

1104
00:56:29,989 --> 00:56:40,279
killer chem D by 95 chem 91 candy so I

1105
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:44,900
got you know all those going right now

1106
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:46,820
so it's uh it's nice to have different

1107
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:49,760
flavors for sure yeah

1108
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:51,260
and have you ever had someone tell you

1109
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:53,000
that like a scam dog cut was

1110
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:54,320
specifically good for a certain

1111
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:57,289
condition because I remember when I

1112
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:58,940
asked Tommy this he said that the camo

1113
00:56:57,289 --> 00:57:02,108
anyone is great people who want to gain

1114
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:02,108
weight because it gives you the munchies

1115
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:08,030
you know this is good for Crohn's or

1116
00:57:05,719 --> 00:57:11,088
something like that Crohn's I chem for

1117
00:57:08,030 --> 00:57:15,220
I've got a couple people that have

1118
00:57:11,088 --> 00:57:19,880
Crohn's and love the Kemp for works

1119
00:57:15,219 --> 00:57:22,009
works great for them I guess stronger

1120
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:22,980
strains I don't know me may work for

1121
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:28,049
that

1122
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:30,358
that disease but yeah and then you know

1123
00:57:28,048 --> 00:57:32,190
no the chem 91 is good for any stomach

1124
00:57:30,358 --> 00:57:37,108
issues for sure got me through my

1125
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:39,480
stomach flu last year during 4/20 so

1126
00:57:37,108 --> 00:57:43,440
yeah it's there they're great medicinal

1127
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:46,380
strains for sure yeah and do you ever

1128
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:48,630
see chem dog being explored more by the

1129
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:51,420
general public as a medicinal strain you

1130
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:52,890
think it's just not it's I mean I guess

1131
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:55,380
the way I think about it is it seems

1132
00:57:52,889 --> 00:57:56,789
like it's like like a band-aid for a

1133
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:59,338
bullet in some ways you know like it's

1134
00:57:56,789 --> 00:58:02,159
it's a very broad acting strain but I

1135
00:57:59,338 --> 00:58:04,739
don't know if it seems specific in many

1136
00:58:02,159 --> 00:58:10,379
ways if you know what I mean yeah I'm

1137
00:58:04,739 --> 00:58:13,588
not really sure and specifics I would

1138
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:18,450
love to see it you know used in medicine

1139
00:58:13,588 --> 00:58:22,108
for sure it's just so strong I don't

1140
00:58:18,449 --> 00:58:26,818
know how you know the side effects or

1141
00:58:22,108 --> 00:58:29,789
you know no I'm just not sure on yeah

1142
00:58:26,818 --> 00:58:33,960
you know the the medicinal part of the

1143
00:58:29,789 --> 00:58:38,548
Kem's but I I know for Chrome's camphor

1144
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:40,108
and stomach issues any cam yeah we got a

1145
00:58:38,548 --> 00:58:43,230
doubt I think it would be interesting to

1146
00:58:40,108 --> 00:58:50,730
see like you know a 91 or a D cross two

1147
00:58:43,230 --> 00:58:53,338
really strong yes yeah sure so this is

1148
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:55,858
just a bit of a hot question here but I

1149
00:58:53,338 --> 00:58:57,389
think it's a good one the 91 show itself

1150
00:58:55,858 --> 00:58:58,558
right despite everything that happened

1151
00:58:57,389 --> 00:59:00,629
you know he was going down as a

1152
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:02,369
legendary show do you remember the show

1153
00:59:00,630 --> 00:59:03,390
itself like was it actually a good show

1154
00:59:02,369 --> 00:59:05,338
because I thought wouldn't it be so

1155
00:59:03,389 --> 00:59:08,219
ironic if like arguably the most

1156
00:59:05,338 --> 00:59:14,058
important you know dead show kind of his

1157
00:59:08,219 --> 00:59:17,959
history was actually do context for me

1158
00:59:14,059 --> 00:59:19,170
the dad kind of started going downhill

1159
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:23,030
91

1160
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:26,940
you know after Brent died he died 90 I

1161
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:28,769
wasn't a big Vince fan Bruce Hornsby

1162
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:31,769
played with him for a while but he had

1163
00:59:28,769 --> 00:59:34,349
stopped shows good I just remember a

1164
00:59:31,769 --> 00:59:37,789
Jack Straw Berthe opener which is like

1165
00:59:34,349 --> 00:59:41,300
my favorite combination opener

1166
00:59:37,789 --> 00:59:45,920
but don't really remember the show -

1167
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:49,818
well the dead were kind of you know 91

1168
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:52,730
man he was a good year 92 93 94 95 were

1169
00:59:49,818 --> 00:59:58,730
all kind of the scene was getting bad

1170
00:59:52,730 --> 01:00:01,280
and jelly was just ill and the dead were

1171
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:03,619
good when they were healthy yeah

1172
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:06,589
straighten us straight up when there are

1173
01:00:03,619 --> 01:00:10,579
healthy they were doing J was all [ __ ]

1174
01:00:06,588 --> 01:00:12,949
up you know it was sloppy and the shows

1175
01:00:10,579 --> 01:00:16,370
are still good but they weren't great

1176
01:00:12,949 --> 01:00:18,338
when like 1990 was probably the last

1177
01:00:16,369 --> 01:00:23,179
[Music]

1178
01:00:18,338 --> 01:00:25,509
great great year spring tour 90 was

1179
01:00:23,179 --> 01:00:29,118
probably the great last great year so

1180
01:00:25,510 --> 01:00:30,890
yeah okay Wow but it was a good show it

1181
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:32,750
was a good show it was good cool venue

1182
01:00:30,889 --> 01:00:36,679
Deer Creek is great it's out in the

1183
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:39,980
middle of nowhere like farmland and

1184
01:00:36,679 --> 01:00:44,480
cornfields and camping and there's fun

1185
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:46,880
times yes I mean the Grateful Dead you

1186
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:49,309
know they kind of passed on the torch

1187
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:52,369
metaphorically to fish when they kind of

1188
01:00:49,309 --> 01:00:55,430
finished up but yeah I've never heard of

1189
01:00:52,369 --> 01:00:57,048
there being you know that same impact on

1190
01:00:55,429 --> 01:00:58,039
the cannabis in is what the Dead had you

1191
01:00:57,048 --> 01:00:59,869
know like I've never heard of there

1192
01:00:58,039 --> 01:01:02,808
being like a car park scene at a Phish

1193
01:00:59,869 --> 01:01:05,289
show for example do you think that that

1194
01:01:02,809 --> 01:01:07,190
was a camera sorry a Grateful Dead

1195
01:01:05,289 --> 01:01:10,880
exclusive thing like do you think we'll

1196
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:12,710
ever get another you know I don't know

1197
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:14,329
how to say like cannabis revolution the

1198
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:17,329
way we did with the Grateful Dead or not

1199
01:01:14,329 --> 01:01:21,170
necessarily I think it's people getting

1200
01:01:17,329 --> 01:01:24,859
them getting it other places now just I

1201
01:01:21,170 --> 01:01:28,670
think back then it was me likes country

1202
01:01:24,858 --> 01:01:30,469
a said is she said this or someone said

1203
01:01:28,670 --> 01:01:34,099
this that you know dead tour was kind of

1204
01:01:30,469 --> 01:01:36,379
like the first Facebook so it was a way

1205
01:01:34,099 --> 01:01:38,720
of connecting with people and you knew

1206
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:46,670
they were gonna be at that next venue

1207
01:01:38,719 --> 01:01:48,798
and so it was kind of I don't know if

1208
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:49,700
fish does that I don't really go I've

1209
01:01:48,798 --> 01:01:54,739
never

1210
01:01:49,699 --> 01:01:58,669
into a fishtail before but yeah I'm not

1211
01:01:54,739 --> 01:02:01,489
really sure if what the scene is like

1212
01:01:58,670 --> 01:02:05,210
there so I probably couldn't comment on

1213
01:02:01,489 --> 01:02:08,269
that but I know the dad was the first

1214
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:11,869
the first Facebook really for social

1215
01:02:08,269 --> 01:02:15,889
media and do you think that besides the

1216
01:02:11,869 --> 01:02:17,929
CEM dog the quite car park scene of the

1217
01:02:15,889 --> 01:02:20,599
Grateful Dead's contributed a lot to

1218
01:02:17,929 --> 01:02:22,699
cannabis in terms of like recognizable

1219
01:02:20,599 --> 01:02:25,099
strains like had you ever heard of like

1220
01:02:22,699 --> 01:02:27,829
Oh someone got you know like a TK cut a

1221
01:02:25,099 --> 01:02:29,239
dead show or like it seems like Kem dog

1222
01:02:27,829 --> 01:02:30,849
is the big one that gets talked about in

1223
01:02:29,239 --> 01:02:34,819
regards to the Grateful Dead

1224
01:02:30,849 --> 01:02:40,190
yeah em dogs definitely the the big one

1225
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:42,740
I think more it was more of you know

1226
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:48,950
selling flowers that the at the show

1227
01:02:42,739 --> 01:02:52,849
sellin selling buds and and you know I'm

1228
01:02:48,949 --> 01:02:56,449
sure you know cuts and stuff like that

1229
01:02:52,849 --> 01:02:59,239
were traded but the chem dog one is that

1230
01:02:56,449 --> 01:03:01,389
is the is the big one that you know most

1231
01:02:59,239 --> 01:03:04,759
people associate with it

1232
01:03:01,389 --> 01:03:06,710
so I mean how do you feel about the og

1233
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:08,150
in relation to the chem dog because I

1234
01:03:06,710 --> 01:03:09,920
mean I realized just as I asked that

1235
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:12,680
question there was a big major floor and

1236
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:14,539
that I mean in my mind I feel like the

1237
01:03:12,679 --> 01:03:17,210
chem dog is either the daughter or a

1238
01:03:14,539 --> 01:03:18,349
sister or like some some close relative

1239
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:19,849
to the chem dog so I mean you're

1240
01:03:18,349 --> 01:03:21,289
probably not gonna get an OG cut at a

1241
01:03:19,849 --> 01:03:23,329
Grateful Dead show back in the day but

1242
01:03:21,289 --> 01:03:25,039
how do you feel all of that relates

1243
01:03:23,329 --> 01:03:27,230
together are you of the same school of

1244
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:28,940
thought that it's probably some close

1245
01:03:27,230 --> 01:03:33,409
relative or I think they're I think

1246
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:40,539
they're related for sure I think oh geez

1247
01:03:33,409 --> 01:03:44,779
uh just you know an S one from a bag of

1248
01:03:40,539 --> 01:03:48,500
91 I mean I can't prove it but that's my

1249
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:51,560
thoughts I think now that I'm grown oh

1250
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:56,269
geez they they they remind me of the

1251
01:03:51,559 --> 01:04:01,090
ninety one you know not as big of buds

1252
01:03:56,269 --> 01:04:03,679
but they definitely remind me of it so

1253
01:04:01,090 --> 01:04:07,009
that's that's what I think but

1254
01:04:03,679 --> 01:04:11,960
the og question is kind of a tough one

1255
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:15,440
to crack for sure yeah yeah so if you

1256
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:18,528
were in G's position back in that time

1257
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:19,670
when you know he was fresh 17 or 18 do

1258
01:04:18,528 --> 01:04:23,170
you think that would have been able to

1259
01:04:19,670 --> 01:04:26,690
keep the cuts alive as well as he did

1260
01:04:23,170 --> 01:04:29,329
depending on my back at that young

1261
01:04:26,690 --> 01:04:32,690
probably not know just because I

1262
01:04:29,329 --> 01:04:38,630
wouldn't have had I wouldn't have had

1263
01:04:32,690 --> 01:04:40,700
that spot to do it just I was living

1264
01:04:38,630 --> 01:04:43,369
just at my parents house and I wouldn't

1265
01:04:40,699 --> 01:04:48,710
have been able to to do that sort of

1266
01:04:43,369 --> 01:04:50,690
thing but thank God he did yeah I mean

1267
01:04:48,710 --> 01:04:53,749
the reason I'm just so amazed like I

1268
01:04:50,690 --> 01:04:56,150
just I I don't I haven't met anyone

1269
01:04:53,748 --> 01:04:57,468
who's truthfully said that like yes oh I

1270
01:04:56,150 --> 01:04:59,269
could have been in that position and

1271
01:04:57,469 --> 01:05:01,969
also kept those cuts alive for all those

1272
01:04:59,268 --> 01:05:06,488
years it's just so mind-blowing it's

1273
01:05:01,969 --> 01:05:12,409
it's awesome and just yeah the work and

1274
01:05:06,489 --> 01:05:14,749
that he did to keep those alive and the

1275
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:15,338
crosses and all that yeah it's it's

1276
01:05:14,748 --> 01:05:18,409
awesome

1277
01:05:15,338 --> 01:05:21,228
have you ever asked him why he waited

1278
01:05:18,409 --> 01:05:23,598
such long periods of time him between

1279
01:05:21,228 --> 01:05:24,949
popping the successive seeds like I've

1280
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:26,719
always wondered why did he wait four

1281
01:05:24,949 --> 01:05:29,088
years between popping the first and the

1282
01:05:26,719 --> 01:05:34,880
next batch like so yeah I'm not sure why

1283
01:05:29,088 --> 01:05:37,159
did that I think it was smart I think he

1284
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:42,259
knew he had something special and didn't

1285
01:05:37,159 --> 01:05:46,368
want to blow it all maybe uh yep and do

1286
01:05:42,259 --> 01:05:50,778
it over over time just nice because he

1287
01:05:46,369 --> 01:05:53,930
sent those four seeds to Joe which was

1288
01:05:50,778 --> 01:05:56,929
which was pretty cool so yeah I mean a

1289
01:05:53,929 --> 01:05:59,960
lot of what he did that yeah a lot of

1290
01:05:56,929 --> 01:06:01,308
people probably really kind of I don't

1291
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:02,449
know how to phrase it you know like they

1292
01:06:01,309 --> 01:06:04,519
were probably thinking I wouldn't have

1293
01:06:02,449 --> 01:06:06,649
done that if they're in his position you

1294
01:06:04,518 --> 01:06:10,488
know given that he knew what the seeds

1295
01:06:06,650 --> 01:06:13,969
were at that point yeah no I think that

1296
01:06:10,489 --> 01:06:16,500
was huge of him to do and just such a

1297
01:06:13,969 --> 01:06:19,139
nice nice thing because

1298
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:21,900
after Jo got back in touch with the kids

1299
01:06:19,139 --> 01:06:25,379
it's been like a yeah nice to nice to

1300
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:28,769
talk to you again yes you know you can

1301
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:31,650
have some cuts but you know not not for

1302
01:06:28,769 --> 01:06:34,320
the seeds yeah I think that was a great

1303
01:06:31,650 --> 01:06:36,030
thing you did yeah so I mean not

1304
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:37,410
necessarily in relation to giving the

1305
01:06:36,030 --> 01:06:39,480
seeds to Joe because obviously that was

1306
01:06:37,409 --> 01:06:41,279
a very nice thing to do but if you're in

1307
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:42,929
G's position would you have ever done it

1308
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:44,760
differently like would you have popped

1309
01:06:42,929 --> 01:06:46,589
them all at the start or just sat on

1310
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:48,650
them for longer or you know what would

1311
01:06:46,590 --> 01:06:54,000
you have done

1312
01:06:48,650 --> 01:06:58,440
tough questions I would have probably I

1313
01:06:54,000 --> 01:07:01,739
would have probably popped tomorrow and

1314
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:06,300
just you know gotten what we got and

1315
01:07:01,739 --> 01:07:10,289
then save save those you know kept all

1316
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:12,930
the keepers and saved them so yeah so

1317
01:07:10,289 --> 01:07:14,608
this is an interesting thing I've been

1318
01:07:12,929 --> 01:07:16,980
told which you've probably been told as

1319
01:07:14,608 --> 01:07:18,750
well is that someone's told me before

1320
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:20,400
they said I think that the chem dog seed

1321
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:22,108
to a result they're all s vartanus

1322
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:23,760
basically and I said yeah but there was

1323
01:07:22,108 --> 01:07:25,858
that male you know and that kind of

1324
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:27,240
ruins that theory yeah and then they

1325
01:07:25,858 --> 01:07:29,069
were like yeah but no one ever saw that

1326
01:07:27,239 --> 01:07:31,500
male it's almost like that male is like

1327
01:07:29,070 --> 01:07:33,150
conveniently inserted into the story so

1328
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:35,280
that people wouldn't think they're RS

1329
01:07:33,150 --> 01:07:37,019
ones and I thought about that and I

1330
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:38,310
thought well I see what you're saying

1331
01:07:37,019 --> 01:07:39,690
you know like the fact the male was

1332
01:07:38,309 --> 01:07:42,119
there does show that they probably

1333
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:44,820
weren't s ones but at the same time I

1334
01:07:42,119 --> 01:07:45,900
don't see why she would lie about them

1335
01:07:44,820 --> 01:07:48,330
you know like what does he have to gain

1336
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:51,240
from that really there's nothing to gain

1337
01:07:48,329 --> 01:07:53,909
I mean he wasn't putting himself as he

1338
01:07:51,239 --> 01:07:57,809
killed it so it wasn't really putting

1339
01:07:53,909 --> 01:08:03,000
himself in a good light but yeah I told

1340
01:07:57,809 --> 01:08:04,769
that yes tell the truth yeah yeah that

1341
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:07,260
so I guess what the question really was

1342
01:08:04,769 --> 01:08:08,699
was that um given that there was males

1343
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:10,589
there what do you speculate the father

1344
01:08:08,699 --> 01:08:12,389
was you know I don't believe their

1345
01:08:10,588 --> 01:08:17,309
response how I guess you've kind of said

1346
01:08:12,389 --> 01:08:22,009
the same yeah I bet I'm not I'm not

1347
01:08:17,310 --> 01:08:24,509
really sure what the father is

1348
01:08:22,009 --> 01:08:26,729
Tommy would probably know that better

1349
01:08:24,509 --> 01:08:29,880
than better than me being a breeder and

1350
01:08:26,729 --> 01:08:32,729
knowing that sort of thing but uh yeah I

1351
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:34,469
would I wouldn't know yeah the reason I

1352
01:08:32,729 --> 01:08:37,048
ask that is just because I'm a lot of

1353
01:08:34,469 --> 01:08:40,109
people have this you know thought that

1354
01:08:37,048 --> 01:08:42,930
the father is what passes on the potency

1355
01:08:40,109 --> 01:08:44,430
more so and so yeah I'm always

1356
01:08:42,930 --> 01:08:47,310
interested to know what the father of

1357
01:08:44,430 --> 01:08:51,930
things yeah for sure

1358
01:08:47,310 --> 01:08:58,109
I think maybe the puck could be related

1359
01:08:51,930 --> 01:08:59,759
to the to the dog bird someway yeah it's

1360
01:08:58,109 --> 01:09:03,539
kind of always thought that for very

1361
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:06,270
similar so I mean see you given that you

1362
01:09:03,539 --> 01:09:08,488
have been trying all of this you know

1363
01:09:06,270 --> 01:09:11,880
high-quality weed from back in the early

1364
01:09:08,488 --> 01:09:13,559
roots so to speak do you think that the

1365
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:15,960
modern-day hybrids are standing up to

1366
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:17,279
those old favorites or you know do you

1367
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:18,029
still find yourself reminiscing about

1368
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:23,630
the past

1369
01:09:18,029 --> 01:09:29,880
I think the pair yeah there's a few that

1370
01:09:23,630 --> 01:09:34,219
can stand up to the to the cams but the

1371
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:38,159
most of them just don't they just don't

1372
01:09:34,219 --> 01:09:40,199
and so do you think that modern hybrids

1373
01:09:38,159 --> 01:09:43,920
have mostly improved on flavor and not

1374
01:09:40,199 --> 01:09:45,179
so much potency per se yeah I think a

1375
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:49,409
lot of people are out there for the

1376
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:54,510
flavor where I've always been for the

1377
01:09:49,409 --> 01:09:56,219
potency not real I don't really care too

1378
01:09:54,510 --> 01:09:59,369
much what it tastes like it's got you

1379
01:09:56,219 --> 01:10:03,119
know but could we taste good I mean they

1380
01:09:59,369 --> 01:10:07,559
it just doesn't I like that expanding in

1381
01:10:03,119 --> 01:10:09,510
your lungs and coughing and all that

1382
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:13,830
stuff I like I like the strong stuff

1383
01:10:09,510 --> 01:10:15,480
that's why I've just I smoke Kem's and

1384
01:10:13,829 --> 01:10:19,109
oh geez that's about it

1385
01:10:15,479 --> 01:10:24,238
yep you don't ever dabble in any glass

1386
01:10:19,109 --> 01:10:25,409
wax do you no just just by yeah it's

1387
01:10:24,238 --> 01:10:26,939
just the reason I ask is it's like it

1388
01:10:25,409 --> 01:10:28,529
seems like there's so many people in the

1389
01:10:26,939 --> 01:10:32,039
chem fam who dabble in you know whether

1390
01:10:28,529 --> 01:10:33,599
it be on yeah I'm not sure he's real

1391
01:10:32,039 --> 01:10:36,960
name which is a weasel I think he's also

1392
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:40,170
a glass blower yeah he's yeah he's blows

1393

heavily now people like cuz they say you

1414

know I mean I'm not a glass expert or

1415
01:11:36,448 --> 01:11:39,149
anything but they they always ask me

1416
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:40,770
know who should I get my glass from this

1417
01:11:39,149 --> 01:11:46,710
why well there's only one name I minato

1418
01:11:40,770 --> 01:11:53,159
yo dog glass he makes I love his colors

1419
01:11:46,710 --> 01:11:56,369
and the Milly's he puts in on there it's

1420
01:11:53,158 --> 01:11:58,079
nice yeah and I remember Tommy was even

1421
01:11:56,369 --> 01:12:00,119
saying like some of those Milly's are

1422
01:11:58,079 --> 01:12:01,590
like quite old and rare even so like you

1423
01:12:00,119 --> 01:12:04,529
truly are getting your money's worth

1424
01:12:01,590 --> 01:12:06,179
oh yeah in the time he puts into them

1425
01:12:04,529 --> 01:12:07,769
and yeah

1426
01:12:06,179 --> 01:12:11,579
oh hey man yeah they're great I've got a

1427
01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:13,320
dead 50 piece that he made oh wow for

1428
01:12:11,579 --> 01:12:17,519
the dead shows last year and it's got

1429
01:12:13,319 --> 01:12:21,029
like 10 dead Milly's in it and yeah it's

1430
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:24,360
it's it's my favourite piece that's the

1431
01:12:21,029 --> 01:12:26,639
one if I break I'd be I'd be crying yeah

1432
01:12:24,359 --> 01:12:28,049
it's funny I got a few dead ones in mine

1433
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:34,650
it's like I always have to tell what

1434
01:12:28,050 --> 01:12:36,390
they are so I think a good way to get

1435
01:12:34,649 --> 01:12:40,198
back into this would be um you know like

1436
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:41,760
count dog is just the epitome of indica

1437
01:12:40,198 --> 01:12:44,639
you know you really can't get more

1438
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:46,260
indica than that how do you balance the

1439
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:47,369
sativa side out because I it's

1440
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:49,260
interesting when I was talking to mr.

1441
01:12:47,369 --> 01:12:50,250
Sol the way he described was chem dog

1442
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:53,039
was like it was that perfect

1443
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:54,420
counterpoint to the really super sativas

1444
01:12:53,039 --> 01:12:55,710
he enjoys smoking you know

1445
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:57,929
kind of bringing you back to earth when

1446
01:12:55,710 --> 01:13:01,260
you've blasted off too hard how do you

1447
01:12:57,929 --> 01:13:03,239
view sativas in relation to chem dogging

1448
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:04,829
or is it just like chem dog filled your

1449
01:13:03,238 --> 01:13:05,849
need and you don't venture to that side

1450
01:13:04,829 --> 01:13:09,539
of the river so to speak

1451
01:13:05,850 --> 01:13:12,320
I don't really venture to sativas I mean

1452
01:13:09,539 --> 01:13:16,109
I think the teams are really good like

1453
01:13:12,319 --> 01:13:19,529
daytime you know get you up and going

1454
01:13:16,109 --> 01:13:25,170
and good for like at work and stuff but

1455
01:13:19,529 --> 01:13:29,729
uh I've just always liked that you know

1456
01:13:25,170 --> 01:13:33,090
that just the knock you dead hi so I've

1457
01:13:29,729 --> 01:13:35,729
always I just wanted to smoke the pop to

1458
01:13:33,090 --> 01:13:38,369
get you the highest that's that's my

1459
01:13:35,729 --> 01:13:43,319
personality so sativas really never

1460
01:13:38,369 --> 01:13:46,519
really did it for me so yeah just I I

1461
01:13:43,319 --> 01:13:51,779
just love the the pose really strong

1462
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:53,969
strong stuff and so how do you think the

1463
01:13:51,779 --> 01:13:55,859
scene would have progressed if there was

1464
01:13:53,969 --> 01:13:58,109
never any chem dog so it seems like a

1465
01:13:55,859 --> 01:14:01,409
bit of a weird question but I always

1466
01:13:58,109 --> 01:14:05,488
think about I don't know it would be a

1467
01:14:01,409 --> 01:14:09,960
sad world out there I think yeah I don't

1468
01:14:05,488 --> 01:14:14,009
know it's like there you'd have another

1469
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:16,409
favorite weed out there yes I don't know

1470
01:14:14,010 --> 01:14:19,409
everything kind of everything I like

1471
01:14:16,409 --> 01:14:21,059
came from camp so yeah that's exactly it

1472
01:14:19,409 --> 01:14:22,710
isn't it because it's an interesting

1473
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:24,239
kind of thought exercise to do with

1474
01:14:22,710 --> 01:14:26,219
yourself where you think of like all

1475
01:14:24,238 --> 01:14:28,169
these big name strains and if they've

1476
01:14:26,219 --> 01:14:29,520
got care Minotaur is suspect be kind of

1477
01:14:28,170 --> 01:14:33,300
cross them off the list you're not left

1478
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:35,969
with March I know you know like no

1479
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:38,310
gorilla cruise out and you know Sour

1480
01:14:35,969 --> 01:14:42,289
Diesel zat house and all those really

1481
01:14:38,310 --> 01:14:44,730
good go strains wouldn't be her

1482
01:14:42,289 --> 01:14:48,630
you just had the special word gorilla

1483
01:14:44,729 --> 01:14:49,559
glue what do you think about it yeah I

1484
01:14:48,630 --> 01:14:54,109
like it

1485
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:58,969
I mean I've grown it than one one time I

1486
01:14:54,109 --> 01:15:02,789
like that I kind of got sick of it but

1487
01:14:58,969 --> 01:15:06,090
they were strong and I'm a fan I'm a fan

1488
01:15:02,789 --> 01:15:07,859
of the girl look cool yeah why something

1489
01:15:06,090 --> 01:15:11,400
about the gorilla glue which really

1490
01:15:07,859 --> 01:15:13,049
if the cam is I mean a a lot of people

1491
01:15:11,399 --> 01:15:16,379
love Gorilla Glue but no one really

1492
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:19,230
shows that same love to the khemsa's and

1493
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:21,000
I think that a lot of the high or the

1494
01:15:19,229 --> 01:15:23,789
enjoyment of the high from the Gorilla

1495
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:26,639
Glue yes from the cam yeah definitely

1496
01:15:23,789 --> 01:15:29,279
definitely yeah the taste is the

1497
01:15:26,639 --> 01:15:32,250
chocolate it's kind of chocolatey and

1498
01:15:29,279 --> 01:15:36,210
smell to me but yeah the high is

1499
01:15:32,250 --> 01:15:38,060
definitely the the sister for sure I

1500
01:15:36,210 --> 01:15:40,408
mean that's where it gets its strength

1501
01:15:38,060 --> 01:15:42,090
yeah and the other interesting thing

1502
01:15:40,408 --> 01:15:44,579
about the gorilla glue which I think it

1503
01:15:42,090 --> 01:15:46,829
it definitely has parallels with the

1504
01:15:44,579 --> 01:15:48,510
chem dog is that it seems now you're

1505
01:15:46,829 --> 01:15:50,250
starting to get these fake gorilla crews

1506
01:15:48,510 --> 01:15:52,980
going around much like the fake chem

1507
01:15:50,250 --> 01:15:54,479
dogs and so you get this situation I

1508
01:15:52,979 --> 01:15:55,769
think it was Tommy who said it where

1509
01:15:54,479 --> 01:15:57,829
it's like you know everyone's had the

1510
01:15:55,770 --> 01:16:00,960
chem dog but no one's had the chem dog

1511
01:15:57,829 --> 01:16:02,368
right anxiety to know about that person

1512
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:05,130
like do you feel like that's a pretty

1513
01:16:02,368 --> 01:16:08,849
accurate reflection cuz yeah like

1514
01:16:05,130 --> 01:16:12,060
something yeah I think a lot of people

1515
01:16:08,850 --> 01:16:14,579
you know claim that they haven't smoked

1516
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:17,670
it or whatever but I think the

1517
01:16:14,579 --> 01:16:20,609
percentage of that is pretty it's pretty

1518
01:16:17,670 --> 01:16:23,730
low and now the night I know that's the

1519
01:16:20,609 --> 01:16:28,469
case on the 91 you know the four is out

1520
01:16:23,729 --> 01:16:31,529
there and more available Joe is really

1521
01:16:28,469 --> 01:16:35,550
generous and giving that out to a lot a

1522
01:16:31,529 --> 01:16:38,130
lot of people you know six and it's kind

1523
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:43,380
of made its way around yes

1524
01:16:38,130 --> 01:16:45,630
and so I mean if we look at it both JJ's

1525
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:48,989
and Reza's work we see that they both

1526
01:16:45,630 --> 01:16:51,000
chose to work with the chem D and we

1527
01:16:48,988 --> 01:16:53,218
know that you like the company more but

1528
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:55,948
in many ways I find it an interesting

1529
01:16:53,219 --> 01:16:57,779
choice because just the the raw potency

1530
01:16:55,948 --> 01:17:00,599
of the ninety-one seems like it would be

1531
01:16:57,779 --> 01:17:02,908
just an obvious one to work with do you

1532
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:04,500
do you agree with this trade-off they've

1533
01:17:02,908 --> 01:17:06,629
done so to speak where you know the

1534
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:08,010
presumption is they've thought well it's

1535
01:17:06,630 --> 01:17:09,690
not quite as strong but it's got better

1536
01:17:08,010 --> 01:17:12,239
flavor or maybe better breeding

1537
01:17:09,689 --> 01:17:13,379
properties do you agree with that choice

1538
01:17:12,238 --> 01:17:17,669
they made or would you have done it

1539
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:20,140
differently no I agree I think the D is

1540
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:24,369
so close to

1541
01:17:20,140 --> 01:17:30,130
as potent as the 91 it's close it's just

1542
01:17:24,369 --> 01:17:34,390
got that I think more people like that

1543
01:17:30,130 --> 01:17:37,869
have that have smoked the real 91 and

1544
01:17:34,390 --> 01:17:43,720
the D like the deep better overall I

1545
01:17:37,869 --> 01:17:46,510
think yeah and it's it's it's very close

1546
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:48,970
to being as strong as that 91 so I think

1547
01:17:46,510 --> 01:17:51,909
that's probably the the smell and the

1548
01:17:48,970 --> 01:17:56,619
it's it's a better yield er than the 91

1549
01:17:51,909 --> 01:18:00,279
so could be another reason well I mean

1550
01:17:56,619 --> 01:18:02,710
do you agree with I think it was not

1551
01:18:00,279 --> 01:18:04,689
skunk himself but he's his former friend

1552
01:18:02,710 --> 01:18:06,130
in the story he told where he was saying

1553
01:18:04,689 --> 01:18:07,389
you know like he feels like there's

1554
01:18:06,130 --> 01:18:09,010
something about the chem dog where it's

1555
01:18:07,390 --> 01:18:10,660
like it's tied to the stars well you

1556
01:18:09,010 --> 01:18:13,150
know like it's this real fickle plant

1557
01:18:10,659 --> 01:18:15,789
that's hard to master so to speak do you

1558
01:18:13,149 --> 01:18:17,109
think that's true or maybe it's just we

1559
01:18:15,789 --> 01:18:21,159
didn't understand plants the way we do

1560
01:18:17,109 --> 01:18:23,649
now no I think it's true I think you

1561
01:18:21,159 --> 01:18:25,899
gotta have experience grown the cams

1562
01:18:23,649 --> 01:18:30,460
they got stuff they like and stuff they

1563
01:18:25,899 --> 01:18:33,069
don't like but in its comfy a has been

1564
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:37,779
growing that strange for these probably

1565
01:18:33,069 --> 01:18:42,880
the you know number one expert on the on

1566
01:18:37,779 --> 01:18:45,670
the 91 for sure yeah yeah with you know

1567
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:51,970
whatever he says I would I would believe

1568
01:18:45,670 --> 01:18:53,319
it yeah yeah so if you had to pick the

1569
01:18:51,970 --> 01:18:55,270
genetics which you think would best

1570
01:18:53,319 --> 01:18:56,559
compliment the 91 I guess to put it in a

1571
01:18:55,270 --> 01:18:57,250
realistic sense if you had to pick a

1572
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:59,110
male

1573
01:18:57,250 --> 01:19:01,390
you know which genetics do you think

1574
01:18:59,109 --> 01:19:04,539
would complement the 91 the best because

1575
01:19:01,390 --> 01:19:06,340
I think I asked Duke and he said that

1576
01:19:04,539 --> 01:19:08,680
yeah he agreed that the Afghani land

1577
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:10,960
race that both JJ and res picked was a

1578
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:22,420
good complement to the D how do you feel

1579
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:27,939
about the 91 yeah I don't know I don't

1580
01:19:22,420 --> 01:19:30,420
know I think I agree with with what

1581
01:19:27,939 --> 01:19:30,419
those guys

1582
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:37,330
yeah yeah so you know not trying to talk

1583
01:19:34,779 --> 01:19:39,639
negatively about it but what are some of

1584
01:19:37,329 --> 01:19:41,260
the the downsides about the chem dogs

1585
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:42,760
which don't frequently get mentioned I

1586
01:19:41,260 --> 01:19:44,860
mean the flavor was brought up a few

1587
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:46,270
times by a few people including us what

1588
01:19:44,859 --> 01:19:49,329
what are some things which people don't

1589
01:19:46,270 --> 01:19:53,350
often consider which do you regard the

1590
01:19:49,329 --> 01:20:00,220
the chem Deacon you know throw manners

1591
01:19:53,350 --> 01:20:04,660
and could very gate and the chem 90 ones

1592
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:06,909
you know a lot the biggest producer but

1593
01:20:04,659 --> 01:20:08,769
you know those things really don't you

1594
01:20:06,909 --> 01:20:10,380
know the DS probably that's probably the

1595
01:20:08,770 --> 01:20:14,860
biggest problem with that one is

1596
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:18,270
throwing out those bananas but they're

1597
01:20:14,859 --> 01:20:20,769
not really there's nothing in them and

1598
01:20:18,270 --> 01:20:23,820
they don't really it's not like a lot of

1599
01:20:20,770 --> 01:20:27,310
them unless it gets stressed but uh

1600
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:29,710
these are probably the biggest problems

1601
01:20:27,310 --> 01:20:31,660
with it yeah it's interesting you bring

1602
01:20:29,710 --> 01:20:33,159
that out because a lot of the best

1603
01:20:31,659 --> 01:20:36,250
strains throughout history of being

1604
01:20:33,159 --> 01:20:38,109
created from the 91 throwing pollen on

1605
01:20:36,250 --> 01:20:40,680
other things but as you just mentioned

1606
01:20:38,109 --> 01:20:45,460
that that the nanos on the D they're

1607
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:48,310
infertile so to speak yeah so do you do

1608
01:20:45,460 --> 01:20:50,199
you find that the 91 is easy to her me

1609
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:51,520
so to speak because that's that's

1610
01:20:50,199 --> 01:20:53,170
something I'm always thinking about you

1611
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:54,730
know given all these strains originated

1612
01:20:53,170 --> 01:20:58,029
from it I would have thought it was easy

1613
01:20:54,729 --> 01:20:59,889
to herm how do you find it no I think

1614
01:20:58,029 --> 01:21:03,369
they are all yeah

1615
01:20:59,890 --> 01:21:06,310
easy easy to herm for sure okay

1616
01:21:03,369 --> 01:21:09,279
interesting and so I mean you know if

1617
01:21:06,310 --> 01:21:11,170
it's not too much effort how you give us

1618
01:21:09,279 --> 01:21:17,019
a quick rundown of what your gross style

1619
01:21:11,170 --> 01:21:22,199
is I do soil or cocoa I just switched

1620
01:21:17,020 --> 01:21:25,030

1621
01:21:22,199 --> 01:21:27,519
got a friend that works for botanic air

1622
01:21:25,029 --> 01:21:31,960

1623
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:34,300

mean I'm not know what some tips for

1639
01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:30,640
people who're looking to grow large

1640
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:32,500
numbers you know like you must have to

1641
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:34,300
do things in you must be looking for

1642
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:39,430
shortcuts all the time given you look up

1643
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:44,020
as so many plans yes and we're we're

1644
01:22:39,430 --> 01:22:46,720
doing soil right now so we're and water

1645
01:22:44,020 --> 01:22:49,360
and everything which takes quite a bit

1646
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:52,570
of time but we're up close and personal

1647
01:22:49,359 --> 01:22:54,969
with the plants and it's when you get

1648
01:22:52,569 --> 01:23:00,210
into big things like that you just have

1649
01:22:54,970 --> 01:23:04,060
to be more just on top of things

1650
01:23:00,210 --> 01:23:07,989
preventive and start one that you know

1651
01:23:04,060 --> 01:23:09,760
the plants small and you know just make

1652
01:23:07,989 --> 01:23:14,079
sure it's really really healthy to fight

1653
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:16,780
off any just bugs or diseases or mildew

1654
01:23:14,079 --> 01:23:18,609
or anything like that just really start

1655
01:23:16,779 --> 01:23:21,759
from the beginning and make sure the

1656
01:23:18,609 --> 01:23:25,869
plants healthy all the way through it's

1657
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:28,840
hard and in the warehouse but uh staying

1658
01:23:25,869 --> 01:23:32,529
on top of it but uh it's just it's just

1659
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:40,600
a lot of hours and and in hard work and

1660
01:23:32,529 --> 01:23:45,159
a good team for sure yeah so do you see

1661
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:47,530
yourself ever trying to turn chem dog

1662
01:23:45,159 --> 01:23:50,199
into like a full-on thing for yourself

1663
01:23:47,529 --> 01:23:51,729
like I just remember briefly trying to

1664
01:23:50,199 --> 01:23:53,319
skunk and he just mentioned that you

1665
01:23:51,729 --> 01:23:55,229
know like he would love to be able to

1666
01:23:53,319 --> 01:23:56,909
open like you know like the chem dog

1667
01:23:55,229 --> 01:23:59,159
mekka so to speak is that something you

1668
01:23:56,909 --> 01:24:02,609
would envision wanting to do or you I

1669
01:23:59,159 --> 01:24:06,260
would love to be a part of it for sure

1670
01:24:02,609 --> 01:24:06,259
and help in any way I can

1671
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:13,650
right now I'm just kind of focused you

1672
01:24:08,819 --> 01:24:16,619
know and you know my job in working at

1673
01:24:13,649 --> 01:24:20,479
Incredibles and and stuff like that but

1674
01:24:16,619 --> 01:24:23,640
uh I would love to be involved and help

1675
01:24:20,479 --> 01:24:27,929
any of those guys out with whatever I

1676
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:30,720
could whatever I could do as far as I

1677
01:24:27,930 --> 01:24:32,190
know you were or people seem to tell me

1678
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:34,920
that you you were the first person to

1679
01:24:32,189 --> 01:24:38,129
kind of get the Skelly back into you

1680
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:39,810
know the the familiar crews hands what

1681
01:24:38,130 --> 01:24:45,300
was that process of tracking it down

1682
01:24:39,810 --> 01:24:47,070
like well my good friend Rob was in

1683
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:50,460
Crested Butte he's the one that won the

1684
01:24:47,069 --> 01:24:52,500
he won the Adam Dunn Cup came in second

1685
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:54,750
place with the hash plant two years ago

1686
01:24:52,500 --> 01:25:00,738
and then won it this year with the chem

1687
01:24:54,750 --> 01:25:03,510
four he's been holding on to it since 87

1688
01:25:00,738 --> 01:25:08,789
he's lived in the same place in Crested

1689
01:25:03,510 --> 01:25:10,829
Butte so he's stable but he has kept it

1690
01:25:08,789 --> 01:25:14,640
you know for all these years him and a

1691
01:25:10,829 --> 01:25:18,659
couple other people because to be that

1692
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:23,130
been keeping it alive for since 1987 so

1693
01:25:18,659 --> 01:25:26,220
you know all the credit goes to rob and

1694
01:25:23,130 --> 01:25:29,279
those guys down the crusty Butte yeah

1695
01:25:26,220 --> 01:25:33,270
and have you ever made an attempt to try

1696
01:25:29,279 --> 01:25:34,920
to track down the growers of the

1697
01:25:33,270 --> 01:25:38,250
original dog butter would you think of

1698
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:40,409
it just it just be too hard to do it'd

1699
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:42,479
be hard like the guy that I think

1700
01:25:40,409 --> 01:25:45,479
they're all probably a lot or you know a

1701
01:25:42,479 --> 01:25:49,099
lot older and you know not on the

1702
01:25:45,479 --> 01:25:51,539
internet and to find them would be hard

1703
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:53,370
the guy that brought it into Crested

1704
01:25:51,539 --> 01:25:56,550
Butte still lives in Crested Butte and

1705
01:25:53,369 --> 01:26:00,869
he's the one that told my friend that it

1706
01:25:56,550 --> 01:26:02,820
came from the kamas Valley in Oregon not

1707
01:26:00,869 --> 01:26:05,819
sure if he's in touch I don't think he's

1708
01:26:02,819 --> 01:26:08,789
in touch with the people that you know

1709
01:26:05,819 --> 01:26:13,359
he got it from so

1710
01:26:08,789 --> 01:26:15,970
it's it's been 25 years of trying to

1711
01:26:13,359 --> 01:26:18,969
find that that strand again and it's

1712
01:26:15,970 --> 01:26:24,460
yeah I haven't I haven't found that or

1713
01:26:18,970 --> 01:26:29,230
where came from her or what so maybe in

1714
01:26:24,460 --> 01:26:34,119
the future yeah maybe they're still

1715
01:26:29,229 --> 01:26:42,009
growing it the dog bug in Oregon so who

1716
01:26:34,119 --> 01:26:44,380
knows how his name changed yeah so how

1717
01:26:42,010 --> 01:26:48,070
do you feel about how the public has

1718
01:26:44,380 --> 01:26:50,199
received the kam dog I mean it's I think

1719
01:26:48,069 --> 01:26:52,239
I saw an interview with g-unit way he

1720
01:26:50,199 --> 01:26:54,970
said that he feels over the past few

1721
01:26:52,239 --> 01:26:56,590
years the public is really like warmed

1722
01:26:54,970 --> 01:26:58,510
to it where in the past people used to

1723
01:26:56,590 --> 01:27:00,430
really ride it off but I think just

1724
01:26:58,510 --> 01:27:01,690
maybe due to exposure more people have

1725
01:27:00,430 --> 01:27:04,300
had the real thing and I like really

1726
01:27:01,689 --> 01:27:07,269
impressed by it I think yeah if you

1727
01:27:04,300 --> 01:27:10,270
smoked the real thing I think you know I

1728
01:27:07,270 --> 01:27:12,580
think more people have smoked the real

1729
01:27:10,270 --> 01:27:15,400
thing and once you smoke the real thing

1730
01:27:12,579 --> 01:27:18,699
it's you know met you you won't forget

1731
01:27:15,399 --> 01:27:21,429
it I mean I've had so many people tell

1732
01:27:18,699 --> 01:27:24,550
me in the last couple years that it's

1733
01:27:21,430 --> 01:27:28,030
their favorite string it's it's the best

1734
01:27:24,550 --> 01:27:32,980
one that they've ever smoked and never

1735
01:27:28,029 --> 01:27:34,119
will smoke yeah and so you know at

1736
01:27:32,979 --> 01:27:36,849
certain parts throughout the history

1737
01:27:34,119 --> 01:27:38,109
because obviously a lot of people you

1738
01:27:36,850 --> 01:27:40,030
know basically everyone excluding you

1739
01:27:38,109 --> 01:27:40,779
and the people directly involved there

1740
01:27:40,029 --> 01:27:42,550
they're getting a lot of their

1741
01:27:40,779 --> 01:27:46,779
information from online so there are

1742
01:27:42,550 --> 01:27:49,300
periods where for example I think it was

1743
01:27:46,779 --> 01:27:53,259
around that High Times article that they

1744
01:27:49,300 --> 01:27:54,970
did with G where certain cuts we just

1745
01:27:53,260 --> 01:27:56,829
thought not to be around like I think G

1746
01:27:54,970 --> 01:27:57,579
thought he had lost the 91 and it was

1747
01:27:56,829 --> 01:28:00,789
just gone

1748
01:27:57,579 --> 01:28:02,619
we whoever in that boat where there were

1749
01:28:00,789 --> 01:28:04,420
times when you thought I well there goes

1750
01:28:02,619 --> 01:28:05,859
the Kim D forever and then like it turns

1751
01:28:04,420 --> 01:28:07,630
out you get it back from a friend of a

1752
01:28:05,859 --> 01:28:09,549
friend or something or was it always

1753
01:28:07,630 --> 01:28:10,980
pretty well controlled and you never

1754
01:28:09,550 --> 01:28:14,770
really thought things were gone forever

1755
01:28:10,979 --> 01:28:19,179
since we got them it's pretty much it's

1756
01:28:14,770 --> 01:28:20,980
pretty controlled it's never been last I

1757
01:28:19,180 --> 01:28:26,880
think that happened you know

1758
01:28:20,979 --> 01:28:29,829
earlier back in the 90s and early 2000s

1759
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:33,699
but since weeds and my friends have had

1760
01:28:29,829 --> 01:28:37,000
it there's pretty much you know if you

1761
01:28:33,699 --> 01:28:42,010
lose it I know someone else you know

1762
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:46,840
reliable has it so like we got the chem

1763
01:28:42,010 --> 01:28:49,600
D back I got Mike MD back a couple years

1764
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:51,579
ago and this guy's had it since we gave

1765
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:53,950
it to him and you know I was six when we

1766
01:28:51,579 --> 01:28:57,640
first got it and then got it back from

1767
01:28:53,949 --> 01:29:00,849
him a few years ago so he's he's kept it

1768
01:28:57,640 --> 01:29:03,970
and he still has it and will have it for

1769
01:29:00,850 --> 01:29:06,300
forever and then people don't want to

1770
01:29:03,970 --> 01:29:11,350
lose it so they they put in a lot of

1771
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:14,409
effort in trying to preserve it yeah and

1772
01:29:11,350 --> 01:29:17,200
I mean Tommy mentioned that you can

1773
01:29:14,409 --> 01:29:20,619
revitalize clones by vegging a man in

1774
01:29:17,199 --> 01:29:21,970
the Sun for a season and letting him get

1775
01:29:20,619 --> 01:29:24,760
really big and then taking some nice

1776
01:29:21,970 --> 01:29:27,940
clones off them and rings inside have

1777
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:29,619
you ever seen that done with any of the

1778
01:29:27,939 --> 01:29:32,769
chem dogs and if so did they come out

1779
01:29:29,619 --> 01:29:34,960
any better than beforehand never seen

1780
01:29:32,770 --> 01:29:39,239
that done with the chem dogs it's always

1781
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:42,340
kind of been an indoor venture the last

1782
01:29:39,238 --> 01:29:45,699
since we'd since you know since I've

1783
01:29:42,340 --> 01:29:47,619
since I've Adam exhale still so it's

1784
01:29:45,699 --> 01:29:52,899
always been yeah just keeping them alive

1785
01:29:47,619 --> 01:29:57,340
indoors yeah and so if you could only

1786
01:29:52,899 --> 01:30:01,929
pick say two of all the chem dogs which

1787
01:29:57,340 --> 01:30:05,079
would you want to keep 291 in the D is

1788
01:30:01,930 --> 01:30:08,489
it an easy choice yeah that's that's

1789
01:30:05,079 --> 01:30:13,319
easy you give me two choices that's easy

1790
01:30:08,488 --> 01:30:17,279
and so I get you know what's three then

1791
01:30:13,319 --> 01:30:19,899
what comes in third from maybe four

1792
01:30:17,279 --> 01:30:22,929
would be the for a lot of people who

1793
01:30:19,899 --> 01:30:26,319
would wouldn't say that but I I like

1794
01:30:22,930 --> 01:30:31,750
before I like the high of it I think

1795
01:30:26,319 --> 01:30:33,849
it's very medicinal instant high taste

1796
01:30:31,750 --> 01:30:38,199
isn't the best but yeah bros before

1797
01:30:33,850 --> 01:30:42,400
would be third yeah okay and then I

1798
01:30:38,199 --> 01:30:46,599
guess the the number one is the D number

1799
01:30:42,399 --> 01:30:49,719
one is D 91 close second if you're

1800
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:53,770
taking everything like smell taste hi

1801
01:30:49,719 --> 01:30:57,460
everything is D is d is number one in my

1802
01:30:53,770 --> 01:30:59,110
book and that names like you know the

1803
01:30:57,460 --> 01:31:00,819
only thing you if you had to pick one

1804
01:30:59,109 --> 01:31:03,488
strain you could only have that would be

1805
01:31:00,819 --> 01:31:06,069
it oh that's just the favorite that's my

1806
01:31:03,488 --> 01:31:08,109
island strain yeah that's my desert only

1807
01:31:06,069 --> 01:31:10,090
strange Kim D I might have thought you

1808
01:31:08,109 --> 01:31:13,569
might have said ah it's my favorite but

1809
01:31:10,090 --> 01:31:16,260
it veggies too slow that's a good

1810
01:31:13,569 --> 01:31:21,340
producer and the only thing is that that

1811
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:24,539
that banana issue but we've got it

1812
01:31:21,340 --> 01:31:28,869
pretty much under control okay so I mean

1813
01:31:24,539 --> 01:31:32,170
Tommy's got another he's got another D

1814
01:31:28,869 --> 01:31:36,130
cut that I got some flowers from the

1815
01:31:32,170 --> 01:31:39,000
other day I was up there and so I'm

1816
01:31:36,130 --> 01:31:43,510
gonna I'm gonna grill that one out and

1817
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:47,680
maybe replace Tommy's with Tommy got

1818
01:31:43,510 --> 01:31:51,610
this one from from G Pat way way back

1819
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:53,110
when so yeah and it's it's phenomenal I

1820
01:31:51,609 --> 01:31:55,479
don't know if you got to see any of that

1821
01:31:53,109 --> 01:31:59,229
but it's it's it's phenomenal and it

1822
01:31:55,479 --> 01:32:03,279
doesn't it doesn't throw out bananas and

1823
01:31:59,229 --> 01:32:06,459
it's never variegated on them so well it

1824
01:32:03,279 --> 01:32:09,130
may replace replace that I think that

1825
01:32:06,460 --> 01:32:11,890
was the one I tried and then I tried the

1826
01:32:09,130 --> 01:32:15,840
real one later on but I think I kind of

1827
01:32:11,890 --> 01:32:20,500
like Tommy's one yeah Tommy's is good

1828
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:21,880
it's it's the real it's the real thing G

1829
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:24,699
was telling that he thinks it's the

1830
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:27,850
sister but there's no way that's it's

1831
01:32:24,699 --> 01:32:31,319
Kim D it's it is that was a long time

1832
01:32:27,850 --> 01:32:35,910
ago and he gave him that cut so

1833
01:32:31,319 --> 01:32:35,909
mistakes happen yeah

1834
01:32:36,198 --> 01:32:41,278
so if you could only change one thing

1835
01:32:38,998 --> 01:32:42,599
outside of the banana issue because I

1836
01:32:41,279 --> 01:32:44,609
think that's probably the obvious choice

1837
01:32:42,599 --> 01:32:46,949
if you change one thing about the D and

1838
01:32:44,609 --> 01:32:48,659
the 91 you know it could be different

1839
01:32:46,948 --> 01:32:53,848
things about the cuts what would you

1840
01:32:48,658 --> 01:32:56,128
change about them nothing not even like

1841
01:32:53,849 --> 01:32:58,319
bigger yield I mean bigger yield since

1842
01:32:56,128 --> 01:33:03,328
the 91 if you get a bigger yield it

1843
01:32:58,319 --> 01:33:05,819
would be nice but uh I did I juris I've

1844
01:33:03,328 --> 01:33:09,238
always thought bigger it doesn't

1845
01:33:05,819 --> 01:33:11,879
necessarily mean better you know my

1846
01:33:09,238 --> 01:33:14,698
parents live in Maine and you know that

1847
01:33:11,878 --> 01:33:16,588
big fat six seven pound laughs just

1848
01:33:14,698 --> 01:33:20,578
don't taste nearly as good as a to two

1849
01:33:16,588 --> 01:33:24,509
and a half pound lobsters so and I don't

1850
01:33:20,578 --> 01:33:26,639
like I'm more of a the shoulder so I'm

1851
01:33:24,509 --> 01:33:29,969
the plants I like the buds like it's

1852
01:33:26,639 --> 01:33:33,059
shoulders instead of the tops yeah

1853
01:33:29,969 --> 01:33:35,819
so the 91 not being that big it really

1854
01:33:33,059 --> 01:33:37,559
doesn't doesn't bother me but if I had

1855
01:33:35,819 --> 01:33:40,559
to pick you that would be at the bigger

1856
01:33:37,559 --> 01:33:44,338
bigger yield is always good yep

1857
01:33:40,559 --> 01:33:46,319
and so what's the most annoying thing

1858
01:33:44,338 --> 01:33:49,349
about trying to talk to people about the

1859
01:33:46,319 --> 01:33:51,329
kam dog because I obviously the history

1860
01:33:49,349 --> 01:33:53,159
is maybe the the obvious one but like

1861
01:33:51,328 --> 01:33:54,898
sometimes I find it's even just like

1862
01:33:53,158 --> 01:33:57,238
people get really lost up in all the

1863
01:33:54,899 --> 01:33:59,009
names because you know there's there's

1864
01:33:57,238 --> 01:34:01,618
all the different cuts and it will just

1865
01:33:59,009 --> 01:34:03,899
lose track of things really quickly well

1866
01:34:01,618 --> 01:34:09,509
I probably biggest one is I've been I'm

1867
01:34:03,899 --> 01:34:13,229
gonna spell guy it's just the DEA WG its

1868
01:34:09,509 --> 01:34:18,118
chem da its dog it's it's a combination

1869
01:34:13,229 --> 01:34:21,119
of dog bud which is what we got in

1870
01:34:18,118 --> 01:34:24,179
Crested Butte we started calling it chem

1871
01:34:21,118 --> 01:34:26,338
weed so I think when we saw mass G and

1872
01:34:24,179 --> 01:34:30,088
Indian Indianapolis we were calling a

1873
01:34:26,338 --> 01:34:31,889
chem we'd probably probably Tony was dog

1874
01:34:30,088 --> 01:34:35,429
done and chem weed and he just combined

1875
01:34:31,889 --> 01:34:40,139
the names cam and dog and there you have

1876
01:34:35,429 --> 01:34:45,989
it so it's it's do do G it's not D AWG

1877
01:34:40,139 --> 01:34:48,760
it's never been da w g JJ uses star dog

1878
01:34:45,988 --> 01:34:51,329
just out of respect for G and

1879
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:56,619
and that's the you know that's that but

1880
01:34:51,329 --> 01:35:00,699
it's always been do G yeah and so I mean

1881
01:34:56,619 --> 01:35:04,238
do you think in a way you know that by

1882
01:35:00,699 --> 01:35:07,750
JJ using that naming nomenclature that

1883
01:35:04,238 --> 01:35:11,559
he's almost you know inadvertently made

1884
01:35:07,750 --> 01:35:15,359
it a little made a little more confusing

1885
01:35:11,560 --> 01:35:20,260
but I think the biggest culprit was

1886
01:35:15,359 --> 01:35:26,139
another company changed it before JJ

1887
01:35:20,260 --> 01:35:30,100
teams actually cam dog do G to D aw gee

1888
01:35:26,140 --> 01:35:34,860
I forget what company it was but they

1889
01:35:30,100 --> 01:35:38,560
they kind of started it all yeah yeah

1890
01:35:34,859 --> 01:35:42,009
dog I mean that version of dog really

1891
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:44,710
didn't come out to like the later 90s I

1892
01:35:42,010 --> 01:35:51,039
know there was David Griezmann has dog

1893
01:35:44,710 --> 01:35:52,899
music D AWG but that's not what they're

1894
01:35:51,039 --> 01:35:56,729
referring to they're referring to like

1895
01:35:52,899 --> 01:36:01,539
dog like the urban way of saying dog

1896
01:35:56,729 --> 01:36:02,019
yeah no chance he's just smoking Kim dog

1897
01:36:01,539 --> 01:36:07,420
right now

1898
01:36:02,020 --> 01:36:10,989
yeah I've read online that aj has

1899
01:36:07,420 --> 01:36:13,289
actually taken credit for at least he

1900
01:36:10,988 --> 01:36:17,019
said that at one point in time he was

1901
01:36:13,289 --> 01:36:20,470
selling or giving kem dog to people in

1902
01:36:17,020 --> 01:36:21,700
new york that calling it diesel but at

1903
01:36:20,470 --> 01:36:23,199
the same time so many people say that

1904
01:36:21,699 --> 01:36:25,059
diesel and chem dog and not the same

1905
01:36:23,199 --> 01:36:27,010
thing how do you feel about that because

1906
01:36:25,060 --> 01:36:28,210
some of the older guys say like oh i

1907
01:36:27,010 --> 01:36:31,119
know like there is no such thing as

1908
01:36:28,210 --> 01:36:33,899
diesel it's actually just chem dog no I

1909
01:36:31,119 --> 01:36:36,819
think they just they changed they didn't

1910
01:36:33,899 --> 01:36:40,269
age it in like this goes in like the

1911
01:36:36,819 --> 01:36:42,488
name chem associated with it

1912
01:36:40,270 --> 01:36:46,960
a chemical didn't like that name they

1913
01:36:42,488 --> 01:36:50,019
thought it brought it down so they

1914
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:52,750
changed it to diesel I don't know if it

1915
01:36:50,020 --> 01:36:56,860
was the smell or the word diesel meant

1916
01:36:52,750 --> 01:37:00,310
something in New York but yeah it's the

1917
01:36:56,859 --> 01:37:06,589
same thing chem 91 is the diesel

1918
01:37:00,310 --> 01:37:12,110
because when I got a bag of the diesel

1919
01:37:06,590 --> 01:37:20,000
it was chem 91 and then the Sour Diesel

1920
01:37:12,109 --> 01:37:23,089
was more of a that was an s-1 of a chem

1921
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:26,420
91 or something or I'm not really sure

1922
01:37:23,090 --> 01:37:29,800
on that story the whole Sour Diesel

1923
01:37:26,420 --> 01:37:35,179
story it's kind of been changed a bunch

1924
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:37,730
those guys yeah have the whole story

1925
01:37:35,179 --> 01:37:41,810
I think they I'm not really sure they

1926
01:37:37,729 --> 01:37:46,609
know what exactly happened but it's

1927
01:37:41,810 --> 01:37:50,480
definitely from the 91 I mean it's it's

1928
01:37:46,609 --> 01:37:55,279
it is I mean the smell is similar

1929
01:37:50,479 --> 01:37:58,189
Saturday's a little stronger but yeah

1930
01:37:55,279 --> 01:38:01,399
I'm not really sure on that yep

1931
01:37:58,189 --> 01:38:04,460
yeah so I mean I'm gonna spring an idea

1932
01:38:01,399 --> 01:38:06,759
on you know here a lot of people give a

1933
01:38:04,460 --> 01:38:09,130
lot of credit to Oregon and California

1934
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:11,210
for helping to kind of you know

1935
01:38:09,130 --> 01:38:13,699
establish the color of the marijuana

1936
01:38:11,210 --> 01:38:15,260
stay in America but the more I kind of

1937
01:38:13,698 --> 01:38:17,238
delve into the history of things the

1938
01:38:15,260 --> 01:38:19,460
more I think New York is like this

1939
01:38:17,238 --> 01:38:21,198
unsung hero of the scene because it's

1940
01:38:19,460 --> 01:38:23,000
like seems like when you trace back a

1941
01:38:21,198 --> 01:38:24,948
lot of the best breeders in my opinion

1942
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:26,899
not not just the chem dog ones like

1943
01:38:24,948 --> 01:38:29,719
obviously all the chem dog ones but they

1944
01:38:26,899 --> 01:38:31,969
trace their roots to New York and it

1945
01:38:29,719 --> 01:38:34,039
seems like that environment they had

1946
01:38:31,969 --> 01:38:35,719
where people willing to pay for really

1947
01:38:34,039 --> 01:38:37,460
expensive weed like bread this

1948
01:38:35,719 --> 01:38:40,158
environment where it was like productive

1949
01:38:37,460 --> 01:38:41,689
to be a breeder and also Steven just a

1950
01:38:40,158 --> 01:38:42,859
really good grower you know have you

1951
01:38:41,689 --> 01:38:46,069
ever thought about that at all and do

1952
01:38:42,859 --> 01:38:49,698
you agree I totally agree I think just

1953
01:38:46,069 --> 01:38:51,738
the combination of just people in New

1954
01:38:49,698 --> 01:38:56,178
York or just go-getters you know they

1955
01:38:51,738 --> 01:39:00,769
just get things done the market for the

1956
01:38:56,179 --> 01:39:06,140
weed was I mean just the you know 6,000

1957
01:39:00,770 --> 01:39:08,929
a pound 7,000 a pound so you know it was

1958
01:39:06,140 --> 01:39:10,789
worth it for those guys to do what they

1959
01:39:08,929 --> 01:39:15,300
did and

1960
01:39:10,789 --> 01:39:17,189
to be able to make that money and yeah I

1961
01:39:15,300 --> 01:39:19,380
think it's a combination of those those

1962
01:39:17,189 --> 01:39:23,399
things but yeah I think New York was a

1963
01:39:19,380 --> 01:39:26,220
good an outdoor two up in the UH the

1964
01:39:23,399 --> 01:39:31,049
Finger Lakes region and if it could

1965
01:39:26,220 --> 01:39:35,489
college and a lot of Cornell and a lot

1966
01:39:31,050 --> 01:39:36,619
of uh a lot of outdoor weed up there for

1967
01:39:35,488 --> 01:39:39,929
sure

1968
01:39:36,619 --> 01:39:41,939
did you ever get to try any of the stuff

1969
01:39:39,930 --> 01:39:43,909
that Duke talks about coming out of

1970
01:39:41,939 --> 01:39:48,210
Virginia or that never really got to you

1971
01:39:43,909 --> 01:39:51,238
never really got to us Lee I smoked a

1972
01:39:48,210 --> 01:39:54,659
lot of living out growing up outside New

1973
01:39:51,238 --> 01:39:59,159
York City you smoked a lot of like plant

1974
01:39:54,659 --> 01:40:04,319
like you know pot from Laos and Afghan

1975
01:39:59,159 --> 01:40:08,099
Afghani just really exotic exotic we

1976
01:40:04,319 --> 01:40:12,840
that will come into New York so I was

1977
01:40:08,100 --> 01:40:15,720
pretty spoiled as a as a teenager yeah

1978
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:18,000
and were you smoking weed the full the

1979
01:40:15,720 --> 01:40:21,270
introductions of indicas to the scene oh

1980
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:24,238
we you they had always been around there

1981
01:40:21,270 --> 01:40:27,420
kind of I created the kind of look great

1982
01:40:24,238 --> 01:40:31,079
at the beginning when I was smoking uh

1983
01:40:27,420 --> 01:40:34,279
you know just smoking a lot of Mexican

1984
01:40:31,079 --> 01:40:38,970
and Mexican weed and stuff like that and

1985
01:40:34,279 --> 01:40:41,639
but yeah a lot of it started kind of

1986
01:40:38,970 --> 01:40:44,610
when I started smoking and those things

1987
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:46,590
started coming on the scene yeah okay

1988
01:40:44,609 --> 01:40:49,529
it's interesting because I've kind of

1989
01:40:46,590 --> 01:40:51,989
found anecdotally the people who were

1990
01:40:49,529 --> 01:40:54,359
around especially growers before the

1991
01:40:51,988 --> 01:40:57,569
advent of like commercial indica seeds

1992
01:40:54,359 --> 01:40:58,889
like Afghan ease they you never find one

1993
01:40:57,569 --> 01:41:00,238
of them who says in because of their

1994
01:40:58,890 --> 01:41:02,640
favorites you know because like they

1995
01:41:00,238 --> 01:41:04,469
obviously grew up on sativa so I know

1996
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:10,860
sting if you fell into that category but

1997
01:41:04,470 --> 01:41:12,780
the chem dog had run you over with that

1998
01:41:10,859 --> 01:41:14,819
in mind throughout you know your whole

1999
01:41:12,779 --> 01:41:17,399
history of smoking weed what's been the

2000
01:41:14,819 --> 01:41:18,599
most enjoyable terpene or flavor profile

2001
01:41:17,399 --> 01:41:21,000
for you I know you said you don't really

2002
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:22,430
care too much for flavor but for a lot

2003
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,579
of people there's you know these really

2004
01:41:22,430 --> 01:41:25,409
kind of

2005
01:41:23,579 --> 01:41:26,789
exotic terpene profiles from another

2006
01:41:25,409 --> 01:41:30,750
younger because you know things were

2007
01:41:26,789 --> 01:41:36,269
more land Gracie what is it for you I'm

2008
01:41:30,750 --> 01:41:39,439
really into these the sfv and the TK the

2009
01:41:36,270 --> 01:41:43,080
oh geez for taste you know I really love

2010
01:41:39,439 --> 01:41:47,099
love that taste like the Kem's get you

2011
01:41:43,079 --> 01:41:51,359
still get you a little higher but yeah I

2012
01:41:47,100 --> 01:41:57,840
love these these og tastes their ID I

2013
01:41:51,359 --> 01:42:01,049
believe the hype for sure and so how do

2014
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:03,930
you think that the laws affected the

2015
01:42:01,050 --> 01:42:05,880
scene as it progressed on because I mean

2016
01:42:03,930 --> 01:42:08,340
the immediate assumption one might make

2017
01:42:05,880 --> 01:42:09,779
is like if the laws were more loose you

2018
01:42:08,340 --> 01:42:11,460
know maybe cam dog would have flourished

2019
01:42:09,779 --> 01:42:13,109
even more do you think that was

2020
01:42:11,460 --> 01:42:15,600
necessarily the case because at the same

2021
01:42:13,109 --> 01:42:17,729
time it was still very you know as you

2022
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:21,539
said somewhat close God you know is it

2023
01:42:17,729 --> 01:42:28,289
in the right circle type thing yeah I

2024
01:42:21,539 --> 01:42:30,239
think back then was definitely you know

2025
01:42:28,289 --> 01:42:34,769
there wasn't as much trading going on

2026
01:42:30,239 --> 01:42:36,210
and there definitely held closer the

2027
01:42:34,770 --> 01:42:38,670
reason I ask that is just because I I

2028
01:42:36,210 --> 01:42:40,529
kind of think that it was the perfect

2029
01:42:38,670 --> 01:42:42,630
breeding ground with the illegal

2030
01:42:40,529 --> 01:42:44,340
environment in a sense because it

2031
01:42:42,630 --> 01:42:45,930
allowed there to be you know if you look

2032
01:42:44,340 --> 01:42:47,159
at the New York crew for example you

2033
01:42:45,930 --> 01:42:48,960
know like those guys who were selling

2034
01:42:47,159 --> 01:42:52,619
the chem dog for crazy prices in the

2035
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:54,630
park you know like if it was legal or

2036
01:42:52,619 --> 01:42:56,180
more lacks you know like those prices

2037
01:42:54,630 --> 01:42:58,020
wouldn't have been there and then maybe

2038
01:42:56,180 --> 01:42:59,909
maybe they wouldn't have been as much

2039
01:42:58,020 --> 01:43:01,470
incentive to keep the chem dog around

2040
01:42:59,909 --> 01:43:02,970
because that's part of what I think has

2041
01:43:01,470 --> 01:43:05,730
helped keep it around was because it is

2042
01:43:02,970 --> 01:43:10,280
obviously so valuable in so many regards

2043
01:43:05,729 --> 01:43:14,969
it just ensured its survival exactly I

2044
01:43:10,279 --> 01:43:19,739
think just the laws and people it being

2045
01:43:14,970 --> 01:43:22,289
worth so much money and people were you

2046
01:43:19,739 --> 01:43:24,750
know held it closer and protected it

2047
01:43:22,289 --> 01:43:29,399
more I would I would think that would

2048
01:43:24,750 --> 01:43:31,199
say yeah and so you mentioned earlier

2049
01:43:29,399 --> 01:43:33,479
that you generally just grew from

2050
01:43:31,199 --> 01:43:35,699
Klein's over the years but with that in

2051
01:43:33,479 --> 01:43:36,569
mind whether ever any breeders who you

2052
01:43:35,699 --> 01:43:38,939
kind of

2053
01:43:36,569 --> 01:43:44,340
their work was pretty good and bonus

2054
01:43:38,939 --> 01:43:48,619
points if it's besides JJ yeah yeah guys

2055
01:43:44,340 --> 01:43:51,930
from God what is their company called or

2056
01:43:48,619 --> 01:43:55,050
southfork seeds about in California are

2057
01:43:51,930 --> 01:43:56,850
really good they got all the real you

2058
01:43:55,050 --> 01:44:01,050
know chem genetics if you have the real

2059
01:43:56,850 --> 01:44:05,120
chem genetics and you're a good breeder

2060
01:44:01,050 --> 01:44:09,150
then you know your shit's gonna be good

2061
01:44:05,119 --> 01:44:12,029
there's on Instagram mr. Bob Hempfield

2062
01:44:09,149 --> 01:44:14,759
his you know starting to breed now and

2063
01:44:12,029 --> 01:44:19,259
he he's gonna be coming out with lots of

2064
01:44:14,760 --> 01:44:23,100
good crosses cam and puck crosses JJ of

2065
01:44:19,260 --> 01:44:24,720
course and then scum PA I would

2066
01:44:23,100 --> 01:44:27,150
definitely check his stuff out with it

2067
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:29,310
when his comes out you just got to be

2068
01:44:27,149 --> 01:44:34,379
careful you want to find someone that

2069
01:44:29,310 --> 01:44:36,120
has the real the real deal and not just

2070
01:44:34,380 --> 01:44:39,029
claiming they have it and breeding with

2071
01:44:36,119 --> 01:44:40,590
it and just putting out whatever yeah

2072
01:44:39,029 --> 01:44:44,039
without a dad there's too much of that

2073
01:44:40,590 --> 01:44:46,860
at the moment yep and so at what point

2074
01:44:44,039 --> 01:44:49,050
did you really notice that the cam dog

2075
01:44:46,859 --> 01:44:50,549
was taking off in the mainstream and

2076
01:44:49,050 --> 01:44:52,170
even an extension of that is but you

2077
01:44:50,550 --> 01:44:53,850
know at what point were you kind of

2078
01:44:52,170 --> 01:44:58,230
starting to get recognized as the figure

2079
01:44:53,850 --> 01:45:01,829
from the story that you are probably an

2080
01:44:58,229 --> 01:45:04,429
Icee mag kind of from then people have

2081
01:45:01,829 --> 01:45:07,649
just been reading about it for the last

2082
01:45:04,430 --> 01:45:12,860
whatever ten years or so and it's just

2083
01:45:07,649 --> 01:45:15,839
kind of taken taken on a life of its own

2084
01:45:12,859 --> 01:45:19,079
but probably after that that I see mag

2085
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:21,930
had started to really I really only got

2086
01:45:19,079 --> 01:45:24,869
back in the Facebook and Instagram and

2087
01:45:21,930 --> 01:45:28,170
all this media stuff a few a few years

2088
01:45:24,869 --> 01:45:31,340
ago so probably when I went on the Adam

2089
01:45:28,170 --> 01:45:35,180
Dunn show is probably when it really

2090
01:45:31,340 --> 01:45:40,319
kind of really blew up okay fantastic

2091
01:45:35,180 --> 01:45:44,130
Thank You Adam I mean you kind of Polly

2092
01:45:40,319 --> 01:45:46,859
answer this question of it is there have

2093
01:45:44,130 --> 01:45:48,510
you met many other people who did you

2094
01:45:46,859 --> 01:45:49,889
know have claimed they got to experience

2095
01:45:48,510 --> 01:45:51,630
the dog garden and you know

2096
01:45:49,890 --> 01:45:53,430
they describing it correctly to you and

2097
01:45:51,630 --> 01:45:56,369
it works out the timeframes about right

2098
01:45:53,430 --> 01:45:58,920
or not reveal not the dog but I've never

2099
01:45:56,369 --> 01:46:02,250
I've had a few people over the years

2100
01:45:58,920 --> 01:46:05,130
told me that they have it and this that

2101
01:46:02,250 --> 01:46:07,680
I've even had someone send it to me send

2102
01:46:05,130 --> 01:46:12,659
a sample and it I mean it was not it so

2103
01:46:07,680 --> 01:46:16,980
I've never known anyone besides myself

2104
01:46:12,659 --> 01:46:18,510
Joe and mass G that have smoked the dog

2105
01:46:16,979 --> 01:46:22,289
blood I mean I know there's people out

2106
01:46:18,510 --> 01:46:25,590
there but I have never heard of anyone

2107
01:46:22,289 --> 01:46:30,689
getting it back then or I mean it was

2108
01:46:25,590 --> 01:46:33,659
just so incredible for 1991 this this

2109
01:46:30,689 --> 01:46:36,119
pot was just so incredible for that time

2110
01:46:33,659 --> 01:46:38,939
we just had never seen anything like it

2111
01:46:36,119 --> 01:46:42,000
and to this day 25 years later I've

2112
01:46:38,939 --> 01:46:45,829
never talked to anyone that smoked the

2113
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:52,140
real dog bird before was it outdoors uh

2114
01:46:45,829 --> 01:46:53,489
indoor awesome yeah so this is just a

2115
01:46:52,140 --> 01:46:54,900
bit of a personal question I was

2116
01:46:53,489 --> 01:46:57,300
thinking to myself while trying to know

2117
01:46:54,899 --> 01:46:59,189
anyone is how functional do you think

2118
01:46:57,300 --> 01:47:00,900
someone can be you know the average

2119
01:46:59,189 --> 01:47:02,909
person in the real world if they are

2120
01:47:00,899 --> 01:47:04,979
smoking these chem dogs all day do you

2121
01:47:02,909 --> 01:47:06,659
have using people who are still you know

2122
01:47:04,979 --> 01:47:10,709
real go-getters or do you just find it

2123
01:47:06,659 --> 01:47:13,800
to still takes its toll on you I think

2124
01:47:10,710 --> 01:47:16,319
it's your personality I think if you're

2125
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:21,150
a go-getter you can you know smoke it

2126
01:47:16,319 --> 01:47:26,759
and you know no problem I mean I smoked

2127
01:47:21,149 --> 01:47:31,229
it all day and um I'm motivated and it's

2128
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:33,650
it helps me so that wouldn't I would

2129
01:47:31,229 --> 01:47:38,849
know what I'd do without it for sure

2130
01:47:33,649 --> 01:47:41,670
yeah and so I always like to ask people

2131
01:47:38,850 --> 01:47:43,289
like what are their reasons for I'm

2132
01:47:41,670 --> 01:47:44,760
hanging on to cuts but you know I

2133
01:47:43,289 --> 01:47:46,079
specifically not giving them out and

2134
01:47:44,760 --> 01:47:47,940
with when you're talking to breathe is

2135
01:47:46,079 --> 01:47:49,769
it's somewhat obvious but one of the

2136
01:47:47,939 --> 01:47:51,809
interesting topics I had brought up was

2137
01:47:49,770 --> 01:47:53,730
that um not necessarily like you're

2138
01:47:51,810 --> 01:47:56,130
looking to keep it out of the hands of

2139
01:47:53,729 --> 01:47:59,279
the masses but the reason I got told was

2140
01:47:56,130 --> 01:48:00,869
that you know people can not look after

2141
01:47:59,279 --> 01:48:02,759
the plant well and you know they take

2142
01:48:00,869 --> 01:48:04,470
all clones and poor clones

2143
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:06,000
and then eventually you know you've

2144
01:48:04,470 --> 01:48:07,230
you've got like for example it's a it's

2145
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:09,840
the chem dog you know it's like it's

2146
01:48:07,229 --> 01:48:11,159
just really degraded and then and then

2147
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:13,529
it's giving everyone a poor

2148
01:48:11,159 --> 01:48:16,260
representation of the chem dog even when

2149
01:48:13,529 --> 01:48:19,590
it's done well just due to the clone do

2150
01:48:16,260 --> 01:48:21,420
you feel like that has some what

2151
01:48:19,590 --> 01:48:23,279
happened to the chem dog because when I

2152
01:48:21,420 --> 01:48:25,590
heard that reasoning the first thing

2153
01:48:23,279 --> 01:48:27,149
that pops in my mind was like that seems

2154
01:48:25,590 --> 01:48:28,590
like that's kind of what it's happened

2155
01:48:27,149 --> 01:48:30,299
with the chem dog in some ways like I

2156
01:48:28,590 --> 01:48:32,369
mean I've just been told from so many

2157
01:48:30,300 --> 01:48:34,140
people that you know the biggest reason

2158
01:48:32,369 --> 01:48:35,550
why clones fade off so to speak is

2159
01:48:34,140 --> 01:48:38,190
because sometimes you know you're not

2160
01:48:35,550 --> 01:48:41,070
taking the healthiest cuttings yep yeah

2161
01:48:38,189 --> 01:48:42,329
that's yeah that's you gotta take

2162
01:48:41,069 --> 01:48:44,460
healthy kind of starts from the

2163
01:48:42,329 --> 01:48:49,260
beginning you gotta take them for a nice

2164
01:48:44,460 --> 01:48:52,590
healthy mother and and it'll just that

2165
01:48:49,260 --> 01:48:54,720
plant will be happy for its as long as

2166
01:48:52,590 --> 01:49:01,369
you take care of it okay happy for its

2167
01:48:54,720 --> 01:49:03,720
life so I think people I think people I

2168
01:49:01,369 --> 01:49:06,000
don't think that's the reason people

2169
01:49:03,720 --> 01:49:07,940
kept them close I think people kept them

2170
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:12,329
close just because it was special and

2171
01:49:07,939 --> 01:49:14,429
you know they wanted to I don't think

2172
01:49:12,329 --> 01:49:15,930
people thought you know that if I give

2173
01:49:14,430 --> 01:49:19,380
it to this person they're gonna degrade

2174
01:49:15,930 --> 01:49:21,090
the plant I think people just found

2175
01:49:19,380 --> 01:49:23,489
something special they wanted to they

2176
01:49:21,090 --> 01:49:26,100
wanted to hold on to it yeah

2177
01:49:23,489 --> 01:49:29,699
or they got conditions someone gave it

2178
01:49:26,100 --> 01:49:34,680
to them and said don't give it out stuff

2179
01:49:29,699 --> 01:49:36,539
like that okay awesome well I think

2180
01:49:34,680 --> 01:49:38,250
we've only got some short answer

2181
01:49:36,539 --> 01:49:42,109
questions left so these are just you

2182
01:49:38,250 --> 01:49:45,239
know more far away but okay what's uh

2183
01:49:42,109 --> 01:49:48,210
what's this is a tooth powder you know

2184
01:49:45,239 --> 01:49:49,619
what's your least favorite strain you

2185
01:49:48,210 --> 01:49:51,569
like the worst strain in your opinion

2186
01:49:49,619 --> 01:49:53,220
and then the second part is you know

2187
01:49:51,569 --> 01:49:54,929
without necessarily giving away the

2188
01:49:53,220 --> 01:49:56,310
breeder what's the worst cross you've

2189
01:49:54,930 --> 01:49:57,780
ever seen the kemon you know because

2190
01:49:56,310 --> 01:49:59,370
obviously some strains just don't work

2191
01:49:57,779 --> 01:50:01,079
when you cross them to others it's just

2192
01:49:59,369 --> 01:50:03,090
you know genetic yeah what's the worst

2193
01:50:01,079 --> 01:50:05,850
one you've seen what is it not agree I

2194
01:50:03,090 --> 01:50:10,909
don't like fruity strains I'm not a big

2195
01:50:05,850 --> 01:50:15,870
fruity guy so you know any of those

2196
01:50:10,909 --> 01:50:18,819
purple grape e ones or tangerine e ones

2197
01:50:15,869 --> 01:50:26,920
you know all those I'm not I'm not into

2198
01:50:18,819 --> 01:50:28,599
those in the chem cross I'm not really

2199
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:31,390
sure most of the chem crosses I've

2200
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:34,240
smoked if it's the real chem it's I like

2201
01:50:31,390 --> 01:50:36,970
it maybe came close to some fruity

2202
01:50:34,239 --> 01:50:39,489
purple thing yeah maybe at first I've

2203
01:50:36,970 --> 01:50:42,640
seen a couple people crossing them to

2204
01:50:39,489 --> 01:50:46,000
some fruity stuff and I haven't tried

2205
01:50:42,640 --> 01:50:51,100
them but maybe the chem will make it

2206
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:54,880
strong at least yeah the one silver

2207
01:50:51,100 --> 01:50:57,070
lining yes what you know you obviously

2208
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:59,050
you've been around the scene for a long

2209
01:50:57,069 --> 01:51:04,949
time what's been the worst thing to

2210
01:50:59,050 --> 01:51:04,949
happen to it in your opinion the scene

2211
01:51:05,189 --> 01:51:11,649
just Oh God

2212
01:51:09,239 --> 01:51:14,199
just some of the people getting in the

2213
01:51:11,649 --> 01:51:21,189
in the business and in it for the wrong

2214
01:51:14,199 --> 01:51:24,519
reasons and just seeing people 20 years

2215
01:51:21,189 --> 01:51:27,159
ago or 15 years ago that would just look

2216
01:51:24,520 --> 01:51:30,220
at me and thought I was just the biggest

2217
01:51:27,159 --> 01:51:32,979
piece of [ __ ] you know low-grade person

2218
01:51:30,220 --> 01:51:37,210
in the world and now they're you know

2219
01:51:32,979 --> 01:51:40,329
now they're all put marijuana and it's

2220
01:51:37,210 --> 01:51:42,310
just kind of weird people that would

2221
01:51:40,329 --> 01:51:45,279
look at me differently 15 years ago I

2222
01:51:42,310 --> 01:51:49,690
look at me differently now so that's

2223
01:51:45,279 --> 01:51:52,389
kind of what bothers me the most I would

2224
01:51:49,689 --> 01:51:55,779
think about this business have you ever

2225
01:51:52,390 --> 01:51:57,730
had someone you know like try to get

2226
01:51:55,779 --> 01:51:59,920
back in contact and kind of like getting

2227
01:51:57,729 --> 01:52:01,389
in with you once they realized who you

2228
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:03,880
are and maybe they had previously

2229
01:52:01,390 --> 01:52:08,590
written you off yeah most people from

2230
01:52:03,880 --> 01:52:10,180
high school you know mostly but they're

2231
01:52:08,590 --> 01:52:12,579
getting back in touch with me because

2232
01:52:10,180 --> 01:52:15,430
they know they have a sick you know

2233
01:52:12,579 --> 01:52:17,590
relative or something and they're

2234
01:52:15,430 --> 01:52:20,110
looking for answers stuff like that and

2235
01:52:17,590 --> 01:52:22,600
yeah you know happy to help them out you

2236
01:52:20,109 --> 01:52:24,670
know they're not they're not looking for

2237
01:52:22,600 --> 01:52:28,060
strains and stuff like that

2238
01:52:24,670 --> 01:52:28,908
I get people asking me for the Kem's all

2239
01:52:28,060 --> 01:52:34,030
the time and they

2240
01:52:28,908 --> 01:52:37,519
I have to just say no all the time so

2241
01:52:34,029 --> 01:52:38,119
yeah that's kind of hard yeah I can

2242
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:41,900
imagine

2243
01:52:38,119 --> 01:52:44,899
and so what do you think is like a big

2244
01:52:41,899 --> 01:52:48,229
mistake people make when they're growing

2245
01:52:44,899 --> 01:52:49,939
the chem dog because for me it's you

2246
01:52:48,229 --> 01:52:52,009
know a lot of people say it's so finicky

2247
01:52:49,939 --> 01:52:54,019
so you know what what's something about

2248
01:52:52,010 --> 01:53:02,360
it that it likes that it or something it

2249
01:52:54,020 --> 01:53:04,760
doesn't like like m91 doesn't like a lot

2250
01:53:02,359 --> 01:53:07,339
of light I usually put him kind of on

2251
01:53:04,760 --> 01:53:12,560
the outskirts of the light they seem to

2252
01:53:07,340 --> 01:53:17,110
do a lot better Wow but if you you know

2253
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:21,889
follow your your you know fertile

2254
01:53:17,109 --> 01:53:25,009
program and tender loving care they play

2255
01:53:21,889 --> 01:53:30,710
like a lot of cal-mag you know Dee likes

2256
01:53:25,010 --> 01:53:33,380
cow bag up until you know week seven so

2257
01:53:30,710 --> 01:53:37,539
just a couple things like that but it's

2258
01:53:33,380 --> 01:53:41,029
it's it's a very hard plant to grow yeah

2259
01:53:37,539 --> 01:53:42,829
so I mean I've thought about the same

2260
01:53:41,029 --> 01:53:44,269
that the Grateful Dead created and it

2261
01:53:42,829 --> 01:53:46,250
seems like you know it was like that

2262
01:53:44,270 --> 01:53:47,960
perfect storm for progressing the scene

2263
01:53:46,250 --> 01:53:50,300
do you think that it trying to create

2264
01:53:47,960 --> 01:53:52,639
something similar to that in a modern

2265
01:53:50,300 --> 01:53:55,070
sense would work out or you think just

2266
01:53:52,639 --> 01:53:57,289
the the climate is too different and

2267
01:53:55,069 --> 01:53:59,599
it's just yeah it's not it wouldn't work

2268
01:53:57,289 --> 01:54:02,539
in the same way yeah I think it's just

2269
01:53:59,600 --> 01:54:07,250
different I think people are just more

2270
01:54:02,539 --> 01:54:09,619
out in the open and trading things just

2271
01:54:07,250 --> 01:54:14,679
you know you can buy cuts on Craigslist

2272
01:54:09,619 --> 01:54:17,630
now so it's just it's a different time

2273
01:54:14,679 --> 01:54:21,170
we live and so yeah I don't think it

2274
01:54:17,630 --> 01:54:25,609
would I think it was just a just that

2275
01:54:21,170 --> 01:54:27,649
time that we were in and well do you

2276
01:54:25,609 --> 01:54:30,009
think they even like so much of the

2277
01:54:27,649 --> 01:54:32,738
masses are now newly jumping into

2278
01:54:30,010 --> 01:54:34,820
cannabis cultivation at least in America

2279
01:54:32,738 --> 01:54:36,649
do you think that that could be harmful

2280
01:54:34,819 --> 01:54:38,359
in any way because it seems like there's

2281
01:54:36,649 --> 01:54:40,039
a lot of growers who don't necessarily

2282
01:54:38,359 --> 01:54:42,408
know how to deal with a lot of problems

2283
01:54:40,039 --> 01:54:42,569
that could have flow-on effects like you

2284
01:54:42,408 --> 01:54:44,819
know

2285
01:54:42,569 --> 01:54:48,359
the climbing one yeah I think yeah the

2286
01:54:44,819 --> 01:54:50,869
cloning ones one and you know as for

2287
01:54:48,359 --> 01:54:57,380
that's for sure

2288
01:54:50,869 --> 01:55:00,119
you know get more people and but yeah I

2289
01:54:57,380 --> 01:55:03,020
definitely problems for sure the more

2290
01:55:00,119 --> 01:55:05,460
people growing and how do you feel about

2291
01:55:03,020 --> 01:55:08,490
what's you know widely regarded as

2292
01:55:05,460 --> 01:55:10,739
somewhat over-the-top rules in you know

2293
01:55:08,489 --> 01:55:12,659
you might not be fully involved in it

2294
01:55:10,739 --> 01:55:13,859
but I'm you know in the Oregon I believe

2295
01:55:12,659 --> 01:55:15,840
it is I've got you know some pretty

2296
01:55:13,859 --> 01:55:20,849
insane testing requirements how do you

2297
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:23,460
feel about those testing is I'm kind of

2298
01:55:20,850 --> 01:55:25,620
up in the up in the air I'm testing

2299
01:55:23,460 --> 01:55:30,840
until they you know have like a

2300
01:55:25,619 --> 01:55:33,630
standardized test I guess like a no

2301
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:35,850
machine that's this is the way it's done

2302
01:55:33,630 --> 01:55:38,940
I think they're kind of different

2303
01:55:35,850 --> 01:55:42,060
machines and so I really don't you know

2304
01:55:38,939 --> 01:55:45,210
the testing don't really believe in the

2305
01:55:42,060 --> 01:55:48,810
testing too much and if you have you

2306
01:55:45,210 --> 01:55:55,050
know twenty seven percent THC crystals

2307
01:55:48,810 --> 01:55:58,110
on your whatever flow bud and you know

2308
01:55:55,050 --> 01:56:00,180
you have in the chem test set twenty

2309
01:55:58,109 --> 01:56:03,750
percent or 18 percent

2310
01:56:00,180 --> 01:56:06,119
I think the chem crystals the makeup of

2311
01:56:03,750 --> 01:56:10,260
those eighteen percent or better than

2312
01:56:06,119 --> 01:56:12,479
the then the you know the twenty seven

2313
01:56:10,260 --> 01:56:14,960
percent on the on the other but I think

2314
01:56:12,479 --> 01:56:18,479
the crystals the makeup of those

2315
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:21,270
crystals are stronger and better so I

2316
01:56:18,479 --> 01:56:25,979
don't you know saw a seventeen could get

2317
01:56:21,270 --> 01:56:28,410
you higher than a twenty seven so yes I

2318
01:56:25,979 --> 01:56:29,939
mean what do you think you know it's

2319
01:56:28,409 --> 01:56:31,979
obviously probably gonna be a guess but

2320
01:56:29,939 --> 01:56:33,929
if you did have to guess what do you

2321
01:56:31,979 --> 01:56:36,299
think that you know the average sample

2322
01:56:33,930 --> 01:56:37,800
of well-grown chem ninety-one does sit

2323
01:56:36,300 --> 01:56:39,720
up because you know like if that is the

2324
01:56:37,800 --> 01:56:41,039
strongest weed then we shouldn't you

2325
01:56:39,720 --> 01:56:43,500
know and it's not testing higher than

2326
01:56:41,039 --> 01:56:46,319
you know who cares about numbers yeah I

2327
01:56:43,500 --> 01:56:51,390
think that 91 and the for those day old

2328
01:56:46,319 --> 01:56:55,529
they test like mid-20s I think so it's

2329
01:56:51,390 --> 01:56:57,170
never you know like 30 percent or

2330
01:56:55,529 --> 01:57:03,109
anything like that

2331
01:56:57,170 --> 01:57:07,369
but yet they're the strongest strongest

2332
01:57:03,109 --> 01:57:10,739
strains that I've ever smoked so yeah

2333
01:57:07,369 --> 01:57:17,279
I'm not a big believer in testing yet

2334
01:57:10,739 --> 01:57:19,859
and so a final question if you could go

2335
01:57:17,279 --> 01:57:22,229
back to any time and get any seeds from

2336
01:57:19,859 --> 01:57:24,299
anywhere whether it be you know seeds

2337
01:57:22,229 --> 01:57:26,579
you could buy from earlier in the day or

2338
01:57:24,300 --> 01:57:29,579
just landrace seeds and you know you're

2339
01:57:26,579 --> 01:57:31,279
allowed to just obtain them what would

2340
01:57:29,579 --> 01:57:34,829
it be

2341
01:57:31,279 --> 01:57:39,809
man I think I'd have to go back to 1991

2342
01:57:34,829 --> 01:57:49,949
and take that out from G and take those

2343
01:57:39,810 --> 01:57:52,050
13 seeds from him no I you know I you

2344
01:57:49,949 --> 01:57:56,010
know those those are those are special

2345
01:57:52,050 --> 01:58:00,060
seeds yeah but like a nice you know a

2346
01:57:56,010 --> 01:58:02,850
nice African laminaria strain seeds from

2347
01:58:00,060 --> 01:58:04,560
Africa would be nice have you been

2348
01:58:02,850 --> 01:58:09,120
wondering about to go back to Amsterdam

2349
01:58:04,560 --> 01:58:13,020
in the 70s or you know early 80s and see

2350
01:58:09,119 --> 01:58:16,859
what they had I get some of that old

2351
01:58:13,020 --> 01:58:19,350
sensi seed stock something like that but

2352
01:58:16,859 --> 01:58:22,559
I think I'd go after those 13 seeds that

2353
01:58:19,350 --> 01:58:27,050
G found I was trying to bite you into

2354
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:29,570
the Skelly seeds you gave it better oh

2355
01:58:27,050 --> 01:58:33,930
yeah have you tried

2356
01:58:29,569 --> 01:58:36,689
JJ's Nigerian yeah yeah that's that's

2357
01:58:33,930 --> 01:58:40,590
one of the better sativa so like kind of

2358
01:58:36,689 --> 01:58:42,149
reminds me of you know but all that weed

2359
01:58:40,590 --> 01:58:45,329
I used to get in high school from

2360
01:58:42,149 --> 01:58:47,809
different countries and stuff but it's

2361
01:58:45,329 --> 01:58:49,979
good the Nigerians great yeah it's great

2362
01:58:47,810 --> 01:58:53,840
yeah I just thought maybe that was where

2363
01:58:49,979 --> 01:58:56,909
the the African comment came from yeah

2364
01:58:53,840 --> 01:58:58,409
awesome so I think that brings us to the

2365
