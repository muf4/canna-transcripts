right at the moment i just loaded up a

30
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,760
bowl of dr who

31
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,159
from geek farms

32
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,159
master cut it's one of my faves to go to

33
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,000
it's very relaxing

34
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,439
you know the doctor who's very high

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,400
immersing so

36
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:24,158
it's i find it really relaxing

37
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,240
you just jump straight to one of my

38
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,479
questions so one of one of the biggest

39
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:30,798
things i wanted to ask you i think a lot

40
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,879
of people including myself gained a lot

41
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,118
of familiarity with your brand through

42
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,798
the exposure that geek mic

43
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,719
gave you guys kind of with that doctor

44
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,040
who cut so the question is

45
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:42,719
how impactful has it been to have

46
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,159
something like that happen to your brand

47
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:47,118
to kind of have a really good grower

48
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,200
find this killer cut and run with it

49
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:52,159
well pretty good um doctor who's

50
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,680
definitely one of our top sellers

51
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,719
yeah everybody that grows it seems to

52
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,600
like it

53
00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:00,078
um there's quite a bit of it around

54
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:02,559
and uh yeah i know i'm

55
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:04,559
i'm i'm a huge fan of geek farms we're

56
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,600
obviously really good friends

57
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,679
and uh yeah i'm

58
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,840
excited for all their success and future

59
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,598
success as well as i know he is for ours

60
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,800
as well

61
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:17,119
so

62
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,200
did the success of the doctor who kind

63
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,439
of immediately make it a candidate in

64
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:23,919
your mind for like maybe a male in

65
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:25,840
future breeding crosses or was it

66
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:27,199
not the immediate thought

67
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,039
no it was definitely an immediate

68
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:31,039
thought um actually the one that came up

69
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:33,280
the whole doctor who thing and did the

70
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,400
original doctor who crossed was my son

71
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,439
donovan

72
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,039
um

73
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,919
him and him and his brother and my

74
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:41,519
oldest son um ray they got together and

75
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:43,919
did this whole thing and

76
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,560
planned out all kinds of plants that you

77
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:48,639
know we had to make stuff

78
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,680
multiple times before we got to their

79
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:53,518
end game of what they wanted it to be so

80
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,120
as we started you know cruising through

81
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,480
that yeah

82
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,319
we knew we would always want a doctor

83
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:03,679
whomel and we picked one now

84
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:07,359
okay and so what type of females do you

85
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:10,159
think would pair well with doctor who

86
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,959
so actually um we just recently did a

87
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:14,479
bunch of crosses with our doctor who mel

88
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,959
um

89
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,479
17 different strains different moms

90
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,360
cross the two

91
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:24,719
uh sfv lemon g

92
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,440
um just a whole slew of uh

93
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:29,439
standard old goodies you know old cuts

94
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:30,719
and whatnots and uh most of them came

95
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:32,878
out pretty well

96
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,959
the doctor whom male that we picked uh

97
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:37,359
was chosen

98
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,400
for specific structure and smell that it

99
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,000
had

100
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,080
and uh we're wanting to do the doctor

101
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,878
who down to about an f5 f6 to get to

102
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,560
where

103
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:46,318
the actual what the doctor who is going

104
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,080
to be when it's completed you know kind

105
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:49,919
of like how it regen how the doctor

106
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,519
regenerates all the time right

107
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:55,119
um

108
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,879
i like that so um he he was picked for

109
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,878
how close he was resembled the grape

110
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:03,438
high chew cut that we run

111
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:05,679
um it uh very sweet very grapey

112
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:06,959
and it's very dominant in the crosses

113
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,280
that we saw

114
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,759
it was kind of interesting

115
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,840
we even we even crossed them to a

116
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,518
forum cut

117
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,840
cookies the one of my friends asked me

118
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,840
if i would do so

119
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,839
there you go and so just as a quick

120
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:25,119
little side question out of all the

121
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:27,839
cookies which one's your favorite

122
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,918
honestly i'm not a big cookies fan um i

123
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:31,039
would not have i've never grown cookies

124
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:32,399
um

125
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,160
i

126
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:36,239
would not have done the cross if my

127
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,520
friend would not have asked me

128
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,879
so

129
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:40,319
obviously he's a pretty good pretty

130
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:43,120
close friend

131
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:45,199
yeah there you go okay and so just as

132
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,680
another little cookies question

133
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,919
do you feel like at this point

134
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,400
it's kind of been able to solidify

135
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:53,758
itself as one of those elite clones or

136
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:56,719
do you think it's still just kind of

137
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,319
like a hypey thing

138
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,400
well you know it's probably an elite

139
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,959
column sure it definitely is in certain

140
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:04,560
circles especially here in california um

141
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:06,478
you know a lot of there's a lot of

142
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,240
places that are cookies everybody likes

143
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:11,199
the cookies and don't get me wrong the

144
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,879
cookie dough flavor is nice um

145
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,240
i only kind of wish that some of them

146
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:16,000
produced better

147
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,478
the different cuts right

148
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
so automatically you want to find a mill

149
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:21,680
that's going to add your size and your

150
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,680
weight and you know try to keep the

151
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,918
flavor

152
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,400
but instead of hitting him yeah instead

153
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:29,680
of i'm just not a big fan of it it was

154
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:31,519
uh

155
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,759
i was something that i was offered at a

156
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,519
very early age when it came out and

157
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,840
turned it down and haven't grown it

158
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:40,879
since i've never grown it actually

159
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:42,799
there you go well on that note early age

160
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:45,918
let's take us back what was your first

161
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,919
experience with cannabis

162
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,000
wow

163
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:52,639
seven eight years old probably

164
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,240
um smoking uh cannabis with the cousin

165
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,759
of mine actually

166
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,280
um

167
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,639
our parents grew um and uh it was all

168
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:02,719
over and all around you know we're

169
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,918
talking the 70s so

170
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,520
it was

171
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:08,159
at that point in time in the in the

172
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:10,318
family the family that i was in and

173
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,639
there was plenty abundant

174
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,840
and it wasn't like

175
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,519
my parents didn't know that i was

176
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:18,318
smoking but my cousin and i sure were

177
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:20,799
taking some to smoke so yeah

178
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,479
haha there you go and do you know what

179
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,759
strains they were back then or it was

180
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:26,318
just whatever

181
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,960
oh yeah i just it was just whatever you

182
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,879
know yeah we had no clue

183
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:32,799
um we're never really in on those

184
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:35,600
conversations really to know what was

185
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,199
what uh we found the hash stash every

186
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,160
now and again you know that was always

187
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,240
nice

188
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,000
um but yeah normally just buds here and

189
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,759
there they were definitely nothing like

190
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,759
what we smoked today looking at these

191
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,759
yeah okay and so what was the

192
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,120
progression to you becoming a grower

193
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,319
yourself

194
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,000
um

195
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,240
lived with my mom for a while and then

196
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
uh hip teenage years she couldn't handle

197
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,598
me anymore so she sent me to my father's

198
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,199
at the age of 14

199
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:02,879
who was living in northern idaho and

200
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,800
growing

201
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:07,120
garage fulls of marijuana

202
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,639
so he kind of handed me a book and

203
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,560
said get up in the attic start doing

204
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,319
this start doing that and that pretty

205
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,680
much started me growing was when i was

206
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,840
14.

207
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,840
nice and which book did he give you

208
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,639
you know

209
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,080
um

210
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:28,160
right off the top of my head i don't

211
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:28,159
remember but it's one of the old clouds

212
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,039
it's an old classic yeah i don't

213
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:35,759
remember right at the moment yeah maybe

214
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:36,879
like an rc clark thing or something

215
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,400
um

216
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,959
no it was um

217
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:43,519
frank mel frank and

218
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:45,120
rosen i want to say it was rosenthal but

219
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,120
um grower's bible

220
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,240
yeah okay

221
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,240
like a 1982

222
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,400
version or something like that had a big

223
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,639
old pot had a big old bud cola on the

224
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:59,439
front pitch on the front cover and

225
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:02,400
yeah i had that book for a long time

226
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:05,120
cool yeah that's a good good mentor

227
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:07,598
i actually uh re-found it at pal pals

228
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,439
books there in uh portland

229
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:11,279
and in the used book section and bought

230
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:12,719
it for my father so you could

231
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:14,719
have it back

232
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,720
that's neat full circle

233
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,120
so during those early days when you were

234
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,879
growing was there any notable strains

235
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,639
that went around in your area or was it

236
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,720
just really everything wasn't having

237
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,120
names at that point

238
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,599
well and we're i was living in a

239
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,080
northern idaho point in time and skunk

240
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:33,679
was king i mean

241
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,759
there was there were several really good

242
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,038
strains not really any names with much

243
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:38,080
of them then

244
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:40,158
um

245
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,399
but yeah i mean i was still in junior

246
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:44,958
high so we weren't really that concerned

247
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,399
with it we were more concerned that

248
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,399
five bags later and you're still

249
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,039
smelling it and pretty ridiculous to

250
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:54,320
walk anywhere with it

251
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:55,838
yeah so did you have any recollections

252
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,800
of the roadkill skunk or what are your

253
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,240
thoughts on it in general

254
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:03,199
um

255
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,639
scott yeah i know i i love skunk i've

256
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,920
been searching for it ever since i've

257
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:07,120
left idaho

258
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:09,360
um

259
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,360
the closest thing that i've seen is what

260
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,120
duke is putting out

261
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,278
and i think that if anybody's going to

262
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,839
find the old old-school roadkill it's

263
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:20,000
going to be him they have it

264
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,240
and do there's there's a lot of kind of

265
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,919
discussion around the whole idea and

266
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,720
something which i'm interested in is the

267
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:29,039
idea that maybe there was not

268
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,519
necessarily one roadkill skunk but it

269
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:33,679
was more of kind of like a profile which

270
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,240
maybe popped up in one or two different

271
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:37,679
strains do you think there's any maybe

272
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,000
credence to that or do you think no it

273
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:41,838
was very much just one clone

274
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,120
yeah no i would totally agree with that

275
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:47,360
um myself i kind of look back to uh

276
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,600
the popular strains and go back a year

277
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,278
or two and see what war was happening

278
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,360
and most likely that's where it came

279
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:55,039
from as whatever region we were having a

280
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,278
war in

281
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:59,120
yeah okay interesting

282
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:01,278
so what are your thoughts on the land

283
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,879
races in terms of like would you

284
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:06,720
consider working them or no um i have a

285
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:08,159
good buddy too he's doing a bunch of

286
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,079
work with some land races right now

287
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,399
we've all donated a bunch of latin race

288
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:14,159
seed stock that we had so that he could

289
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,440
uh start working with that

290
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:18,000
um

291
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,240
yeah you know

292
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,200
so i think that the plant has used us to

293
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,600
progress itself along as most things do

294
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,920
right i mean we take it everywhere we've

295
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,079
given it life in existence and

296
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:31,599
we've done a lot for the plant as far as

297
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:33,679
the plant also does a lot for us don't

298
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,000
get me wrong the least bit um but it's

299
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:37,679
manipulated us to where we do all this

300
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,278
crazy stuff for it

301
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,359
and uh

302
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:44,240
is it progression the way that it should

303
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,560
be uh with us doing all the inner

304
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,000
breeding and cross-breeding and

305
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:50,078
multi-quad

306
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,320
polyprop you know poly breeding and all

307
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:53,599
that um

308
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,200
you know i

309
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,959
i think that it's progressing away as

310
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,200
long as what you're making is better

311
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:01,838
than what it was

312
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,800
but to work with land races a lot of

313
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,320
land races are run really long

314
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:07,519
and uh

315
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,920
you know

316
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,839
there's a reason why the when you look

317
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,599
at a picture of the buds in the high

318
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,040
times from the 70s

319
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,040
and you look at a picture of the buds

320
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:18,639
from the high times now

321
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:21,278
it's a huge difference which would you

322
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:23,600
rather you know it's which would you

323
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:25,200
rather smoke first off negan and land

324
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,720
races are nice they're very unique highs

325
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,600
very unique flavors

326
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,839
um but nowadays we're more about the

327
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,920
strong potencies and maybe even stronger

328
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,279
or more isolated flavors

329
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:36,799
um

330
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:40,000
but yeah to work with some land races i

331
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:44,000
have a few ibl's in stock and we play

332
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,399
with them every now and again but uh

333
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,759
that's that's a long project because you

334
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,759
need to

335
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:51,919
you know outcross land races are strong

336
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:53,278
you see those for and ibl's are strong

337
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,679
you see those for generations down the

338
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:56,799
line obviously but what characteristics

339
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:58,799
are you looking for and what

340
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:02,078
characteristics do you want

341
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:04,240
to grab from it and get it to express

342
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:06,719
well i guess it begs the question right

343
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,560
what would you like to bring to the game

344
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,200
because i think the modern criticism of

345
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:14,159
cannabis is that there's this kind of

346
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,680
same same amongst everything and that

347
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:18,559
there's also

348
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:20,078
like this ceiling where you can only get

349
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,759
so high whereas a lot of people would

350
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:23,199
argue that with certain land races you

351
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:25,120
would just you know the more you smoke

352
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,399
the further you would go

353
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,679
are those the type of things you would

354
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:32,399
be looking to bring into modern crosses

355
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:34,399
yeah no absolutely um

356
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,278
i've

357
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,879
you know

358
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:38,639
when when people describe that and i

359
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:40,879
remember you know i started smoking

360
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,879
fairly young so i started smoking

361
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:44,559
mid to late 70s

362
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,078
do i remember everything no do i know

363
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:48,000
all the names you know

364
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:49,278
but i do remember a lot of the effects

365
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,559
and a lot of the ways that it made me

366
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:52,480
feel

367
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:55,518
and i'm able to use that

368
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,519
to uh kind of guide me in what i

369
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,240
what my memory is

370
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,560
so

371
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,000
if i could find the land races from back

372
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:03,759
then that made me feel that way

373
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,720
absolutely i'd love to play with them

374
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:08,879
because yeah they were

375
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,560
you know but then again was it my age

376
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:12,240
was it because i had nothing else to

377
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:14,799
compare it to

378
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,079
you know that all comes into a factor as

379
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:16,958
well but

380
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:19,679
um

381
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:21,039
yeah i would like to uh definitely get

382
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:23,359
there are some land races that i would

383
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:24,240
like to play with if i could find

384
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,839
you know

385
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,839
true

386
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,399
seeds of

387
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,880
and which ones are they

388
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,120
more of your afghanis more of your

389
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:36,799
hindu mountains areas more indicators

390
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,519
i'm more of an indica guy

391
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:40,639
um i'm not much into the sativas

392
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,639
yeah okay

393
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,079
um you may or may not have heard about

394
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,240
this it's kind of been on instagram i

395
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:48,479
got tagged in it a few times there's

396
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,278
kind of been some talks about like the

397
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,480
origins of the triangle kush

398
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:56,000
having coming out recently and basically

399
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,839
you know to cut a long story short it's

400
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,839
meant to be some old-school cali strain

401
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:03,360
called emerald triangle across to hindu

402
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,040
kush i don't suppose you've heard about

403
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,199
this kind of little saga at all and if

404
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:08,719
so if not what do you think about you

405
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:10,319
know kind of that as a potential

406
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,480
genetics do you see any hindu kush in

407
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,639
the triangle kush

408
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,000
well you know i actually i have heard a

409
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,759
little bit of read a little bit about

410
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,278
that my kind of thoughts on that is that

411
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:21,759
they're just now coming out without

412
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:21,759
information

413
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,399
right you know um what

414
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,839
all of a sudden you just woke up oh yeah

415
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,440
we crossed that for this and created

416
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:33,199
this yeah you know

417
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,480
i don't know that's that's kind of hard

418
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:36,799
to swallow

419
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,399
um the people that are saying it though

420
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:42,479
um you know i know them and uh

421
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,600
they have done a lot of things you know

422
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,120
there's a lot of good strains that

423
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,360
they've done um

424
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,000
so i don't know but having you know

425
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,839
um we just had chrome over at the garden

426
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,759
here a couple days back looking at some

427
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,720
of their genetics that we just

428
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:59,679
germinated over there and uh

429
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:03,040
you know he's pretty infamous for the tk

430
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:06,000
and a lot of tk crosses and stuff so

431
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:08,480
um i didn't talk with him about it but i

432
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,320
do know what you're talking about and

433
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,800
there's a couple of things that you know

434
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,560
come to question in my head

435
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:16,958
yeah okay so i think people are going to

436
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:20,559
be wondering out of the swamp boys gear

437
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,559
which ones did you decide to jam

438
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,919
oh good guy i don't have the list with

439
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,040
me so we did two different germinations

440
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:31,679
of seeds the first one was 6 300 seeds

441
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:32,799
the next one was 2 800 seeds

442
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:35,198
so

443
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:36,159
it was several breeders and several

444
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:37,838
strains

445
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:39,439
unfortunately i could not rattle them

446
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,920
off without having my list in front of

447
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,279
me um i could tell some of the breeders

448
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:44,559
but i couldn't definitely tell you all

449
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:45,838
the strains

450
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:47,838
yeah i don't think anyone would expect

451
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,920
you to remember with a list that big but

452
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,399
the question which jumps to mind is

453
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:54,240
how many seeds of each strain would you

454
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,078
like to run when you do a pheno hunt of

455
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,320
that size

456
00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:00,479
at least a hundred

457
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,879
great answer

458
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:06,079
you know um that way you're getting

459
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:07,838
50 to 60 females to look at

460
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:09,599
pretty harsh you know they fall over we

461
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,360
don't stick them up it's cloudy to

462
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,079
school when you're a seedling

463
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,560
um we don't baby them in any way shape

464
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:19,359
or form and survival with fitness

465
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:22,958
out of all those seeds we came back with

466
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:26,240
3 700 females that we looked through

467
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:27,439
and um have picked maybe 400 to bring

468
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,440
back out of

469
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,959
to reveg

470
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,560
wow yeah because that's that was going

471
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:34,879
to be my next question when you do a

472
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:36,638
phenomenon of that size how long does it

473
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:38,799
take you to actually discern the winner

474
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,079
because as you just kind of implied

475
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:41,758
there's probably going to be a lot that

476
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:43,120
are really neck and neck at that end

477
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,680
point it's like heart you've got to do

478
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,600
them again and again type of thing

479
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:48,879
most definitely um there is several that

480
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,199
are neck connect

481
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:53,360
um you know and that's the thing is you

482
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:55,278
grow them out to

483
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,680
almost completion before you want to

484
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:59,759
re-veg them or clone them and re-veg

485
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:01,359
them or however so that you can see all

486
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,000
its final traits

487
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,720
um but yeah it's really close on a lot

488
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,119
of them um one of them might have just a

489
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,038
little bit better structure or you know

490
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,639
because it got bent here or something or

491
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:14,798
restrained here maybe it didn't perform

492
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,160
as well as it could have

493
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:17,279
and you think maybe it performed better

494
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,279
next time

495
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:22,078
so it's two pretty much

496
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:24,720
three within three runs we'll be down to

497
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:26,798
maybe one percent of the 400

498
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,120
so maybe 40 strains

499
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:31,440
wow and and how many end keepers would

500
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:33,839
you ideally like to keep at the end of

501
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,840
it all

502
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,200
that's rough at that point that's when

503
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:40,160
you're getting down pretty nitty gritty

504
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,000
um

505
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,440
you know so i mean because we've got a

506
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
lot of counteratta we've got a lot of

507
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,720
caramel we've got a lot of swamp boys

508
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,400
we've got oni we've got

509
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,400
i mean you know a whole bunch of the

510
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,759
great the great breeders out there that

511
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,080
were that were

512
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:57,200
privileged enough to germinate a lot of

513
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:58,879
seeds of

514
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,240
um

515
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,080
and uh they are all just so fantastic

516
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,839
it's really hard to pick one you know i

517
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:08,159
would rather window it down to maybe two

518
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:10,879
or three per breeder

519
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:13,120
than um just two or three strains

520
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,880
overall kind of a thing

521
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,639
um just because

522
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,799
you know because a breeder is more more

523
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,640
of an artist and you know they're

524
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:22,400
they've painted this picture for you to

525
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,000
kind of color in so

526
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,160
um

527
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,679
i would definitely i think

528
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,880
i'm shooting for that rap we haven't

529
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:32,320
completely decided all that way yet um

530
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,000
but yeah that's kind of where i'm

531
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:36,319
thinking

532
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,240
and so the end goal of doing this big

533
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:41,038
phenohunt besides obviously having the

534
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:44,079
clone is it to kind of offer that to the

535
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:47,919
market or more so as a breeding queen

536
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:50,240
oh no it's for market um it's um

537
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,759
we're doing this at one of our

538
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,038
clients

539
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:53,839
facility

540
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:55,599
and

541
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:58,000
yeah it's totally for their market for

542
00:18:55,599 --> 00:19:00,719
them to be able to bring to the market

543
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,960
and have variety and diversity

544
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,720
yeah nice that's a great answer and so

545
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,519
one of the things i'm thinking about and

546
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,798
i often hear is like a complex issue so

547
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:11,519
to speak is

548
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:13,679
the the idea of how people want more

549
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:15,119
sativa being offered and more variety

550
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,720
along those lines but there's a whole

551
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:19,519
bunch of issues that come along with

552
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,558
that in regards to price points flower

553
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:22,798
times

554
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:24,639
all things like that what's your stance

555
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:26,400
do you feel like people are asking for

556
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,520
something but they're not willing to buy

557
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,200
it on the other hand like you know how

558
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:30,960
do you feel about it all

559
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,200
oh yeah i know absolutely um people talk

560
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,519
about land races but most land races

561
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,798
most land race sativas are going to take

562
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:40,000
you 16 to 20 something weeks to finish

563
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:41,759
um

564
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,519
unfortunately on a production scale type

565
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:45,440
of a model that just really doesn't work

566
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:47,519
because there's nobody out there in a

567
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,798
market that will pay two to three times

568
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,240
the amount

569
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:53,119
for the same eighth if you're already

570
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,120
complaining about paying 30 or 40

571
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:57,199
for an eighth from the market and now

572
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:59,199
all of a sudden it's 60 to

573
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,919
you know 120 dollars for that same

574
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,919
eighth just because it's a land race or

575
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,520
something of that effect um at this

576
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,480
point in time the market is not there

577
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:08,158
for it

578
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,240
it would be

579
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:13,120
a little i think that it is possible in

580
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,038
the future to definitely see a craft

581
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:16,639
style market for it

582
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:19,200
um

583
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,520
which is a big thing to come yet i think

584
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,679
the whole craft thing is

585
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:25,759
going to stick around for a while and um

586
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,000
you know the big scale people it's hard

587
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:29,359
for them to do craft

588
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,558
yeah of course

589
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:33,038
and so

590
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:35,119
in regards to the craft market do you

591
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:39,119
think that that's

592
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:39,119
good like it's still kind of to emerge

593
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:43,119
um

594
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,319
just depends on where you're at

595
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:45,678
yeah right

596
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:48,879
um is it

597
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:51,840
in oregon craft market is king um

598
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,240
that's i think i feel that that's

599
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,918
you know and uh price point i feel kind

600
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,359
of proves that um

601
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,400
most pounds in oregon are 12 1600 for

602
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:03,359
indoor

603
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,679
um if you are considered

604
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:08,240
craft and you have the brand and you

605
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:11,759
have the recognition of said craft

606
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:14,000
you're still getting 24 2600 a pound it

607
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:15,519
hasn't really changed that much

608
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,759
but if you don't have that brand and if

609
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:18,639
you don't have something special

610
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:20,400
um

611
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,640
yeah you know

612
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,120
here in california this market here is a

613
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,200
lot different you know a lot

614
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:28,798
it depends on where you're at some parts

615
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,159
of it they want fruit some parts they

616
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:31,519
want gas the other parts they want

617
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,120
cookies

618
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:35,839
so you got to be able to appease all of

619
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:38,239
those on a larger scale market

620
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:40,959
but as far as

621
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,200
craft for many of the large guys

622
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,200
yeah

623
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:47,759
you'll probably see some coming

624
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:51,038
um but uh i think that it'll take a

625
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:52,798
little bit for everybody to dial it in

626
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:54,879
yeah so i mean

627
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:57,038
perfect segue on that issue of craft

628
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:00,159
cannabis how do you feel i'm sure you've

629
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:01,599
heard about it about the infamous 100

630
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,720
eighths of mac

631
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:06,879
we spoke to aficionado leo not long ago

632
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,079
and he said he thinks that's the biggest

633
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,679
thing that's happened in the cannabis

634
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:11,279
industry in a while and it's kind of

635
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,798
maybe not getting the recognition it

636
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:15,038
should what do you feel about the whole

637
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:17,440
issue and maybe as an extension of that

638
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:19,759
how do you feel about kind of mac sorry

639
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,840
cap's kind of general unhappiness with

640
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:23,440
the pricing of it

641
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:25,279
well you know i look at it as anything

642
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,798
else it's only worth as much as you get

643
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:28,558
somebody to pay for it

644
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:30,079
so if somebody's willing to pay it then

645
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:32,399
why not

646
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:34,240
that's you know i it's sad to look at it

647
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,679
that way but that's kind of where it's

648
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,000
at

649
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,240
i could go buy a

650
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,919
10 000 bottle of wine or i can go buy a

651
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,519
hundred dollar bottle of wine they're

652
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,840
both probably gonna get me just about as

653
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:45,839
drunk

654
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:51,599
yeah okay and so how do you feel about

655
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:53,439
like the idea of

656
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:55,439
you wouldn't want say

657
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,120
one of your strains reaching a certain

658
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,960
price point with the implication being

659
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:01,199
it's kind of like price gouging at that

660
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,200
point

661
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:05,439
um you know that would be for the farm

662
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:07,119
to decide at that point in time we don't

663
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,960
really um

664
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:10,719
you know we're we're a seed company once

665
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,159
you buy the seeds you do with what you

666
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,480
want you find something that people are

667
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:17,440
willing to pay that much for once again

668
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,839
if you can get it why wouldn't you

669
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,840
um

670
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,400
i see i i can see both sides of it

671
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,079
because you know that it seems

672
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,919
ridiculous a hundred dollars an eighth

673
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:32,240
but once again you don't have to buy it

674
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,840
yeah yeah i kind of feel the same in a

675
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,960
lot of regards like in terms of that

676
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:38,079
pure capitalist view on things right

677
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,360
right

678
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:41,359
you know

679
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:43,918
it works in every other market it's

680
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:45,839
going to wind up being the same in this

681
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,000
you know look at how much do some nikes

682
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:51,199
go for i mean

683
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,038
yeah or even just expensive cars

684
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,720
right exactly you know what is it

685
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:56,798
mercedes or uh

686
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,038
volvo this is the safest car out there

687
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:01,839
but not everybody drives one

688
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:03,759
yeah let's uh rewind back for a moment i

689
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:05,278
would love to know what was your first

690
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:07,759
breeding project and how did you get

691
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:09,599
into breeding in general

692
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:13,519
oh good golly um

693
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:17,038
so a friend of mine and i had a house

694
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:19,038
in colorado in the early 90s

695
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:20,558
we've been growing hash plant and doing

696
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:22,879
quite well with it

697
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:26,079
um got a hold of some seeds out of

698
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:28,799
california of some california red hair

699
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:30,158
and uh we popped the seeds

700
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:32,240
chose between a couple of different

701
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:35,440
mouths and used those to pollinate a

702
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:37,679
couple of the hash plant

703
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,120
huh and so did you end up growing out

704
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,360
the offspring

705
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:43,678
we did we only wound up getting a couple

706
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:45,119
hundred seeds and we popped the majority

707
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,440
of them but didn't necessarily really

708
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:49,119
find anything all that great

709
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,038
okay and what do you think that is do

710
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:52,639
you think that maybe is because

711
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:54,240
like uh the genetics back then just

712
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,600
weren't as kind of refined as they are

713
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,798
these days

714
00:24:55,599 --> 00:25:00,879
um no i would think they were more

715
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:02,798
more so refined then now they're a

716
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,200
little bit more you know

717
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:06,558
for lack of a better bastardized out

718
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,600
um

719
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:09,119
but uh

720
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:11,599
the um

721
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:13,359
i think that uh it was a it was a land

722
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:15,038
race that we hit it too and the land

723
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:16,719
race was just so dominant that it

724
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:18,319
overrode

725
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,720
the hash plan

726
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:21,599
um but the hash plant you know back then

727
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,360
it was

728
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:24,719
a super fast plant so we had a hash

729
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:26,479
plant that we could take a clone within

730
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,759
a week it had roots and it went right on

731
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,919
the flood table

732
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:32,400
six weeks and flower chop it down a week

733
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,480
to dry once again we're in colorado

734
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,519
so an eight week cycle from clone to

735
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,360
done

736
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:38,879
um we wanted to find something that

737
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:40,399
would maybe you know add a little bit

738
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,278
more to it but

739
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,120
yeah that wasn't the ticket

740
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:47,519
interesting and so when you say hash

741
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:49,439
plan is it just like it's just any old

742
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:51,119
hash plan or is it like a specific one

743
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,759
you're referring to

744
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:55,038
um it came to us as hashman

745
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:56,720
you know

746
00:25:55,038 --> 00:26:00,000
shortly after that is when the arcade

747
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,360
cut came to us train wreck derek katrina

748
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,440
came to us a little while after that and

749
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:04,959
we all grew that for a long time

750
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,798
but uh yeah the hash plan was what we

751
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:11,200
all grew for quite a while 92 93-ish

752
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:13,200
there in denver okay

753
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,759
and so i don't suppose it might have

754
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,840
been the skelly hash plant

755
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:19,519
it's a very good possibility

756
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:20,879
i'm not exactly sure

757
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:22,720
interesting i mean i don't suppose

758
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,960
you've tried scaly more recently since

759
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,720
she's kind of made a re-emergence

760
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:30,159
i have not

761
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:33,278
so yeah i wouldn't have any reference

762
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:35,440
all right we'll have to line that up

763
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:38,240
yeah yeah that would be great cool yeah

764
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,880
that's that's insanely fast flowering

765
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:43,278
time in your opinion you know do you

766
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,799
think it was truly done that quickly or

767
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:46,240
maybe you were cutting corners a little

768
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:47,679
bit

769
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,599
yeah it might have needed to go a little

770
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,679
longer but we were doing flat tables and

771
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:53,519
pushing everything right along you know

772
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:56,240
that was back in the day the

773
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:59,519
simple salts in the tanks and

774
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:01,440
ripped and let her go you know um

775
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:04,000
yeah it maybe needed to go seven or

776
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,360
eight i could totally see that

777
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,759
but yeah

778
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:09,839
okay cool and so

779
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:11,839
do you grow organically nowadays or are

780
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:14,158
you still a soul guy or

781
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:16,798
oh no it's all organics

782
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,000
we mix most of our soils

783
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:20,558
um

784
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,359
we use a few things out of a bottle but

785
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:24,158
they all say organics on them

786
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:26,158
yeah

787
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,080
bro you know you can take that as far as

788
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:30,880
you can throw it um

789
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:32,319
we pay extra for water obviously but uh

790
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,360
you know

791
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:36,079
um

792
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:38,798
yeah so we we try to stay pretty organic

793
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:39,599
we don't play with salts that much but

794
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:41,918
yeah

795
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:43,599
cool and do you feel like it's just kind

796
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,440
of a personal preference thing or do you

797
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:48,398
feel like it's just truly like you know

798
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,640
a superior option like

799
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:52,639
yeah no i think uh you know if you want

800
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,278
mass you're gonna do salts if you want

801
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,520
flavor you're gonna do organics

802
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:59,359
okay interesting we've heard some guests

803
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:01,679
in the past argue that

804
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:04,558
if you kind of you know really

805
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:06,880
on point so to speak you can get the the

806
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:09,038
yields to be quite on par with the hydro

807
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,799
guys do you feel like that's maybe a

808
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:12,480
little bit stretching the truth or that

809
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:14,000
that is accurate

810
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,640
you know i don't know you know i'll

811
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,759
refer back to uh geek farms they do

812
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,278
about

813
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:21,200
two and a half to three a light with

814
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:23,839
that doctor who and that's all organic

815
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,759
soil that they create themselves

816
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:26,639
yeah it sounds like it's matching it i

817
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:28,720
mean

818
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,480
so you know i have plenty of friends

819
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,200
that just smash

820
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:35,278
do fantastic on organic soils

821
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,960
um

822
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:39,919
i just think that with the good cocoa

823
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,798
and salt system you can see 15 20 times

824
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,640
a day

825
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:44,720
you're going to crush

826
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,919
that's there's no

827
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,519
you know

828
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,278
the more food you can get it to uptake

829
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:51,038
the bigger it's going to get it's basic

830
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:52,960
physics

831
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:53,919
yeah for sure

832
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,000
so

833
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,840
on the issue of growing

834
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,278
grow lights what are your preferred

835
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:01,519
brand you know it seems like there's new

836
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:03,759
technologies ever constantly emerging

837
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:05,359
what are you currently using

838
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:06,960
yeah we jumped on that gavita train in

839
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:08,879
the very beginning kind of been riding

840
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,798
it ever since i'm a big fan of the

841
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,399
gavitas

842
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:15,200
cool cool and so

843
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:17,038
like just uh the 1000 double ends or

844
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,278
which ones you rocking

845
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:20,640
yeah we ran the 1000 double ends because

846
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:22,640
we bought them way back in the beginning

847
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,360
before they had the 750s

848
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,399
would you use the 750s if you could

849
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:29,119
um absolutely

850
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:32,239
uh before we went to the uh gavita 1000s

851
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:34,158
we went we ran 600s

852
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,200
due to the fact that instead of

853
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,480
six

854
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,360
thousands i would stuff in 10 or 11 or

855
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,319
12

856
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:44,398
600 to get to the same point pretty much

857
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:46,480
with power so therefore you just have

858
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:48,079
more points of light and you they run a

859
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,159
lot cooler so you can run the plants a

860
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:51,119
lot closer i run them a lot closer to

861
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,799
the plants

862
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:55,519
and so

863
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:58,158
just to kind of this idea put forward by

864
00:29:55,519 --> 00:30:00,960
dj short is that like metal halides

865
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,480
brings more flavor hps brings more yield

866
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,759
or maybe it wasn't dj short specifically

867
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,679
but he's the one who i remembered

868
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:08,480
bringing it up initially do you agree

869
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:10,720
with that and if so what type of system

870
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,558
do you use like a mixed a pure how do

871
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,679
you do it

872
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:15,440
you know so

873
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,600
what i've learned from

874
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,480
doing different mixed spectrum rooms is

875
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:21,359
that

876
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,798
a 50 50 is usually pretty good

877
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:24,479
um

878
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:26,240
you know but you'll get certain strains

879
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,319
that under the blue light they'll show

880
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,480
different colors um to wear under the

881
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:32,798
halogen they won't so now you got a bud

882
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,798
that's half say pink hair and the other

883
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:36,319
behalf of its white hair because it's

884
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:37,679
getting the metal halide or it's getting

885
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:39,200
the h the

886
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,798
hps right

887
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,278
um

888
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:45,839
the metal halide though does from blue

889
00:30:43,278 --> 00:30:48,319
light promotes vegetative growth so you

890
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:51,519
wind up getting a leafier more open

891
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:52,240
product i feel um

892
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:53,839
so

893
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,319
you know

894
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:58,319
a 50 50 mix but now with the ceramics

895
00:30:56,319 --> 00:31:00,319
and all that stuff i haven't played with

896
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:02,158
ceramics that much

897
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:04,639
but i see a lot of people throwing those

898
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,240
in nowadays as well instead of the metal

899
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,038
halides

900
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,278
so

901
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:11,919
i think i don't know that

902
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:13,440
flavor wise on the blues probably so um

903
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:17,200
just because

904
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,960
it's more of the cool color um

905
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,159
it's more of a promoting vegetative

906
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,159
growth

907
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,760
but i don't know for sure

908
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:25,760
yeah

909
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:28,079
okay so

910
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:29,839
if we kind of just jump back to that

911
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:32,398
initial story where you had the hash

912
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:34,240
plant and you did the pollination at

913
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:36,239
that time were there any kind of

914
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,759
breeders you were looking up to or was

915
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,319
everyone just kind of

916
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:42,158
self-sufficient and given to themselves

917
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:44,798
yeah pretty self-sufficient keeping to

918
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:47,200
themselves um high times cups had just

919
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:49,119
kind of started over in amsterdam right

920
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,798
so uh you know the big guys at that

921
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:52,398
point obviously were

922
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:54,319
greenhouse

923
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:55,759
and adam dunn was doing quite well back

924
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:57,839
then um

925
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:59,599
you know since he sees there's a few

926
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:01,199
different seed companies you get but

927
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:02,639
everybody was too scared to order them

928
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,399
especially out of the back of high times

929
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,759
or call them you know i mean that was

930
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:07,599
still back

931
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:09,200
we would get stuff at the grocery store

932
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:11,278
and then go camping for a three-day

933
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,840
weekend before we went anywhere kind of

934
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:16,240
thing you know borrow somebody's car and

935
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:17,839
meet him at a campsite to grab your your

936
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,599
nutrients and all that stuff that you

937
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:20,558
needed for the next month

938
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:23,038
um

939
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:25,038
it was still pretty pretty harsh in the

940
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:26,480
early 90s late 80s

941
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:28,000
so

942
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,399
it was definitely a little bit more to

943
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,398
yourself

944
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,038
okay and so

945
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:37,919
did you go to like you know those extra

946
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:39,519
efforts to try to throw the you know

947
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:42,000
cops off your trail or did you kind of

948
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:45,519
always view it as a bit of paranoia

949
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,720
oh no um definitely we would i've spent

950
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,759
i didn't mind spending time in the

951
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,640
mountains

952
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:53,759
so that was a bonus anyways right an

953
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:55,600
excuse to go fishing for the weekend um

954
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:57,278
you know yeah it was just the way that i

955
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:59,038
was raised because my father even was

956
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:01,119
the same way i mean anytime he would

957
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:03,359
order stuff we lived in northern idaho

958
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:05,599
so the panhandle so we would go over to

959
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:07,199
spokane to buy all of our nutrients or

960
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:08,798
anything like that we'd only go to

961
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,640
garden stores

962
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:12,319
you know a long ways away

963
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:15,440
um

964
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:17,439
and uh yeah it was just you it was still

965
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,320
it was such a paranoid type

966
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,399
uh

967
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:22,398
time for sure

968
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:24,959
and so what was the first cup you ended

969
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:27,119
up going to yourself

970
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,000
um first cup actually the first

971
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:32,798
competition i went to was the omcas

972
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,079
oregon medicinal cannabis awards

973
00:33:32,798 --> 00:33:39,038
um and actually we wound up taking first

974
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:41,038
place with a mad scientist

975
00:33:39,038 --> 00:33:42,398
okay so that was obviously a bit more

976
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:44,319
recently

977
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:47,119
yeah that was 2011. i never went to

978
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:51,038
amsterdam i've never been into amsterdam

979
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:53,119
so um yeah my first cup was here so

980
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:54,240
that was it it was a small local state

981
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:56,000
thing

982
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,480
uh first high times cup was the first

983
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,798
one that was here in l.a

984
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,519
interesting and and did you ever

985
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:04,960
have uh you know a lot to do with the

986
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,440
the following cups after that in

987
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,918
california and whatnot

988
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:12,960
um did the high time circuit quite a bit

989
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:16,638
did a couple of the other ones um

990
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:18,559
but yeah no mainly just the high times

991
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,800
and do you feel like they they kind of

992
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:22,719
help the scene develop over the years or

993
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:26,480
maybe not as much as other avenues like

994
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:26,480
say forums or things like that

995
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:29,838
i think the forums did a lot they had

996
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,280
their place

997
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:33,599
unfortunately once again i'm not a

998
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,280
computer guy i wasn't on the forums

999
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,639
so i don't know much about the forum

1000
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,720
life

1001
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,639
but i meet a lot of people now that

1002
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,279
that's all they're about is forum this

1003
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,280
and

1004
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,240
you know i was so and so on this forum

1005
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,839
and

1006
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:47,598
um there's a lot of great people that

1007
00:34:45,838 --> 00:34:50,000
were on those forums

1008
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:52,240
as far as high times i think it

1009
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,440
allowed an avenue for people to come and

1010
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:59,118
uh yeah see everything that they

1011
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,119
were reading about and hearing about

1012
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:02,880
in the beginning

1013
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:06,000
towards the end

1014
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,680
they've changed a bit but yeah

1015
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,920
yeah okay and so how do you feel about

1016
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:12,000
things nowadays i mean emerald cup has

1017
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,240
been a hot topic in the sense that last

1018
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
year i remember being at the cup people

1019
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:18,479
were almost predicting like you know it

1020
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,559
was the last one that'll ever happen and

1021
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,400
it was all doom and gloom what's your

1022
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:25,440
forecast for cups going forward and

1023
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,320
specifically the emerald cup this year

1024
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,920
so

1025
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,440
yeah i've been doing him cup for a long

1026
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,960
time

1027
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,039
i'm good friends with a lot of those

1028
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:36,400
folks um

1029
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:38,400
and we'll be there again this year um

1030
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,800
but yes it won't be like it was last

1031
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,440
year last year was the last cup of the

1032
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,400
free will of where you could freely bust

1033
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,079
up

1034
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,039
and do pretty much kind of what you

1035
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,519
wanted

1036
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:50,800
um that's not happening anymore now it's

1037
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:53,199
all regulated

1038
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,800
um if you're not licensed if you're not

1039
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:56,319
from a nursery there's all kinds of

1040
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,640
things that you have to be

1041
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,838
even to be able to get the booth

1042
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:00,960
so

1043
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:02,639
i think it's going to be a little

1044
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,400
different but there's you know once

1045
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:05,358
again there's always loopholes around

1046
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,240
everything

1047
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:11,519
uh as i just mentioned we will most like

1048
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:13,279
we will be there um i do believe that we

1049
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:15,599
were talking with jinx proof about

1050
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,200
sharing a booth with him actually

1051
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,720
uh-huh that was going to be my question

1052
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:21,759
will you have your own booth or just be

1053
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:24,959
represented with seeds here now

1054
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,880
um i haven't spoken with james um but

1055
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,358
most likely seats here now does a

1056
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,680
fantastic showing at those um

1057
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:33,598
we normally like to have our own booths

1058
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:35,358
uh just that way we get a little bit of

1059
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,320
time to talk to the people that are you

1060
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:37,598
know

1061
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,240
supporting us

1062
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:42,960
and uh

1063
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:44,799
but you know then again it's sometimes

1064
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,639
nice just to let james and his preview

1065
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,000
their job and just go and have fun and

1066
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:50,159
enjoy yourself

1067
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,199
so that's kind of where we're at now

1068
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:52,960
um

1069
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:54,960
but jinx drinks proof just hit me up

1070
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,720
here in the last last week

1071
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,880
and was talking to me about this so

1072
00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:01,598
that's kind of a new development that

1073
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:04,000
warren talks about right at the moment

1074
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,760
yeah okay i remember last year cruz

1075
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,838
passed your booth a few times and every

1076
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,320
time you're locked in a conversation is

1077
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:11,519
that what it feels like to you

1078
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,079
yeah no

1079
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:15,679
that is that's why i love doing them um

1080
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,200
is so that i can get locked into

1081
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:18,239
conversations with the supporters

1082
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:19,838
because

1083
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:22,000
it's great to hear what they think or

1084
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:24,078
what they're doing or how it's going and

1085
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,159
you know just hear their stories of

1086
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:28,400
how your strains did for them for the

1087
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:31,440
following the prior year

1088
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,440
um or the future of

1089
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,119
um so yeah you know that's the thing

1090
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,358
that's why it's kind of nice to do your

1091
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,960
booth that way people can come and talk

1092
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:40,719
to you

1093
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,559
and how often is it that someone will

1094
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:44,159
come by the booth and bring you a sample

1095
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:46,239
of your work and you're like really

1096
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:47,440
blown away by it

1097
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:48,838
quite often

1098
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,838
most shows

1099
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:53,599
actually we've uh unfortunately i've

1100
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:54,960
slowed down on doing shows i think

1101
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:56,400
emerald cup's the only one we're pretty

1102
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,599
much doing this year

1103
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,400
um

1104
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:02,400
but uh yeah no it's there's there's some

1105
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,480
amazing growers out there and

1106
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,240
um you know i would like to think that

1107
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,079
we're providing them with some fantastic

1108
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:09,519
genetics to grow

1109
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,200
so

1110
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:14,639
it's really nice to get something back

1111
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:16,480
that just is like wow that's fantastic

1112
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:18,960
yeah i mean on the topic of providing

1113
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,800
genetics how do you feel when people

1114
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,559
want to breed with your work do you feel

1115
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,400
like you're all cool with it you know

1116
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:26,719
just like maybe give me a little hello

1117
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,760
how you doing or what's your stance on

1118
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:29,598
it

1119
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,280
absolutely um

1120
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,599
if if it's something that i don't want

1121
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,920
the public to have and or work with

1122
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:37,039
um i wouldn't release it i have lots of

1123
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,720
those things

1124
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:40,000
um

1125
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:42,159
but there's

1126
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,838
you know so it's it's more of an honor

1127
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:46,399
and a privilege for somebody to use your

1128
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:48,880
genetics in something because

1129
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:51,680
it takes a lot of time to do to create

1130
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,280
genetics and test them out and you know

1131
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:55,519
and have a vision of where you're

1132
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,200
wanting to go with it

1133
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:59,039
and if that works in somebody else's

1134
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:00,399
head and it's one of our genetics that's

1135
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:02,320
awesome

1136
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,838
but yeah always you know the head knots

1137
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,519
great

1138
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:09,199
cool cool and so if we kind of jump back

1139
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:11,759
to the emerald cup for just one last

1140
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:13,679
second um do you ever get a chance to

1141
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,240
cruise around with the intention of

1142
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:18,799
trying to find like eye off what the

1143
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:20,479
next kind of trend is or like find some

1144
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,079
new hot breeders or do you find it's

1145
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,320
just too chaotic to really be able to do

1146
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:28,320
that

1147
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:29,920
yeah you know it's pretty chaotic um

1148
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,920
there

1149
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,159
there's definitely a lot of new good new

1150
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,358
breeders out there i'm always as always

1151
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:37,679
will be

1152
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:37,679
um

1153
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:44,079
yeah it's kind of chaotic

1154
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:45,838
um you know we're creating we create

1155
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,200
so much that for us to pop somebody

1156
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:49,358
else's genetics

1157
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:53,118
at this point except for at our clients

1158
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:55,598
facility um becomes rough

1159
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:57,920
yeah okay so i'm gonna put you on the

1160
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:59,039
grill for a second

1161
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,880
whether you've got to do it

1162
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:02,400
imaginatively because you're not able to

1163
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,318
in real life or whether it is the real

1164
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,480
life answer let's just say for your

1165
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:08,239
personal grow you're gonna pop a pack of

1166
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,079
seeds you know just one pack what's it

1167
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,598
gonna be

1168
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:14,720
quantum

1169
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,720
ha ha easy choice

1170
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,680
i pop quantum everywhere i go

1171
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:21,519
so like do you

1172
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:23,358
do you like to

1173
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:26,079
find new keepers of things or do you

1174
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:28,159
like to hold on to old keepers

1175
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:30,560
um you know if there are strains that we

1176
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:32,559
created yeah um in and out

1177
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:34,078
you know if we find something that's

1178
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:36,480
that's special

1179
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:39,039
we'll have it we'll have it tested and

1180
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:41,199
if our thoughts are right then it is

1181
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:42,719
special then we may hold on to it for

1182
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:43,598
future progress

1183
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:45,679
um

1184
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:47,920
but most of the time yeah we've got a

1185
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:49,279
whole bunch of moms in a library already

1186
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,838
we don't need to keep a bunch of stuff

1187
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,440
we make in c form

1188
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:54,559
that's i mean that's a that's a good

1189
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,960
answer if you've got that much

1190
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:59,039
confidence in the seed stock is it true

1191
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,599
i might be wrong but i think i'm right

1192
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:04,719
that uh geek mike actually found that

1193
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:06,960
cut out of just a single five seeds

1194
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:07,838
yeah yeah that's true i gave him a five

1195
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,720
pack

1196
00:41:07,838 --> 00:41:11,199
um

1197
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:13,199
he wound up getting five females

1198
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:14,639
and that wasn't even the best female out

1199
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:17,039
of the five pack

1200
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:19,279
uh the best yeah the best he said the

1201
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:21,838
best one didn't clone

1202
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,200
jesus

1203
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:26,078
yeah so

1204
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:27,598
yeah you know um he got fairly lucky not

1205
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:29,359
everybody has that you know gets that

1206
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,800
luck unfortunately that tells me that

1207
00:41:29,358 --> 00:41:31,920
somebody out there got a five pack of

1208
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,519
mouse

1209
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,920
yeah yeah you know it's probably a

1210
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:36,759
breeder and they're probably stoked

1211
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,280
right

1212
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,400
[Laughter]

1213
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,640
all righty

1214
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:45,519
so i just wanted to loot back a while

1215
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:47,598
back you mentioned um that like you know

1216
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:49,759
scentsy were the people advertising in

1217
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:51,599
high times and stuff like that i'm

1218
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:54,480
always interested to know what's your

1219
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:56,160
opinions on scentsy in regards to like

1220
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,480
when and why do you think they went to

1221
00:41:56,159 --> 00:41:58,480
[ __ ]

1222
00:41:59,358 --> 00:42:03,440
um

1223
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:05,679
you know so

1224
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,358
they cross bred out too much right i

1225
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:09,679
think and they just got

1226
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:11,358
they they also subbed everything out to

1227
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:12,879
people in spain or somewhere else to

1228
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:14,078
make their seeds

1229
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,680
right

1230
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,119
um

1231
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:18,719
yeah you can go to spain and they're

1232
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:21,039
sitting on five gallon buckets full of

1233
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:22,719
seeds they'll sell you all day long um

1234
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:24,880
just big old totes you can buy them by

1235
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:26,719
the tens of thousands

1236
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,559
are they really what they are or are

1237
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:30,559
they something different you know it's

1238
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:32,639
hard to say and i think that's kind of

1239
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:34,159
what crushed them a little bit was

1240
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:35,598
once they went to that model they kind

1241
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:36,639
of lost control of what they were

1242
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:38,960
actually

1243
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:41,679
getting back in seat for

1244
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,599
yeah definitely i think i saw a post a

1245
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:45,279
few months back i i wish i remember who

1246
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:47,359
it was because if you're not familiar

1247
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:49,519
with this post it would totally allow us

1248
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:51,279
to go look at it but basically

1249
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:52,800
someone in the community

1250
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,480
um

1251
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,480
posted that they had a plan they were

1252
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,760
calling kush for

1253
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,639
and they were saying that it was one of

1254
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:03,839
the supposed parents of the original

1255
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:05,358
hindu kush offered by sensei and it just

1256
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:06,960
got me thinking like

1257
00:43:05,358 --> 00:43:08,880
do you think it's even possible that

1258
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,000
like a parent that like scentsy was

1259
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,280
breeding with do you think like

1260
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,199
realistically it's possible that a

1261
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,359
parent like that is even around anymore

1262
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:16,879
or is not the whole implied point of the

1263
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:18,719
last question that like those parents

1264
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,318
are gone

1265
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:22,719
yeah those parents are gone i think

1266
00:43:20,318 --> 00:43:24,880
there was a couple of raids in between

1267
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:27,759
those and i think that a lot of them got

1268
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,720
cut down by little boys in blue kind of

1269
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,160
thing

1270
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:31,199
so

1271
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:32,799
you know

1272
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:34,719
a lot of people that's that all of a

1273
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,519
sudden reappear and say oh i still have

1274
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:36,959
this

1275
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:38,400
do you really

1276
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,358
um

1277
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,358
you know

1278
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:43,039
we'll never really know because

1279
00:43:41,358 --> 00:43:45,358
everybody's opinion is always changing

1280
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:46,239
and you always have new reference points

1281
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:49,920
so

1282
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:51,279
is it the same is it not hard to say

1283
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,440
yeah interesting

1284
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,480
so if we kind of fast forward to today's

1285
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,000
scene

1286
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,719
i feel like it's categorized

1287
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,639
predominantly by like a terpene or like

1288
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:02,879
a flavor emphasis

1289
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:04,400
in this modern era would you agree or do

1290
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,960
you feel like it's still predominantly a

1291
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,960
potency emphasis

1292
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,519
um within connoisseurs it's definitely

1293
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,599
terpenes within uh the market cells it's

1294
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:16,400
potency

1295
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:19,440
okay so like with that being said

1296
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,880
how do you feel the cbd is going to work

1297
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,480
considering that

1298
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,720
you know there is this emphasis on

1299
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:27,280
potency and cbd strains generally

1300
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:29,358
speaking uh kind of lacking in that

1301
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:31,040
do you feel like cbd is on the way out

1302
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:33,358
so to speak

1303
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:34,800
um i think cbd is on its way out but not

1304
00:44:33,358 --> 00:44:36,960
because of that reason

1305
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:39,200
um i have some friends that do some

1306
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:45,280
fantastic cbd work they're all the way

1307
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:47,519
up to 25 20 6 25 to 26 cbd with no thc

1308
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,599
and then flavors of all the rainbow

1309
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:51,280
skunks fruits

1310
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:53,440
lemons oranges

1311
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:55,119
whatever you want um

1312
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,358
but there's other things on the horizon

1313
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:58,640
that i feel that are going to interrupt

1314
00:44:57,358 --> 00:45:00,078
the cbd

1315
00:44:58,639 --> 00:45:01,679
program

1316
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:03,440
would you care to shine a little light

1317
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:05,598
on those things

1318
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,440
absolutely recently here in america cbd

1319
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:08,559
was taken off of

1320
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:12,480
scheduling

1321
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:15,838
and now has received a fda approval

1322
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,760
for a specific pharmaceutical company

1323
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:21,279
and they're going to now they can sell

1324
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:22,319
you cbd direct derived from plants

1325
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,800
um

1326
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:26,880
prescription wise through your doctor

1327
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,880
um they're still talking about it and if

1328
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:31,039
insurance will cover it or not

1329
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:33,200
but most likely it will

1330
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:35,519
and they're going to gouge people

1331
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:39,199
and uh yeah but now it's going to be

1332
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:41,358
legal and controlled by them

1333
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:43,118
wow okay and so you think that yeah just

1334
00:45:41,358 --> 00:45:45,119
controlling interest will

1335
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:47,680
try to implement some legal changes so

1336
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:49,280
that it's just not being produced

1337
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:52,000
outside of them

1338
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:53,359
absolutely um what i would be concerned

1339
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,719
with is

1340
00:45:53,358 --> 00:45:57,199
if all of a sudden they came back and

1341
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:59,598
made it the schedule two which schedule

1342
00:45:57,199 --> 00:46:01,838
twos can only be made by pharmaceutical

1343
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:04,400
companies

1344
00:46:01,838 --> 00:46:05,119
that would take care of it right there

1345
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,039
so

1346
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:08,079
interesting and do you feel like that

1347
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:10,000
would just

1348
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:13,039
also be a stepping stone to then do the

1349
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:16,719
same with thc afterwards

1350
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:16,719
um no um

1351
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,200
you know i

1352
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,200
i don't think i don't think it's going

1353
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:24,639
to happen with thc

1354
00:46:23,199 --> 00:46:28,000
um

1355
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:30,318
too many people like smoking the flowers

1356
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,239
and the concentrates just freshly

1357
00:46:30,318 --> 00:46:34,000
derived

1358
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:36,639
but

1359
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,838
you know cbd most cbd is taken in pill

1360
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:39,838
form tincture form

1361
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,079
so

1362
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,760
it's a little bit different

1363
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:48,318
yeah i guess it kind of lends itself to

1364
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,920
the pharmaceutical model a little more

1365
00:46:48,318 --> 00:46:51,519
right absolutely because it's an

1366
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,920
isolated molecule

1367
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:55,358
right the bad part is is that we

1368
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,800
nowadays you know we've known for a

1369
00:46:55,358 --> 00:47:00,400
while that you need cbd along with thc

1370
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,200
so they're still going to be depriving

1371
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:05,680
their patients of what they truly need

1372
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:07,199
yeah yeah and you know we all know the

1373
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:09,039
same is true for the opposite end of the

1374
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:12,559
spectrum with the whole drogono thing in

1375
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:14,639
the pure thc that was no good either

1376
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:16,318
right absolutely not

1377
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:18,559
interesting so i mean if we're on the

1378
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:21,199
topic of uh interesting cannabinoid

1379
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:23,838
profiles i had a nice little question

1380
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:26,480
for this one

1381
00:47:23,838 --> 00:47:28,078
worked with like some cbd lines before

1382
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,440
notably the one that caught my eye was

1383
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:31,280
the kana su

1384
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,960
and um

1385
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,119
the the thing which i noticed about this

1386
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:37,119
is you crossed it with a thc male so

1387
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:39,039
you're going to end up with like a like

1388
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:41,358
you know a hybrid type of end product

1389
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:43,119
whereas some thc some cbd obviously

1390
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:45,679
there'd be some variation

1391
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:47,599
do you find that these lines in general

1392
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:49,440
fare well in the market or they're just

1393
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:52,559
really not received to the same degree

1394
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:55,679
that say a regular thc line is

1395
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:57,280
absolutely they uh do not they're not

1396
00:47:55,679 --> 00:47:59,919
they're not as marketable as a regular

1397
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:02,720
thc strain is even though the uh the one

1398
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:04,318
you're talking about is our canary

1399
00:48:02,719 --> 00:48:08,558
canna c by timeric

1400
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:11,039
and uh it tests two to one to one to two

1401
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:11,920
um cbd being first

1402
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:13,440
um

1403
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:15,599
but uh

1404
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,119
you know it uh it added a whole lot of

1405
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:20,160
structure and

1406
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:23,039
bigger buds to the plant um canissu

1407
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:25,598
itself was pretty largely and lay out

1408
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:28,400
laid out didn't really stand up and grow

1409
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:30,480
grew fairly ugly in really small beds

1410
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,680
um so we hit it to our with our time

1411
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,800
rack mill

1412
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:36,719
that increases bud sizes adds

1413
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,760
strength within stem

1414
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:42,000
and uh potency so we really didn't know

1415
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:43,680
what to expect there but it wound up

1416
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,719
turning out all right we hit anywhere

1417
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:47,759
from

1418
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:49,439
13 14 cbd to

1419
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:53,599
you know

1420
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:55,599
half that and thc or vice versa you know

1421
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:58,000
that and thc with

1422
00:48:55,599 --> 00:49:00,960
four or five percent cbd

1423
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,880
so when you talk to your customers who

1424
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:04,880
grow out these crosses

1425
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,400
generally speaking what do you find is

1426
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,559
their preference in regards to the

1427
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,800
keeper phenos are they the more thc

1428
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:13,280
dominant phenos or the more cbd dominant

1429
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:16,800
phenos

1430
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:17,920
most of them are more cbd dominant

1431
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,559
and

1432
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:22,720
you know cbd is a unique counterweight

1433
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:24,559
that cannabinoid that

1434
00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:28,159
matures early

1435
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:30,880
so if it has too much thc just

1436
00:49:28,159 --> 00:49:34,399
pull it a little bit earlier um

1437
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:36,480
it'll still be higher cbd with lower thc

1438
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,760
so you know i explain that to them when

1439
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,199
they're when they're looking for the

1440
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:42,079
right ratio

1441
00:49:39,199 --> 00:49:42,960
of what's going to work best for them

1442
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:46,400
okay

1443
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:48,639
and so do you find that one thing i've

1444
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:51,358
heard is this complaint of a lot of cbd

1445
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:53,920
strains or the pure ones at least having

1446
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:56,239
this common denominator terpene profile

1447
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:58,400
which some would describe as cherry

1448
00:49:56,239 --> 00:50:01,039
have you found that yourself

1449
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,559
absolutely the old the old older cbds

1450
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:03,759
when you extract them they all taste

1451
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:05,680
like cherry

1452
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:08,640
um and that's how you know is always

1453
00:50:05,679 --> 00:50:11,358
well known that you were hitting cbd

1454
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:12,558
um nowadays i would you know but they're

1455
00:50:11,358 --> 00:50:13,759
all hybrids

1456
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:16,160
you know we've hit them with other

1457
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:18,640
things and then outcross them back and

1458
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:20,799
you know just to pull

1459
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:23,118
certain terpene profiles

1460
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:26,318
um to to get to the fire to where people

1461
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:28,800
hopefully would want to smoke the flower

1462
00:50:26,318 --> 00:50:31,119
yeah okay and so this idea i've been

1463
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,240
kicking around for a while it you know

1464
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:35,119
i don't think it's right or wrong it's

1465
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:37,598
just an interesting idea is like

1466
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:39,519
embedding kind of a little bit of cbd in

1467
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:41,680
the back of what we would regard as

1468
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:42,960
regular strains so there are a lot of

1469
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:44,318
strains out there which do this where

1470
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,318
you know maybe there's like two two and

1471
00:50:44,318 --> 00:50:47,759
a half three percent cbd you know it's

1472
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:49,838
just kind of like you know hiding in the

1473
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:52,720
background but enough to actually do

1474
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:54,960
something and the idea is like

1475
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:56,799
you can subconsciously you know get some

1476
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,240
of those benefits into people without

1477
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,839
them knowing and then hopefully

1478
00:50:58,239 --> 00:51:01,519
eventually people start to give it a bit

1479
00:50:59,838 --> 00:51:02,960
more credence what do you think about

1480
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:04,719
that idea do you think like could ever

1481
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:07,199
possibly work or there's just maybe some

1482
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:09,358
issues with it

1483
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:11,439
yeah i know it could possibly work um

1484
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:14,239
obviously i i definitely agree the more

1485
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:17,119
cannabinoids and terpenes you have the

1486
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:18,799
more effective all the medicine is um it

1487
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:20,838
really just comes down to what works

1488
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:23,760
best for you

1489
00:51:20,838 --> 00:51:26,480
um you know that's the great thing about

1490
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:28,640
cannabis is it's so diverse that you

1491
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,159
eventually you'll find one

1492
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:31,838
but you know

1493
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:33,598
um

1494
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:35,358
i don't know how

1495
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:39,440
i don't know if that's enough to get

1496
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:40,239
people to want to try cbd more or not

1497
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,039
okay

1498
00:51:40,239 --> 00:51:42,558
so

1499
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:45,119
do you think that some of these more

1500
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:47,040
rare terpene profiles are the way of the

1501
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:50,480
future i remember reading in some of

1502
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:52,000
your strains you're getting cbg and cbc

1503
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,159
showing up you know some of these more

1504
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,519
kind of exotic ones do you think that

1505
00:51:54,159 --> 00:51:57,598
that is the way of the future or it's

1506
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:58,960
just kind of like a cool tibbet that's

1507
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:01,039
probably going to go by and we won't

1508
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:03,760
talk too much about it

1509
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:06,079
yeah no i think that uh

1510
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,760
rare cannabinoids is definitely going to

1511
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:11,760
be a big thing coming up

1512
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:14,160
um one that we're working with is thcv

1513
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:16,720
and the cbc

1514
00:52:14,159 --> 00:52:18,719
our quantum kush we find good amounts of

1515
00:52:16,719 --> 00:52:20,078
that both of those in it

1516
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:22,078
um

1517
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:23,359
what i consider good amounts is two

1518
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:25,119
percent plus

1519
00:52:23,358 --> 00:52:27,039
um the highest we've seen so far is

1520
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:29,039
three percent we see a lot

1521
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:30,880
below two percent in between that two to

1522
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:32,400
three percent we see quite a bit as far

1523
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,480
as ghcv

1524
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:37,358
um cbc

1525
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:39,838
um one percent one and a half percent is

1526
00:52:37,358 --> 00:52:43,440
pretty much the highest that i've seen

1527
00:52:39,838 --> 00:52:45,519
but with the new technologies we have

1528
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,559
it makes it a lot easier

1529
00:52:45,519 --> 00:52:48,000
to

1530
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:50,079
know if it's

1531
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:53,039
transferring in the crosses the way we

1532
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:54,318
want it to or if it's not

1533
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:56,558
yeah okay

1534
00:52:54,318 --> 00:52:58,318
so i think some of this curiosity

1535
00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:00,000
stemmed initially from reading some of

1536
00:52:58,318 --> 00:53:02,239
the information around tardis

1537
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,239
specifically where it said there's been

1538
00:53:02,239 --> 00:53:06,558
some you know research indicating that

1539
00:53:04,239 --> 00:53:08,959
some of the profile of the cannabinoids

1540
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:10,960
has got tumor fighting properties

1541
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:13,358
was this like something you guys looked

1542
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:16,639
into a lot or is it just kind of like a

1543
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:16,639
peripheral thing you noted

1544
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,240
just kind of more of a peripheral thing

1545
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,839
we noted um

1546
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:23,759
i was fortunate enough to work with a

1547
00:53:21,838 --> 00:53:25,199
really good lab in oregon for a long

1548
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,720
time and they worked with me and

1549
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:29,439
educated me a lot

1550
00:53:26,719 --> 00:53:31,118
on what we had um

1551
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:33,838
and kind of explained to us you know how

1552
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:35,519
our how special some of our crosses were

1553
00:53:33,838 --> 00:53:38,078
so the witch intrigue just to figure out

1554
00:53:35,519 --> 00:53:40,159
well what's bringing those to the table

1555
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:42,800
so which intrigued us to more testing

1556
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:44,558
and more learning and so you know we've

1557
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,640
i followed them a lot i have several

1558
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:49,119
years worth of lab results

1559
00:53:46,639 --> 00:53:52,239
um on a lot of our strains full terpene

1560
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:54,160
profiles and full cannabinoid profiles

1561
00:53:52,239 --> 00:53:57,439
all from the same lab

1562
00:53:54,159 --> 00:53:58,879
um and uh it definitely has helped a lot

1563
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,599
i think now

1564
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:04,079
if we can find a genoming

1565
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:06,480
one that works well um that could even

1566
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:09,440
help even more

1567
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:11,760
how do you feel about phylus

1568
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:13,760
you know so philos i've been involved

1569
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,640
with them for a long time sonny chiba

1570
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,599
and i

1571
00:54:14,639 --> 00:54:18,480
um

1572
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:20,318
worked on the uh the seed laws in oregon

1573
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,480
when we went recreational

1574
00:54:20,318 --> 00:54:24,079
and we met um

1575
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:26,719
we were introduced to phytos at that

1576
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:29,440
point in time um so i've dealt with maui

1577
00:54:26,719 --> 00:54:31,279
for quite some time um

1578
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:33,760
i have several of our strains in there

1579
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:35,519
um they wanted us to put in specific

1580
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:37,040
phenotypes and i'm like no i'm gonna put

1581
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:38,639
in moms and dads

1582
00:54:37,039 --> 00:54:41,358
that way any of our crosses can be

1583
00:54:38,639 --> 00:54:43,118
traced right back to the mom and dad

1584
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:44,239
so that's what we did

1585
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:45,838
so our

1586
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:50,239
all of our males and most of our

1587
00:54:45,838 --> 00:54:50,239
breeding moms are in the fido's library

1588
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:55,119
and we did that a while ago um as i said

1589
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:56,960
we've been talking with them and

1590
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:59,519
whatnots quite a bit

1591
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:01,358
um so yeah you know i don't know

1592
00:54:59,519 --> 00:55:03,440
the information that they give you is

1593
00:55:01,358 --> 00:55:06,078
kind of

1594
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:08,159
not really clear

1595
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:10,880
yeah okay so a common feedback i've

1596
00:55:08,159 --> 00:55:13,358
heard is that there is this kind of

1597
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:15,440
there's a degree of hard to operate

1598
00:55:13,358 --> 00:55:17,358
within the universe and how to like

1599
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:19,358
actually understand things

1600
00:55:17,358 --> 00:55:20,880
do you feel like that is something they

1601
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:22,480
should really be focusing on trying to

1602
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,160
improve or do you think that it's just

1603
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,838
like a learning curve people need to

1604
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:26,798
adapt to

1605
00:55:25,838 --> 00:55:28,558
well

1606
00:55:26,798 --> 00:55:30,880
so what they're doing is they're doing a

1607
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:33,119
short path so from my understanding i'm

1608
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:34,960
not i'm not a big science guy i'm not

1609
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:37,358
good with big words but uh

1610
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:39,440
um they're doing a short path technique

1611
00:55:37,358 --> 00:55:40,960
which is just breaking it down pretty

1612
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,880
basically and there's a long path

1613
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:45,358
technique which i know there's a company

1614
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:47,358
out of colorado working with um they ran

1615
00:55:45,358 --> 00:55:48,798
a few of our strains they actually were

1616
00:55:47,358 --> 00:55:50,239
the ones that informed me that in our

1617
00:55:48,798 --> 00:55:51,838
quantum kush

1618
00:55:50,239 --> 00:55:53,838
we have um

1619
00:55:51,838 --> 00:55:56,318
russian rudorelli

1620
00:55:53,838 --> 00:55:57,119
or russian him sorry russian hymn

1621
00:55:56,318 --> 00:56:00,079
which

1622
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:01,519
um provided apparently in this in this

1623
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:03,440
specifics you know

1624
00:56:01,519 --> 00:56:05,440
russet might resistance

1625
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:07,358
uh they found this planet that didn't

1626
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,720
seem to have hardly any rusted lights on

1627
00:56:07,358 --> 00:56:10,639
it when everything else was infected

1628
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:12,239
really bad turned out to be a quantum

1629
00:56:10,639 --> 00:56:14,480
coach so they went ahead and ran a long

1630
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:16,558
path on it and found out that it had

1631
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:18,400
russian hip in its lineage

1632
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:19,839
so that was kind of the conclusion that

1633
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:22,400
they came to

1634
00:56:19,838 --> 00:56:23,838
but i think that there's definitely ones

1635
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,599
certain ways that they could get us the

1636
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:27,920
information that we need

1637
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:30,480
and i just don't know that phylos is

1638
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:33,599
doing that for us

1639
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:36,719
yeah so a lot of people are

1640
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:39,200
kind of a bit skeptical of the idea that

1641
00:56:36,719 --> 00:56:41,838
by getting your samples done at fire

1642
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:43,679
loss they're now you know kind of in the

1643
00:56:41,838 --> 00:56:44,400
open domain you don't have to worry

1644
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:46,719
about

1645
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,639
things in a legal sense as much do you

1646
00:56:46,719 --> 00:56:50,719
believe that is the case because i find

1647
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:52,400
it still hard to get a clear answer on

1648
00:56:50,719 --> 00:56:54,639
this

1649
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:56,160
well so

1650
00:56:54,639 --> 00:56:58,960
there's some people out there already

1651
00:56:56,159 --> 00:57:01,598
that they did some utility patents and

1652
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:04,000
they got them and they cover such a wide

1653
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:06,318
array wide array

1654
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,798
of cannabinoid and terpene or

1655
00:57:06,318 --> 00:57:12,079
cannabinoid and terpene profile

1656
00:57:08,798 --> 00:57:13,838
that it covers a lot

1657
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:16,318
so

1658
00:57:13,838 --> 00:57:18,400
to protect us from people patenting

1659
00:57:16,318 --> 00:57:20,558
plants first off it's kind of hard to

1660
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:22,480
patent a plant

1661
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:24,559
because there's so much variety in it

1662
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:27,119
even in ibl's when i pop

1663
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:29,920
seeds of ibl's there's still varieties

1664
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:31,920
in it um

1665
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:33,838
you know so there's an issue there but

1666
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,960
with crispr systems coming and stuff

1667
00:57:33,838 --> 00:57:38,159
like that

1668
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:41,039
you know it's possible to do it all

1669
00:57:38,159 --> 00:57:42,960
but will it protect us in the future i

1670
00:57:41,039 --> 00:57:44,159
hope so kind of

1671
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:46,720
you know

1672
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:47,920
um but does that include like offspring

1673
00:57:46,719 --> 00:57:50,078
from said

1674
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:51,920
what's in the galaxy or is that you know

1675
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:53,119
does all the sudden offspring now become

1676
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:54,159
open

1677
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:56,240
when you shouldn't have made that

1678
00:57:54,159 --> 00:57:58,399
without this to begin with i don't know

1679
00:57:56,239 --> 00:58:00,159
how all that works

1680
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:02,400
yeah okay

1681
00:58:00,159 --> 00:58:05,039
let's just loop back for one second you

1682
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:07,039
mentioned the russian hemp does that not

1683
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:08,798
kind of have something to be said for

1684
00:58:07,039 --> 00:58:10,719
the reuteralis genetics and how

1685
00:58:08,798 --> 00:58:12,798
sometimes they're just brushed to the

1686
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:15,039
side

1687
00:58:12,798 --> 00:58:17,519
yeah you know i think um obviously

1688
00:58:15,039 --> 00:58:19,759
everything has a good purpose to it and

1689
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:22,079
it will as a land race will create

1690
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:23,760
resistance to whatever the pest is and

1691
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,359
continue to survive

1692
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,680
it's a weed

1693
00:58:25,358 --> 00:58:30,639
we do still have to remember that

1694
00:58:27,679 --> 00:58:32,159
and uh it definitely adapts very quickly

1695
00:58:30,639 --> 00:58:33,920
so i think that uh

1696
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:35,199
there's most likely some traits there

1697
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,559
that are good

1698
00:58:35,199 --> 00:58:38,000
um

1699
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:41,040
i just know that

1700
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,079
on actual rear ellis coming up out it's

1701
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:46,159
very

1702
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:46,160
it's like headache from my understanding

1703
00:58:46,239 --> 00:58:50,239
yeah well i mean have you heard of any

1704
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,680
of the more modern companies doing it i

1705
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:54,159
mean some of them are certainly getting

1706
00:58:51,679 --> 00:58:56,960
really good reviews

1707
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:58,399
oh yeah no um i hope i say this right

1708
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,079
with manchester

1709
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:03,039
um genetics

1710
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:04,640
they kill it um you know there's

1711
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:07,679
definitely a few companies out there the

1712
00:59:04,639 --> 00:59:08,879
autoflower game is doing fantastic

1713
00:59:07,679 --> 00:59:11,440
um

1714
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:12,720
a lot of people still it's a huge market

1715
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,798
you know a lot of people that's what

1716
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:16,798
they prefer

1717
00:59:14,798 --> 00:59:17,519
yeah definitely

1718
00:59:16,798 --> 00:59:20,000
so

1719
00:59:17,519 --> 00:59:22,159
in terms of photo period we'll jump off

1720
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:25,760
the autos for a sec

1721
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:29,358
i uh i want to know what do you think is

1722
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:33,640
the absolute longest photo period strain

1723
00:59:29,358 --> 00:59:33,639
that would be commercially viable

1724
00:59:34,798 --> 00:59:39,119
um

1725
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:41,439
you know i think if you're commercially

1726
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:44,960
if you're pushing 11 to 12 weeks

1727
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:47,280
you you're kind of you're kind of there

1728
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:50,480
is that more what you're asking is

1729
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:53,119
what flower time or yeah yeah definitely

1730
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:56,960
yeah um i think that uh

1731
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:56,960
you know and that's where you come into

1732
00:59:57,199 --> 01:00:01,279
the market you know

1733
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:04,720
um

1734
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:06,559
it will so a company that can put out

1735
01:00:04,719 --> 01:00:07,358
strains in an eight-week cycle is going

1736
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:10,319
to get

1737
01:00:07,358 --> 01:00:12,239
six cycles per year right so

1738
01:00:10,318 --> 01:00:14,159
um and a company that's doing them every

1739
01:00:12,239 --> 01:00:16,000
12 weeks is only going to get three and

1740
01:00:14,159 --> 01:00:18,639
three and a half cycles a year

1741
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,559
so somewhere it has to equal out to pay

1742
01:00:18,639 --> 01:00:21,920
all the bills because no matter what you

1743
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:24,240
ain't growing for free and you're paying

1744
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:24,240
a lot

1745
01:00:24,318 --> 01:00:27,279
so

1746
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:30,159
if the market will allow it

1747
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:31,760
i can see it going longer

1748
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:34,798
but it really kind of depends on what

1749
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,799
the market demands

1750
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:41,159
and so what do you predict to be the

1751
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:41,159
next big thing the market demands

1752
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:46,879
yeah that

1753
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:48,719
is changing so rapidly right now that's

1754
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:51,280
that's a loading question

1755
01:00:48,719 --> 01:00:53,598
um there's

1756
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,880
it's really hard to say you know it's so

1757
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:56,960
it's so

1758
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,400
i hate to say a bit more and less

1759
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:00,318
unstable

1760
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:02,480
of what how things are going and what's

1761
01:01:00,318 --> 01:01:04,000
going to happen next and you know here

1762
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:06,639
in california

1763
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,559
medical goes away in january

1764
01:01:06,639 --> 01:01:10,400
they lose their 2 15.

1765
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:11,519
so how is that going to affect the

1766
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,720
market

1767
01:01:11,519 --> 01:01:14,480
um

1768
01:01:12,719 --> 01:01:16,798
we don't know yet it's hard to say it's

1769
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:18,559
kind of hard to predict that

1770
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:20,559
i think that uh

1771
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:22,000
eight nine weeks is kind of where the

1772
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:23,200
market's gonna have to stay to be

1773
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,480
competitive

1774
01:01:23,199 --> 01:01:26,480
at least on a large scale

1775
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:31,440
so do you think then that if something

1776
01:01:29,199 --> 01:01:33,838
as in maybe a strain

1777
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:36,880
would come in and be that next game

1778
01:01:33,838 --> 01:01:38,798
change or slash paradigm shift it would

1779
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:41,358
essentially be confined to those

1780
01:01:38,798 --> 01:01:43,440
flowering times

1781
01:01:41,358 --> 01:01:45,358
uh yeah i don't know you know there's

1782
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:47,760
always a new hype strength

1783
01:01:45,358 --> 01:01:47,759
um

1784
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:51,760
who's gonna have the next big best

1785
01:01:49,838 --> 01:01:54,000
biggest thing hard to say

1786
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:56,160
it could be anybody

1787
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,559
so do you feel like the market is still

1788
01:01:56,159 --> 01:02:00,159
dominated by numbers in regards to

1789
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:02,079
percentages or do you think that that's

1790
01:02:00,159 --> 01:02:04,838
kind of fallen off of it

1791
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:06,960
yeah no it's definitely still still by

1792
01:02:04,838 --> 01:02:09,199
percentages all day long

1793
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:11,039
people walk in what's the strongest

1794
01:02:09,199 --> 01:02:13,038
every shop owner i know will

1795
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:15,280
tell you that

1796
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:17,119
so i've spoken to a few readers in the

1797
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:18,160
past and they said if they make some

1798
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:20,000
stuff

1799
01:02:18,159 --> 01:02:23,358
generally even if they love it if it's

1800
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:24,880
not tested above say 20 22

1801
01:02:23,358 --> 01:02:26,239
they're just not even going to consider

1802
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:28,720
it for release

1803
01:02:26,239 --> 01:02:30,078
do you sit in the same boat

1804
01:02:28,719 --> 01:02:32,399
uh yeah i know and that's where the

1805
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:33,119
market is absolutely 100 if you if

1806
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:35,599
you're

1807
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:37,519
pushing strains out that are below 20

1808
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:39,838
percent they're going to sit on a shelf

1809
01:02:37,519 --> 01:02:43,199
for a while

1810
01:02:39,838 --> 01:02:45,199
that's going to be all concentrates

1811
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:46,639
yeah interesting and so are these the

1812
01:02:45,199 --> 01:02:48,078
type of things that are in the forefront

1813
01:02:46,639 --> 01:02:50,639
of your mind as a breeder or are you

1814
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:53,200
more considering other attributes like

1815
01:02:50,639 --> 01:02:55,279
flavor and things like that

1816
01:02:53,199 --> 01:02:58,000
i don't concern myself with all that

1817
01:02:55,280 --> 01:03:00,000
i've always been about you know

1818
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:02,079
more medicinal effect and flavors you

1819
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,920
know kind of what we like um what

1820
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:06,160
everybody else likes what we like really

1821
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:08,559
doesn't matter as much but

1822
01:03:06,159 --> 01:03:09,519
what everybody else likes and

1823
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:11,519
um

1824
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:14,000
yeah is kind of where we go

1825
01:03:11,519 --> 01:03:16,000
the you know the hype thing is cool and

1826
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,519
all but yeah we don't do a lot of work

1827
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,039
with a lot of the new hype strains or

1828
01:03:17,519 --> 01:03:20,798
anything to that effect

1829
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:22,880
just because of that

1830
01:03:20,798 --> 01:03:26,079
um

1831
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:29,039
really not into that hype thing

1832
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:30,880
yeah okay so what does it take for you

1833
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:32,720
to bring a new clone into the library

1834
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:34,798
then

1835
01:03:32,719 --> 01:03:36,959
uh normally it has to be an old cut that

1836
01:03:34,798 --> 01:03:38,719
i've been looking for

1837
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:41,039
at this point in time i've got pretty

1838
01:03:38,719 --> 01:03:44,879
much what i want to play with and now

1839
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:46,720
it's just reworking itself upon itself

1840
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:48,400
so it begs the question are there any

1841
01:03:46,719 --> 01:03:49,838
old school cuts you would love to get

1842
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:52,079
but you just don't think they're around

1843
01:03:49,838 --> 01:03:54,159
anymore

1844
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:56,318
yeah obviously the road cap

1845
01:03:54,159 --> 01:03:58,399
or whatever you know as we discussed

1846
01:03:56,318 --> 01:04:00,159
before whatever that may have been

1847
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:01,200
um

1848
01:04:00,159 --> 01:04:03,519
yeah you know

1849
01:04:01,199 --> 01:04:05,118
i'm privileged enough to where

1850
01:04:03,519 --> 01:04:07,519
most the breeders

1851
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:10,480
i can ask them and get access to pretty

1852
01:04:07,519 --> 01:04:10,480
much whatever i want

1853
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:16,880
so

1854
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:18,480
you know um having that accessibility

1855
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:20,400
um

1856
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:21,280
frees it up a little bit to allow us to

1857
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,160
uh

1858
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,839
you know

1859
01:04:22,159 --> 01:04:25,519
play a little bit more

1860
01:04:23,838 --> 01:04:27,358
like i said we have a lot of classes

1861
01:04:25,519 --> 01:04:29,119
that we've done and have not released

1862
01:04:27,358 --> 01:04:31,119
um just because

1863
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:32,880
they were we felt they were really good

1864
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:34,880
too good that we didn't want to release

1865
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:36,559
them or obviously they weren't good

1866
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:38,559
enough but

1867
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:40,720
yeah access to cuts for us is pretty

1868
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:41,519
easy fortunately enough

1869
01:04:40,719 --> 01:04:43,838
so

1870
01:04:41,519 --> 01:04:45,358
i'd have to say not really

1871
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:46,880
yeah okay sounds like you're a very

1872
01:04:45,358 --> 01:04:49,199
lucky man

1873
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:51,280
yeah i i definitely consider myself that

1874
01:04:49,199 --> 01:04:53,679
to be absolutely

1875
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:55,760
so my last little question in regards to

1876
01:04:53,679 --> 01:04:57,358
testing and things around that nature is

1877
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:59,760
have you ever considered or do you

1878
01:04:57,358 --> 01:05:02,159
currently engage in you know some of

1879
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:03,920
those like um kits which like are now

1880
01:05:02,159 --> 01:05:05,920
offered by the labs in regards to early

1881
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:07,838
cannabinoid profile testing and early

1882
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:09,440
sex testing and things like that or you

1883
01:05:07,838 --> 01:05:11,358
just old school

1884
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:13,440
definitely don't do the sex testing i'm

1885
01:05:11,358 --> 01:05:15,358
super old school with that the plant's

1886
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:17,200
going to tell you in a few weeks just

1887
01:05:15,358 --> 01:05:18,639
chill

1888
01:05:17,199 --> 01:05:20,639
and

1889
01:05:18,639 --> 01:05:22,400
as far as

1890
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:24,078
cannabinoid ratios and stuff like that's

1891
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:26,160
more for cbd guys

1892
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:27,839
um you know

1893
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:30,159
as i mentioned before my buddy too and

1894
01:05:27,838 --> 01:05:33,119
then my other friend adam jocks

1895
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:34,798
they both use those and it allows them

1896
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:37,119
to cruise through their stock really

1897
01:05:34,798 --> 01:05:39,038
fast but they're popping thousands of

1898
01:05:37,119 --> 01:05:41,599
seeds you know so

1899
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:43,520
i can see where that's helpful

1900
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:45,200
um

1901
01:05:43,519 --> 01:05:46,639
we're doing thousands of seeds as well

1902
01:05:45,199 --> 01:05:49,279
but i'm fairly old school with that i

1903
01:05:46,639 --> 01:05:51,279
like to see what it does

1904
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:53,359
yeah okay cool

1905
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:55,359
so i mean you mentioned crisp and

1906
01:05:53,358 --> 01:05:57,920
crispers some cool technology you know

1907
01:05:55,358 --> 01:06:00,000
kind of can hint to the past of some

1908
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:01,519
things but one thing it's not going to

1909
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,679
tell us is

1910
01:06:01,519 --> 01:06:06,559
who picked that time wreck mail was it

1911
01:06:03,679 --> 01:06:08,639
your sub cool but before we get into it

1912
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:10,319
let's go back how did you first meet sub

1913
01:06:08,639 --> 01:06:10,960
we you knew it was coming let's get into

1914
01:06:10,318 --> 01:06:12,159
it

1915
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:14,480
yeah

1916
01:06:12,159 --> 01:06:16,078
so actually um i originally first met

1917
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:18,079
dioxide

1918
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:21,039
he was manager

1919
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:22,559
at a growth store where i lived um

1920
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:24,319
the first time that i met subcool

1921
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:26,319
dioxide brought him out to my house to

1922
01:06:24,318 --> 01:06:27,519
see my oregon diesel in my backyard that

1923
01:06:26,318 --> 01:06:28,880
was done

1924
01:06:27,519 --> 01:06:31,599
in uh

1925
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:33,200
september first week of september

1926
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:35,280
um that was the first time he was ever

1927
01:06:33,199 --> 01:06:36,318
at my house i had never heard of tga

1928
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,640
before

1929
01:06:36,318 --> 01:06:40,639
dioxide or any of that

1930
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:42,558
but dioxide throughout the time that i

1931
01:06:40,639 --> 01:06:43,440
had met dioxide and before the sub came

1932
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:45,200
out

1933
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:46,720
had given me a lot of packs to pop and

1934
01:06:45,199 --> 01:06:49,279
we popped them all so when they came out

1935
01:06:46,719 --> 01:06:50,798
we had a room full of all their genetics

1936
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:52,798
in full flower

1937
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:54,239
um

1938
01:06:52,798 --> 01:06:56,960
yeah and that was the first time that i

1939
01:06:54,239 --> 01:06:56,959
met him so

1940
01:06:57,519 --> 01:07:02,079
after that you know their dioxide kind

1941
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:04,318
of talked to me and um

1942
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:06,880
we talked for a while about

1943
01:07:04,318 --> 01:07:09,519
him about us producing seeds on a larger

1944
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:10,559
scale and then distributing them for us

1945
01:07:09,519 --> 01:07:12,239
and we're like

1946
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:13,519
sounds like it could be fun sure let's

1947
01:07:12,239 --> 01:07:15,759
check it out

1948
01:07:13,519 --> 01:07:17,838
um so that's kind of how that history

1949
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:19,520
went one of the test restraints that we

1950
01:07:17,838 --> 01:07:23,119
did back then for them

1951
01:07:19,519 --> 01:07:24,719
was dioxide's creation of time wreck

1952
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:27,280
um

1953
01:07:24,719 --> 01:07:30,639
so even before i was obviously a tester

1954
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:32,480
um so we popped some my son donovan

1955
01:07:30,639 --> 01:07:34,318
found a male that he liked a lot

1956
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:36,079
the branching came up within a couple

1957
01:07:34,318 --> 01:07:37,599
inches from the top including the bottom

1958
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:40,000
branches all the branches that beautiful

1959
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:42,160
structure great smell

1960
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,639
we talked with dioxide if we could use

1961
01:07:42,159 --> 01:07:45,440
it for some crosses uh mushroom mouth

1962
01:07:44,639 --> 01:07:46,960
just

1963
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:48,639
described to him what he wanted to do

1964
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:50,318
and the line that he wanted to go

1965
01:07:48,639 --> 01:07:53,038
through and uh

1966
01:07:50,318 --> 01:07:54,239
doc says yeah absolutely not a problem

1967
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:56,000
so um

1968
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:58,000
that's kind of where we started with the

1969
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,440
doctor who and the quantum and the

1970
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,679
mickey

1971
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:04,720
the jtr mill actually came to us through

1972
01:08:01,679 --> 01:08:04,719
dioxide as well

1973
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:09,039
and that was to do some crosses we had

1974
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:10,960
the medicine woman

1975
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:13,119
which was a strain created by a

1976
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:15,039
gentleman there in oregon for his wife's

1977
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:17,600
fibromyalgia and he wanted us to cross

1978
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:18,880
the jack the ripper to the medicine

1979
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:21,520
woman

1980
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:22,480
so that was nurse jackie that was one of

1981
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:24,799
our

1982
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:25,919
first releases as well

1983
01:08:24,798 --> 01:08:27,439
um

1984
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:30,158
but yeah throughout that time we started

1985
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:32,079
doing cops started working with sub had

1986
01:08:30,158 --> 01:08:34,000
moved to california by that point in

1987
01:08:32,079 --> 01:08:35,439
time i never really hung out with them

1988
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,198
or talked with them much

1989
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:40,559
other than on the phone or whatever my

1990
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:43,678
main person with tga was dioxide

1991
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:45,839
um helped him with the soil company and

1992
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:46,960
you know a lot of that kind of stuff but

1993
01:08:45,838 --> 01:08:48,880
uh

1994
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:50,960
you know worked a lot of the cups my

1995
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:53,920
sons and i

1996
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:55,679
ran the booth for several years um set

1997
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:57,279
up we would i'd bring in a crew we would

1998
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:58,798
set up the booth and tear down the boots

1999
01:08:57,279 --> 01:09:00,400
and run the booth and

2000
01:08:58,798 --> 01:09:02,079
all that good stuff

2001
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:04,559
um those were back in the day good old

2002
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:06,238
days when heroes of the farm um

2003
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:08,719
joined in and he was making stuff with

2004
01:09:06,238 --> 01:09:09,838
dioxide as well and that was the heroes

2005
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:11,359
of the farm

2006
01:09:09,838 --> 01:09:12,399
collab thing

2007
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:14,798
um

2008
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:17,198
so once that got going then uh

2009
01:09:14,798 --> 01:09:18,880
pat's like

2010
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:20,559
hey do you mind if i use the time rack

2011
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:22,000
mill to do some crosses so i'm like yeah

2012
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:24,080
sure no problem

2013
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,838
so we worked out a collaboration and all

2014
01:09:24,079 --> 01:09:26,798
that kind of stuff and

2015
01:09:25,838 --> 01:09:28,158
um

2016
01:09:26,798 --> 01:09:30,719
he went ahead and used the time wrecked

2017
01:09:28,158 --> 01:09:32,798
mel and that's the locomotion and

2018
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:34,399
a few of those other ones right that's

2019
01:09:32,798 --> 01:09:35,439
our time wreck now

2020
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:37,599
um

2021
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:39,759
yeah so as far as the mail the time

2022
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:42,079
wreck mail yeah no it was not found by

2023
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:44,399
sub it was found by my son donovan and

2024
01:09:42,079 --> 01:09:46,640
it was while it was in testing mode

2025
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:48,719
we have we got permission we talked to

2026
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:51,920
dioxide about it beforehand

2027
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:53,359
and uh yeah everything was good gravy

2028
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:55,199
um and all that

2029
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:56,960
i know now that sub likes to claim that

2030
01:09:55,198 --> 01:09:58,799
he gave it to me

2031
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:01,119
and that he found it and all that good

2032
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:03,840
stuff but uh yeah that's far from the

2033
01:10:01,119 --> 01:10:03,840
truth unfortunately

2034
01:10:04,319 --> 01:10:08,799
why do you think he wants to take credit

2035
01:10:06,399 --> 01:10:08,799
for it

2036
01:10:09,039 --> 01:10:12,479
you know

2037
01:10:10,319 --> 01:10:14,479
i'm not really quite sure

2038
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:16,079
i would think you know as i explained

2039
01:10:14,479 --> 01:10:18,158
earlier with people using our genetics

2040
01:10:16,079 --> 01:10:20,158
for strength for

2041
01:10:18,158 --> 01:10:21,519
making stuff um i feel privileged and

2042
01:10:20,158 --> 01:10:23,920
honored about it if they mention it's

2043
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:25,360
cool if they don't cool either way they

2044
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:29,039
paid the money for the seed that i was

2045
01:10:25,359 --> 01:10:29,039
offering they bought their goods

2046
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:34,880
i think right now the biggest issue is

2047
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:34,880
that

2048
01:10:35,279 --> 01:10:39,039
he has uh got himself into some places

2049
01:10:37,359 --> 01:10:40,719
where he went bragging that they were

2050
01:10:39,039 --> 01:10:42,079
all his and he owned all this and he

2051
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:43,920
owned all that

2052
01:10:42,079 --> 01:10:45,439
when he doesn't he never grew that time

2053
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:46,319
wreck now he's never

2054
01:10:45,439 --> 01:10:48,639
seen

2055
01:10:46,319 --> 01:10:51,359
grown any of the stuff that we make

2056
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:53,920
um same with pat same with um heroes of

2057
01:10:51,359 --> 01:10:56,479
the farm same with jinx proof

2058
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:58,560
um you know there's there's been several

2059
01:10:56,479 --> 01:11:00,718
i hang out now with sunny chiba sunny

2060
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:03,440
chiba was the original person that

2061
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:05,039
helped miss jill bring sub cool to the

2062
01:11:03,439 --> 01:11:07,519
west coast

2063
01:11:05,039 --> 01:11:09,679
he's the one that created

2064
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:12,560
dope purple doja black tray black cherry

2065
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:14,800
soda lemon freeze this whole list goes

2066
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,679
on does he get credit for him very

2067
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:18,480
rarely

2068
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:20,399
now that miss jill and sub are separated

2069
01:11:18,479 --> 01:11:22,319
miss jill has actually come out and

2070
01:11:20,399 --> 01:11:24,399
explained a lot of the truths and i i

2071
01:11:22,319 --> 01:11:25,439
really i appreciate that and i love her

2072
01:11:24,399 --> 01:11:26,639
for that

2073
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:28,559
um

2074
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:30,079
at one point in time she was part of the

2075
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:31,679
issue but she's

2076
01:11:30,079 --> 01:11:34,238
changed and

2077
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:36,480
has you know come full circle as far as

2078
01:11:34,238 --> 01:11:39,119
i'm concerned as far as that goes

2079
01:11:36,479 --> 01:11:41,119
um i would give some more credit because

2080
01:11:39,119 --> 01:11:42,399
he is a great man he has done a lot for

2081
01:11:41,119 --> 01:11:44,960
the community

2082
01:11:42,399 --> 01:11:47,439
um and he did definitely help us in

2083
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:49,198
marketing and what not to that effect

2084
01:11:47,439 --> 01:11:52,158
but that was part of the agreement that

2085
01:11:49,198 --> 01:11:54,000
was part of the distribution agreement

2086
01:11:52,158 --> 01:11:54,960
that's why we put their names on the

2087
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,039
back

2088
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:58,880
of our covers you know we all have the

2089
01:11:57,039 --> 01:12:01,679
little tga little circle on the very

2090
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:03,039
back of our covers up in the top corner

2091
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:04,560
all of our names are on the front

2092
01:12:03,039 --> 01:12:06,880
they're all of our strengths

2093
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:09,280
so why he sits there and says that he

2094
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:11,279
claims the creation of all them and this

2095
01:12:09,279 --> 01:12:13,119
and that i really don't know it's the

2096
01:12:11,279 --> 01:12:15,679
same that he tells him tells people that

2097
01:12:13,119 --> 01:12:17,039
he taught me how to grow yeah my father

2098
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:19,279
heard that and was kind of like really

2099
01:12:17,039 --> 01:12:22,319
so he was around when you were 14.

2100
01:12:19,279 --> 01:12:24,000
he's like no he wasn't you know that but

2101
01:12:22,319 --> 01:12:25,359
at any rate people will believe what

2102
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,039
they want to believe and i'm okay with

2103
01:12:25,359 --> 01:12:29,279
that i don't try to defend it i don't

2104
01:12:27,039 --> 01:12:31,519
come out and talk a bunch of trash or

2105
01:12:29,279 --> 01:12:33,439
anything like that about subpool and i

2106
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:38,239
and i won't um

2107
01:12:33,439 --> 01:12:40,719
we had some issues and uh yeah um

2108
01:12:38,238 --> 01:12:42,479
that was it i you know

2109
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:45,039
so what was it ultimately which

2110
01:12:42,479 --> 01:12:46,718
catalyzed the decision for you to part

2111
01:12:45,039 --> 01:12:48,560
ways

2112
01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:50,399
so what it came down to is they brought

2113
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:52,800
in another group that was starting to

2114
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:54,319
run the cup they were extremely rude to

2115
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:56,880
me and my children

2116
01:12:54,319 --> 01:12:58,719
me and my boys um that have been running

2117
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:01,679
the shows for years

2118
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:03,520
um at uh the next show coming up was the

2119
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:05,520
denver show and i asked him i was like

2120
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:07,600
so i think for the denver show i'd just

2121
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:10,480
rather do my own booth

2122
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:11,360
and he freaked out i was like well you

2123
01:13:10,479 --> 01:13:12,718
know

2124
01:13:11,359 --> 01:13:14,399
this is what it comes down to is you

2125
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:16,079
have our seeds being sold all over the

2126
01:13:14,399 --> 01:13:18,158
place in other booths throughout the

2127
01:13:16,079 --> 01:13:20,079
show i don't see why it's a big deal

2128
01:13:18,158 --> 01:13:21,599
that i have our own booth and we sell

2129
01:13:20,079 --> 01:13:24,479
our own seats

2130
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:26,239
um he couldn't see it and i said okay

2131
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:29,039
well then that's it we're done

2132
01:13:26,238 --> 01:13:31,519
that's pretty much it

2133
01:13:29,039 --> 01:13:33,039
yeah i mean it seems pretty simple

2134
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:35,040
i mean you know we all have the same

2135
01:13:33,039 --> 01:13:36,560
agreement so

2136
01:13:35,039 --> 01:13:38,479
heroes of the farmer bring a set amount

2137
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:40,159
of seeds high green set amount of seeds

2138
01:13:38,479 --> 01:13:42,399
drinks perfectly set amount of seeds we

2139
01:13:40,158 --> 01:13:45,359
would sell all the seeds we'd split

2140
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:47,279
everything equally pay all the help

2141
01:13:45,359 --> 01:13:48,960
and go our separate ways after each show

2142
01:13:47,279 --> 01:13:50,238
after everything was covered

2143
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:53,920
um

2144
01:13:50,238 --> 01:13:56,879
you know i've i've heard ridiculous

2145
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:59,279
things come from him as far as like

2146
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:01,520
i paid him forty thousand dollars a show

2147
01:13:59,279 --> 01:14:04,158
to do this and he never paid me that we

2148
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:05,600
never made that we had one show in la

2149
01:14:04,158 --> 01:14:07,198
one year or

2150
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:08,880
san bernardino one year where we did

2151
01:14:07,198 --> 01:14:12,079
over forty thousand dollars

2152
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:14,239
only one and uh yeah i didn't get it all

2153
01:14:12,079 --> 01:14:15,840
but far from it but i mean i could sit

2154
01:14:14,238 --> 01:14:17,439
here and go on about a whole bunch of

2155
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:19,360
different stories but

2156
01:14:17,439 --> 01:14:21,198
what it comes down to is we definitely

2157
01:14:19,359 --> 01:14:23,279
just didn't see eye to eye on where i

2158
01:14:21,198 --> 01:14:24,399
wanted to go and what i wanted to do

2159
01:14:23,279 --> 01:14:26,559
and uh

2160
01:14:24,399 --> 01:14:28,879
she was unmoving and willing to move

2161
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:30,800
then compromise

2162
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:34,400
yeah it's interesting you made that

2163
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:36,239
comment um about sunny cheever's work a

2164
01:14:34,399 --> 01:14:37,920
sentiment we've heard in the past is

2165
01:14:36,238 --> 01:14:39,678
that you know some of the best work to

2166
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:42,239
ever come out of tga was from the

2167
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:44,640
canadian crew do you kind of echo that

2168
01:14:42,238 --> 01:14:44,639
sentiment

2169
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:47,520
um

2170
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:48,800
yeah i don't know what what work came

2171
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:50,080
out of the canadian crew because that

2172
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:51,119
was all in order

2173
01:14:50,079 --> 01:14:53,198
yeah i think i think they're pretty much

2174
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:55,198
just referring to sunny cheba

2175
01:14:53,198 --> 01:14:57,039
that's sonic it was oregon

2176
01:14:55,198 --> 01:14:58,879
oh there you go

2177
01:14:57,039 --> 01:15:01,519
so yeah it wasn't and it wasn't canadian

2178
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:03,920
at all he was there in portland oregon

2179
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:06,400
there you go and a final little thing i

2180
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:08,399
wanted to quickly ask you about this

2181
01:15:06,399 --> 01:15:09,599
dioxide's an interesting character to me

2182
01:15:08,399 --> 01:15:11,839
this is going to sound like a weird

2183
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:14,079
question but i had to ask it because i

2184
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:15,920
had always i i i'm familiar with him

2185
01:15:14,079 --> 01:15:17,760
through his involvement with um the

2186
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:20,000
chernobyl and i love it you know it's

2187
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:21,600
super energetic really gorgeous hi i

2188
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:23,920
love it i've got a really nice keeper i

2189
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:25,360
found and i can't remember who told me

2190
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:27,840
but someone was like oh man you should

2191
01:15:25,359 --> 01:15:29,599
meet dioxide like he's like real high

2192
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:31,119
energy like he makes weed like his

2193
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:32,400
personality

2194
01:15:31,119 --> 01:15:34,960
do you find that to be true or is that

2195
01:15:32,399 --> 01:15:37,119
just some random story i got told

2196
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:38,719
yeah you know he's pretty hyped up most

2197
01:15:37,119 --> 01:15:40,719
of the time he's pretty kick-back though

2198
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:43,520
he's fairly level-headed

2199
01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:45,198
um as far as i was concerned he

2200
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:46,640
definitely made the best strains that

2201
01:15:45,198 --> 01:15:49,359
tga offered

2202
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:51,360
as far as the tga company

2203
01:15:49,359 --> 01:15:53,039
him and sub as partners

2204
01:15:51,359 --> 01:15:55,119
um you know he's the one that found the

2205
01:15:53,039 --> 01:15:56,560
jtr male he uh

2206
01:15:55,119 --> 01:15:58,319
he made he

2207
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:02,320
i watched him go through a three-year

2208
01:15:58,319 --> 01:16:04,479
search of kush's before before he decies

2209
01:16:02,319 --> 01:16:07,840
before he decided to use the hell's og

2210
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:09,519
to make the jesus you know so i mean he

2211
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:10,400
was definitely really into what he was

2212
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:13,440
doing

2213
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:14,238
and he was really good at it um

2214
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:17,359
but

2215
01:16:14,238 --> 01:16:19,279
yeah as soon as it wasn't long after

2216
01:16:17,359 --> 01:16:22,079
him and subs split up

2217
01:16:19,279 --> 01:16:23,599
the sub and i split up as well

2218
01:16:22,079 --> 01:16:24,559
yeah okay

2219
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:26,640
so

2220
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:28,640
do you feel like it's a bit of a weird

2221
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:31,119
situation given that you do use that

2222
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:32,640
jack the riffer mail or you think like

2223
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:34,719
not really

2224
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:36,400
um actually we don't use it anymore we

2225
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:39,119
haven't used it for years

2226
01:16:36,399 --> 01:16:40,399
um we were the ones that gave it back to

2227
01:16:39,119 --> 01:16:42,479
so after

2228
01:16:40,399 --> 01:16:44,719
dioxide did all the breeding so after

2229
01:16:42,479 --> 01:16:46,718
dioxide and sub separated sub did not

2230
01:16:44,719 --> 01:16:49,039
have the jtr mountain

2231
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:51,439
so he had to hound me for it and how

2232
01:16:49,039 --> 01:16:52,880
many for it and i kept telling dachshund

2233
01:16:51,439 --> 01:16:55,519
i'm like hey man he's bugging me again

2234
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:57,600
for that jtr mill dioxide finally tells

2235
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:59,840
me he's like hey i put you in a really

2236
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:00,719
bad situation here go ahead and give it

2237
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:02,480
to him

2238
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:03,198
so it was at that point in time that i

2239
01:17:02,479 --> 01:17:05,919
took

2240
01:17:03,198 --> 01:17:06,960
the jtr mill back to sub

2241
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:09,359
um

2242
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:11,119
we read with it one more time after that

2243
01:17:09,359 --> 01:17:12,960
and that was it

2244
01:17:11,119 --> 01:17:14,559
i knew that our separations were coming

2245
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:16,640
and that was their mail that they had

2246
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:18,640
picked from their company so yeah i

2247
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:19,679
didn't want to use it that was theirs i

2248
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:22,480
get that

2249
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:25,760
um the time wreck yeah no we found that

2250
01:17:22,479 --> 01:17:27,919
we take claim to it it is ours

2251
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:29,679
made by a dioxide

2252
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:31,600
yeah for sure

2253
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:33,359
so final little question on the whole

2254
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:35,039
saga i've asked this to some other

2255
01:17:33,359 --> 01:17:36,479
people because this seems to be i'm not

2256
01:17:35,039 --> 01:17:38,158
going to say a common occurrence but

2257
01:17:36,479 --> 01:17:40,718
it's not you know these guys certainly

2258
01:17:38,158 --> 01:17:41,519
aren't the only example but

2259
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:43,760
you know

2260
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:46,239
do you feel like kind of in a sense you

2261
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:48,320
would like things to be you know cool

2262
01:17:46,238 --> 01:17:50,158
given that you know some of that work is

2263
01:17:48,319 --> 01:17:51,679
embedded within your own work even if

2264
01:17:50,158 --> 01:17:53,599
it's not a direct descendant it's kind

2265
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:55,279
of almost like a little bit of a

2266
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:57,199
tipping of the hat given that it is

2267
01:17:55,279 --> 01:17:58,800
embedded in there how do you feel about

2268
01:17:57,198 --> 01:18:00,399
that

2269
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:04,159
um i would not have i don't have a

2270
01:18:00,399 --> 01:18:07,198
problem given dioxide credit any day

2271
01:18:04,158 --> 01:18:10,158
yeah cool cool easy answer

2272
01:18:07,198 --> 01:18:12,719
yeah no absolutely easy

2273
01:18:10,158 --> 01:18:14,399
all sub is is a salesman

2274
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:17,279
he doesn't breed

2275
01:18:14,399 --> 01:18:19,519
um and yeah that's all there is to it he

2276
01:18:17,279 --> 01:18:21,840
may he did at one point in time

2277
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:24,560
but once he got to diox once dioxide

2278
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:26,400
came in that was it um after dioxide

2279
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:27,520
left he talked to me about doing all his

2280
01:18:26,399 --> 01:18:29,679
breeding

2281
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:30,960
and that didn't happen so he went to

2282
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:32,800
joel

2283
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:33,840
northstar genetics which is who makes it

2284
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:37,199
all now

2285
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:38,960
and uh i've been to joel's place so i

2286
01:18:37,198 --> 01:18:41,599
know what kind of reading he does there

2287
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:43,359
and when people sat there for the last

2288
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:45,440
three years after i left and come up to

2289
01:18:43,359 --> 01:18:47,679
me and say hey the seeds that i bought

2290
01:18:45,439 --> 01:18:49,919
from tga last year weren't what i had

2291
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:52,319
got the year before what happened i

2292
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:56,239
couldn't answer even though i know what

2293
01:18:52,319 --> 01:18:59,519
happened but i still wouldn't answer

2294
01:18:56,238 --> 01:19:01,359
and is that to do with like uh the issue

2295
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:04,000
that miss jewel was pointing out with

2296
01:19:01,359 --> 01:19:05,759
males being lost and replaced

2297
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,679
yeah no we learned about the males being

2298
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:10,159
lost same time they did they ran them

2299
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:12,480
through filos

2300
01:19:10,158 --> 01:19:14,719
yeah so when i spoke to sub about that

2301
01:19:12,479 --> 01:19:17,198
he said that what had happened was the

2302
01:19:14,719 --> 01:19:19,279
person who had sent the cuttings in made

2303
01:19:17,198 --> 01:19:20,639
a mistake and took five cuttings of the

2304
01:19:19,279 --> 01:19:23,679
same plant

2305
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:25,520
seemed like uh an interesting answer

2306
01:19:23,679 --> 01:19:27,199
though maybe a little hard to swallow

2307
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:30,000
what did you think

2308
01:19:27,198 --> 01:19:30,000
absolutely not

2309
01:19:30,319 --> 01:19:34,158
no um

2310
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:36,719
yeah that they don't

2311
01:19:34,158 --> 01:19:38,719
that just goes to show the kind of of of

2312
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:40,319
how they how he does everything he

2313
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:41,760
relies upon everybody else to do

2314
01:19:40,319 --> 01:19:43,920
everything

2315
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:45,520
so once something goes wrong it's a

2316
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:49,039
blame on somebody else

2317
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:50,800
it's never a fault that he ever made

2318
01:19:49,039 --> 01:19:53,119
yeah okay

2319
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:54,880
i um i had a good friend send me this

2320
01:19:53,119 --> 01:19:57,198
question to ask you so hopefully you're

2321
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:58,800
gonna have more idea about it than what

2322
01:19:57,198 --> 01:20:01,359
i do because i have no idea what this

2323
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:04,800
means at the moment but he said

2324
01:20:01,359 --> 01:20:07,920
um the time wreck he got from dioxide

2325
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:09,920
was it a female except only one branch

2326
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:13,199
that hermied

2327
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:14,880
so yeah actually absolutely so um

2328
01:20:13,198 --> 01:20:17,119
yeah the uh

2329
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:18,639
some of the genetics that uh that could

2330
01:20:17,119 --> 01:20:20,719
put out of there

2331
01:20:18,639 --> 01:20:23,039
have high height

2332
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:24,480
her mafidation results

2333
01:20:23,039 --> 01:20:27,600
um

2334
01:20:24,479 --> 01:20:29,439
so more or less if if just one branch

2335
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:31,520
did it though i would look more towards

2336
01:20:29,439 --> 01:20:32,799
a light leak of some sort around that

2337
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:34,960
branch

2338
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:37,440
but uh it is definitely possible they

2339
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:40,560
have some stuff that you know the the

2340
01:20:37,439 --> 01:20:42,799
the jtr mail the space dude which

2341
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:44,560
if you ever get um

2342
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:46,000
if you ever get sunny on here maybe

2343
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:47,280
he'll explain to you about the space

2344
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,679
dude story

2345
01:20:47,279 --> 01:20:51,840
um but uh

2346
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:53,920
it's you know it's a super cost of

2347
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:56,639
multiple things you know and as you

2348
01:20:53,920 --> 01:21:00,960
continue to cross it it's super unstable

2349
01:20:56,639 --> 01:21:02,000
so it creates unstable genetics

2350
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:03,840
yeah okay

2351
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,760
and so i think he had a bit of a

2352
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:07,920
follow-up and he says

2353
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:12,400
do you think that this accounts for the

2354
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:12,399
occurrence of hermaphroditisms in nature

2355
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:15,840
um

2356
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:17,199
i don't i think it more so comes from

2357
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:20,000
stressing of

2358
01:21:17,198 --> 01:21:20,879
meshed together genetics

2359
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,238
yeah

2360
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:25,039
okay yeah i think i kind of get what

2361
01:21:22,238 --> 01:21:26,559
he's getting at now giving your answers

2362
01:21:25,039 --> 01:21:29,039
right

2363
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:30,400
some stress in the plant out to where

2364
01:21:29,039 --> 01:21:31,519
it's getting the signal that it's going

2365
01:21:30,399 --> 01:21:33,839
to die

2366
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:35,920
um cannabis is fortunate enough to be

2367
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:38,239
able to produce both male and female sex

2368
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:40,639
organisms and reproduce itself

2369
01:21:38,238 --> 01:21:42,718
so when it hits a point to where either

2370
01:21:40,639 --> 01:21:44,639
a light leak or

2371
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:45,840
the gases are off or it's something that

2372
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:47,039
it doesn't like or something that

2373
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:49,440
stresses that it's going to cause a

2374
01:21:47,039 --> 01:21:51,519
hermaphrodite which has produced both

2375
01:21:49,439 --> 01:21:52,879
parts so that it can pollinate and

2376
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:55,520
produce seeds

2377
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:56,880
to continue to live once again it is a

2378
01:21:55,520 --> 01:22:00,000
weed

2379
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:02,639
yeah okay so on the topic of producing

2380
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,800
seeds are there any little extra perks

2381
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:06,639
or little kind of icing on the cake you

2382
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:09,199
like to give to your female plants when

2383
01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:10,000
you're creating seeds

2384
01:22:09,198 --> 01:22:11,119
uh

2385
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,800
not really

2386
01:22:11,119 --> 01:22:14,238
so you just yeah you just kind of treat

2387
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:15,679
it like it's a scentsy crop except the

2388
01:22:14,238 --> 01:22:17,279
fact it's not

2389
01:22:15,679 --> 01:22:20,719
well um

2390
01:22:17,279 --> 01:22:22,719
yeah i i will uh a different feeling

2391
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:24,480
right i don't want to deprive it of

2392
01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:27,679
nitrogens

2393
01:22:24,479 --> 01:22:29,359
because it's it's no different than

2394
01:22:27,679 --> 01:22:30,639
a female that gets pregnant they need

2395
01:22:29,359 --> 01:22:32,000
prenatals

2396
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:34,079
they need different nutrients than what

2397
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,920
you're given a regular flowering plant

2398
01:22:34,079 --> 01:22:38,719
at least in my opinion

2399
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:40,158
and that's personal you know and that's

2400
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:42,000
mo there's probably going to be a bunch

2401
01:22:40,158 --> 01:22:45,439
of people say oh you're just crazy

2402
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:48,000
possibly i could be but it works for me

2403
01:22:45,439 --> 01:22:49,359
and i'm happy with it that way

2404
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:52,238
cool and have you ever noticed a

2405
01:22:49,359 --> 01:22:54,559
difference in the end outcome of a seed

2406
01:22:52,238 --> 01:22:56,238
based on the different medium or

2407
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:59,199
nutrients that's being fed or do you

2408
01:22:56,238 --> 01:23:01,039
think overall it's same same

2409
01:22:59,198 --> 01:23:03,678
we've pretty much used the exact same

2410
01:23:01,039 --> 01:23:06,719
soils and exact same nutrients

2411
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:08,158
for the last 10 years 12 years so most

2412
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:10,079
of our breeding has been done on the

2413
01:23:08,158 --> 01:23:12,319
same regimens

2414
01:23:10,079 --> 01:23:14,079
yeah okay i mean maybe to play devil's

2415
01:23:12,319 --> 01:23:15,519
advocate i don't suppose you've ever

2416
01:23:14,079 --> 01:23:17,439
seen like

2417
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:19,520
a bit of a questionable grow or maybe a

2418
01:23:17,439 --> 01:23:21,919
better way to phrase it is you pop some

2419
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:24,159
seeds and got some you know some funky

2420
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:26,399
germination ratios or some bad

2421
01:23:24,158 --> 01:23:28,319
germination ratings and then maybe you

2422
01:23:26,399 --> 01:23:30,000
went and saw the grower and you know you

2423
01:23:28,319 --> 01:23:32,799
weren't too impressed by their setup and

2424
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:36,238
you're like this is maybe why

2425
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:39,039
yeah no absolutely we uh we germ test

2426
01:23:36,238 --> 01:23:41,198
germination test all of our seeds uh we

2427
01:23:39,039 --> 01:23:42,960
make our seeds fresh every year

2428
01:23:41,198 --> 01:23:45,279
we don't like them to sit we do small

2429
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:46,800
batch and that that's the reason why

2430
01:23:45,279 --> 01:23:48,639
because i have fresh seeds are way

2431
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:52,079
better than five-year-old seeds they're

2432
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:52,079
going to have a better germination rate

2433
01:23:52,399 --> 01:23:56,158
so you know

2434
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:58,320
we don't really seem to have problems

2435
01:23:56,158 --> 01:24:00,559
with it so when people call me or

2436
01:23:58,319 --> 01:24:02,639
contact me with that issue

2437
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:03,920
i have a set of questions that i run

2438
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:05,279
through with them

2439
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:07,199
and uh

2440
01:24:05,279 --> 01:24:08,319
normally it's something on their end and

2441
01:24:07,198 --> 01:24:11,198
we

2442
01:24:08,319 --> 01:24:12,319
usually send them back out a pack and uh

2443
01:24:11,198 --> 01:24:13,759
um

2444
01:24:12,319 --> 01:24:15,679
the next round they usually don't have

2445
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:18,159
the same problems

2446
01:24:15,679 --> 01:24:19,440
yeah okay that's a good little answer

2447
01:24:18,158 --> 01:24:20,879
so

2448
01:24:19,439 --> 01:24:22,559
going back to a bit earlier you

2449
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:23,840
mentioned the medicine woman that was an

2450
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:25,600
interesting one i wanted to ask you

2451
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:26,960
about but thankfully you filled us in on

2452
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:28,960
the backstory

2453
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:31,119
but i also had written down the sweet

2454
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:32,719
irish kush this is another one where you

2455
01:24:31,119 --> 01:24:34,479
use it not a whole hell of a lot of a

2456
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:36,399
backstory on it would you mind filling

2457
01:24:34,479 --> 01:24:39,359
us in a little more about it

2458
01:24:36,399 --> 01:24:41,119
yeah so sweet irish push was created by

2459
01:24:39,359 --> 01:24:42,839
my friend that i was living with in the

2460
01:24:41,119 --> 01:24:45,679
90s when we did the

2461
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:47,279
uh um he continued to do more breeding

2462
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:49,359
throughout his time but sweetheart chris

2463
01:24:47,279 --> 01:24:51,759
was one that he created and he's a hydro

2464
01:24:49,359 --> 01:24:55,839
guy colorado's a lot of hydro especially

2465
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:55,840
back in 90s 2000s

2466
01:24:55,920 --> 01:25:00,239
so

2467
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:02,159
it's a fairly quick strain um

2468
01:25:00,238 --> 01:25:03,839
it's a

2469
01:25:02,158 --> 01:25:05,519
92

2470
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:07,679
it's an oat so

2471
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:09,199
hit from him it's an og

2472
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:11,119
by

2473
01:25:09,198 --> 01:25:14,000
sweet leaf

2474
01:25:11,119 --> 01:25:16,960
so that's the cross

2475
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:19,119
um when we put it through filos it came

2476
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:21,039
back fifty percent og and

2477
01:25:19,119 --> 01:25:24,079
you know a few other things here and

2478
01:25:21,039 --> 01:25:26,158
there but yeah it's it's 50 og

2479
01:25:24,079 --> 01:25:28,158
so but it's a it's an old one because he

2480
01:25:26,158 --> 01:25:32,479
created it in

2481
01:25:28,158 --> 01:25:34,879
late 90s 96 97 i do believe

2482
01:25:32,479 --> 01:25:37,599
something like that and i've had it

2483
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:39,359
i brought it to oregon with me and i

2484
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:41,440
brought it back up

2485
01:25:39,359 --> 01:25:43,519
0405

2486
01:25:41,439 --> 01:25:46,158
and so how does she compare to say your

2487
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:48,719
more typical ogs like say maybe the sfv

2488
01:25:46,158 --> 01:25:51,439
which you mentioned at the start

2489
01:25:48,719 --> 01:25:54,158
um you know sweet irish fish is one of

2490
01:25:51,439 --> 01:25:57,759
my favorites um i really like that a lot

2491
01:25:54,158 --> 01:25:59,359
it has a fantastic high it tests 25 27

2492
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:02,239
pretty consistently

2493
01:25:59,359 --> 01:26:03,759
um it's a fast strain once again he was

2494
01:26:02,238 --> 01:26:04,799
into the fast drains for the hydro

2495
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:07,760
systems

2496
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:09,440
we did lab tests on here

2497
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:10,800
six weeks seven weeks eight weeks nine

2498
01:26:09,439 --> 01:26:12,879
weeks and ten weeks

2499
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:16,239
six weeks with our highest thc and

2500
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:16,239
degraded from there on down

2501
01:26:16,319 --> 01:26:20,799
but uh it was fast it's fast and veg

2502
01:26:19,119 --> 01:26:23,519
it's fast and flower

2503
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:24,880
and it's kind of ugly to grow it's all

2504
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:27,360
over the place so it's kind of like a

2505
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:29,039
typical older og where it's floppy and

2506
01:26:27,359 --> 01:26:31,599
skinny or branch

2507
01:26:29,039 --> 01:26:34,079
um but it produces fairly well for as

2508
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:35,280
fast as it is

2509
01:26:34,079 --> 01:26:38,238
interesting and what's kind of the

2510
01:26:35,279 --> 01:26:41,039
flavor profile just straight og

2511
01:26:38,238 --> 01:26:43,678
no it's a more of a really sweet emoji

2512
01:26:41,039 --> 01:26:46,319
um to be honest it uh

2513
01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:48,399
it um really sweet with uh with a bit of

2514
01:26:46,319 --> 01:26:50,158
a funk to it

2515
01:26:48,399 --> 01:26:52,079
yeah

2516
01:26:50,158 --> 01:26:53,920
okay so the other strain i mean there's

2517
01:26:52,079 --> 01:26:56,158
a few i want to ask you about but one

2518
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:57,760
which really caught my oregon blues and

2519
01:26:56,158 --> 01:27:00,559
the part about it which caught my eye

2520
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:02,800
specifically was how it uses uh what you

2521
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:05,039
say is the in-house ibl jamaican

2522
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:06,400
blueberry sativa what is that you know

2523
01:27:05,039 --> 01:27:08,158
because like when i first read it i was

2524
01:27:06,399 --> 01:27:09,960
thinking is he kind of talking about

2525
01:27:08,158 --> 01:27:12,238
like a dutch

2526
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:14,239
acclimatized jamaican type of thing or

2527
01:27:12,238 --> 01:27:17,119
just straight land race

2528
01:27:14,238 --> 01:27:19,519
um straight ibl from a from a plantation

2529
01:27:17,119 --> 01:27:20,880
in jamaica on the in the blue mountains

2530
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:22,000
um they've been growing it there for

2531
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:24,560
generations

2532
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,920
a friend of mine brought me back seeds

2533
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:27,600
and uh

2534
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:29,520
anything that it touches it passes

2535
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:31,679
strong blueberries too

2536
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:33,520
the bad part about it is it's an ibl and

2537
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:35,760
it's very dominant so you see a lot of

2538
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:36,639
it for generations out

2539
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:38,239
um

2540
01:27:36,639 --> 01:27:40,000
so

2541
01:27:38,238 --> 01:27:41,439
we're still playing with it a little bit

2542
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,600
um

2543
01:27:41,439 --> 01:27:45,439
but yeah that is the so the blue

2544
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:46,719
mountain kush

2545
01:27:45,439 --> 01:27:48,559
is a

2546
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:49,840
is that was the one you asked about

2547
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:52,080
right

2548
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:53,920
yeah yeah i see oregon believes yeah

2549
01:27:52,079 --> 01:27:55,119
organizes the oregon diesel by the

2550
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:56,480
jamaican

2551
01:27:55,119 --> 01:27:58,719
um

2552
01:27:56,479 --> 01:28:01,039
that you either get so we have some a

2553
01:27:58,719 --> 01:28:02,960
few phenos we found that are really like

2554
01:28:01,039 --> 01:28:04,079
i want to say cat pissy you know very

2555
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:04,960
ammonia

2556
01:28:04,079 --> 01:28:07,359
um

2557
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:08,719
but then a lot of really blueberry you

2558
01:28:07,359 --> 01:28:10,880
know so

2559
01:28:08,719 --> 01:28:12,639
um that one was it was definitely

2560
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:14,639
different

2561
01:28:12,639 --> 01:28:16,880
it's not one that we put out to market

2562
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:18,000
because we didn't feel that it was

2563
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:21,520
up to par

2564
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:23,760
as of you know at this point but yeah

2565
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:27,880
okay so what to you would be the ideal

2566
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:27,880
mating partner for the jamaican

2567
01:28:28,639 --> 01:28:31,600
i don't know yet

2568
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:33,119
whatever it is it's going to be a few

2569
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:35,280
crosses out

2570
01:28:33,119 --> 01:28:38,319
um just because as i say the jamaican is

2571
01:28:35,279 --> 01:28:40,000
super strong and it's not necessarily

2572
01:28:38,319 --> 01:28:42,639
it's what you would think of when you

2573
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:45,439
think of a land race it's very airy it's

2574
01:28:42,639 --> 01:28:48,319
very loose buds it's very stretchy it's

2575
01:28:45,439 --> 01:28:50,879
you know it has a few different thing

2576
01:28:48,319 --> 01:28:53,119
characteristics that

2577
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:56,719
don't necessarily make it very viable

2578
01:28:53,119 --> 01:28:58,719
viable in a market that we have today

2579
01:28:56,719 --> 01:29:00,880
okay and so the next question that

2580
01:28:58,719 --> 01:29:03,039
stimulated in my mind was this idea of

2581
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:04,480
different blueberry origins because i

2582
01:29:03,039 --> 01:29:07,279
remember when i was looking up some

2583
01:29:04,479 --> 01:29:09,198
information on the infamous vikkai he

2584
01:29:07,279 --> 01:29:11,920
claimed he had blueberry that was of

2585
01:29:09,198 --> 01:29:13,599
different origin to dj short and i guess

2586
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:14,639
that was the first place i started to

2587
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:17,199
think like

2588
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:19,679
was there multiple sources of blueberry

2589
01:29:17,198 --> 01:29:22,158
or did it all come from dj short um

2590
01:29:19,679 --> 01:29:23,199
what's your feelings on it

2591
01:29:22,158 --> 01:29:26,238
you know

2592
01:29:23,198 --> 01:29:27,599
from talking so i'm friends with dj he's

2593
01:29:26,238 --> 01:29:29,279
one of my favorite people to sit down

2594
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:30,480
and talk with actually one of the one of

2595
01:29:29,279 --> 01:29:33,599
the old guys that i

2596
01:29:30,479 --> 01:29:35,919
really enjoy talking with um

2597
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:37,600
but yeah vic high from my understanding

2598
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:40,319
took his blueberry and said he was going

2599
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:41,920
to make it better

2600
01:29:40,319 --> 01:29:43,519
so yeah i would almost have to say it

2601
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:46,399
was probably

2602
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:46,400
more so from

2603
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:51,920
dj than i would vic but

2604
01:29:49,359 --> 01:29:54,079
i wasn't around back then so i who knows

2605
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:55,119
for sure right you'd have to get both of

2606
01:29:54,079 --> 01:29:57,359
them

2607
01:29:55,119 --> 01:29:58,719
in to find out you know

2608
01:29:57,359 --> 01:30:00,960
who was first and where did you source

2609
01:29:58,719 --> 01:30:04,800
it from kind of a thing but according to

2610
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:04,800
dj it's a jamaican thing so

2611
01:30:05,039 --> 01:30:10,479
yeah okay there you go

2612
01:30:07,679 --> 01:30:12,158
so it also brings up this next question

2613
01:30:10,479 --> 01:30:15,279
in my mind and you kind of referenced it

2614
01:30:12,158 --> 01:30:17,599
at the very start of extremely isolated

2615
01:30:15,279 --> 01:30:19,759
flavors part of the reason why i think

2616
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:21,920
tangy and blueberry and a few other

2617
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:23,840
notable ones have got such traction is

2618
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:27,119
because they're such dead ringers for

2619
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:28,960
this isolated specific profile

2620
01:30:27,119 --> 01:30:31,039
do you think that that is maybe

2621
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:33,119
something you could aim for as a breeder

2622
01:30:31,039 --> 01:30:34,560
if you were like well if i can you know

2623
01:30:33,119 --> 01:30:36,479
if i've got a strain and it kind of

2624
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:37,920
smells like raspberries and i can refine

2625
01:30:36,479 --> 01:30:39,678
it to the point where it's just banging

2626
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:41,679
on raspberries like that'd just be a

2627
01:30:39,679 --> 01:30:43,679
market winner or do you think that it's

2628
01:30:41,679 --> 01:30:46,079
just that would be an oversimplification

2629
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:47,760
of things

2630
01:30:46,079 --> 01:30:49,960
you know

2631
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:52,400
i think it almost but it's kind of an

2632
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:54,560
oversimplification but i think we need

2633
01:30:52,399 --> 01:30:57,279
the variety and being humans as we are

2634
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:59,280
we all want different so

2635
01:30:57,279 --> 01:31:00,960
um just a little bit different or a lot

2636
01:30:59,279 --> 01:31:04,399
different is definitely dependent upon

2637
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:07,359
the person but uh

2638
01:31:04,399 --> 01:31:07,359
yeah um

2639
01:31:08,158 --> 01:31:10,158
you know it

2640
01:31:09,359 --> 01:31:11,920
you

2641
01:31:10,158 --> 01:31:14,079
not everybody can get the right fruit

2642
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:16,239
combinations once again it's what pairs

2643
01:31:14,079 --> 01:31:18,079
up together what lines up together you

2644
01:31:16,238 --> 01:31:19,919
know i've smelt

2645
01:31:18,079 --> 01:31:21,840
several different strains that smell a

2646
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:24,079
lot like our grape high chief you know

2647
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:25,440
of our doctor who but once you get into

2648
01:31:24,079 --> 01:31:26,800
smoking i mean you look at the blood

2649
01:31:25,439 --> 01:31:29,119
structure there's quite a bit of

2650
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:29,119
difference

2651
01:31:29,279 --> 01:31:34,079
so

2652
01:31:31,198 --> 01:31:35,519
you know i don't know that's uh

2653
01:31:34,079 --> 01:31:37,359
i guess you know

2654
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:40,560
it'd be nice to find the ultimate one

2655
01:31:37,359 --> 01:31:43,359
but i don't know if it truly exists

2656
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:47,440
what's the flavor profile that you wish

2657
01:31:43,359 --> 01:31:47,439
you had in cannabis form

2658
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:52,319
um

2659
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:57,679
you know we've had we have flavors from

2660
01:31:55,439 --> 01:32:00,719
dirt to watermelon

2661
01:31:57,679 --> 01:32:03,760
to rotten fruit to ripe fruit to

2662
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:05,279
souly to cat piss

2663
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:06,960
i like them all kind of just depends on

2664
01:32:05,279 --> 01:32:08,319
what kind of mood i'm in or what i'm

2665
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:11,840
getting ready to do or who i'm getting

2666
01:32:08,319 --> 01:32:13,679
ready to go hang out with

2667
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:16,719
we've always been a group that we like

2668
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:18,719
to grow a lot of different things

2669
01:32:16,719 --> 01:32:22,560
yeah perfect segue

2670
01:32:18,719 --> 01:32:22,560
what type of weed is your favorite weed

2671
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:25,359
flowers

2672
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:30,159
any and all um

2673
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:31,520
you know obviously right at the moment i

2674
01:32:30,158 --> 01:32:33,519
have some

2675
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:36,400

five some i mean

2683
01:32:48,399 --> 01:32:51,519
right at the moment i've got a whole

2684
01:32:49,679 --> 01:32:53,119
slew of flavors and you know just

2685
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:55,679
depends on what the day is what kind of

2686
01:32:53,119 --> 01:32:59,679
mood i'm in is what flavor i grab

2687
01:32:55,679 --> 01:33:02,239
damn you do have everything in that bag

2688
01:32:59,679 --> 01:33:04,560
yeah no i uh i make sure that i have

2689
01:33:02,238 --> 01:33:06,959
choices i like choices

2690
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:10,639
i gotta i gotta take a guess here do you

2691
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:14,000
have also docido

2692
01:33:10,639 --> 01:33:15,840
i do not uh i got some sfv and i have

2693
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:17,920
some chem 4 though

2694
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:20,560
oh how do you feel about cam 4 we were

2695
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:22,960
getting around to the chem dog topic

2696
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:25,039
yeah jim's nice um

2697
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:27,198
all the kim dog lines are really nice we

2698
01:33:25,039 --> 01:33:30,079
uh

2699
01:33:27,198 --> 01:33:31,839
we have a kim 91 that is the other chem

2700
01:33:30,079 --> 01:33:33,198
91 i don't know if you know that story

2701
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:35,440
or not but

2702
01:33:33,198 --> 01:33:38,158
there's another chem 91 that goes around

2703
01:33:35,439 --> 01:33:40,559
swerve worked with it

2704
01:33:38,158 --> 01:33:42,960
we've been growing it for the past

2705
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:44,880
10 11 years maybe more

2706
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:46,239
um

2707
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:48,159
you know that's a weird one every time

2708
01:33:46,238 --> 01:33:50,319
we try to do any work with it there's

2709
01:33:48,158 --> 01:33:51,920
there hasn't been much that has came out

2710
01:33:50,319 --> 01:33:54,238
that i was happy with

2711
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:57,119
um but uh

2712
01:33:54,238 --> 01:33:58,079
we did we hit it with the male doctor

2713
01:33:57,119 --> 01:33:59,760
who

2714
01:33:58,079 --> 01:34:02,479
and i actually found several that i

2715
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:03,440
liked so there's potential there

2716
01:34:02,479 --> 01:34:05,119
um

2717
01:34:03,439 --> 01:34:07,039
but there's still a lot more testing to

2718
01:34:05,119 --> 01:34:09,359
go on with that one but yeah i know the

2719
01:34:07,039 --> 01:34:12,079
chem lines are fantastic they're very

2720
01:34:09,359 --> 01:34:13,759
potent um

2721
01:34:12,079 --> 01:34:15,920
they don't always cross very well though

2722
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:19,840
i don't think

2723
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:21,520
yeah i can um i can attest to how

2724
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:23,199
they're potent and i think that part of

2725
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:24,960
the potency comes from the fact that

2726
01:34:23,198 --> 01:34:27,119
they are kind of like

2727
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:28,560
a bit of a winning lottery ticket and

2728
01:34:27,119 --> 01:34:29,359
it's kind of like the cookies you know

2729
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:30,960
like

2730
01:34:29,359 --> 01:34:32,719
not everything's going to come out

2731
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:34,639
exactly as good as the parent because it

2732
01:34:32,719 --> 01:34:36,480
is the anomaly in itself

2733
01:34:34,639 --> 01:34:39,760
with that being said which of all the

2734
01:34:36,479 --> 01:34:39,759
chem cuts is your favorite

2735
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:48,158
i don't know i like the 91

2736
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:50,319
yeah i like the real 91 and the other 91

2737
01:34:48,158 --> 01:34:52,799
so i like both the 91s quite a bit they

2738
01:34:50,319 --> 01:34:56,319
have more of the fuelly flavor for me or

2739
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:59,199
the the kimmy funk right

2740
01:34:56,319 --> 01:35:00,880
the four is great for production

2741
01:34:59,198 --> 01:35:03,439
because it gets nice and big but i don't

2742
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:06,079
think it's as flavor it's the flavor

2743
01:35:03,439 --> 01:35:08,319
isn't as strong it's a little mute on it

2744
01:35:06,079 --> 01:35:09,760
but if you're looking for weight that's

2745
01:35:08,319 --> 01:35:12,319
where you want to go

2746
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:15,360
if you're growing for your head and for

2747
01:35:12,319 --> 01:35:16,719
a stronger flavor than 91 is where it's

2748
01:35:15,359 --> 01:35:18,719
at

2749
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:21,760
i think you're the first person ever to

2750
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:24,319
have not mentioned the chem d

2751
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:26,560
yeah you know kennedy yeah

2752
01:35:24,319 --> 01:35:26,559
yeah

2753
01:35:26,639 --> 01:35:32,639
it's good um

2754
01:35:29,118 --> 01:35:34,158
but i wouldn't i would i think that uh

2755
01:35:32,639 --> 01:35:35,920
the 91 is

2756
01:35:34,158 --> 01:35:38,319
is the best out of the bunch

2757
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:40,960
kim's sister is super hard to find and

2758
01:35:38,319 --> 01:35:43,439
try to get to smoke any of so i haven't

2759
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:44,639
smoked any of that um

2760
01:35:43,439 --> 01:35:47,198
but uh

2761
01:35:44,639 --> 01:35:48,639
you know i've smoked kim d kim 4 and the

2762
01:35:47,198 --> 01:35:51,439
91 and

2763
01:35:48,639 --> 01:35:53,199
out of them i like the 91 the best

2764
01:35:51,439 --> 01:35:54,638
yeah well i mean depending on which

2765
01:35:53,198 --> 01:35:57,439
camdee you smoke you might have smoked

2766
01:35:54,639 --> 01:35:59,199
the sister

2767
01:35:57,439 --> 01:36:01,279
that's very very true

2768
01:35:59,198 --> 01:36:03,118
but um that's interesting you say that

2769
01:36:01,279 --> 01:36:05,519
because i think at the end of the day 91

2770
01:36:03,118 --> 01:36:06,319
rules for sure

2771
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:08,560
yeah

2772
01:36:06,319 --> 01:36:10,319
yeah alrighty so

2773
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:11,679
with that being said final question on

2774
01:36:10,319 --> 01:36:14,238
the chem dogs

2775
01:36:11,679 --> 01:36:16,079
no one really knows what do you think uh

2776
01:36:14,238 --> 01:36:18,399
the genetics behind it we hear a lot of

2777
01:36:16,079 --> 01:36:20,319
speculation of northern lights and hash

2778
01:36:18,399 --> 01:36:22,079
plan just things of that general nature

2779
01:36:20,319 --> 01:36:23,920
what do you think

2780
01:36:22,079 --> 01:36:26,800
yeah i definitely could see it being an

2781
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:30,880
afghani of some sort um

2782
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:30,880
just because of structure and growth um

2783
01:36:31,279 --> 01:36:36,479
it's hard to say

2784
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:38,158
you know um speculation is a killer

2785
01:36:36,479 --> 01:36:39,839
you know you can speculate on a lot of

2786
01:36:38,158 --> 01:36:42,158
things and most of the time neither

2787
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:43,840
one's right so

2788
01:36:42,158 --> 01:36:44,960
you know i don't know it's it's hard to

2789
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:46,960
say what the

2790
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:48,399
if they can figure out the whole

2791
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:50,800
genealogy thing

2792
01:36:48,399 --> 01:36:52,559
maybe we'll know someday

2793
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:53,360
yeah okay

2794
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:56,239
so

2795
01:36:53,359 --> 01:36:57,759
on the topic of cannabis that you like

2796
01:36:56,238 --> 01:36:59,599
what are you more of an indica or a

2797
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:01,920
sativa guy overall

2798
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:04,000
definitely

2799
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:05,440
interesting the reason why i asked that

2800
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:07,039
was kind of like a bit of a setup to

2801
01:37:05,439 --> 01:37:09,198
this question it's because when i was

2802
01:37:07,039 --> 01:37:10,960
looking at a lot of your offerings i

2803
01:37:09,198 --> 01:37:12,799
think more of them lean towards the

2804
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:13,920
sativa side of things were you aware of

2805
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:17,039
this

2806
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:19,279
yes i am very aware of that um but a lot

2807
01:37:17,039 --> 01:37:20,560
of people like those fast sativas you

2808
01:37:19,279 --> 01:37:22,399
know they like

2809
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:24,239
just because we breed them doesn't mean

2810
01:37:22,399 --> 01:37:26,479
that i smoke them

2811
01:37:24,238 --> 01:37:28,319
you know obviously i've tested them and

2812
01:37:26,479 --> 01:37:29,279
you know once again it comes back to

2813
01:37:28,319 --> 01:37:31,359
where i said it doesn't really

2814
01:37:29,279 --> 01:37:35,679
necessarily matter what i like what

2815
01:37:31,359 --> 01:37:38,079
matters is what everybody else likes um

2816
01:37:35,679 --> 01:37:40,560
so you know obviously i i gotta like it

2817
01:37:38,079 --> 01:37:42,319
in the beginning to create it

2818
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:44,480
but if i create it and put it out and

2819
01:37:42,319 --> 01:37:45,759
nobody likes it then obviously it's just

2820
01:37:44,479 --> 01:37:47,118
something that i like

2821
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:48,719
if i create it and put it out and

2822
01:37:47,118 --> 01:37:49,759
everybody's like wow that's [ __ ]

2823
01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:51,840
awesome

2824
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:53,199
then i know that hey okay well we might

2825
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:54,960
have something here

2826
01:37:53,198 --> 01:37:56,719
so then you expand your

2827
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:58,158
your tester group a little bit larger

2828
01:37:56,719 --> 01:37:59,359
and a little bit larger you know back in

2829
01:37:58,158 --> 01:38:01,439
the old days

2830
01:37:59,359 --> 01:38:03,198
the way we did it was we filled a jar

2831
01:38:01,439 --> 01:38:05,359
sold jars multiple jars in the first jar

2832
01:38:03,198 --> 01:38:08,158
empty that was the win

2833
01:38:05,359 --> 01:38:10,479
yeah that's a good way of sorting the

2834
01:38:08,158 --> 01:38:13,839
the cream from the milk

2835
01:38:10,479 --> 01:38:16,000
yeah yeah so with that being said

2836
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:17,679
do you ever get people asking you to put

2837
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:19,760
out more indica dom crosses and if you

2838
01:38:17,679 --> 01:38:21,199
were to do so what would be some of the

2839
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:23,520
parents you would look to use straight

2840
01:38:21,198 --> 01:38:23,519
away

2841
01:38:24,479 --> 01:38:28,559
um yeah you know we're already working

2842
01:38:26,479 --> 01:38:30,000
we're already doing a mad scientist back

2843
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:31,920
cross we just did the bad scientists

2844
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:34,000
back across just around the first set of

2845
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:35,520
those those are really nice short

2846
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:38,000
squatty plants

2847
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:38,000
um

2848
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:44,560
you know we're more into we work in our

2849
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:46,719
lives more than you know stepping out of

2850
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:49,280
what we did a lot of the moms that we

2851
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:52,158
use in our crosses were stuff the

2852
01:38:49,279 --> 01:38:52,158
crosses that we made

2853
01:38:52,238 --> 01:38:54,479
so

2854
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:58,480
at this point in time we're still

2855
01:38:57,118 --> 01:39:00,000
working with our lines to get them to

2856
01:38:58,479 --> 01:39:02,638
where we want them

2857
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:04,880
and then maybe looking for a few others

2858
01:39:02,639 --> 01:39:06,000
to play with and tinker with a little

2859
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:07,520
bit

2860
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:09,118
but

2861
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:11,360
it's got to be pretty special for us to

2862
01:39:09,118 --> 01:39:14,960
want to work with it

2863
01:39:11,359 --> 01:39:17,920
yeah okay and so overall do you like

2864
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:20,000
kind of creating 50 50s or do you like

2865
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:21,920
more doing them leaning one side to or

2866
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:24,880
the other

2867
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:26,319
50 50s are ideal you know because so

2868
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:28,480
sativas you get a little bit of that

2869
01:39:26,319 --> 01:39:31,599
stretch um indicators will bring you in

2870
01:39:28,479 --> 01:39:34,799
your your uh stiffer stronger

2871
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:36,239
stems and tighter intermodals

2872
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:38,079
sometimes you need to stretch them out

2873
01:39:36,238 --> 01:39:39,759
so you hit them with a heavy a sativa

2874
01:39:38,079 --> 01:39:41,439
mill

2875
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:42,800
sometimes you need to make them stronger

2876
01:39:41,439 --> 01:39:44,479
and shorter so you hit them more with an

2877
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:46,239
indica mill

2878
01:39:44,479 --> 01:39:47,919
that's more the diversity that i like to

2879
01:39:46,238 --> 01:39:49,678
look at is

2880
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:50,800
which direction are we trying to take

2881
01:39:49,679 --> 01:39:54,800
the mom

2882
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:58,560
in are we trying to

2883
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:59,920
stretch it make it more bigger beds or

2884
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:01,840
are we trying to make it shorter or

2885
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:04,000
maybe a little bit faster

2886
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:06,079
um

2887
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:08,000
yeah kind of goes from there that's why

2888
01:40:06,079 --> 01:40:09,840
we're trying to we've got we've got

2889
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:12,000
several males that we've spent the last

2890
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:15,039
few years picking out we just haven't

2891
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:17,279
gotten around to working with them yet

2892
01:40:15,039 --> 01:40:19,840
so what what are some of these strains

2893
01:40:17,279 --> 01:40:22,559
that you you know got these males from

2894
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:24,400
and the question i guess absolutely love

2895
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:26,000
what are some of the characteristics or

2896
01:40:24,399 --> 01:40:28,319
traits you look for when selecting a

2897
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,319
male

2898
01:40:29,118 --> 01:40:35,519
selecting a male definitely a uniformity

2899
01:40:31,679 --> 01:40:38,158
size of flower pod you know size of

2900
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:41,679
the the palm the flower cluster at the

2901
01:40:38,158 --> 01:40:43,920
end of the cycle coloring potencies

2902
01:40:41,679 --> 01:40:46,000
um

2903
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:47,920
yeah just depends on if we're you know

2904
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:50,719
are we looking for a mel that's going to

2905
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:52,158
even out branches make so make

2906
01:40:50,719 --> 01:40:53,198
more so for

2907
01:40:52,158 --> 01:40:55,118
um

2908
01:40:53,198 --> 01:40:56,479
you know multi-head type crop or we're

2909
01:40:55,118 --> 01:40:58,719
looking for something that's going to be

2910
01:40:56,479 --> 01:41:00,879
more just two or three kind of top you

2911
01:40:58,719 --> 01:41:02,800
know two to four tops or whatever it's

2912
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:04,800
going to go more straight up

2913
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:07,199
um just depends on what we're really

2914
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:09,199
looking for is where we're wanting to go

2915
01:41:07,198 --> 01:41:11,599
is what we look for in the mail

2916
01:41:09,198 --> 01:41:13,678
um right at the moment we just we've had

2917
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:15,920
a uh like i said it took us three years

2918
01:41:13,679 --> 01:41:17,679
to find our doctor humel and we actually

2919
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:19,520
founded it a friend's in a friend's

2920
01:41:17,679 --> 01:41:21,440
garden it wasn't even a seat that we

2921
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:24,080
popped

2922
01:41:21,439 --> 01:41:24,079
it took us

2923
01:41:25,198 --> 01:41:29,198
four years before we found a quantum

2924
01:41:27,039 --> 01:41:30,479
mill that we liked

2925
01:41:29,198 --> 01:41:31,759
we're getting ready to start playing

2926
01:41:30,479 --> 01:41:33,439
with him

2927
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:35,840
now with him we're going to bring in a

2928
01:41:33,439 --> 01:41:37,599
different a few other og's

2929
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:38,719
and hit him with just because the sweet

2930
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:40,079
irish kush

2931
01:41:38,719 --> 01:41:41,198
lineage there

2932
01:41:40,079 --> 01:41:43,118
um

2933
01:41:41,198 --> 01:41:45,039
and just kind of see where that goes

2934
01:41:43,118 --> 01:41:48,079
mainly with the quantum metal we're one

2935
01:41:45,039 --> 01:41:51,039
to more isolate into the thcv and the

2936
01:41:48,079 --> 01:41:52,000
cbc and a few other of the

2937
01:41:51,039 --> 01:41:55,519
you know

2938
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:58,000
the finer cannabinoids that we're

2939
01:41:55,520 --> 01:42:01,679
now discovering or figuring out what

2940
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:03,600
uses they actually have

2941
01:42:01,679 --> 01:42:05,920
yeah okay and one of the things we've

2942
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:07,840
heard of in recent episodes in terms of

2943
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:10,639
like the cutting edge things people do

2944
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:12,239
with males is reversing males and being

2945
01:42:10,639 --> 01:42:14,560
able to express

2946
01:42:12,238 --> 01:42:16,238
the male as if it was a female and you

2947
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:18,639
can't smoke it because you spray it with

2948
01:42:16,238 --> 01:42:20,399
some pretty toxic chemicals but you can

2949
01:42:18,639 --> 01:42:22,400
certainly get uh

2950
01:42:20,399 --> 01:42:24,399
a possible indication of the terpene

2951
01:42:22,399 --> 01:42:26,238
profile and things like that is this

2952
01:42:24,399 --> 01:42:28,960
something you've ever thought about or

2953
01:42:26,238 --> 01:42:31,919
even potentially engaged in

2954
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:33,600
um i know about the practice

2955
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:35,520
uh personally i wouldn't do it because

2956
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:38,079
of like you just said you have to spray

2957
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:39,600
it with some pretty harsh chemicals

2958
01:42:38,079 --> 01:42:41,519
i don't like bringing those anywhere

2959
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:44,159
around my car especially for something

2960
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:46,960
like that a male will produce its own

2961
01:42:44,158 --> 01:42:48,960
smell at the end of its flower cycle

2962
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:50,158
and throughout its flower cycle

2963
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:51,679
um

2964
01:42:50,158 --> 01:42:53,519
a lot of people

2965
01:42:51,679 --> 01:42:55,118
you know it's a cool thing to look at

2966
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:58,080
and it looks cool in a picture and all

2967
01:42:55,118 --> 01:43:01,198
that but you can't smoke it

2968
01:42:58,079 --> 01:43:03,279
so you know and it's not fully expressed

2969
01:43:01,198 --> 01:43:05,439
so

2970
01:43:03,279 --> 01:43:06,880
i don't know i haven't done it due to

2971
01:43:05,439 --> 01:43:09,198
the fact as i said i don't like the

2972
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:10,800
chemicals that you have to use to do it

2973
01:43:09,198 --> 01:43:13,198
and uh

2974
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:15,119
i just don't foresee

2975
01:43:13,198 --> 01:43:16,719
with you know i i think you see a lot of

2976
01:43:15,118 --> 01:43:19,198
the same stuff if you just let the mouth

2977
01:43:16,719 --> 01:43:21,760
flower out to full cycle

2978
01:43:19,198 --> 01:43:23,599
yeah okay so i mean

2979
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:25,440
very much in that topic how do you feel

2980
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:28,000
about residence males do you feel like

2981
01:43:25,439 --> 01:43:29,759
it's a positive indicator for the male's

2982
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:33,279
potential to pass on

2983
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:35,520
good traits yes once again um it's male

2984
01:43:33,279 --> 01:43:36,840
dependent due to the fact that some will

2985
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:39,920
and somewhat

2986
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:42,000
um not everything transfers one it's

2987
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:43,199
still a 50 50 mix

2988
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,800
right so

2989
01:43:43,198 --> 01:43:46,319
just because it transfers with this

2990
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:47,440
female it may not transfer with that

2991
01:43:46,319 --> 01:43:49,039
other female

2992
01:43:47,439 --> 01:43:51,439
um

2993
01:43:49,039 --> 01:43:53,920
so once again it's going to be

2994
01:43:51,439 --> 01:43:56,000
and well-dependent upon

2995
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:58,960
you know whether or not a resinous metal

2996
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:00,880
is going to make a non-so resonance

2997
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:03,679
female more resonance

2998
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:05,199
you got a 50-50 chance

2999
01:44:03,679 --> 01:44:08,000
yeah okay

3000
01:44:05,198 --> 01:44:10,799
so how do you feel about the idea of

3001
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:12,960
breeding with hermaphrodite prone

3002
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:14,400
females is it kind of like a challenge

3003
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:16,158
you're willing to take up or do you feel

3004
01:44:14,399 --> 01:44:18,479
like you may be setting yourself up for

3005
01:44:16,158 --> 01:44:19,519
more trouble down the line

3006
01:44:18,479 --> 01:44:20,959
yeah

3007
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:23,199
if there's something that's already

3008
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:25,198
prone for her malfunction yes absolutely

3009
01:44:23,198 --> 01:44:26,479
it's all you're doing is passing along

3010
01:44:25,198 --> 01:44:27,599
that genetic

3011
01:44:26,479 --> 01:44:29,919
um

3012
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:31,520
now if you have steady females and you

3013
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:33,679
light link them or you stress them in a

3014
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:36,960
way to where they produce flowers

3015
01:44:33,679 --> 01:44:39,359
i feel that's a little bit different

3016
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:42,079
because they're tried and true

3017
01:44:39,359 --> 01:44:44,960
females that you've ran flour

3018
01:44:42,079 --> 01:44:47,118
that didn't herm or didn't produce any

3019
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:48,800
bananas or anything to that effect

3020
01:44:47,118 --> 01:44:49,920
until they were stressed to a point

3021
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:50,719
where they thought they were going to

3022
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:52,239
die

3023
01:44:50,719 --> 01:44:54,000
and wanted to live

3024
01:44:52,238 --> 01:44:56,399
how do you feel about feminized seeds in

3025
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,399
general

3026
01:44:57,039 --> 01:45:00,399
it really depends on how you go about

3027
01:44:58,479 --> 01:45:02,959
doing them um if you're doing it with

3028
01:45:00,399 --> 01:45:04,238
the chemical spray on

3029
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:06,719
on

3030
01:45:04,238 --> 01:45:09,439
females that don't show any mafidation

3031
01:45:06,719 --> 01:45:12,800
signs beforehand absolutely that's the

3032
01:45:09,439 --> 01:45:14,559
proper way to do it um if you have a

3033
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:18,480
plan that's hermaphrodite and it seeds

3034
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:18,480
out your room yeah you're not a breeder

3035
01:45:18,639 --> 01:45:23,359
yeah it's interesting because some of

3036
01:45:20,399 --> 01:45:25,439
the earliest breeding programs i heard

3037
01:45:23,359 --> 01:45:27,519
about were apparently

3038
01:45:25,439 --> 01:45:30,000
more a result of the later of what you

3039
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:32,159
said than the earlier ones like i

3040
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,880
believe i heard from a credible source

3041
01:45:32,158 --> 01:45:35,519
that

3042
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:38,159
some of the original og kush

3043
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:39,920
fem seed releases from oregon kid were

3044
01:45:38,158 --> 01:45:42,238
were like not a

3045
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:44,079
an intentionally feminized

3046
01:45:42,238 --> 01:45:46,959
project but more of like a potential

3047
01:45:44,079 --> 01:45:50,639
hermaphroditism type of thing

3048
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:53,439
yeah i can totally see that you know it

3049
01:45:50,639 --> 01:45:55,600
it happens a lot you know i mean

3050
01:45:53,439 --> 01:45:57,519
anytime you find a backseat

3051
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:59,840
there was hermaphrodite somewhere

3052
01:45:57,520 --> 01:46:00,800
right so when you think about it on that

3053
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:02,560
logic

3054
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:04,800
kim the kim line we were just talking

3055
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:07,679
about those are all backseats they were

3056
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:10,000
all from hermaphrodite crisis process

3057
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:12,800
gorilla glue hermaphrodite cross

3058
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:14,399
um cookies hermaphrodite cross um you

3059
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:15,600
know a lot of the great strains that are

3060
01:46:14,399 --> 01:46:17,920
out there the popular strains that are

3061
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:19,679
out there were hermaphrodite process

3062
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:21,279
so is it a good thing or is it a bad

3063
01:46:19,679 --> 01:46:24,158
thing well

3064
01:46:21,279 --> 01:46:25,920
from what i see it could be either or

3065
01:46:24,158 --> 01:46:27,759
so how would you feel about the argument

3066
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:29,279
which some people put forward and which

3067
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:32,159
i'll admit i'm starting to buy into

3068
01:46:29,279 --> 01:46:34,158
myself that arguably the most memorable

3069
01:46:32,158 --> 01:46:35,439
and influential strains of all cannabis

3070
01:46:34,158 --> 01:46:38,960
history were

3071
01:46:35,439 --> 01:46:40,799
bag seed hermaphrodite

3072
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:42,158
yeah i would you know

3073
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:44,719
um that were

3074
01:46:42,158 --> 01:46:46,319
mark they're all good strains absolutely

3075
01:46:44,719 --> 01:46:48,480
i would have to agree with that there

3076
01:46:46,319 --> 01:46:50,399
were accidental process that nobody

3077
01:46:48,479 --> 01:46:53,519
intended to do

3078
01:46:50,399 --> 01:46:55,009
yeah it certainly says something for our

3079
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:57,040
legacy as breeders

3080
01:46:55,010 --> 01:46:59,840
[Laughter]

3081
01:46:57,039 --> 01:47:00,800
absolutely it does

3082
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:02,319
so

3083
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:04,159
on the topic of

3084
01:47:02,319 --> 01:47:05,599
being a breeder this is one i definitely

3085
01:47:04,158 --> 01:47:06,799
wanted to run by you and people are

3086
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:09,119
probably scratching their heads why i

3087
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:11,600
haven't done it so far someone in your

3088
01:47:09,118 --> 01:47:14,399
camp clearly has to be a doctor who fan

3089
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:16,639
given all the strain names right so

3090
01:47:14,399 --> 01:47:18,719
the question is who's the who's the big

3091
01:47:16,639 --> 01:47:20,639
doctor who fan who initiated the idea

3092
01:47:18,719 --> 01:47:22,560
more importantly do you think that there

3093
01:47:20,639 --> 01:47:24,079
was kind of this advantageous marketing

3094
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:26,159
side of things given that there was this

3095
01:47:24,079 --> 01:47:28,719
kind of household recognizable name

3096
01:47:26,158 --> 01:47:28,719
involved

3097
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:33,440
originally it absolutely was um

3098
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:35,119
my father

3099
01:47:33,439 --> 01:47:37,678
i grew up watching doctor who with my

3100
01:47:35,118 --> 01:47:40,158
father my sons grew up watching doctor

3101
01:47:37,679 --> 01:47:41,199
who with their grandfather my father

3102
01:47:40,158 --> 01:47:43,118
um

3103
01:47:41,198 --> 01:47:45,118
and they we just always it was a very

3104
01:47:43,118 --> 01:47:46,719
memorable point in time we all would get

3105
01:47:45,118 --> 01:47:48,799
together on a sunday and watch doctor

3106
01:47:46,719 --> 01:47:50,560
who on pbs

3107
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:52,480
um

3108
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:55,280
and it was just something that they were

3109
01:47:52,479 --> 01:47:57,198
really into it was originally the kids

3110
01:47:55,279 --> 01:47:58,960
came up pretty much with the idea and we

3111
01:47:57,198 --> 01:48:00,158
kind of just ran with it

3112
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:02,158
um

3113
01:48:00,158 --> 01:48:03,439
now though that we've found a doctor who

3114
01:48:02,158 --> 01:48:05,118
mel

3115
01:48:03,439 --> 01:48:07,599
now we're it's

3116
01:48:05,118 --> 01:48:09,839
who's about our valley who or who's

3117
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:11,679
cookies or you know we're calling

3118
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:12,639
everything who's this or who's that kind

3119
01:48:11,679 --> 01:48:16,880
of thing

3120
01:48:12,639 --> 01:48:16,880
who's boss our frost boss cross

3121
01:48:17,118 --> 01:48:20,559
yeah we have a whole bunch of those

3122
01:48:20,719 --> 01:48:25,279
and so how much effort do you put into

3123
01:48:23,118 --> 01:48:27,118
the consideration of marketing when

3124
01:48:25,279 --> 01:48:29,118
naming a strain do you just think no i'm

3125
01:48:27,118 --> 01:48:30,559
naming a strain what i want to name it

3126
01:48:29,118 --> 01:48:32,479
or do you sometimes think to yourself oh

3127
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:35,520
but i also need to ensure that it does

3128
01:48:32,479 --> 01:48:37,839
have some sort of commercial flyability

3129
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:40,719
sorry viability

3130
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:43,520
right um you know it uh

3131
01:48:40,719 --> 01:48:45,279
it helps to have a catchy name for sure

3132
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:47,119
um there's some names out there that are

3133
01:48:45,279 --> 01:48:48,719
really long

3134
01:48:47,118 --> 01:48:50,960
that just don't roll off the tongue so

3135
01:48:48,719 --> 01:48:50,960
well

3136
01:48:51,118 --> 01:48:54,559
but

3137
01:48:52,719 --> 01:48:58,079
you know normally when we do a name we

3138
01:48:54,560 --> 01:48:58,080
try to include both parents

3139
01:48:59,118 --> 01:49:02,799
but a lot of them we you know it's

3140
01:49:00,639 --> 01:49:04,639
obviously someone we haven't but

3141
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:07,199
they're somewhat of a reference you know

3142
01:49:04,639 --> 01:49:08,159
because i mean so doctor who is across

3143
01:49:07,198 --> 01:49:10,879
of

3144
01:49:08,158 --> 01:49:13,679
a mad scientist

3145
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:16,000
to a time wreck

3146
01:49:13,679 --> 01:49:18,399
kind of self-explanatory when you look

3147
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:19,520
at it from that point of view right

3148
01:49:18,399 --> 01:49:22,079
um

3149
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:24,639
the tardis is a time wreck it's an

3150
01:49:22,079 --> 01:49:26,479
oregon diesel by a time wreck

3151
01:49:24,639 --> 01:49:27,760
i thought we kind of thought that was

3152
01:49:26,479 --> 01:49:29,919
you know

3153
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:31,199
pretty viable as well there too

3154
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:33,118
um

3155
01:49:31,198 --> 01:49:35,279
and now with the who's this and who's

3156
01:49:33,118 --> 01:49:37,519
that the kids don't necessarily like it

3157
01:49:35,279 --> 01:49:40,399
i think it's funny as can be

3158
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:41,920
is it marketable we'll see i don't know

3159
01:49:40,399 --> 01:49:43,519
we haven't released any of it we haven't

3160
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:45,440
taken any flowers to market yet or

3161
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:46,880
anything like that and it's just what

3162
01:49:45,439 --> 01:49:48,879
i'm calling them right now so we can

3163
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:50,079
kind of keep track of them

3164
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:52,239
but uh

3165
01:49:50,079 --> 01:49:53,198
yeah marketability and a strain name is

3166
01:49:52,238 --> 01:49:55,039
great

3167
01:49:53,198 --> 01:49:57,598
um seeing as how we're in our own

3168
01:49:55,039 --> 01:49:59,359
industry trademark infringement you know

3169
01:49:57,599 --> 01:50:01,840
stuff like that kind of goes away a

3170
01:49:59,359 --> 01:50:04,079
little bit right there um we actually

3171
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:05,599
have all of our strain names and our

3172
01:50:04,079 --> 01:50:07,198
names company names all that stuff

3173
01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:08,319
trademarked for use in the cannabis

3174
01:50:07,198 --> 01:50:09,439
industry

3175
01:50:08,319 --> 01:50:11,920
um

3176
01:50:09,439 --> 01:50:14,000
have had for a few years at this point

3177
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:16,560
um you know and

3178
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:18,319
actually the funny story was we got two

3179
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:20,560
days

3180
01:50:18,319 --> 01:50:22,559
we got it we received our okay for

3181
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:26,320
trademark within the cannabis industry

3182
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:28,000
for doctor who two days later the olcc

3183
01:50:26,319 --> 01:50:30,399
which is the

3184
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:32,079
who runs the cannabis in oregon

3185
01:50:30,399 --> 01:50:33,839
came out with a list of the 100 strains

3186
01:50:32,079 --> 01:50:36,000
that you couldn't use the name of and of

3187
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:36,960
course doctor who was one of them

3188
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,880
so

3189
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:40,560
we have trademarks within state giving

3190
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:42,960
us to the by the state but then again we

3191
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:45,119
have this independent group telling us

3192
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:47,279
we can't use it so you know i kind of

3193
01:50:45,118 --> 01:50:49,439
found that to be weird but

3194
01:50:47,279 --> 01:50:52,719
it is what it is

3195
01:50:49,439 --> 01:50:54,960
so what do you ultimately call it

3196
01:50:52,719 --> 01:50:57,520
just depends geek farms calls there's

3197
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:57,520
the doctor

3198
01:50:57,760 --> 01:51:03,119
dog house grows our grape hi-chew cut

3199
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,118
and they call that gray poo

3200
01:51:03,359 --> 01:51:07,759
okay yeah so they do skirt around it a

3201
01:51:05,039 --> 01:51:09,198
bit absolutely everybody knows what it

3202
01:51:07,760 --> 01:51:11,119
is

3203
01:51:09,198 --> 01:51:13,519
you just can't have it on the label at

3204
01:51:11,118 --> 01:51:15,519
the store

3205
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:17,599
yeah yeah i understand

3206
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:20,719
so

3207
01:51:17,599 --> 01:51:23,039
next thing i wanted to kind of ask you

3208
01:51:20,719 --> 01:51:24,800
what do you feel generally speaking

3209
01:51:23,039 --> 01:51:26,279
because i mean i think a big component

3210
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:28,480
of what you've been saying today is that

3211
01:51:26,279 --> 01:51:29,759
individualization is a huge part of

3212
01:51:28,479 --> 01:51:30,638
stuff

3213
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:32,239
but

3214
01:51:30,639 --> 01:51:34,319
just generally speaking what do you

3215
01:51:32,238 --> 01:51:36,319
think is the best type of weed for

3216
01:51:34,319 --> 01:51:37,759
anxiety and what do you think is the

3217
01:51:36,319 --> 01:51:39,359
best type of weed for depression in

3218
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:42,560
terms of the characteristics you might

3219
01:51:39,359 --> 01:51:45,118
be looking for either to embody

3220
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:49,199
so for um

3221
01:51:45,118 --> 01:51:52,079
i i prefer high mercy for anxieties i

3222
01:51:49,198 --> 01:51:54,238
suffer from anxieties quite a bit

3223
01:51:52,079 --> 01:51:58,158
i find indicas are a lot better for that

3224
01:51:54,238 --> 01:52:00,879
and for anxieties and relaxation

3225
01:51:58,158 --> 01:52:02,479
if you're depressed though a good sativa

3226
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:03,840
you know to get you uplifting and

3227
01:52:02,479 --> 01:52:06,718
feeling good and

3228
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:09,440
um sativas make you feel really creative

3229
01:52:06,719 --> 01:52:10,639
and wanting to go go do stuff and i

3230
01:52:09,439 --> 01:52:12,000
would explain to people it's not

3231
01:52:10,639 --> 01:52:13,679
necessarily that you're wanting to go do

3232
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:15,439
stuff you just feel good

3233
01:52:13,679 --> 01:52:16,480
you know it's you don't feel your pains

3234
01:52:15,439 --> 01:52:18,158
you're not

3235
01:52:16,479 --> 01:52:20,158
you have a better outlook on because

3236
01:52:18,158 --> 01:52:23,039
you're not in pain you're not in

3237
01:52:20,158 --> 01:52:24,799
in distress you're not you know

3238
01:52:23,039 --> 01:52:27,279
depressed you want you actually are

3239
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:29,599
looking at life a lot differently

3240
01:52:27,279 --> 01:52:32,158
yeah okay so if someone was looking to

3241
01:52:29,599 --> 01:52:33,920
take up growing to kind of help with an

3242
01:52:32,158 --> 01:52:36,000
issue like what we just mentioned or

3243
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:39,039
something kind of similar do you think

3244
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:40,800
they should consider cbd as like one of

3245
01:52:39,039 --> 01:52:42,639
the first things they should grow or do

3246
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:45,920
you think that just regular strains is

3247
01:52:42,639 --> 01:52:47,840
probably a better first protocol

3248
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:49,679
once again it would

3249
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:51,360
excuse me once again it really depend

3250
01:52:49,679 --> 01:52:53,279
upon what the issue was that they were

3251
01:52:51,359 --> 01:52:55,839
trying to address

3252
01:52:53,279 --> 01:52:57,759
what i would tell somebody with ptsd

3253
01:52:55,840 --> 01:53:00,719
would be mercy

3254
01:52:57,760 --> 01:53:03,119
with pains with same thing

3255
01:53:00,719 --> 01:53:06,239
or cbd's

3256
01:53:03,118 --> 01:53:07,198
somebody that has cancer or

3257
01:53:06,238 --> 01:53:10,799
has

3258
01:53:07,198 --> 01:53:12,879
arthritis or fibromyalgia or you know

3259
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:15,520
body aches pains joints so on and stuff

3260
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:17,599
like that cbd is wonderful

3261
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:18,719
obviously it's fantastic for

3262
01:53:17,599 --> 01:53:21,119
um

3263
01:53:18,719 --> 01:53:23,520
seizures epilepsy

3264
01:53:21,118 --> 01:53:24,839
we're finding great works in it and also

3265
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:28,880
in autism

3266
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:31,039
um you know so

3267
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:34,239
you really have to curtail around each

3268
01:53:31,039 --> 01:53:36,079
individual patient at that point in time

3269
01:53:34,238 --> 01:53:38,079
um

3270
01:53:36,079 --> 01:53:40,880
yeah well i mean it brings us to kind of

3271
01:53:38,079 --> 01:53:43,519
the master question of it all in that

3272
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:45,679
to what degree do you think that

3273
01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:47,599
cannabinoid therapy as a general term

3274
01:53:45,679 --> 01:53:50,319
needs to be individualized and i guess

3275
01:53:47,599 --> 01:53:52,159
maybe a specific way of phrasing that is

3276
01:53:50,319 --> 01:53:54,479
you know like people will hear that a

3277
01:53:52,158 --> 01:53:56,479
certain strain is good for something

3278
01:53:54,479 --> 01:53:57,519
maybe let's just say depression do you

3279
01:53:56,479 --> 01:53:59,359
think that someone with depression

3280
01:53:57,520 --> 01:54:00,960
should should look and try to get those

3281
01:53:59,359 --> 01:54:02,479
ones that are well known or at the end

3282
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:04,560
of the day you're still going to have to

3283
01:54:02,479 --> 01:54:06,799
do some individual searching for it just

3284
01:54:04,560 --> 01:54:08,400
kind of clicks with you

3285
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:10,480
yeah i know i would definitely start

3286
01:54:08,399 --> 01:54:11,198
with um popular strings that are known

3287
01:54:10,479 --> 01:54:13,039
for

3288
01:54:11,198 --> 01:54:16,479
and see if those work for you

3289
01:54:13,039 --> 01:54:18,880
and then um if those don't work for you

3290
01:54:16,479 --> 01:54:20,799
um or parts of it works and parts of it

3291
01:54:18,880 --> 01:54:22,719
doesn't you know like the onset is great

3292
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:24,400
but then towards the end you're too

3293
01:54:22,719 --> 01:54:26,560
couch locked or whatever you know maybe

3294
01:54:24,399 --> 01:54:29,598
you need to move more towards instead of

3295
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:30,560
a 70 30 indica sativa maybe you need to

3296
01:54:29,599 --> 01:54:32,960
go to

3297
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:34,400
a 60 40 or something of that effect get

3298
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:37,679
a little more sativa in there so you're

3299
01:54:34,399 --> 01:54:38,879
not the lag down isn't so bad

3300
01:54:37,679 --> 01:54:40,399
um

3301
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:42,159
but yeah i would definitely start out

3302
01:54:40,399 --> 01:54:43,198
with with known

3303
01:54:42,158 --> 01:54:46,000
um

3304
01:54:43,198 --> 01:54:49,118
strains genetics that help the

3305
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:50,800
symptoms that you're suffering from

3306
01:54:49,118 --> 01:54:51,920
and kind of go from there once again

3307
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:55,279
it's so

3308
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:57,199
personalized and individualized that uh

3309
01:54:55,279 --> 01:55:00,319
you know at least on a medical side i

3310
01:54:57,198 --> 01:55:00,319
think that it's

3311
01:55:00,479 --> 01:55:05,319
it's almost overwhelming i would believe

3312
01:55:02,079 --> 01:55:05,319
for the patient

3313
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:09,440
and so what do you think are some

3314
01:55:07,599 --> 01:55:13,119
medicinal strains that commonly get

3315
01:55:09,439 --> 01:55:13,118
overlooked from your offerings

3316
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:18,480
well we just did some cbd crosses we

3317
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:20,560
acquired a uh

3318
01:55:18,479 --> 01:55:23,039
a metal harley suit from levi which was

3319
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:25,039
og ringo's son who was his own o.j

3320
01:55:23,039 --> 01:55:27,039
ringo's son

3321
01:55:25,039 --> 01:55:28,319
and we did a bunch we did a few crosses

3322
01:55:27,039 --> 01:55:31,359
to our normal

3323
01:55:28,319 --> 01:55:33,359
setup of moms and they all turned out

3324
01:55:31,359 --> 01:55:34,719
pretty much two to ones um which is

3325
01:55:33,359 --> 01:55:36,238
fantastic

3326
01:55:34,719 --> 01:55:37,760
um

3327
01:55:36,238 --> 01:55:39,678
they're definitely i'm definitely

3328
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:41,440
getting rave reviews from them

3329
01:55:39,679 --> 01:55:43,440
from a lot of our patients that that's

3330
01:55:41,439 --> 01:55:45,759
the ratio that they're looking for

3331
01:55:43,439 --> 01:55:49,519
um we're getting

3332
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:51,280
upwards of 14 to 18 cbd with half that

3333
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:52,560
in thc

3334
01:55:51,279 --> 01:55:54,960
just depends on what flavors you're

3335
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:57,520
looking for what terpene profiles you're

3336
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:57,520
looking for

3337
01:55:57,840 --> 01:56:01,199
you know

3338
01:55:59,359 --> 01:56:03,519
those are really good

3339
01:56:01,198 --> 01:56:03,519
um

3340
01:56:05,359 --> 01:56:08,719
most of them you know so our

3341
01:56:09,359 --> 01:56:13,920
sonic sonic screwdriver is really good

3342
01:56:12,238 --> 01:56:16,238
um we get uh

3343
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:18,960
we find we get a lot of people that um

3344
01:56:16,238 --> 01:56:21,198
it helps with opiates quite a bit

3345
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:22,560
um there's a couple cannabinoids in

3346
01:56:21,198 --> 01:56:25,759
there cb

3347
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:28,560
cb10 cb9

3348
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:30,639
that are like a opiate molecule but

3349
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:33,119
they're laid back over upon themselves

3350
01:56:30,639 --> 01:56:35,199
so we're wondering if maybe it's working

3351
01:56:33,118 --> 01:56:37,118
as an opiate blocker or

3352
01:56:35,198 --> 01:56:39,439
similar enough to where it allows the

3353
01:56:37,118 --> 01:56:42,799
person to get off opiates to where it

3354
01:56:39,439 --> 01:56:43,839
stimulates the same receptors there as

3355
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:46,719
um

3356
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:47,679
but obviously a lot healthier for you

3357
01:56:46,719 --> 01:56:48,560
yeah

3358
01:56:47,679 --> 01:56:49,520
okay

3359
01:56:48,560 --> 01:56:51,119
so

3360
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:53,119
one of the last questions i wanted to

3361
01:56:51,118 --> 01:56:55,839
quickly ask you about a random strain

3362
01:56:53,118 --> 01:56:57,519
orange cream soda it's another parent

3363
01:56:55,840 --> 01:56:59,440
haven't come across it's not in many

3364
01:56:57,520 --> 01:57:00,719
other crosses what's the back story on

3365
01:56:59,439 --> 01:57:04,079
that one

3366
01:57:00,719 --> 01:57:05,679
orange cream soda so um we had gotten a

3367
01:57:04,079 --> 01:57:07,679
clone from a

3368
01:57:05,679 --> 01:57:09,118
gentleman some seeds from the gentleman

3369
01:57:07,679 --> 01:57:12,960
he created

3370
01:57:09,118 --> 01:57:12,960
called daddy's girl it was a

3371
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:17,679
sour diesel by um

3372
01:57:15,920 --> 01:57:19,840
mk ultra

3373
01:57:17,679 --> 01:57:22,399
and it was a fantastic strain and then

3374
01:57:19,840 --> 01:57:25,840
we crossed it with a

3375
01:57:22,399 --> 01:57:27,759
new york diesel and

3376
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:30,000
the progeny from that

3377
01:57:27,760 --> 01:57:32,079
it was the only orange flavored one out

3378
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:33,760
of them they all kind of had like the

3379
01:57:32,079 --> 01:57:36,399
soda creamy

3380
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:39,840
flavor to them but that one just was

3381
01:57:36,399 --> 01:57:42,079
nice and orangey um

3382
01:57:39,840 --> 01:57:44,159
so yeah it's it's it's not one that's

3383
01:57:42,079 --> 01:57:46,319
very potent

3384
01:57:44,158 --> 01:57:48,319
it's definitely a daytime smoker for a

3385
01:57:46,319 --> 01:57:50,399
light smoker

3386
01:57:48,319 --> 01:57:51,920
it doesn't get you too

3387
01:57:50,399 --> 01:57:55,279
hyper it doesn't get you too low but

3388
01:57:51,920 --> 01:57:57,279
it's nice and mellow and keeps you uh

3389
01:57:55,279 --> 01:58:00,158
pretty pain free and works works quite

3390
01:57:57,279 --> 01:58:03,840
well and has just this fantastic

3391
01:58:00,158 --> 01:58:05,759
orange cream soda smell and flavor to it

3392
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:07,679
fantastic so can we expect to see it pop

3393
01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:10,000
up again in the future

3394
01:58:07,679 --> 01:58:12,158
oh yeah yeah yeah we just crossed there

3395
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:15,039
to the doctor who

3396
01:58:12,158 --> 01:58:16,960
um and uh we're gonna probably we'll

3397
01:58:15,039 --> 01:58:20,560
wind up being doing we're crossing her

3398
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:22,880
to uh our quantum kushmel as well ah

3399
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:24,480
nice nice and when can we expect to be

3400
01:58:22,880 --> 01:58:26,159
able to maybe get that is there still

3401
01:58:24,479 --> 01:58:27,919
some testing to come

3402
01:58:26,158 --> 01:58:29,920
yeah oh yeah

3403
01:58:27,920 --> 01:58:31,920
we're slow when it comes to that you

3404
01:58:29,920 --> 01:58:33,599
know we release maybe one or two strains

3405
01:58:31,920 --> 01:58:35,840
a year

3406
01:58:33,599 --> 01:58:38,560
i like to grow

3407
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:40,480
that strain multiple times

3408
01:58:38,560 --> 01:58:43,039
and the reason being is normally i just

3409
01:58:40,479 --> 01:58:44,479
pop a five pack at a time

3410
01:58:43,039 --> 01:58:46,000
the reason being is because that's what

3411
01:58:44,479 --> 01:58:47,759
most people buy

3412
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:49,118
so i want to see what somebody's getting

3413
01:58:47,760 --> 01:58:51,520
in a five pack

3414
01:58:49,118 --> 01:58:53,759
so i'll pop

3415
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:55,119
i don't know eight nine ten

3416
01:58:53,760 --> 01:58:56,000
five packs

3417
01:58:55,118 --> 01:58:58,319
um

3418
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:59,760
and see what i see you know

3419
01:58:58,319 --> 01:59:01,920
um so

3420
01:58:59,760 --> 01:59:02,400
realistically 40 to 50 seeds at a time

3421
01:59:01,920 --> 01:59:03,440
pretty much

3422
01:59:02,399 --> 01:59:05,359
[Music]

3423
01:59:03,439 --> 01:59:07,359
just to see what i see

3424
01:59:05,359 --> 01:59:08,960
and

3425
01:59:07,359 --> 01:59:11,839
that takes a while we send them out all

3426
01:59:08,960 --> 01:59:14,079
over the country for testing as well

3427
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:17,199
and then we send them off to our larger

3428
01:59:14,079 --> 01:59:18,800
operations where they can run 100 to 500

3429
01:59:17,198 --> 01:59:21,039
at a time kind of thing

3430
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:23,199
just to see how they do all across

3431
01:59:21,039 --> 01:59:25,198
so our testing is pretty tight and we

3432
01:59:23,198 --> 01:59:27,118
got to see something we really like kind

3433
01:59:25,198 --> 01:59:29,439
of thing

3434
01:59:27,118 --> 01:59:31,759
yeah of course so it brings up an

3435
01:59:29,439 --> 01:59:34,238
interesting point in my mind of pricing

3436
01:59:31,760 --> 01:59:36,159
seeds given you only do you know one or

3437
01:59:34,238 --> 01:59:38,238
two projects a year

3438
01:59:36,158 --> 01:59:39,679
it must make pricing hard for you

3439
01:59:38,238 --> 01:59:41,839
because you know there's a lot of work

3440
01:59:39,679 --> 01:59:43,599
going into it but i noticed you know you

3441
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:46,159
guys are certainly no

3442
01:59:43,599 --> 01:59:47,520
aficionado seeds in regards to your

3443
01:59:46,158 --> 01:59:48,879
pricing

3444
01:59:47,520 --> 01:59:51,840
how do you feel about the whole topic

3445
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:54,079
and do you struggle sometimes to kind of

3446
01:59:51,840 --> 01:59:55,920
you know feel a pri reach a price that

3447
01:59:54,079 --> 01:59:58,158
maybe you feel comfortable with in all

3448
01:59:55,920 --> 01:59:59,520
regards

3449
01:59:58,158 --> 02:00:01,279
you know

3450
01:59:59,520 --> 02:00:03,920
so

3451
02:00:01,279 --> 02:00:06,479
i remember when i had to buy seeds

3452
02:00:03,920 --> 02:00:07,920
and how much they were and how hard it

3453
02:00:06,479 --> 02:00:09,359
was for me to come up with the money to

3454
02:00:07,920 --> 02:00:11,279
buy those

3455
02:00:09,359 --> 02:00:13,279
so when we decided to come do the seed

3456
02:00:11,279 --> 02:00:16,000
company thing i was like you know we

3457
02:00:13,279 --> 02:00:17,519
need to keep it low to where anybody can

3458
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:19,118
buy them we're doing this for the

3459
02:00:17,520 --> 02:00:20,639
patients we originally got into it for

3460
02:00:19,118 --> 02:00:23,679
helping in patients

3461
02:00:20,639 --> 02:00:26,560
patients can't afford 500 10 packs

3462
02:00:23,679 --> 02:00:27,679
they're doing good to afford 100 10 pack

3463
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:29,840
so

3464
02:00:27,679 --> 02:00:32,719
i i really see that and

3465
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:35,360
i don't want people to be denied good

3466
02:00:32,719 --> 02:00:37,198
medicine because they can't afford it

3467
02:00:35,359 --> 02:00:38,399
you see that in real life bad enough as

3468
02:00:37,198 --> 02:00:40,879
it is

3469
02:00:38,399 --> 02:00:43,198
once again if you can get somebody to

3470
02:00:40,880 --> 02:00:44,400
pay a thousand dollars for a 10 pack 800

3471
02:00:43,198 --> 02:00:45,919
for a 10 pack

3472
02:00:44,399 --> 02:00:48,559
why wouldn't you

3473
02:00:45,920 --> 02:00:49,840
you know i've never attempted it i don't

3474
02:00:48,560 --> 02:00:52,000
know that i would

3475
02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:54,719
um

3476
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:55,840
but then again um

3477
02:00:54,719 --> 02:00:58,960
you know

3478
02:00:55,840 --> 02:01:01,360
if somebody will pay it why not

3479
02:00:58,960 --> 02:01:02,880
if the market will allow it

3480
02:01:01,359 --> 02:01:04,238
yeah definitely

3481
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:07,359
so

3482
02:01:04,238 --> 02:01:09,439
what type of new or just special

3483
02:01:07,359 --> 02:01:10,880
offerings do you have coming up and do

3484
02:01:09,439 --> 02:01:12,719
you have anything you know i guess

3485
02:01:10,880 --> 02:01:14,880
special in regards to say

3486
02:01:12,719 --> 02:01:17,679
going to be released at events but maybe

3487
02:01:14,880 --> 02:01:19,760
not online or anything like that

3488
02:01:17,679 --> 02:01:21,840
um yeah actually

3489
02:01:19,760 --> 02:01:24,079
probably our next one is going to be our

3490
02:01:21,840 --> 02:01:26,560
mad scientist back cross

3491
02:01:24,079 --> 02:01:29,760
um will be our next release

3492
02:01:26,560 --> 02:01:31,360
we're really liking how it's turning out

3493
02:01:29,760 --> 02:01:32,639
it's definitely showing what we want to

3494
02:01:31,359 --> 02:01:35,439
see

3495
02:01:32,639 --> 02:01:37,920
it's cut genotypes down to

3496
02:01:35,439 --> 02:01:39,439
two got short and you got tall so a

3497
02:01:37,920 --> 02:01:41,840
couple more back crosses and we'll have

3498
02:01:39,439 --> 02:01:43,759
the mad scientist where we want it

3499
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:45,920
um

3500
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:48,800
but you know it uh it definitely has

3501
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:51,440
some very beautiful things going on

3502
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:54,079
so i think that we may release that

3503
02:01:51,439 --> 02:01:56,559
um we may have a few special things with

3504
02:01:54,079 --> 02:01:58,880
this down in uh emerald cup

3505
02:01:56,560 --> 02:02:00,639
uh as i said before that that's the only

3506
02:01:58,880 --> 02:02:02,159
cup we're doing this year

3507
02:02:00,639 --> 02:02:03,760
um

3508
02:02:02,158 --> 02:02:06,319
so yeah you know there's definitely

3509
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:08,000
stuff that we do small batches of

3510
02:02:06,319 --> 02:02:09,599
that

3511
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,639
you know maybe i'll bring some with me

3512
02:02:09,599 --> 02:02:13,360
just to

3513
02:02:10,639 --> 02:02:15,199
see if anybody wants any but the next

3514
02:02:13,359 --> 02:02:17,279
big release will most likely be our mad

3515
02:02:15,198 --> 02:02:19,279
scientist back across

3516
02:02:17,279 --> 02:02:21,439
okay and you got a new idea on an eta of

3517
02:02:19,279 --> 02:02:21,439
that

3518
02:02:21,840 --> 02:02:25,119
you know we might do a small release of

3519
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:26,480
emerald cup

3520
02:02:25,118 --> 02:02:28,559
um but

3521
02:02:26,479 --> 02:02:30,399
we'll see um

3522
02:02:28,560 --> 02:02:33,760
we're still we we're waiting on some

3523
02:02:30,399 --> 02:02:34,559
coas right at the moment

3524
02:02:33,760 --> 02:02:36,800
but

3525
02:02:34,560 --> 02:02:39,199
everything else in grow rooms and grows

3526
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:41,039
here and grows there has come back very

3527
02:02:39,198 --> 02:02:44,000
positive

3528
02:02:41,039 --> 02:02:44,000
also we did a

3529
02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:48,400
medicine time which is medicine woman by

3530
02:02:46,800 --> 02:02:49,920
time wreck

3531
02:02:48,399 --> 02:02:51,759
so uh

3532
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:53,440
that uh

3533
02:02:51,760 --> 02:02:55,039
we're liking a lot of people are liking

3534
02:02:53,439 --> 02:02:57,598
it as well so that might come out as

3535
02:02:55,039 --> 02:02:58,960
well at the same time we try to do two

3536
02:02:57,599 --> 02:03:00,719
at a time

3537
02:02:58,960 --> 02:03:03,520
um

3538
02:03:00,719 --> 02:03:04,480
possibly emerald cup um as far as like

3539
02:03:03,520 --> 02:03:06,239
uh

3540
02:03:04,479 --> 02:03:08,238
one seats here now or something like

3541
02:03:06,238 --> 02:03:10,799
that i'll get it

3542
02:03:08,238 --> 02:03:11,678
maybe in the spring

3543
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:13,039
yeah

3544
02:03:11,679 --> 02:03:15,520
cool

3545
02:03:13,039 --> 02:03:17,039
okay so on to our last one or two

3546
02:03:15,520 --> 02:03:19,119
questions before we've got our few

3547
02:03:17,039 --> 02:03:21,118
little quickfire ones it's probably a

3548
02:03:19,118 --> 02:03:22,559
bit of a a large question so you know

3549
02:03:21,118 --> 02:03:24,799
feel free to think about it for a minute

3550
02:03:22,560 --> 02:03:26,239
but what type of a legacy do you kind of

3551
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:27,520
want to leave on the industry or

3552
02:03:26,238 --> 02:03:31,039
specifically that like you know

3553
02:03:27,520 --> 02:03:32,560
homegrown natural wonders would leave

3554
02:03:31,039 --> 02:03:34,319
uh

3555
02:03:32,560 --> 02:03:36,560
i haven't really thought about a legacy

3556
02:03:34,319 --> 02:03:39,359
i'm not quite done yet

3557
02:03:36,560 --> 02:03:41,360
you know i think uh legacy is

3558
02:03:39,359 --> 02:03:43,279
not really decided until you're done

3559
02:03:41,359 --> 02:03:45,198
doing your work

3560
02:03:43,279 --> 02:03:48,399
and with the group that i've joined up

3561
02:03:45,198 --> 02:03:51,198
with now the dutch consulting company

3562
02:03:48,399 --> 02:03:53,439
we're pretty far from being done

3563
02:03:51,198 --> 02:03:55,598
so uh yeah

3564
02:03:53,439 --> 02:03:58,158
that's interesting i i noticed that i

3565
02:03:55,599 --> 02:04:01,039
guess the obvious thing to state is that

3566
02:03:58,158 --> 02:04:03,198
it's not exclusively dutch

3567
02:04:01,039 --> 02:04:05,920
no it's not exclusively dutch but there

3568
02:04:03,198 --> 02:04:07,519
are a couple of dutch members so uh

3569
02:04:05,920 --> 02:04:11,199
yeah um

3570
02:04:07,520 --> 02:04:14,480
you know we're a consulting company and

3571
02:04:11,198 --> 02:04:16,638
working with george is just phenomenal

3572
02:04:14,479 --> 02:04:17,919
uh

3573
02:04:16,639 --> 02:04:20,239
he's

3574
02:04:17,920 --> 02:04:23,279
he's definitely on another level when it

3575
02:04:20,238 --> 02:04:26,000
comes to growers for sure

3576
02:04:23,279 --> 02:04:28,719
the the scale that he's done for a long

3577
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:31,039
time um

3578
02:04:28,719 --> 02:04:33,039
is just amazing and the way that he

3579
02:04:31,039 --> 02:04:35,599
breaks everything down and makes

3580
02:04:33,039 --> 02:04:37,519
it's pretty cool it's i'm really happy

3581
02:04:35,599 --> 02:04:39,760
working with this company

3582
02:04:37,520 --> 02:04:40,719
and uh yeah we're just getting started

3583
02:04:39,760 --> 02:04:42,719
so

3584
02:04:40,719 --> 02:04:44,158
i don't think our legacy will be for a

3585
02:04:42,719 --> 02:04:47,118
little bit but

3586
02:04:44,158 --> 02:04:49,039
you know we are part of the pioneers in

3587
02:04:47,118 --> 02:04:50,960
this industry so

3588
02:04:49,039 --> 02:04:53,198
hopefully that'll be the legacy that we

3589
02:04:50,960 --> 02:04:54,719
helped make sure that everybody got a

3590
02:04:53,198 --> 02:04:57,598
fair

3591
02:04:54,719 --> 02:04:58,960
you know safe access to medicine and

3592
02:04:57,599 --> 02:05:00,960
or just

3593
02:04:58,960 --> 02:05:03,679
recreational marijuana whatever you want

3594
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:05,118
to look at it as

3595
02:05:03,679 --> 02:05:07,359
but yeah

3596
02:05:05,118 --> 02:05:09,118
yeah good answer good answer so we'll

3597
02:05:07,359 --> 02:05:10,319
move on to our last little quick fire

3598
02:05:09,118 --> 02:05:11,359
questions

3599
02:05:10,319 --> 02:05:13,279
so

3600
02:05:11,359 --> 02:05:15,598
what is the best canvas you've ever

3601
02:05:13,279 --> 02:05:18,719
smoked in your life

3602
02:05:15,599 --> 02:05:18,719
oh good guy

3603
02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:22,800
um

3604
02:05:20,479 --> 02:05:22,799
you know

3605
02:05:27,920 --> 02:05:32,158
i don't know that that's a really tough

3606
02:05:30,560 --> 02:05:33,599
question because

3607
02:05:32,158 --> 02:05:35,279
you know you can have bed the most

3608
02:05:33,599 --> 02:05:37,440
flavorful that you've smoked and you

3609
02:05:35,279 --> 02:05:40,158
know the different specific high that

3610
02:05:37,439 --> 02:05:43,759
you've had but if i was to kind of look

3611
02:05:40,158 --> 02:05:43,759
at an all around combined

3612
02:05:45,760 --> 02:05:50,320
wow i'd have to go back to the mid-80s

3613
02:05:48,319 --> 02:05:51,920
and back to the old school roadkill

3614
02:05:50,319 --> 02:05:53,439
skunk i mean

3615
02:05:51,920 --> 02:05:56,078
you know granted it could have been my

3616
02:05:53,439 --> 02:05:58,000
point of references from back then

3617
02:05:56,078 --> 02:05:59,920
but my father was a grower so i was

3618
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:03,599
growing a bunch of different pot

3619
02:05:59,920 --> 02:06:06,239
and when that came to town it was just

3620
02:06:03,599 --> 02:06:08,719
yeah um there we weren't growing

3621
02:06:06,238 --> 02:06:11,118
anything like that that's for sure

3622
02:06:08,719 --> 02:06:12,639
um kind of wish we would have been

3623
02:06:11,118 --> 02:06:15,359
but uh

3624
02:06:12,639 --> 02:06:16,480
yeah i'd have to say the 80s the 80s

3625
02:06:15,359 --> 02:06:18,960
roadkills

3626
02:06:16,479 --> 02:06:20,238
the 80s skunk or afghanis or whatever

3627
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:21,439
they were

3628
02:06:20,238 --> 02:06:22,479
yeah okay

3629
02:06:21,439 --> 02:06:24,638
so

3630
02:06:22,479 --> 02:06:27,279
kind of a flip side question

3631
02:06:24,639 --> 02:06:31,118
what is in your opinion the worst strain

3632
02:06:27,279 --> 02:06:33,920
to have gained a heap of momentum

3633
02:06:31,118 --> 02:06:33,920
purple punch

3634
02:06:34,719 --> 02:06:38,880
i feel like there's not enough punch

3635
02:06:37,118 --> 02:06:42,078
yeah definitely not

3636
02:06:38,880 --> 02:06:44,560
it's purple but there ain't no punch

3637
02:06:42,078 --> 02:06:47,439
uh yes maybe it's good marketing

3638
02:06:44,560 --> 02:06:48,960
yeah no completely symbiotic is really

3639
02:06:47,439 --> 02:06:50,879
good about marketing and hiking up

3640
02:06:48,960 --> 02:06:52,880
strings um

3641
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:54,960
when you actually do a lab test on it or

3642
02:06:52,880 --> 02:06:58,159
whatever you come to find out that uh oh

3643
02:06:54,960 --> 02:06:59,760
that's all lipids that's shining there

3644
02:06:58,158 --> 02:07:02,559
in the picture not

3645
02:06:59,760 --> 02:07:03,920
cannabinoids or anything to that effect

3646
02:07:02,560 --> 02:07:05,840
so

3647
02:07:03,920 --> 02:07:07,199
right it's all lipids and waxes and

3648
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:09,440
that's the problem with a lot of those

3649
02:07:07,198 --> 02:07:10,839
strains like that they look great in the

3650
02:07:09,439 --> 02:07:13,519
picture

3651
02:07:10,840 --> 02:07:15,520
um and they can get hyped up all you

3652
02:07:13,520 --> 02:07:17,599
want but when it comes right down to

3653
02:07:15,520 --> 02:07:18,880
smoking them and doing coas and doing

3654
02:07:17,599 --> 02:07:20,639
extractions

3655
02:07:18,880 --> 02:07:23,279
well if you if you

3656
02:07:20,639 --> 02:07:26,239
de-wax your your

3657
02:07:23,279 --> 02:07:28,960
your extractions um yeah your your

3658
02:07:26,238 --> 02:07:30,718
returns on those strains are super low

3659
02:07:28,960 --> 02:07:32,880
because it's all waxes

3660
02:07:30,719 --> 02:07:34,480
and all fatties and lipids

3661
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:36,560
well there you go

3662
02:07:34,479 --> 02:07:38,638
all right onward so

3663
02:07:36,560 --> 02:07:41,119
desert island top three you're gonna

3664
02:07:38,639 --> 02:07:43,679
take with you

3665
02:07:41,118 --> 02:07:45,359
siege of flowers

3666
02:07:43,679 --> 02:07:48,560
it's a good question right you've got an

3667
02:07:45,359 --> 02:07:51,598
infinite infinite supply of flower no no

3668
02:07:48,560 --> 02:07:53,280
explanation how but it just it is

3669
02:07:51,599 --> 02:07:54,480
just uh you gotta you gotta figure out

3670
02:07:53,279 --> 02:07:56,158
the rent-out point

3671
02:07:54,479 --> 02:07:57,839
um

3672
02:07:56,158 --> 02:07:59,198
so uh

3673
02:07:57,840 --> 02:08:01,279
wow

3674
02:07:59,198 --> 02:08:03,839
that's a rough one

3675
02:08:01,279 --> 02:08:06,158
you know i i probably sound it probably

3676
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:06,159
you know

3677
02:08:07,359 --> 02:08:13,118
wow only three huh

3678
02:08:09,679 --> 02:08:13,118
i used to only give people two

3679
02:08:13,279 --> 02:08:17,920
what a nice guy he went up the tree

3680
02:08:15,359 --> 02:08:19,359
that's nice

3681
02:08:17,920 --> 02:08:20,800
um

3682
02:08:19,359 --> 02:08:23,279
you know i probably have to throw some

3683
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:25,599
doctor who in there um

3684
02:08:23,279 --> 02:08:27,840
the kim

3685
02:08:25,599 --> 02:08:27,840
um

3686
02:08:29,279 --> 02:08:32,719
that's hard for the last one

3687
02:08:35,118 --> 02:08:39,439
yeah um

3688
02:08:37,679 --> 02:08:42,078
i could see why i was only two the third

3689
02:08:39,439 --> 02:08:44,319
one's kind of rough realistically uh

3690
02:08:42,078 --> 02:08:45,679
yeah i get you um

3691
02:08:44,319 --> 02:08:48,158
i probably want something a little bit

3692
02:08:45,679 --> 02:08:50,158
more um more uplifting so i probably go

3693
02:08:48,158 --> 02:08:52,158
with uh

3694
02:08:50,158 --> 02:08:53,920
i don't know maybe like a maybe a haze

3695
02:08:52,158 --> 02:08:55,679
an old silver super silver haze or

3696
02:08:53,920 --> 02:08:58,239
something to that effect

3697
02:08:55,679 --> 02:08:59,920
yeah that's a solid pick solid pick

3698
02:08:58,238 --> 02:09:03,359
all right so

3699
02:08:59,920 --> 02:09:07,199
what is a cut that you used to have but

3700
02:09:03,359 --> 02:09:07,198
you've lost and you wish you had it back

3701
02:09:14,078 --> 02:09:19,359
yeah that daddy's girl was pretty nice

3702
02:09:17,118 --> 02:09:21,839
and that was that sour diesel

3703
02:09:19,359 --> 02:09:21,839
by uh

3704
02:09:22,479 --> 02:09:26,158
mk ultra um that was pretty nice i wish

3705
02:09:25,039 --> 02:09:27,198
i kind of kind of wish i had that one

3706
02:09:26,158 --> 02:09:29,679
still

3707
02:09:27,198 --> 02:09:29,678
um

3708
02:09:31,359 --> 02:09:34,238
there's too many

3709
02:09:34,560 --> 02:09:38,000
you know that's why you just cruise

3710
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:39,760
through i'm hoping that you'll find one

3711
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,719
that will replace that in some kind of a

3712
02:09:39,760 --> 02:09:43,119
way

3713
02:09:40,719 --> 02:09:43,118
um

3714
02:09:44,840 --> 02:09:50,319
yeah we've already been fairly fortunate

3715
02:09:47,920 --> 02:09:52,158
about keeping backups and

3716
02:09:50,319 --> 02:09:54,719
you know giving to tight circles so we

3717
02:09:52,158 --> 02:09:57,759
haven't really lost a whole lot

3718
02:09:54,719 --> 02:09:58,880
that hash plant back in the 90s

3719
02:09:57,760 --> 02:10:01,360
that would have been

3720
02:09:58,880 --> 02:10:03,359
fantastic nowadays

3721
02:10:01,359 --> 02:10:04,880
um

3722
02:10:03,359 --> 02:10:07,359
but yeah

3723
02:10:04,880 --> 02:10:08,639
those would probably be my main two

3724
02:10:07,359 --> 02:10:11,359
nice answers

3725
02:10:08,639 --> 02:10:14,078
so lucky last question if you could go

3726
02:10:11,359 --> 02:10:15,839
back in time anywhere any place

3727
02:10:14,078 --> 02:10:20,319
presumably to collect some land race

3728
02:10:15,840 --> 02:10:20,319
seeds where and when and what variety

3729
02:10:21,920 --> 02:10:25,039
wow um

3730
02:10:27,198 --> 02:10:32,479
so probably um yeah the afghani the

3731
02:10:30,319 --> 02:10:33,599
afghani mountains the hindu kush

3732
02:10:32,479 --> 02:10:35,839
mountains

3733
02:10:33,599 --> 02:10:37,360
um the silk trail i guess is what they

3734
02:10:35,840 --> 02:10:38,800
call it a lot

3735
02:10:37,359 --> 02:10:40,479
um

3736
02:10:38,800 --> 02:10:42,719
i think that that's where a lot of the

3737
02:10:40,479 --> 02:10:45,039
really good stuff comes from but then

3738
02:10:42,719 --> 02:10:46,239
again you got the chocolate ties you've

3739
02:10:45,039 --> 02:10:48,479
got

3740
02:10:46,238 --> 02:10:48,479
you know

3741
02:10:49,198 --> 02:10:52,759
the whole continent over there can we

3742
02:10:51,118 --> 02:10:54,479
count that as this one place

3743
02:10:52,760 --> 02:10:57,360
[Laughter]

3744
02:10:54,479 --> 02:10:59,118
just broader asia just a broad broad

3745
02:10:57,359 --> 02:11:00,399
broad spectrum of it

3746
02:10:59,118 --> 02:11:02,960
um

3747
02:11:00,399 --> 02:11:05,039
yeah you know it's

3748
02:11:02,960 --> 02:11:06,399
that's a really good question

3749
02:11:05,039 --> 02:11:08,158
i've never really thought about that one

3750
02:11:06,399 --> 02:11:10,399
much if i could go back in a time where

3751
02:11:08,158 --> 02:11:11,759
would i go and what seeds would i want

3752
02:11:10,399 --> 02:11:14,000
um but yeah

3753
02:11:11,760 --> 02:11:15,920
africa afghanistan and

3754
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:17,279
the hindu mountains pretty pretty much

3755
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:19,599
i'm thinking

3756
02:11:17,279 --> 02:11:21,118
yeah good two very good and popular

3757
02:11:19,599 --> 02:11:22,239
