85
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:34,980
it's good to be back on the show for

86
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,658
another another year down

87
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:38,759
another you go down another year in the

88
00:03:36,658 --> 00:03:40,560
books I gotta say we've had a quick one

89
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:42,000
or should I say probably about eight

90
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,799
months this one's been a little

91
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,900
truncated because we did last year's one

92
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,819
a little bit late but I decided you know

93
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,560
get us back on track we'll do this one a

94
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:52,018
little bit early but needless to say

95
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,878
we've had a few notable changes going

96
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:57,060
down in the industries we've seen a few

97
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:59,459
breeders come a few go a few incarnated

98
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,140
it's going to be an interesting Awards I

99
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:03,539
think how about you what's been going on

100
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:04,859
for you Mr Bean

101
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:07,259
definitely I was thinking I was saying

102
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:09,239
that about that as well um I was

103
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:10,438
thinking uh you know when we were

104
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:12,658
talking about breeder of the year and

105
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:14,340
whatnot I was like huh this name has

106
00:04:12,658 --> 00:04:15,900
been up there the last two years this

107
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,160
name has been non-existent in the last

108
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,079
couple months I wonder what's going on

109
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,019
with that one so we'll definitely talk

110
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,879
about that but uh just just um you know

111
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:26,519
I think the whole industry on the whole

112
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:27,839
is down or the I think uh possibly the

113
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:30,000
seed sales are down a little bit this

114
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:31,859
year over year over year uh people got

115
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,500
out of their houses of course we had two

116
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,819
Banger years 20 and 21. uh but people

117
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,439
actually got other houses got them

118
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:39,719
moving around so

119
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:41,459
uh sells a little bit down but we had

120
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,580
made made our sales even better right

121
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:47,399
even better deals for everybody else so

122
00:04:43,579 --> 00:04:50,339
that's exactly it and um I think this

123
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:51,779
might be a good point to review some of

124
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:54,359
our predictions and some of our results

125
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:56,099
from last year because uh we haven't

126
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,960
done that yet I think it'll be good to

127
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,900
sort of check in and see if they stand

128
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:03,839
the test of time albeit eight to 12

129
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:05,939
months so uh the first award from last

130
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:08,159
year will check in was the clone of the

131
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:11,279
year we gave it to Apple Fritter how

132
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,100
does that feel you still stand by it

133
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:15,599
yeah I still think it was a uh they

134
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,580
thought I tried to look back and and and

135
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,620
know now that you know and not think

136
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:21,899
about that and and compare like oh we

137
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,160
didn't know about this one back then so

138
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:25,019
um I prefer definitely I think I think

139
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,979
it was good I think it was solid pick

140
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:27,839
um

141
00:05:25,978 --> 00:05:30,180
you know for for sure because because it

142
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:32,099
wasn't wasn't the reason recent apples

143
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:35,280
but I think it definitely started up the

144
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,000
apples the Apple's phase Trend if you

145
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,638
will

146
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,939
yeah certainly and and something that I

147
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,800
was very happy to see was that uh it

148
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:45,538
hasn't been adopted by absolutely

149
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,978
everyone in their breeding project so

150
00:05:45,538 --> 00:05:48,899
there's it's not completely

151
00:05:46,978 --> 00:05:51,120
oversaturated so I agree I think it

152
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:52,859
still definitely stands the test and uh

153
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,600
you know shout out to lump status it's a

154
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,038
cool one for sure and the flower is

155
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,039
really nice I've seen it used in a lot

156
00:05:56,038 --> 00:06:01,620
of projects the next thing I wanted to

157
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:04,199
mention though was when I asked you last

158
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,959
year about the clone of the year your

159
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:09,600
guess was the jealousy from jbz and

160
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:12,239
guess what leafly's just come out and

161
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:16,199
called it their Australian of the year

162
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:18,060
so what's interesting is we sort of made

163
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:20,038
this same point around three years ago

164
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,478
when we first predicted the upsurge of

165
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:23,099
runs when it came out and then what do

166
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:25,079
you know Leafly strain of the year the

167
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,600
following year so I guess at this point

168
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:30,240
it's safe to say we're not doing too bad

169
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,460
on the old betting odds are we no I

170
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,259
think uh if I was a better man which

171
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:37,859
which I generally am I do I do play with

172
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:40,680
the cryptos uh I would definitely put

173
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:43,020
our money on us to to pick it but you

174
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,860
know not to not to blow my own horn here

175
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:45,359
but

176
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,680
when you're in the industry and you're

177
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,120
in the seed business you're in the seed

178
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,500
game and you see what's coming in and

179
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,819
day in and day out and see all the new

180
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,579
strangers and what's on the market you

181
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:54,960
know kind of uh it's it's it's humbling

182
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:57,359
and it's and it's cool to be able to hit

183
00:06:54,959 --> 00:07:00,000
things on the head sometimes of course

184
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,580
of course if we move on and we look at

185
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,879
our hottest newcomer uh we had Bloom

186
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:08,459
Seed Co really solidifying himself as

187
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:10,740
you know in that tier one breeder list

188
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:12,299
nowadays I can definitely get behind

189
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,038
that I think Bloom's sort of gone from

190
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,740
strength to strength now doing some

191
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:19,079
collabs with Boston roots

192
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:21,900
definitely and uh I I just had what was

193
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:24,598
his Maple uh Maple oh the black maple

194
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:26,879
hybrids like black maple yeah that had

195
00:07:24,598 --> 00:07:28,860
that that lion release uh just sold the

196
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:32,699
last pack of those the other day uh

197
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:33,479
those were uh commodity definitely a big

198
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:36,598
pack

199
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:38,038
um he's a good guy uh he likes fast cars

200
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:38,779
you know

201
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:41,038
yeah

202
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:42,359
he's got some nice Parts on his

203
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:44,159
Instagram well there you go yeah shout

204
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,280
out to bloom for that one in terms of

205
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,680
our most anticipated sea drop last year

206
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:51,779
we had crickets and cicada Mr Bob and

207
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,538
Hannah bolt with their puck back cross

208
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:56,818
one line I think it's safe to say we can

209
00:07:54,538 --> 00:07:59,399
stand by that one pretty firmly

210
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:03,120
yeah that's uh that's a given that was

211
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:04,379
uh yeah definitely uh he's he's he

212
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,560
happens to be in the running for this

213
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:09,180
year with his bc3 in fact so yeah

214
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,038
they've gone from strength to strength

215
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,300
yeah at least for for me that's uh it

216
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:14,659
was a hot one for this year for sure

217
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:18,240
almost shut my website down

218
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:20,580
that's it that's good to hear so uh in

219
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,978
terms of our Hall of Fame strain we had

220
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:24,899
blueberry from DJ Short you know I don't

221
00:08:22,978 --> 00:08:27,598
think it needs too much said there

222
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:29,159
clearly Hall of Fame worthy strain

223
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:30,360
yeah I mean every reason anybody smoked

224
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,319
clearing them growing up I think I mean

225
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,000
you know they had it even if it wasn't

226
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:34,200
the true blueberry you you got you were

227
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,120
given a bag and it was told he was

228
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,800
blueberry you know I mean you know it

229
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,179
smelled like it's May smell like hay

230
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:41,098
sometimes it wasn't it was clearly

231
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:43,439
beasters but they told you the blueberry

232
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:45,540
so it was one of those the first knocked

233
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,740
off strain if you will yeah gosh it must

234
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:48,360
be knocked off more than basically

235
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,639
anything right

236
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,320
yeah pretty much I remember God remember

237
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:54,299
did you guys ever have beasters over in

238
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,399
Australia what I'm talking about these

239
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:58,919
two said yeah we got the equivalent yep

240
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:02,278
I think the it later came out to be like

241
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:05,639
a like a M38 or 27 or something from

242
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:08,580
Canada but uh horrible horrible weed

243
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:11,519
yeah yeah M39 or whatever that skunk

244
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:13,860
cross NL fast flower

245
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,839
um and then uh we also gave a Lifetime

246
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,060
Achievement Award to Mel Frank for all

247
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,279
of his work so I think again that one

248
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:22,559
stands the test so looking back pretty

249
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:24,480
happy with those results I don't think

250
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:27,359
we've got egg on our face in any real

251
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:30,360
meaningful regards so let's move on to

252
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,180
the awards for this year I think a good

253
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,639
place to start we always like to start

254
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:36,719
we're not always but we last year I

255
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:38,399
should say I listened to the episode

256
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,920
before this so it's just fresh in my

257
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,600
mind last year we started with clone of

258
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:44,819
the year so I think it's a good place to

259
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,040
start again let's do some honorable

260
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:51,180
mentions before we actually announce the

261
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:53,879
winner so for me I want to start out by

262
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:55,620
giving an honorable mention to something

263
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:58,559
that I don't think many people will

264
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:02,580
expect which is that I want to give an

265
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:04,859
honorable mention to RS 11 bred by deep

266
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:07,620
east and an undeniably popular

267
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,839
commercial strain the Doja crew has

268
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,399
wrapped this one they've done super well

269
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,200
with it they're on the record of saying

270
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:15,539
that the Clone drop was the most

271
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,160
successful in history doing I think they

272
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:20,278
said it was like one and a half million

273
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:22,500
or something it'd be JB's jealousy one

274
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:25,439
and it's beautiful flavor that really

275
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:27,419
sort of incorporates uh the best aspects

276
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,760
of the parents being the pink guava and

277
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:31,799
the Oz cush so yeah I want to give an

278
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:34,679
honorable mention uh to the rainbow

279
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:37,139

282
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,600
uh uh when I first saw that strain come

283
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:44,039
across the list I thought it was

284
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,540
roadkill skunk

285
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:48,299

coming up and a lot of people you've

296
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,860
been using it I thought it was vertical

297
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:12,659

298
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:14,639

know rest on the Shelf so to say

330
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,540
a hundred percent and then the final

331
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,519
honorable mention I want to give is to

332
00:12:21,539 --> 00:12:26,219
none other than Boston roots for the

333
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,139
sherbanger Clone this one has started to

334
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:30,720
make its way into many more gardens

335
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:33,480
after being held for a couple years now

336
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,278
uh the plant's been used by many and

337
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,259
he's got some notable collabs going down

338
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:39,000
with uh the likes of Bloom which we've

339
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:41,159
already mentioned so that's cool shout

340
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,100
out to Boston roots for his showbanger

341
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:45,419
well for sure um I I Gotta Give a couple

342

um it's gonna be for exotic and his work

345
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:55,019
with the Gary Poppins

346
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:56,278
which is the Gary Payton crossed with

347
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:59,339
red Bop

348
00:12:56,278 --> 00:13:01,799
yeah I had seen that one Duo yeah we

349
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:03,180
sold a whole bunch of that maybe you

350
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:05,338
know four or five hundred packs of that

351
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:07,259
thing I think was was a hot hot

352
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:08,060
commodity

353
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:11,639
um

354
00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:14,338
uh also he had this this year uh he also

355
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:16,740
had his red runts that's true I've seen

356
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:18,720
people in Australia harvesting that and

357
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,159
it looks great so not only have they

358
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,500
bought it I've seen the flower on

359
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:25,159
Instagram looks good so shout out to

360
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:29,519
Exotic Mike so let's get to the winner

361
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:32,399
this year winner is uh clone only of the

362
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:35,278
year goes to none other than Apples and

363
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,679
Bananas from Chris compound apples and

364
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:40,740
bananas has undeniably been the biggest

365
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:42,539
clone of the year for the 2022 period in

366
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:45,299
my opinion we have seen a number of

367
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:47,759
breeders not just Chris using it in

368
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:49,740
their projects not just as female

369
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:52,919
acceptors but also even other people

370
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:55,259
reversing it themselves like raw and lit

371
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:57,479
Farms just to name a few it's got an

372
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:59,639
undeniable nose that has the ability to

373
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,500
dominate any bag it's in it seriously

374
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:03,539
reminds me of that sort of Tangy thing

375
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,820
where it just fully cuts through the

376
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:09,078
rest and the bud structure in my opinion

377
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:12,120
beautiful that spiraling calyx sort of

378
00:14:09,078 --> 00:14:14,578
pyramidal or fractal looking structure I

379
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,620
really like it beautiful stuff the high

380
00:14:14,578 --> 00:14:19,319
is great composed of some interesting

381
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:21,179
genetics now in laters crossed to gelati

382
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,339
this one I find particularly interesting

383
00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:26,338
because it utilizes some unique work

384
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:28,920
from Sin City who yet again have proven

385
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:31,139
themselves as the breeder's breeder with

386
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:35,039
their work also notably appearing in

387
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:37,560
JB's wedding cake so apples and bananas

388
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:40,319
is hot in every dispensary you go to

389
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:42,599
especially cookies not surprising given

390
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,760
Chris helped curate their menu but

391
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,620
you'll find it in many of the Exotic

392
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:49,319
style Brands pushing it for good reason

393
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,759
it's really high quality Bud lots of

394
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,740
people growing with it lots of people

395
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:54,659
breeding with it what's your thoughts Mr

396
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:57,539
Bean agree disagree

397
00:14:54,659 --> 00:14:58,439
uh I agree Apple's masmus was huge last

398
00:14:57,539 --> 00:15:01,198
year

399
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,120
um and uh 2022 was just it was a big

400
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:04,799
strain we saw coming at the end of the

401
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,139
emerald cup with the big lines Emerald

402
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:09,059
cup uh when I met with Chris down there

403
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:10,139
that whole kind of snapped through that

404
00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:11,638
happened

405
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:13,440
of course Chris is no longer with

406
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:16,980
compound now

407
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:19,260
um he and them split ways uh at the

408
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:21,000
beginning uh of this year you put a post

409
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:23,399
out he's now Cipher genetics which you

410
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,458
know but um that Apple has been as it

411
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:28,259
was it was money and uh the cross on it

412
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:29,698
I've got it as I've just got the full

413
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:31,019
thing right now on my on my website

414
00:15:29,698 --> 00:15:32,879
because I was just like it's not such a

415
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:34,320
jump guy that's four which is platinum

416
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:35,458
cookies Gran that he purps that crossed

417
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,139
the blue Power which gives us now and

418
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:39,838
later as that cross back to gelotti

419
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:42,299
actually sorry so that Platinum cookies

420
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,880
Granddaddy Purple that's that's

421
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:46,620
incorrect it's sorry like it's correct

422
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:48,360
but instead of saying that they should

423
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:50,100
say what it actually is which is it's um

424
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,079
it's Candyland that's what Platinum

425
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:54,540
cookies Granddaddy Purple is

426
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:56,219
huh

427
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:58,319
yeah what I think the most interesting

428
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,600
part which I mentioned before is like um

429
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,760
yet again Sin City sneaking their work

430
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,440
into one of the hottest strains utilized

431
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:06,899
by another big breeder

432
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:09,180
yeah Don's Don's a great dude I've known

433
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:11,578
him since 2014 probably hooked up with

434
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:13,439
him at Denver cup uh we sell a lot of

435
00:16:11,578 --> 00:16:15,179
gear we have Sin City Saturdays 20 off

436
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,620
down stock but he's been putting out a

437
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:18,179
lot of good work for a long time uh

438
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,159
usually always does merge with each

439
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:22,219
release and you know tests his work and

440
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:25,439
does a lot of solid solid stuff

441
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:27,180
so what's your thoughts agree disagree

442
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,680
apples and bananas

443
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:30,899
I think you already answered it actually

444
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:33,000
am I am I just too stoned right now yeah

445
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:34,379
no answered it uh it's definitely the I

446
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,578
mean it was the highest strain last year

447
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:37,379
for sure like I said we saw it coming

448
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:39,719
through the end of the emerald cup the

449
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:41,578
lines of people and stuff and you know

450
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:44,759
it's also just for the for the history

451
00:16:41,578 --> 00:16:47,638
books it's odd how you know that cut was

452
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:50,699
out before he even did the seed release

453
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:52,198
yeah so you know because I got to kill

454
00:16:50,698 --> 00:16:54,838
people over that not being the real deal

455
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:56,278
and find out it was a real deal and just

456
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:58,380
a whole bunch of problems there with

457
00:16:56,278 --> 00:17:00,000
that uh that whole

458
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:02,100
you know if that you know good story

459
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,160
makes a great strain they say well I

460
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:07,380
strongly suspect that um the cut getting

461
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:10,860
out before the seed drop happened is

462
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:13,280
maybe one of the factors that led to

463
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:16,619
Chris's ultimate split from compound

464
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:18,178
yeah I mean if I was you know if just

465
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:20,219
let's say I was

466
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:22,740
a breeder working with a tissue culture

467
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,720
lab hypothetically

468
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,880
if somehow my cuts started to get out

469
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,500
and I didn't give them to anyone

470
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,059
I would be pissed

471
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,140
I would I would you know you got to

472
00:17:30,058 --> 00:17:32,460
figure out you got to start going

473
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,620
backwards and be like well if I didn't

474
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:39,419
give him out how the hell they get out

475
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:41,399
yeah yeah yeah interesting stuff so on

476
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:43,799
to our next award let's do the hottest

477
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:46,259
newcomer on the scene so this award

478
00:17:43,798 --> 00:17:48,240
historically does not go to people where

479
00:17:46,259 --> 00:17:50,940
it's say like their first year breeding

480
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:54,599
in past years we've had winners such as

481
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:56,279
Bloom Soul fire AK Bean brains and I

482
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:58,740
think the idea of this award is more to

483
00:17:56,279 --> 00:18:00,660
acknowledge that people who are notable

484
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:03,538
names within the industry have very much

485
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:05,940
established themselves in that next sort

486
00:18:03,538 --> 00:18:07,859
of level if you're going to say tears

487
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:10,440
establishing themselves as a the next

488
00:18:07,859 --> 00:18:11,879
tier of breeder in a higher status where

489
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,580
you know that their offerings are

490
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,080
generally quite high quality and uh

491
00:18:14,579 --> 00:18:17,099
they've made some waves over the past

492
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:20,519
few years

493
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:22,619
so to start off I want to give the first

494
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:26,819
shout out I want to give the honorable

495
00:18:22,619 --> 00:18:28,079
mention is to none other than Tiki man I

496
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:30,119
actually think he's had a super

497
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:32,579
productive year doing a bunch of collabs

498
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:35,819
with some cool people including the

499
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:37,500
likes of raw and Umami Seed Co and he's

500
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:39,178
had a number of successful releases in

501
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,798
his own right I've got some friends who

502
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:43,259
have found some killer stuff in his gear

503
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:44,759
I think Tiki man deserving of an

504
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:46,558
honorable shout out

505
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:49,079
definitely I think I just saw him how to

506
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:50,879
collab with uh super seed kill I think

507
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:54,058
they did something that it had release

508
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,799
but no it's uh so it looks like this guy

509
00:18:54,058 --> 00:18:57,538
he's been killing it looks like uh we

510
00:18:55,798 --> 00:18:58,980
met him two years ago I believe in

511
00:18:57,538 --> 00:19:01,440
Emerald cups talked with him for a bit

512
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:03,240

513
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,440

um then they just had their runts

544
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:12,600
dropped recently and that's available on

545
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:15,179

546
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:16,500

547
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:18,360
Crasher

548
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,679
um really Frosty stuff great packaging

549
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:21,298
great guys

550
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,100
um we did an interview with him that's

551
00:20:21,298 --> 00:20:24,960
on the website there his neighbors ran

552
00:20:23,099 --> 00:20:26,879
uh real cool guy

553
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,500
but uh he's sort of like gear and like

554
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,440
we've been really happy with this stuff

555
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:34,380
love it shout out Nasha love to hear it

556
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,840
I think they've actually got a um

557
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:38,280
a hardcore OG hybrid or some work

558
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:40,199
they've done with hardcore OG in the

559
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:42,599
past which is piqued my curiosity so

560
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,919
shout out there yes they do in fact I

561
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:45,418
was gonna mention it but I was like ah

562
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,740
No One's Gonna Know The hardcore it's

563
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:48,960
like hardcore gushers or something it's

564
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:50,759
hardcore gussers yeah yeah cool that's

565
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,259
an OG that I've sort of popped up more

566
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:54,779
recently I've been keeping my arm so

567
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:58,200
this brings us to the hottest new camera

568
00:20:54,779 --> 00:21:01,259
on the scene award this year it's gonna

569
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,779
go to someone who is in fact fairly new

570
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:06,359
on the Block and someone who I think's

571
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:07,980
been making waves and they themselves

572
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:10,379
may be a bit surprised to hear this

573
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:13,200
because I've never spoken to them but uh

574
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:16,020
I want to actually give it to Blockhead

575
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:19,140
buds if you have been paying attention

576
00:21:16,019 --> 00:21:21,058
you will likely have seen Blockhead buds

577
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:24,000
Making Waves and I first heard about him

578
00:21:21,058 --> 00:21:26,940
about 12 months ago when I saw a number

579
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,460
of cannabis cups being won in either

580
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:32,159
first or second place often multiple

581
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:34,380
samples in the top five for a strain

582
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:37,200
called superboof and I was like what's

583
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:39,539
this and you sort of start following it

584
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,720
and eventually it got renamed to

585
00:21:39,538 --> 00:21:45,058
blockberry and Blockhead buds is the

586
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,159
creator of this cross it's it's a strain

587
00:21:45,058 --> 00:21:49,798
that's comprised of black cherry punch

588
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:53,039
by Tropicana cookies so it's obviously

589
00:21:49,798 --> 00:21:54,298
boasting like a super terpy high but the

590
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:56,700
difference and the reason why this is so

591
00:21:54,298 --> 00:21:59,038
popular is that it's also potent with a

592
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:01,440
unique Twist on the flavor it's very

593
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:03,298
immersing dominant but it translates to

594
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,159
like you know that typical strong Citrus

595
00:22:03,298 --> 00:22:06,900
nose but it's also got like an earthy

596
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:08,880
cherryness to it which is really

597
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:11,100
interesting so this one grabs your

598
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,320
attention with both the nose but it also

599
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:15,899
keeps you focused and interested in the

600
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:18,538
effect so much so that it's been winning

601
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:20,700
cups left and right as I mentioned it's

602
00:22:18,538 --> 00:22:22,740
often taking out multiple spots in the

603
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:25,500
top five such as the New York Growers

604
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:27,599
cup where it took both first and third

605
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:30,900
by two different Growers respectively

606
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:33,359
and entering their block Berry samples

607
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,980
there's also been a number of other cups

608
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:37,558
one but I think the most interesting

609
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:40,500
twist in this Saga is that Mr Blockhead

610
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:42,839
himself thought he had given away slash

611
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,400
lost the last of the F1 stock so he

612
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:47,038
wasn't going to be able to produce any

613
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,559
f2s or breed with males he just had his

614
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:51,419
breeder cut however recently he put a

615
00:22:49,558 --> 00:22:53,099
post up saying he got sent some seed

616
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:55,860
back from a friend he had sent some of

617
00:22:53,099 --> 00:22:57,899
the f1s to and so there's now some more

618
00:22:55,859 --> 00:23:00,119
projects on the horizon including maybe

619
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:02,640
an F2 line he's done some cool other

620
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:06,599
breeding projects utilizing males such

621
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:10,140
as a triangle Kush bx1 lemon Rose and

622
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:12,538
blueberry frosting just to name a few so

623
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:15,419
a big shout out to block Berry buds

624
00:23:12,538 --> 00:23:18,240
particularly for his block Berry Cross

625
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:20,280
or otherwise known as superboof hugely

626
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,919
popular I suspect you're going to see it

627
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:25,678
more over the coming 12 months Mr Bean

628

the running so yeah I appreciate it

656
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:29,279
thank you

657
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:31,200
that that's brilliant I have to I have

658
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,658
to give you some Kudos because in in

659
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,519
past years the hottest newcomer on the

660
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:38,039
Block award it actually never really

661
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:40,019
went to anyone who was sort of like in

662
00:24:38,038 --> 00:24:41,339
their first year or anything like that

663
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:43,019
it was sort of people who'd been making

664
00:24:41,339 --> 00:24:44,759
little waves but had managed to really

665
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:46,200
establish themselves but I think you're

666
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:47,940
the first person in the three or four

667
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,500
years we've been doing this where it

668
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:51,720
seems like you truly have just like

669
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:55,140
busted down the door of the industry and

670
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:56,759
charged in how's that feel oh man yeah

671
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,480
that sounds that sounds awesome I love

672
00:24:56,759 --> 00:24:58,200
it

673
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,839
um

674
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:03,000
I've actually I've kind of been doing

675
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:05,099
certain things for a long time I'm a

676
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,359
little bit older but yeah so I think

677
00:25:05,099 --> 00:25:08,699
it's just kind of all come to fruition

678
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:10,379
at once so yeah it uh

679
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,819
feels great so I don't even know like

680
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,900
how does this how does it how did it

681
00:25:11,819 --> 00:25:14,639
work with you guys like how do you guys

682
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,019
come up with you know the new breeder or

683
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,179
whatever like because you guys are out

684
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:19,619
in Australia so there's only maybe a

685
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:22,019
couple people that have had my seeds out

686
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:23,879
there so is it for like continental US

687
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:25,440
is this out in Australia or like how do

688
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,520
you guys come up with the with the

689
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,460
winners or whatever

690
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:33,240
great question we are um largely

691
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:35,400
speaking an international show and I uh

692
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,500
you put me in the hot seat here largely

693
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:40,380
speaking the awards are determined by

694
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:42,179
both myself and I have uh James Bean of

695
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,559
seeds here now one of our grateful

696
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:46,080
sponsors

697
00:25:43,558 --> 00:25:48,418
um he also helps guide the selection a

698
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:52,259
bit but I think together we were both so

699
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:54,360
blown away by how well uh superbooth AKA

700
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:57,119
blockberry has done over the past year

701
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:59,579
that it was sort of undeniable that um

702
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:01,678
you know amongst all the people who were

703
00:25:59,579 --> 00:26:03,480
not already really well known breeders

704
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,519
that you you certainly have elevated

705
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,599
yourself to that level and as a quick

706
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:08,460
caveat

707
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:11,099
um one of my one of my buddies on

708
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:13,798
Instagram osgrown he's been he's got

709
00:26:11,099 --> 00:26:15,658
this beautiful cut of the blockberry f1s

710
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:17,759
and and I have to acknowledge he was

711
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:19,020
part of what put me on to that because I

712
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:21,000
was like this looks interesting and then

713
00:26:19,019 --> 00:26:23,519
and then it just all exploded have you

714
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,460
found um that sort of organic growth has

715
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:29,579
been the reception you've got yeah so

716
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:30,720
here's the thing that guy I I'm pretty

717
00:26:29,579 --> 00:26:33,119
positive I know who you're talking about

718
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,120
so he was like one of maybe two people

719
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:38,639
out in Australia to get the seeds so uh

720
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:40,500
initially that whole project wasn't

721
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,659
supposed to be a project it was just

722
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,798
something for me personally so going

723
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:45,659
back to what you and I were talking

724
00:26:43,798 --> 00:26:48,119
about a little earlier is that um when I

725
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:50,700
first started I bought some seed packs I

726
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:52,439
just wanted to kind of dip my toe in to

727
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:54,360
see if I liked it you know what I mean

728
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,159
like I've grown a little bit as a kid we

729
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:57,418
would just throw bag seeds out out in

730
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,220
the yard but all my plants would always

731
00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:00,419
get stolen I was a little kid probably

732
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,500
talked about it you know what I mean so

733
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:03,900
somebody would always Rob your house

734
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:05,759
steal it steal your plants so I never

735
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:08,640
ever got to actually

736
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:10,500
um Harvest anything so in in California

737
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,140
I'm in Southern California so in

738
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,759
California it went like fully legal so I

739
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:16,440
was like all right well now nobody

740
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:18,419
should be stealing my plants right so

741
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,940
bought some seed packs and I was like

742
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:23,038
man this is crazy to me they were 150

743
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:24,360
bucks for a seed pack and I was like we

744
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:26,879
used to get these things for free like

745
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:28,379
you know what I mean nobody wanted seeds

746
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,320
so I was like well I'm gonna I'm gonna

747
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:34,620
buy these so I bought two packs about uh

748
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:37,079
it was like papaya OG from uh Ani seeds

749
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:39,839
and then I bought um triangle Kush from

750
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:41,339
sea junkie so I bought those and then

751
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:43,259
planted them went through my whole thing

752
00:27:41,339 --> 00:27:44,579
and then you know piece by piece got

753
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:46,079
bigger and bigger started growing more

754
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:47,939
and more and then went indoors because

755
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:49,918
Outdoors was just a

756
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:51,600
bug Fest it was just it was just a lot

757
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,679
of work wasn't give you know grew kind

758
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:55,139
of Booth you know what I mean didn't

759
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:56,460
have a market for it so

760
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:59,100
um

761
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:00,659
but based on the fact that those seeds

762
00:27:59,099 --> 00:28:04,259
were so expensive to me I was like 15

763
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:05,880
for one seed so uh maybe on my second or

764
00:28:04,259 --> 00:28:07,980
third pack I bought Tropicana cookies

765
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:10,559
and then I bought um the black cherry

766
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:12,720
punch from uh in-house Tropicana cookies

767
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:15,538
another Oni and uh Harry Palms creation

768
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,759
so I bought those found a male of the

769
00:28:15,538 --> 00:28:20,640
triangle or excuse me of the uh

770
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:22,798
of the Tropicana cookies and I was like

771
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,940
I'm just gonna make my own seeds that's

772
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:25,558
so that's how that whole project

773
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:28,440
happened I was like this is so expensive

774
00:28:25,558 --> 00:28:30,298
they're freaking 15 per seed I'm gonna

775
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:33,298
make thousands of them for free and then

776
00:28:30,298 --> 00:28:35,759
that's it so basically just you know

777
00:28:33,298 --> 00:28:37,200
found this Banger mail threw it on this

778
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:39,119
like to me it was like the terpiest

779
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,580
black cherry punch that I had

780
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:43,859
you know had them do their thing and I

781
00:28:41,579 --> 00:28:45,599
just got you know however many seeds but

782
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:48,119
that's how that project happened it

783
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:50,278
wasn't supposed to be anything other

784
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:51,899
than just like a personal fun project

785
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:53,460
and I was just like cool I'm just gonna

786
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,080
Bank these and I probably was never

787
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,819
gonna pop them to be honest with you I

788
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:58,798
was just I just had them and then that

789
00:28:56,819 --> 00:29:00,778
started my whole thing so I started like

790
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:02,400
I would collect all kinds of seeds I was

791
00:29:00,778 --> 00:29:04,440
kind of like a I wouldn't say Pokemon

792
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,720
but like a record collector for seeds

793
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,159
you know that was a true sea junkie so I

794
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,500
started buying all these seeds and all

795
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:13,679
this [ __ ] and then uh that guy mobile

796
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:17,099
Jay and I were friends on Instagram

797
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:20,038
so we would trade seeds essentially

798
00:29:17,099 --> 00:29:22,500
and so in one of those trades I I gave

799
00:29:20,038 --> 00:29:24,480
them like five of my my little project

800
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:26,700
didn't have a name or anything like that

801
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,500
so he actually popped them so if it

802
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,240
wasn't for him I would have never popped

803
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,220
him so he popped them threw them in the

804
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,140
back of like his Warehouse or his his

805
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:35,819
basement I think at the time

806
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:37,200
and then he's like bro you gotta you

807
00:29:35,819 --> 00:29:39,119
gotta check this out dude these things

808
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,860
are these things are crazy like he just

809
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:42,658
he forgot about him and then he started

810
00:29:40,859 --> 00:29:44,219
sending me videos like holy [ __ ] and

811
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:45,600
looked like a lot better than a lot of

812
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:47,819
the stuff that we had been going through

813
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:49,980
and growing I was like God damn so I got

814
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:52,619
to pop my seeds right so he kind of

815
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:54,839
started the whole thing he was like

816
00:29:52,619 --> 00:29:57,298
the pr he would uh I I kind of like it

817
00:29:54,839 --> 00:30:00,359
into like a dojo and me being like Deo

818
00:29:57,298 --> 00:30:01,918
Farms so he was like the hype man he was

819
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:04,019
the guy that started selling all the

820
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,480
Clones he named it superboof I never

821
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:07,500
named that that's a little side topic

822
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,480
but

823
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:11,099
um he called it super boob it's kind of

824
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:14,099
like a joke he's like razzing me a bit

825
00:30:11,099 --> 00:30:15,480
you know and then he started cutting

826
00:30:14,099 --> 00:30:17,519
them out sending them to everybody and

827
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,019
he's in Michigan so he started the whole

828
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:20,398
thing in Michigan he was just like you

829
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:21,720
guys got to get that he was selling them

830
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:24,000
clones and everything so that's kind of

831
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,319
how it spread and then from there I

832
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,159
popped my own seeds in my own little

833
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:28,379
hunt

834
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,539
got my breeder cut and then that's kind

835
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:33,419
of how the whole thing started and then

836
00:30:30,538 --> 00:30:35,099
the seeds coming to you guys like I like

837
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:37,620
I said I didn't have I only had like one

838
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:39,418
plant and it wasn't like a you know it

839
00:30:37,619 --> 00:30:41,879
wasn't supposed to be a project per se

840
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:43,140
but then like people started seeing all

841
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,278
the stuff on Instagram and mobile J

842
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,600
started getting a bigger and bigger

843
00:30:44,278 --> 00:30:47,460
following and so like all kinds of

844
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:48,839
people started hitting me up so I was

845
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:51,120
like [ __ ] it what I mean they're just

846
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:52,319
gonna sit in my fridge anyways right so

847
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:54,239
I was like might as well get these out

848
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:55,019
to the World by the time I'll go through

849
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,579
these

850
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,839
I'll be 100 years old you know what I

851
00:30:56,579 --> 00:30:59,398
mean like there was no way I was ever

852
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:00,959
going to have time to pop all of them

853
00:30:59,398 --> 00:31:02,939
plus all the stacks of seed that I

854
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,620
collected so that's how I started

855
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:06,298
selling um and then I remember the guy

856
00:31:04,619 --> 00:31:08,099
in Australia there was like two guys I

857
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:10,798
think but yeah he actually popped him so

858
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:12,778
he has he has his own uh Finos by the

859
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:15,058
way so his aren't super boof and his

860
00:31:12,778 --> 00:31:16,980
aren't my breeder I keep telling people

861
00:31:15,058 --> 00:31:19,500
Mike there's so many bangers in there so

862
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:22,679
Jay he found his super boob cut off of

863
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:24,898
five seeds I also did five seeds and uh

864
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:27,059
I got my breeder cut and I think I got

865
00:31:24,898 --> 00:31:29,699
like two or three males one was and then

866
00:31:27,058 --> 00:31:32,700
and mine was by by default I had a

867
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:33,899
female that hermed and then that was it

868
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:37,019
and then the other one was the breeder

869
00:31:33,898 --> 00:31:39,538
cut I was like sweet and then his he he

870
00:31:37,019 --> 00:31:41,038
had uh mobile J had like three females

871
00:31:39,538 --> 00:31:42,599
two males and then you said all three

872
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:43,798
were bangers but he only kept the one

873
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:46,439
because he didn't have room or something

874
00:31:43,798 --> 00:31:48,119
like that wow what what an organic story

875
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,500
but yeah so you guys have your you guys

876
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:51,479
actually have your own stuff out there

877
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,038
that's different from mine and from the

878
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,778
super Booth cut so you guys have your

879
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:56,398
own stuff so I'm I'm excited to try it

880
00:31:54,778 --> 00:31:59,159
too if I ever get out to Australia for

881
00:31:56,398 --> 00:32:00,418
sure yeah right on you know and uh it

882
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:02,940
goes without saying huge shout out

883
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:05,159
osgrown the the homie down under who's

884
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:07,320
uh growing those out it's him yeah it

885
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:09,600
looks beautiful and and that story so

886
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:11,700
much about that which is so organic and

887
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:13,740
beautiful and it speaks to the fact that

888
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:16,259
you know some of the best strains are

889
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:18,120
not exactly all fully planned out on

890
00:32:16,259 --> 00:32:19,379
paper and you know sometimes they're

891
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:21,538
just these sort of little happy

892
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:24,059
accidents yep I'd love to quickly ask

893
00:32:21,538 --> 00:32:26,158
you what stimulated you to change the

894
00:32:24,058 --> 00:32:28,440
name from superbooth to blockberry

895
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:31,320
never change the name so I actually

896
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:34,259
called it blockberry and he didn't like

897
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:37,500
that name he being mobile J so he and

898
00:32:34,259 --> 00:32:40,619
since he was like the the uh the uh uh

899
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:43,079
what's his name the DJ Khaled he's I

900
00:32:40,619 --> 00:32:44,699
guess he's like the DJ so yeah him being

901
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:47,038
the hype man him being you know he

902
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:48,419
already had like way more followers than

903
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:49,619
I did he was like that was what he was

904
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:51,419
doing just for his career you know what

905
00:32:49,619 --> 00:32:53,519
I mean he was the one that named it

906
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:55,140
super Booth I never named it that it was

907
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:57,298
never supposed to be that initially it

908
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:59,520
was a joke

909
00:32:57,298 --> 00:33:01,200
um and then the name stuck and now it's

910
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,058
kind of in the Lexicon now so at this

911
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,038
point I don't have any

912
00:33:03,058 --> 00:33:06,298
um ego about it like I can call it

913
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:08,819
whatever you want you know what I mean

914
00:33:06,298 --> 00:33:11,339
like I don't it is what it is it's

915
00:33:08,819 --> 00:33:12,960
already out there but you know I just

916
00:33:11,339 --> 00:33:15,359
want to make sure that people know that

917
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,640
that actually wasn't the name he named

918
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:19,079
it that as like a Razz and then but yeah

919
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,340
so Blackberry was the initial name and

920
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:22,199
he said he's like that name sucks

921
00:33:20,339 --> 00:33:23,339
because like we were like he was like a

922
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,659
little brother you know what I mean it's

923
00:33:23,339 --> 00:33:25,980
kind of like a little a little bratty

924
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:27,899
brother like when we first started like

925
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:29,640
yeah hanging out kicking it you know

926
00:33:27,898 --> 00:33:32,398
what I mean but yeah

927
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:34,259
um so he he named it that I never named

928
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:36,359
it that there you go I love it that

929
00:33:34,259 --> 00:33:38,579
makes sense that makes sense

930
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:40,439
um and I would love to ask you I saw

931
00:33:38,579 --> 00:33:42,658
recently you put a post up talking about

932
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,519
having gotten some of the F ones back

933
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:46,919
and maybe doing some future Line work

934
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:49,140
yes yeah tell me a bit about that Did

935
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:50,580
you sort of accidentally lose them and

936
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:54,120
then get them back or how did that all

937
00:33:50,579 --> 00:33:55,798
work no so yeah so I sold you know

938
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:57,239
basically the bulk of them off because

939
00:33:55,798 --> 00:33:59,398
like I said there just sitting in my

940
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,839
fridge and I was like I already have my

941
00:33:59,398 --> 00:34:02,278
winner you know what I mean I was like I

942
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:03,599
don't really need to do anything besides

943
00:34:02,278 --> 00:34:06,298
this

944
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:09,118
um but I know so from the black cherry

945
00:34:06,298 --> 00:34:10,500
punch there was uh it had blueberry

946
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:15,358
bread Terps it was like blueberry

947
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:16,679
muffins it was insane so uh most of the

948
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:18,779
Blackberry

949
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:21,059
um I guess venos from what I have uh

950
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:22,560
they have Tangy Terps right so but I

951
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:25,980
know that they're the blueberry outliers

952
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:27,119
because uh Jay had one he said dude he's

953
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,338
like I had one he's like I should have

954
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:31,858
never tossed it so I'm looking for the

955
00:34:29,338 --> 00:34:33,838
blueberry Terps right so anyhow so I

956
00:34:31,858 --> 00:34:35,940
gave and sold out pretty much all my

957
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:37,619
seeds I had I think I kept like 30 or 40

958
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:39,780
for myself

959
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:41,820
um and then those 40 that I got back or

960
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:44,399
those ones that I got back were from a

961
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:45,599
homie in the Bay Area that I sent to

962
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:46,980
um because like I said at first it was

963
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,000
just it was just a passion project you

964
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:50,099
know what I mean so I was just giving

965
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,918
them out to homies like here dude pop

966
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:55,200
them right so I sent him like 40 seeds

967
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:57,900
and then he he hit me up and he was like

968
00:34:55,199 --> 00:35:00,059
hey man I still have those seeds like if

969
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:01,680
you want to do a hunt and I was like

970
00:35:00,059 --> 00:35:03,480
[ __ ] yeah so then he sent them back so

971
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:05,159
that's how it happened so

972
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:08,159
um currently just so you know I'm doing

973
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:09,480

974
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:11,279

975
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:13,679
do some s1s of the Blackberry so and

976
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,480

977
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:17,519

Femmes right so I'm gonna do that and

979
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:21,059
then the F2 I've got a couple Femme

980
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:23,819
projects on the way and then after that

981
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:27,179
I'm gonna be looking for some f2s so

982
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:29,640
it'll be probably next year by the time

983
00:35:27,179 --> 00:35:32,519
I find something but they're coming

984
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:33,900
beautiful I love that and uh yeah it

985
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:35,759
certainly seems like there's a lot of

986
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:37,440
demand for Femmes at the moment and you

987
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,720
you gave me a perfect segue because I

988
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,519
wanted to ask you I noticed you did work

989
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:43,379
with some other males one of them that

990
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:45,000
caught my eye was uh the blueberry

991
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:47,400
frosting can you tell us a little bit

992
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,039
about that one oh yeah so that's from a

993
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:53,880
guy he's uh his uh his handle on ideas

994
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:55,500
Party Time Farms so uh same kind of

995
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:57,838
thing like we've been kind of homies

996
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:59,280
through Instagram

997
00:35:57,838 --> 00:36:01,380
um I don't know what happened but

998
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,940
somehow we started chatting and I was

999
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:05,700
talking to him about getting blueberry

1000
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:08,880
Terps right blueberry are great and then

1001
00:36:05,699 --> 00:36:09,838
uh he was like oh I got this mail he was

1002
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,220
basically just telling me about it and

1003
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:12,838
he was like he's like I'll send you some

1004
00:36:11,219 --> 00:36:15,480
I'll send you some pollen I was like no

1005
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:18,000
way so he ended up sending me some flour

1006
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,980
some pollen and like a [ __ ] ton of his

1007
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,480
new blueberry frosting crosses I was

1008
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:23,820
like dude thank you so much like he's

1009
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,659
such he's such a badass he just sent it

1010
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:26,940
to me

1011
00:36:24,659 --> 00:36:28,259
um most people talk a good game in this

1012
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:29,820
industry you know what I mean but they

1013
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:31,619
never do [ __ ] so this guy actually did

1014
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:33,900
it I was like wow so and then you know

1015
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:36,358
anyhow so that's where I got the pollen

1016
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:39,358
from and the blueberry frosting I

1017
00:36:36,358 --> 00:36:41,400
believe is like Wedding Crasher crossed

1018
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:42,960
with blueberry cookies form cut or

1019
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:45,180
something like that but that's his

1020
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,260
creation so we just did it as like a

1021
00:36:45,179 --> 00:36:48,059
collab I was like here I'll just give

1022
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:50,520
you seeds you know what I mean so it was

1023
00:36:48,059 --> 00:36:53,039
kind of real it was really loose

1024
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:55,500
um crazy part is he just took off I

1025
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:57,179
think he's in like Columbia now he's not

1026
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,800
even I've been hitting him up like dude

1027
00:36:57,179 --> 00:37:01,739
where can I send you these seeds

1028
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,839
ghost but uh yeah so that's that's how

1029
00:37:01,739 --> 00:37:05,939
that uh that project kind of started in

1030
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:08,880
um turns out

1031
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:11,159
I crossed the holly berry which is ice

1032
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,019
cream cake crossed with Blackberry I

1033
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:15,118
crossed that with the blueberry frosting

1034
00:37:13,019 --> 00:37:16,679
and it does have blueberry Terps so I'm

1035
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,119
like super excited about it so I still

1036
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:20,159
have some uh some of that pollen I'm

1037
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:22,920
gonna do and use on some other strains

1038
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:25,319
but uh yeah I'm excited for that one for

1039
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,900
sure that's incredible and you've you've

1040
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:30,059
got me wondering as time gone has gone

1041
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:31,858
by I've realized more and more that

1042
00:37:30,059 --> 00:37:33,539
largely speaking you can divide people

1043
00:37:31,858 --> 00:37:35,338
into sort of you know this is very

1044
00:37:33,539 --> 00:37:36,960
simplistic but two camps of flavor

1045
00:37:35,338 --> 00:37:38,578
people are either more into the gassy

1046
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,500
stuff or more into the fruity stuff

1047
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:42,300
sounds like you're like myself and

1048
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,679
you're more into the fruity stuff is

1049
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:46,619
that how you would put it or is it not

1050
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:48,299
quite that clear-cut oh no I did a full

1051
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:50,338
gas line

1052
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:54,599
um it hasn't taken off because people

1053
00:37:50,338 --> 00:37:56,578
haven't popped the seeds and I'm like uh

1054
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:59,099
I keep doing more and more seed projects

1055
00:37:56,579 --> 00:38:00,839
so I haven't got to hunt them myself but

1056
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:02,940
I did this whole triangle Kush cross

1057
00:38:00,838 --> 00:38:04,858
line and it was from the actual triangle

1058
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:07,920
kush for my very first CPAC from sea

1059
00:38:04,858 --> 00:38:10,139
junkie it was a triangle Kush bx1

1060
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:13,500
um so I do have some super gnarly gas

1061
00:38:10,139 --> 00:38:15,000
right now uh that I did hunt so I've got

1062
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,679
um I don't know if you've heard of the

1063
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,239
soap so I crossed the soap to Triangle

1064
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:21,239
Kush that's one of them it's like super

1065
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:24,959
gnarly I also have a

1066
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:27,838
it's gorilla butter F2 AKA white truffle

1067
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,760
cut I did that I crossed it with uh

1068
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:32,400
blackberry and then I only got a couple

1069
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:35,280
seeds out of it popped that and then I

1070
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,660
crossed that to Triangle Kush and then I

1071
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,240
only got a couple seeds out of that as

1072
00:38:36,659 --> 00:38:41,819
well so I have that one it's insane just

1073
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:44,279
heavy heavy gas so

1074
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:45,900
um no I don't just like Fruity it just

1075
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,579
kind of is something that kind of

1076
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:49,440
started off that way

1077
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:51,420
um and I still have a lot of gas [ __ ]

1078
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,639
that I'm working on right now

1079
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:55,920
um so it's not yeah it's it's basically

1080
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:57,299
what I'm gonna try and do is honestly

1081
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,220
now at this stage

1082
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,599
I have it all mapped out of my head

1083
00:38:59,219 --> 00:39:02,459
hopefully it works

1084
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:04,800
um I need to make strains that everybody

1085
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:06,780
can grow I don't want to make it to

1086
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,579
where they're hard or finicky or you

1087
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:10,800
have to be able to do a b and c to get

1088
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:12,180
it to yield or look right a lot of the

1089
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,800
strains out there especially the hype

1090
00:39:12,179 --> 00:39:15,059
strains either they don't yield or

1091
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,460
whatever there's always something right

1092
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:19,259
they don't check all the boxes so I'm

1093
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:21,300
working with a local facility here in

1094
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:22,500
San Diego and

1095
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,940
um they're you know professional

1096
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:26,820
facility they're they're on the legal

1097
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:29,220
side and they actually hit almost four

1098
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:31,920
light with my with my breeder cut and

1099
00:39:29,219 --> 00:39:33,118
that's insane the the main guy there is

1100
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,800
like dude I've been growing for 20 plus

1101
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:38,099
years I've never had anything like this

1102
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:41,099
in my life so if I can get something to

1103
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:43,680
get three ish per light three pounds per

1104
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:45,180
light with every type of terp profile

1105
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:47,819
like that's it that's what I'm trying to

1106
00:39:45,179 --> 00:39:49,440
do so I look for certain things I want

1107
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:51,660
to make it so like and if you talk to

1108
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,099
anybody blockberry slash superbooth

1109
00:39:51,659 --> 00:39:55,920
whatever it's like the easiest plant

1110
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:58,440
they've ever grown it yields super heavy

1111
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,960
it's got great Vigor structure Etc

1112
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,639
the flowers great tastes great smells

1113
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,858
great you know what I mean so basically

1114
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:05,759
what I'm trying to do at this stage is

1115
00:40:04,858 --> 00:40:07,739
make

1116
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,260
already got the orange Terps right so

1117
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:12,179
that's already or Tangerine whatever so

1118
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,859
I got the Tangy trips down now I got the

1119
00:40:12,179 --> 00:40:15,419
grapes or the or excuse me the

1120
00:40:13,858 --> 00:40:18,420
blueberries I'm gonna try and do some

1121
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:20,519
grapes uh maybe papaya and that'll be

1122
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:21,900
pretty much it for the fruits and then

1123
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:24,179
I'm just gonna do a bunch of different

1124
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:26,700
gas ones and if everything works out the

1125
00:40:24,179 --> 00:40:28,679
way I hope it will then you know what I

1126
00:40:26,699 --> 00:40:30,480
mean then it's gonna be like production

1127
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:32,098
strains left and right everybody's gonna

1128
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,440
be stoked so that's that's the plan

1129
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:35,760
we'll see if it happens because breeding

1130
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:38,338
you never really know what you're gonna

1131
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,180
get you know what I mean but you can

1132
00:40:38,338 --> 00:40:41,099
hope

1133
00:40:39,179 --> 00:40:44,159
yeah that that's brilliant and you sort

1134
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:47,039
of got me thinking you know it sounds as

1135
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:48,899
though you're helping step us out of the

1136
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:50,579
metaphorical Corner that some people

1137
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,900
believe we're in in terms of like you

1138
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:53,460
know the hype strands are just getting

1139
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:56,460
smaller yielding and they're not great

1140
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:59,699
and they are you know yeah right and so

1141
00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:02,280
I I wanted to know do you think that um

1142
00:40:59,699 --> 00:41:03,838
this sort of strains you're making that

1143
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,859
are you know yielding better and easier

1144
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:06,059
to grow do you think they're going to

1145
00:41:04,858 --> 00:41:07,500
become more popular or do you think

1146
00:41:06,059 --> 00:41:10,199
that's just something only you will

1147
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:12,539
probably be able to do

1148
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:14,098
um here's the here's the thing that I've

1149
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:16,800
been seeing too exactly what you just

1150
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:19,859
said all I see a lot of people doing

1151
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,359
that are current breeders are they just

1152
00:41:19,858 --> 00:41:23,759
cross hype strained hype strain and

1153
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:25,920
that's it and then all these pictures

1154
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,740
that I'll see there's these tiny little

1155
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:31,740
Frosty buds uh like satellite sites

1156
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:33,899
gangly and I'm just like I don't I don't

1157
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:36,299
get it like for me I want to grow best

1158
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:38,160
dreams what I want to do personally this

1159
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:40,320
is what I do is like I'll look for the

1160
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:41,940
Beast right that like has a big old

1161
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:43,619
frame structure

1162
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:45,838
Etc right I wanted to check pretty much

1163
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:47,460
every single box and then I want to pair

1164
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:48,599
it with something that has maybe a

1165
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:50,220
little bit of different terp or whatever

1166
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:52,320
so I'll look for something that has a

1167
00:41:50,219 --> 00:41:53,699
weakness and oh this one has that

1168
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:55,200
weakness in it so they'll breed those

1169
00:41:53,699 --> 00:41:57,419
two that's kind of the way I look at it

1170
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:58,379
so blueberry processing I don't think

1171
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:00,838
anybody's ever heard of this because

1172
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:02,220
it's not a hype stream right Halle Berry

1173
00:42:00,838 --> 00:42:04,739
I created

1174
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:06,179
um there's I'm not reading height strain

1175
00:42:04,739 --> 00:42:08,279
the height strain although I'm going to

1176
00:42:06,179 --> 00:42:09,598
have to uh at some point you know what I

1177
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:11,940
mean to sell some seeds about want

1178
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:14,460
because that's what people want but I'm

1179
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:16,920
gonna basically have to use a bunch of

1180
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:18,838
[ __ ] that nobody's ever heard of or that

1181
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:21,358
nobody gives a [ __ ] about because I know

1182
00:42:18,838 --> 00:42:23,099
that it's gonna contribute so to answer

1183
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:24,659
your question yeah eventually

1184
00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:27,180
um in terms of

1185
00:42:24,659 --> 00:42:30,659
on the legal side here everybody needs

1186
00:42:27,179 --> 00:42:32,338
yield prices of tax here in in uh

1187
00:42:30,659 --> 00:42:36,480
California and America in general are

1188
00:42:32,338 --> 00:42:38,699
going down so the days of these one to

1189
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,980
two pound Delight super Frosty little

1190
00:42:38,699 --> 00:42:43,139
buds are gonna be over like people can't

1191
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:45,059
get by anymore so they need to maximize

1192
00:42:43,139 --> 00:42:46,920
their space that's why I want to make it

1193
00:42:45,059 --> 00:42:49,078
so it's like they can grow it because

1194
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:51,240
here's the other key thing as a breeder

1195
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:53,400
people will look at your [ __ ] and

1196
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:54,598
they'll maybe they suck as a grower I

1197
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:57,180
don't know what they're doing right so

1198
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:58,318
like if I can make it shine and I'd beat

1199
00:42:57,179 --> 00:43:00,659
it up because I'd go through all this

1200
00:42:58,318 --> 00:43:02,159
testing and whatnot make it you know try

1201
00:43:00,659 --> 00:43:04,318
to [ __ ] it up as hard as I can to make

1202
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:06,838
sure it's stable and then if I can make

1203
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:08,880
it shine and I want everybody to make a

1204
00:43:06,838 --> 00:43:11,039
chime and so certain people will start

1205
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,420
talking [ __ ] on the breeder even though

1206
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:14,460
they may or may not know what the [ __ ]

1207
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:15,838
they're doing right so so I want to make

1208
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:17,940
it to where it's virtually impossible

1209
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:19,078
for them to [ __ ] it up you know what I

1210
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:21,300
mean yeah because they're always gonna

1211
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:22,859
be like oh it harmed well maybe maybe

1212
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:24,300
it's because you made it her you know

1213
00:43:22,858 --> 00:43:25,858
what I mean or did this or did do that

1214
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,480
whatever like maybe it's because of you

1215
00:43:25,858 --> 00:43:29,699
maybe it's because of me maybe you know

1216
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,318
but I want to make sure before that it's

1217
00:43:29,699 --> 00:43:32,879
going to be like as easy to grow as

1218
00:43:31,318 --> 00:43:35,159
possible so that everybody can have

1219
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,920
success from the small hobbyist tent

1220
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:39,480
grower to the you know facilities and

1221
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,159
then in the production strain world

1222
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,539
they're going to need these heavy

1223
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:45,779
yielding strains that check all the

1224
00:43:42,539 --> 00:43:48,480
boxes to stay afloat wow yeah brilliant

1225
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:50,940
stuff I love that there's a specific

1226
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,679
conscious focus on trying to make it

1227
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:56,159
easier for the grower and every point

1228
00:43:52,679 --> 00:43:57,899
you said is uh a totally relevant but

1229
00:43:56,159 --> 00:43:59,578
it's interesting because as you said you

1230
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:01,500
know other breeders May recognize some

1231
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:03,480
of those issues but maybe not

1232
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,739
necessarily actively trying to combat

1233
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:06,119
them through their breeding so that's

1234
00:44:04,739 --> 00:44:08,039
really cool to hear

1235
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:09,539
honestly don't see I don't yeah I

1236
00:44:08,039 --> 00:44:11,400
honestly don't see anything like I just

1237
00:44:09,539 --> 00:44:14,039
saw a clone drop today from

1238
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,539
um compound genetics and like their

1239
00:44:14,039 --> 00:44:17,099
their picture that they're showing it

1240
00:44:15,539 --> 00:44:18,779
just looks like a little baby Bud looks

1241
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:20,220
like a side branch and I'm like damn

1242
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:22,319
that's like the best picture that they

1243
00:44:20,219 --> 00:44:24,000
have and they're putting that as like

1244
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:27,059
you know here's our cone drop Etc I'm

1245
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,260
like damn like to me just already I just

1246
00:44:27,059 --> 00:44:29,639
wouldn't get it you know what I mean I'm

1247
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:31,200
like I don't

1248
00:44:29,639 --> 00:44:32,460
because I know it's not going to yield

1249
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:35,279
you know what I mean I'm like and

1250
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:36,300
everybody and so I'm you know yeah but

1251
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,180
yeah you're right man everybody

1252
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:40,859
everybody I don't think anybody

1253
00:44:39,179 --> 00:44:42,719
I don't know what's in everybody's head

1254
00:44:40,858 --> 00:44:44,578
but from what I see from the end

1255
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:46,318
products it's literally just hype

1256
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:48,420
strained hype strain and a lot of it is

1257
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:49,619
not even like I don't know what they're

1258
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,818
thinking you know what I mean like I

1259
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:51,960
just don't know I think a lot of people

1260
00:44:50,818 --> 00:44:53,400
are just throwing [ __ ] against the wall

1261
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:55,139
to see if it sticks I don't know if they

1262
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,780
have plans or not

1263
00:44:55,139 --> 00:44:59,519
um but yeah I don't I try to just stay

1264
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:01,319
in my own lane I was trying to do you

1265
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:03,358
know what I'm doing so

1266
00:45:01,318 --> 00:45:04,380
um but yeah a lot of hype to Hype so

1267
00:45:03,358 --> 00:45:07,078
that's what I'm trying to stay away from

1268
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:08,640
man that's brilliant I love that and um

1269
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:11,339
I think we're gonna have to definitely

1270
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:13,858
get you on for a sort of extended show

1271
00:45:11,338 --> 00:45:16,980
on on your your work I'd love to chat

1272
00:45:13,858 --> 00:45:18,480
more I think that that pretty much sums

1273
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:20,818
up the questions I had for you in

1274
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,920
regards to this award in terms of the

1275
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:24,599
final thing I'd love to know what do you

1276
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:27,119
think is going to be the next big flavor

1277
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:29,940
that's going to dominate the industry oh

1278
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:32,760
that's it yeah that's a good one so

1279
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:34,019
basically from where it stands now at

1280
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:38,099
least here

1281
00:45:34,019 --> 00:45:42,059
um everybody likes gas it seems right uh

1282
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:43,619
and and nobody likes or everybody has

1283
00:45:42,059 --> 00:45:44,818
their own flavors of this let's let's

1284
00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:46,440
just say that everybody likes their own

1285
00:45:44,818 --> 00:45:48,779
flavors so

1286
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:53,400
what everybody I think wants currently

1287
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:55,920
right now is a is a gassy candy strain

1288
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:58,500
that also you so but those don't really

1289
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,539
exist usually there's going to be like

1290
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:03,179
the gassy strains are usually like lower

1291
00:46:00,539 --> 00:46:06,000
yielding from from my experience

1292
00:46:03,179 --> 00:46:08,098
um harder to grow uh sometimes they

1293
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,239
don't look that great and then you know

1294
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:10,680
what I mean so it's hard so they

1295
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:12,598
basically want The Best of Both Worlds

1296
00:46:10,679 --> 00:46:14,639
so somebody want I think the newest

1297
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:17,460
thing will be whoever comes up with like

1298
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:19,679
this candy gassy super heavy yielding

1299
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:22,980
covered in trichomes that also has power

1300
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:24,659
right that's the other key thing like

1301
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:26,039
a lot of these strains they'd say oh

1302
00:46:24,659 --> 00:46:28,139
they're not they're not that powerful or

1303
00:46:26,039 --> 00:46:30,119
whatever it'll check like three boxes

1304
00:46:28,139 --> 00:46:32,159
you know what I mean so

1305
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:35,280
um in terms of the terp profile it's a

1306
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:36,838
candy gas like a still fruit but like

1307
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,160
heavy gas if that's even I don't even

1308
00:46:36,838 --> 00:46:39,659
know if it's possible though you know

1309
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:41,159
like I've had some stuff that kind of

1310
00:46:39,659 --> 00:46:43,259
almost checks those boxes but it doesn't

1311
00:46:41,159 --> 00:46:45,299
doesn't check them all so I think that's

1312
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:46,560
going to be the next wave but I don't

1313
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,839
know man it's kind of like asking like

1314
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:50,639
you know does everybody like ipas you

1315

um so we've been with him for a long

1400
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:13,858
time anyhow uh and it's cool just to see

1401
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:17,220
his work evolve and

1402
00:50:13,858 --> 00:50:19,318

1407
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:27,960
I'm not surprised right like it's just

1408
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:29,880
it's you'd be surprised if you if they

didn't have one of my Scouts and then in

1410

um so this is kind of cool to to mention

1412
00:50:33,358 --> 00:50:37,500

1413
00:50:35,818 --> 00:50:39,480
Mike had a lot of good drops with us had

1414

um the uh the uh red pop drop and the

1417
00:50:43,858 --> 00:50:48,058
red wrench drop but for me this year it

1418
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:51,838
definitely is going to be the Crickets

1419

he ran out of the first one so he did

1454
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,940
another one

1455
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:01,260
um and it's been two months and three

1456
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:03,059
months in the making

1457
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:06,559
uh so

1458
00:52:03,059 --> 00:52:10,800
we'll have that uh he has that rs11

1459
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:13,079
rainbow shirt not not roadkill skunk uh

1460
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:15,359
uh so those were two two really good

1461
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:17,460
drops but uh where where are you going

1462
00:52:15,358 --> 00:52:19,139
with this one yeah I was gonna say shout

1463
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:22,260
out Grandma glad to hear you're doing

1464
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:25,318
well after the surgery I think that um

1465
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:28,319
overall for this year the winner for me

1466
00:52:25,318 --> 00:52:31,500
was was pretty obvious and it feels like

1467
00:52:28,318 --> 00:52:33,358
almost sandbagging a bit but the hottest

1468
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:35,579
air dropper this year I think is

1469
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:39,000
undeniably Chris compounds apples and

1470
00:52:35,579 --> 00:52:41,640
bananas its success was simply

1471
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,500
unparalleled the compound drop garnered

1472
00:52:41,639 --> 00:52:46,440
a huge amount of support and attention

1473
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:49,619
even featuring nft drops to accompany

1474
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:51,780
them and some top shelf pricing the

1475
00:52:49,619 --> 00:52:53,760
drops sold out extremely quickly and

1476
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:56,099
from what we both saw at the emerald cup

1477
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:59,220
had people lining up around the corner

1478
00:52:56,099 --> 00:53:01,859
for it high times has in fact recently

1479
00:52:59,219 --> 00:53:04,919
named Pink certs its strain of the year

1480
00:53:01,858 --> 00:53:06,960
for 2022 which was included in this

1481
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:08,460
apples and bananas drop other notable

1482
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,920
strains from the drop included

1483
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:13,500
gastropops which has garnered a lot of

1484
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:16,260
popularity utilizing the white runts

1485
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:18,119
mother and the overall success is a

1486
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:20,160
testament not only to the power of good

1487
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:22,260
marketing which is undeniably played a

1488
00:53:20,159 --> 00:53:25,440
role in the success but also to have

1489
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:27,480
when good marketing combined with

1490
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:29,760
quality genetics will make for something

1491
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:31,858
truly special having tried the apples

1492
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:34,559
and bananas myself I can say it's some

1493
00:53:31,858 --> 00:53:36,779
beautiful herb grapey Berry sort of hard

1494
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:39,780
to describe at the same time it

1495
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:41,280
dominates a bag and these hybrids are

1496
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:43,260
offering Growers many of the best

1497
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:45,420
qualities of both what's your thoughts

1498
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:47,400
Mr Bean apples and bananas

1499
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:48,838
uh well you know it goes back to where

1500
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,280
I've always preached and said some of

1501
00:53:48,838 --> 00:53:51,659
that some of the best guys the guys that

1502
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:53,640
can run the numbers because it's a

1503
00:53:51,659 --> 00:53:55,558
numbers game folks it really is

1504
00:53:53,639 --> 00:53:57,179
um we can all go by the same clone and

1505
00:53:55,559 --> 00:53:59,579
we're all going to have the same kind of

1506
00:53:57,179 --> 00:54:01,318
the same clone of the same thing or we

1507
00:53:59,579 --> 00:54:03,420
can run from seeds we're guaranteed

1508
00:54:01,318 --> 00:54:05,219
something uniquely ours something that

1509
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:06,838
nobody else has and it's like baseball

1510
00:54:05,219 --> 00:54:08,399
cards right you could have the you could

1511
00:54:06,838 --> 00:54:09,719
have the first five pack you could get

1512
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,519
that Babe Ruth

1513
00:54:09,719 --> 00:54:13,500
but but Hank Aaron is always out there

1514
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:15,119
or you could collect cards for 10 years

1515
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,318
and pop ten thousand beats and never get

1516
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:17,760
it right it's always out there floating

1517
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:18,838
around you there's always that better

1518
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,400
one

1519
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:21,779
um and these these breeders are these

1520
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,400
giant facilities you know they have the

1521
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:24,540
opportunity to run five thousand at a

1522
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,160
time

1523
00:54:24,539 --> 00:54:27,659
um and so when you're using that kind of

1524
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:30,000
numbers for final hunts you're able to

1525
00:54:27,659 --> 00:54:31,799
find that that that's something that

1526
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,358
something different I've always heard

1527
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:35,339
breeders say that you know if you look

1528
00:54:33,358 --> 00:54:36,900
for it it's in there don't don't overdo

1529
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:38,940
it don't keep doing the line if you it's

1530
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:40,740
it's in there just keep looking what you

1531
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:42,599
want to find is there

1532
00:54:40,739 --> 00:54:44,159
um and so I think that you know they

1533
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:46,980
have these the the ability to run these

1534
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:49,379
giant populations and see these plants

1535
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:51,179
and see the subtle differences in them

1536
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:53,099
um to see that one that really sticks

1537
00:54:51,179 --> 00:54:54,480
out you know I think that's uh it's

1538
00:54:53,099 --> 00:54:57,539
truly special and I think all the guys

1539
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:58,760
that have that ability definitely shine

1540
00:54:57,539 --> 00:55:01,858
100

1541
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:04,619
huge shout out and congratulations to

1542
00:55:01,858 --> 00:55:06,480
the apples and bananas drop by Chris of

1543
00:55:04,619 --> 00:55:08,700
compound genetics

1544
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:10,920
yeah Chris Lynch so because now the

1545
00:55:08,699 --> 00:55:12,299
compound the other there's two Chris's

1546
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:13,559
there's Chris Lynch and there's the

1547
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:15,539
other Chris which is also one of their

1548
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:17,040
scientist guys and so now they're like

1549
00:55:15,539 --> 00:55:18,779
they just did a thing on future cameras

1550
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:20,519
project they were like I said Chris with

1551
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:21,720
compound and I was like what Chris I

1552
00:55:20,519 --> 00:55:23,519
know he's along with a [ __ ] compound

1553
00:55:21,719 --> 00:55:24,779
I look at the TV and it's they keep

1554
00:55:23,519 --> 00:55:27,119
saying Chris with a compound but it's

1555
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:30,300
not Chris compound it's the other Chris

1556
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:32,519
super smart uh Chris from node Chris

1557
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:34,980
from node Labs okay interesting

1558
00:55:32,519 --> 00:55:36,960
interesting so up next we've got the

1559
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:39,000
Hall of Fame strain

1560
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:41,699
what's what's your predictions you got

1561
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,800
any got anything coming to mind for you

1562
00:55:41,699 --> 00:55:45,000
um yeah I mean I can I can talk about it

1563
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,559
like when you talk about what you want

1564
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,760
to be but I I was thinking about that

1565
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:49,800
like what would be my hall of fame

1566
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:51,720
strain but that that's just giving it up

1567
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:53,400
that was just I don't know what I would

1568
00:55:51,719 --> 00:55:57,179
do like that I would be

1569
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:59,280
you know uh like ruining a future strain

1570
00:55:57,179 --> 00:56:01,980
for us to talk about I guess that's true

1571
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:05,900
that's true no I like that angle okay so

1572
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:09,000
the Hall of Fame strain for this year is

1573
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:12,180
Haze by the Hayes Brothers in all of its

1574
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:14,699
incarnations we have certainly seen a

1575
00:56:12,179 --> 00:56:16,919
recent Resurgence of popularity for

1576
00:56:14,699 --> 00:56:18,480
Hayes I think there's initially got some

1577
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:21,059
momentum probably around the time

1578
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:23,519
Neville passed the nl5 came back into

1579
00:56:21,059 --> 00:56:25,200
the Limelight but more recently with the

1580
00:56:23,519 --> 00:56:27,960
Advent of things like the Colombian

1581
00:56:25,199 --> 00:56:30,659
black Haze or the pif as well as work by

1582
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:33,539
people like Tom Hill and Mr Bob's

1583
00:56:30,659 --> 00:56:36,420
reproduction we are seeing Hayes yet

1584
00:56:33,539 --> 00:56:39,599
again more the focus of attention in the

1585
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:41,338
Cannabis Community Zeitgeist and it's a

1586
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:44,880
strain that I think is well worthy of

1587
00:56:41,338 --> 00:56:46,679
the Hall of Fame work done by Sam and

1588
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:50,160
then the work of countless others around

1589
00:56:46,679 --> 00:56:52,799
the world the likes of old timer one and

1590
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:54,899
many other unsung heroes Hayes is a

1591
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:56,760
truly special plant I don't know if I

1592
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:58,980
can do it justice in just a few minutes

1593
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:02,760
so I hope I can cover some of the main

1594
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:04,800
points but Hayes gave birth to a wave of

1595
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:06,839
smokers who pursued the euphoric and

1596
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:10,140
cerebral effects that Hayes has become

1597
00:57:06,838 --> 00:57:12,719
iconic for it is certainly a white whale

1598
00:57:10,139 --> 00:57:15,960
in its own right claimed by countless

1599
00:57:12,719 --> 00:57:17,459
ogs to be the Pinnacle of smoking and

1600
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:20,280
combining some of the oldest building

1601
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:22,800
blocks the Cannabis genome has to offer

1602
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:25,740
Haze truly is unlike any other strain

1603
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:28,440
having countless incarnations varying

1604
00:57:25,739 --> 00:57:31,379
from mixers of pure Colombians through

1605
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:33,780
to Thai hybrids through to nl5 Haze

1606
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:37,019
hybrids it's made its mark on History

1607
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:40,140
without any doubt a recent Resurgence

1608
00:57:37,019 --> 00:57:42,780
has been brought on by several people in

1609
00:57:40,139 --> 00:57:45,118
the community notable ogs the likes of

1610
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:47,040
Tom Hill have launched into massive Haze

1611
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:49,500
funeral hunts to show everyone just how

1612
00:57:47,039 --> 00:57:52,139
Kick-Ass the keeperfino is that many

1613
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:54,358
have spoken so fondly about as well as

1614
00:57:52,139 --> 00:57:56,639
others the likes of Mr Bob who has

1615
00:57:54,358 --> 00:57:58,139
carried on the Pres Innovation work by

1616
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:59,639
continuing the Tom Hills Haze and

1617
00:57:58,139 --> 00:58:02,699
releasing it commercially as well as

1618
00:57:59,639 --> 00:58:04,980
making a haze hybrid featuring old-timer

1619
00:58:02,699 --> 00:58:06,379
ones Haze Tom Hills Haze and original

1620
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:08,818
Haze

1621
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:10,980
descending originally from the Hayes

1622
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:13,139
Brothers to Sam and then to the world

1623
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:15,300
Hayes is truly something unique

1624
00:58:13,139 --> 00:58:17,159
something in its own category and

1625
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:19,920
something clearly worthy of the Hall of

1626
00:58:17,159 --> 00:58:22,980
Fame category maybe more simply put

1627
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:25,318
Hayes rules everything around me what's

1628
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:26,940
your thoughts Mr Bean pretty awesome

1629
00:58:25,318 --> 00:58:27,900
what's that uh you know I thought we

1630
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:28,920
were going a different direction with

1631
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:30,838
that one in fact you're going for Blue

1632
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:33,000
Dream which is you know a Hades

1633
00:58:30,838 --> 00:58:36,599
derivative you could say

1634
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:37,858
um but the haze is a classic a wonderful

1635
00:58:36,599 --> 00:58:40,200
Choice

1636
00:58:37,858 --> 00:58:44,338
um the Hayes Brothers got that thing uh

1637
00:58:40,199 --> 00:58:46,019
uh 12 to 16 week strain most people

1638
00:58:44,338 --> 00:58:48,298
don't grow it out or won't grow it out

1639
00:58:46,019 --> 00:58:52,079
because they don't have the time for it

1640
00:58:48,298 --> 00:58:54,420
um super uh super huge uh like it

1641
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:55,500
stretches like no other they like it

1642
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:59,220
right

1643
00:58:55,500 --> 00:59:03,059
um so uh so it's very uh

1644
00:58:59,219 --> 00:59:04,558
you know definitely like that strong

1645
00:59:03,059 --> 00:59:05,400
um super capacity smell but it's

1646
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:06,720
definitely definitely something that's

1647
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:09,900
been worked

1648
00:59:06,719 --> 00:59:12,480
um by many people and and uh I don't

1649
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:14,900
know that many people nowadays have

1650
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:17,880
smoked a haze a lot of the new new

1651
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:19,559
smokers I don't believe have

1652
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:22,380
um because I don't believe that shops

1653
00:59:19,559 --> 00:59:24,298
pay for the hate and today's growing

1654
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:26,400
economy of you know you know that that

1655
00:59:24,298 --> 00:59:30,000
plan has to pay for its way

1656
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:31,920
um a 16-week strain or 12-week strain uh

1657
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,539
doesn't really pay its bills to be there

1658
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:35,220
next to an eight weeks train

1659
00:59:33,539 --> 00:59:39,838
you're going to pay the same price per

1660
00:59:35,219 --> 00:59:42,239
pound price per gram so uh but the hazes

1661
00:59:39,838 --> 00:59:44,338
are phenomenal um like I said it's it's

1662
00:59:42,239 --> 00:59:45,539
I just uh I don't know many people that

1663
00:59:44,338 --> 00:59:47,818
can grow them or they haven't because

1664
00:59:45,539 --> 00:59:51,358
they do take so it's such a long time

1665
00:59:47,818 --> 00:59:53,400
but it's worth the wait for sure uh that

1666
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:55,318
it is but you know what

1667
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:57,660
what is it those who are patient or

1668
00:59:55,318 --> 01:00:00,659
rewarded I'm excited to try to get into

1669
00:59:57,659 --> 01:00:03,539
some of it myself in the near future but

1670
01:00:00,659 --> 01:00:05,399
again a big congrats to the strain Haze

1671
01:00:03,539 --> 01:00:07,798
and all those associated with it so many

1672
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:09,599
people so many unsung heroes I'm not

1673
01:00:07,798 --> 01:00:12,420
doing it justice but everyone who's

1674
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:14,099
played a role thank you so much yeah

1675
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:15,480
just just I mean because because those

1676
01:00:14,099 --> 01:00:16,859
guys weren't they weren't funeral

1677
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:18,298
hunting in the 60s right because that's

1678
01:00:16,858 --> 01:00:20,338
where I mean we can talk the haze goes

1679
01:00:18,298 --> 01:00:22,559
all the way back to the 60s so I mean

1680
01:00:20,338 --> 01:00:24,358
anything that that's that's that's LED

1681
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:26,460
that's held the test of time for like 50

1682
01:00:24,358 --> 01:00:28,679
years people still have it or still talk

1683
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:30,119
about it right that's it's got to be

1684
01:00:28,679 --> 01:00:31,318
something special there because these

1685
01:00:30,119 --> 01:00:33,358
guys weren't doing funeral hunts back

1686
01:00:31,318 --> 01:00:35,099
then they were just you know or they're

1687
01:00:33,358 --> 01:00:37,139
smaller scale they just so it's for

1688
01:00:35,099 --> 01:00:39,960
something to work and spread that far

1689
01:00:37,139 --> 01:00:41,338
and wide that's gotta be all right yeah

1690
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:43,019
100 percent

1691
01:00:41,338 --> 01:00:44,099
stayed in the test of time for good

1692
01:00:43,019 --> 01:00:47,338
reason

1693
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:50,880

1694

1695
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:54,660

01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:56,700

1764
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:40,619
has a pack of Bodhi seeds in their

1765
01:03:37,679 --> 01:03:42,419
collection if they don't they should if

1766
01:03:40,619 --> 01:03:44,579
they and if you don't buy them for me

1767
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:47,220

1771
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:55,858

1772
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:57,660

01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:27,960
all the new obstacles that I've had to

1935
01:10:25,319 --> 01:10:29,819
overcome with compound and with my own

1936
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:32,100
place in the industry I'm looking

1937
01:10:29,819 --> 01:10:33,179
forward to work 2023 takes me and what's

1938
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:35,820
next

1939
01:10:33,179 --> 01:10:37,980
yeah incredible I know that all of your

1940
01:10:35,819 --> 01:10:40,979
fans are equally excited for what you

1941
01:10:37,979 --> 01:10:42,899
have for us over the coming few years I

1942
01:10:40,979 --> 01:10:44,939
would love to start let's talk about the

1943
01:10:42,899 --> 01:10:46,979
uh clone of the Year award so apples and

1944
01:10:44,939 --> 01:10:48,178
bananas took out clone of the year I

1945
01:10:46,979 --> 01:10:50,158
think you'd probably have to be living

1946
01:10:48,179 --> 01:10:52,020
under a rock to have not heard or

1947
01:10:50,158 --> 01:10:54,059
experienced apples and bananas at this

1948
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:55,380
point I guess the place I'd love to

1949
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:56,940
start is

1950
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:58,679
um maybe going back to the Genesis you

1951
01:10:56,939 --> 01:11:01,198
know do you remember that pollination

1952
01:10:58,679 --> 01:11:02,940
where you made it and um what was it

1953
01:11:01,198 --> 01:11:04,139
about those two parents that Drew you to

1954
01:11:02,939 --> 01:11:06,000
it because I think it's something I

1955
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:08,699
really like about apples and bananas is

1956
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,560
that it utilizes genetics you don't see

1957
01:11:08,698 --> 01:11:12,479
as much and I think that helped made it

1958
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:13,380
special but I'd love to hear your take

1959
01:11:12,479 --> 01:11:16,319
on it

1960
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:17,699
yeah any other cross back in 2019 I

1961
01:11:16,319 --> 01:11:19,198
believe I was working in a small

1962
01:11:17,698 --> 01:11:20,219
basement I had access to in Portland

1963
01:11:19,198 --> 01:11:21,539
Oregon

1964
01:11:20,219 --> 01:11:22,980
um I received the now and later cut from

1965
01:11:21,539 --> 01:11:24,960
my friend Clearwater genetics in

1966
01:11:22,979 --> 01:11:26,579
Colorado I traded him some cuts for it I

1967
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:28,079
think it was a gelato 41 I traded him

1968
01:11:26,579 --> 01:11:30,238
for the now and later and so I received

1969
01:11:28,079 --> 01:11:32,158
that cut I immediately put it to work um

1970
01:11:30,238 --> 01:11:33,479
I didn't really expect anything special

1971
01:11:32,158 --> 01:11:35,579
to come from the cut so it's really

1972
01:11:33,479 --> 01:11:37,799
awesome to see how far it's come

1973
01:11:35,579 --> 01:11:39,840
um yeah it was really cool to see that

1974
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:42,719
recognition I received and remember

1975
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:46,260
giving the uh the the phenotype to him

1976
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:47,219
and the selection to uh burner when I

1977
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:48,239
started working with cookies and he's

1978
01:11:47,219 --> 01:11:49,319
the one that kind of really put apples

1979
01:11:48,238 --> 01:11:51,359
and bananas on the map so I have to give

1980
01:11:49,319 --> 01:11:52,500
him all the credit and got all the

1981
01:11:51,359 --> 01:11:54,059
credit but you know part of the credit

1982
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:55,859
for basically creating The Branding and

1983
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:57,659
helping with the recognition that this

1984
01:11:55,859 --> 01:11:59,579
Cuts received and the momentum it's

1985
01:11:57,658 --> 01:12:00,960
gotten so it's really cool to see what I

1986
01:11:59,579 --> 01:12:02,880
come full circle

1987
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:04,800
wow there you go I didn't know you had

1988
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:06,719
made it that long ago and that's cool to

1989
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:09,179
hear the back story on it something

1990
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:12,600
which grabbed my eye about it is that

1991
01:12:09,179 --> 01:12:15,359
this is the second big cut that has

1992
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:17,100
utilized work from Sin City genetics and

1993
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:19,559
I think they largely speaking sort of

1994
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:22,500
fly under the radar but people may know

1995
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:23,880
that um jbz also used some of their work

1996
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:26,399
in the wedding cake so I think we've now

1997
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:29,100
got two nice clones that sort of

1998
01:12:26,399 --> 01:12:30,479
illustrate some of the um the quality of

1999
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:32,219
their genetics

2000
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:34,319
um is this is this a thought you've ever

2001
01:12:32,219 --> 01:12:35,939
meditated on maybe Sin Cities like

2002
01:12:34,319 --> 01:12:37,979
secretly the Breeders breeder or do you

2003
01:12:35,939 --> 01:12:40,559
think like a bit of a coincidence

2004
01:12:37,979 --> 01:12:42,059
I'm not sure it's probably coincidence

2005
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:43,860
and some aspects but definitely know

2006
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:45,780
since city does lots of solid work and

2007
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:48,960
the blue Power they they created has

2008
01:12:45,779 --> 01:12:51,238
been a big part of um jvc's genetics in

2009
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:53,279
his work so yeah they definitely have an

2010
01:12:51,238 --> 01:12:55,500
eye and a taste for quality and good

2011
01:12:53,279 --> 01:12:57,000
good Gen X so I think that there's a

2012
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:59,880
reason that their their work is known

2013
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:01,439
for its backbones for so many privileged

2014
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:04,199
breeders

2015
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:06,359
yeah amazing and in that recent answer

2016
01:13:04,198 --> 01:13:08,579
you mentioned working with burner and

2017
01:13:06,359 --> 01:13:10,500
how he helped promote the strain I've

2018
01:13:08,579 --> 01:13:14,039
got to ask what's that like because

2019
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:16,560
obviously the the media Powerhouse that

2020
01:13:14,039 --> 01:13:19,019
is cookies is undeniable right it has

2021
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:23,219
the ability to really Market strains

2022
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:25,020
better than 99.9 of people can is that

2023
01:13:23,219 --> 01:13:28,739
is it a bit surreal to see your work

2024
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:31,140
gets like showcased so well or like how

2025
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:33,419
did how did that come about I guess

2026
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:35,520
yeah it's very humbling I'm still uh

2027
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:37,560
take it back by it every day it's a very

2028
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:38,760
awesome experience to have I'm grateful

2029
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:40,739
to work with Burr and the whole cookies

2030
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:43,800
team I remember when we first linked up

2031
01:13:40,738 --> 01:13:45,419
about around 2019 in San Francisco he

2032
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:47,820
was asking for some jars of flavors and

2033
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:50,699
the apples have been as well maybe that

2034
01:13:47,819 --> 01:13:52,619
apples apples cut which was didn't have

2035
01:13:50,698 --> 01:13:53,879
that name at the time I had in a jar and

2036
01:13:52,619 --> 01:13:56,158
I gave it to him and he immediately

2037
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:57,960
gravitated towards that so I have to

2038
01:13:56,158 --> 01:14:00,420
give him props for he has a very strong

2039
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:01,859
eye for a taste and for what's going to

2040
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:04,020
work in the market so I don't think

2041
01:14:01,859 --> 01:14:06,420
without him selecting that Fina with me

2042
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:08,400
and getting the name Apple Savannah it

2043
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:09,899
would be recognized where it is now so

2044
01:14:08,399 --> 01:14:11,698
it's really cool to be able to work with

2045
01:14:09,899 --> 01:14:13,319
someone like burner who has that that

2046
01:14:11,698 --> 01:14:15,599
ability to basically put a string on or

2047
01:14:13,319 --> 01:14:17,759
off and having select strains that I've

2048
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:20,340
created obviously decided to put them on

2049
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:23,219
the map so it's a really cool experience

2050
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:26,640
that's incredible I love to hear that I

2051
01:14:23,219 --> 01:14:29,279
wanted to ask you about something I I've

2052
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:31,320
I've been um grateful to have received a

2053
01:14:29,279 --> 01:14:33,119
few samples of apples and bananas while

2054
01:14:31,319 --> 01:14:35,039
I was in the states recently and they

2055
01:14:33,119 --> 01:14:36,599
were gorgeous and something people said

2056
01:14:35,039 --> 01:14:39,719
to me and that I also experienced myself

2057
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:41,460
is it has this quality to it that is

2058
01:14:39,719 --> 01:14:43,140
similar to like some of the Citrus

2059
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:45,480
strains in the sense that it's not

2060
01:14:43,140 --> 01:14:47,760
Citrus but it cuts through like you have

2061
01:14:45,479 --> 01:14:49,198
one butt of it in a bag of stuff and

2062
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:51,420
it's like that's all you smell it really

2063
01:14:49,198 --> 01:14:52,979
cuts through I was wondering because you

2064
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:54,779
look at the genetics and I like I wasn't

2065
01:14:52,979 --> 01:14:57,059
really sure where that trait was coming

2066
01:14:54,779 --> 01:15:00,238
from do you have any speculations on why

2067
01:14:57,060 --> 01:15:02,699
it's got such a dominant profile to it

2068
01:15:00,238 --> 01:15:04,439
I don't know I'm not exactly sure maybe

2069
01:15:02,698 --> 01:15:07,139
it was back to the work since city did

2070
01:15:04,439 --> 01:15:09,479
that blue power or it could be a mixture

2071
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:11,820
of the GDP or just a combination of all

2072
01:15:09,479 --> 01:15:13,319
the genetics in the crust together I

2073
01:15:11,819 --> 01:15:14,698
tend to get more of a gassy unique

2074
01:15:13,319 --> 01:15:16,859
profile from it but everyone has their

2075
01:15:14,698 --> 01:15:17,939
own kind of um trait there or or they're

2076
01:15:16,859 --> 01:15:20,579
tripping they pull out from it but

2077
01:15:17,939 --> 01:15:22,500
simply it simply is something that makes

2078
01:15:20,579 --> 01:15:25,140
it unique with the cut server so yeah

2079
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:27,359
it's definitely a strong one

2080
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:28,619
yeah sorry I should clarify I I just

2081
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:30,599
wanted to say I don't think it smells

2082
01:15:28,619 --> 01:15:32,579
like citrus it just um I actually can't

2083
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:33,780
describe the flavor profile to be honest

2084
01:15:32,579 --> 01:15:35,399
and I think a lot of people said that as

2085
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:38,279
well it's like it's a mixture of yeah

2086
01:15:35,399 --> 01:15:39,899
gassy unique berries grapes it's it's

2087
01:15:38,279 --> 01:15:41,819
beautiful and I agree with you it's

2088
01:15:39,899 --> 01:15:44,460
something about those genetics just seem

2089
01:15:41,819 --> 01:15:46,198
to really work well which is lovely so

2090
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:48,000
next thing I wanted to ask you is one of

2091
01:15:46,198 --> 01:15:50,460
the other Awards you want is the hottest

2092
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,899
seed drop of the year and if I had to do

2093
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:53,460
a single one I would say probably the

2094
01:15:51,899 --> 01:15:55,500
apples and bananas drop but I want to

2095
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:57,539
give equal props to the grape gas drop

2096
01:15:55,500 --> 01:16:00,060
which I think also did really well had

2097
01:15:57,539 --> 01:16:02,100
some standout strains what's your

2098
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:03,600
recollection on those two drops and is

2099
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:05,039
one of them more memorable to you than

2100
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:06,179
the other or you think they're both sort

2101
01:16:05,039 --> 01:16:07,619
of equal

2102
01:16:06,179 --> 01:16:09,658
um the real special in their their own

2103
01:16:07,619 --> 01:16:12,000
way for me I think the grape gas

2104
01:16:09,658 --> 01:16:14,099
um created more of a wave on its own

2105
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,840
because the baby has to really have any

2106
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:19,400
recognition going in the in the

2107
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:21,900
collection it was kind of uh uh

2108
01:16:19,399 --> 01:16:24,960
away from cookies prior to the release

2109
01:16:21,899 --> 01:16:27,420
so I'm grateful and surprised at the

2110
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:29,460
whole the whole momentum that the king

2111
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:30,719
sources received in other strange

2112
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:33,300
commitment The Collection like the

2113
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:35,460
Mellows pink shirts those are all very

2114
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:37,440
um strong strains they've done well in

2115
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:39,359
the market since the season release so

2116
01:16:37,439 --> 01:16:40,979
I'm proud of that collection I think the

2117
01:16:39,359 --> 01:16:42,779
Apple has been as also unique on its own

2118
01:16:40,979 --> 01:16:45,000
because it kind of was a combination of

2119
01:16:42,779 --> 01:16:47,579
all the workers burner and was cookie so

2120
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:49,560
it was a special in a different way uh

2121
01:16:47,579 --> 01:16:51,059
yeah they're both really collections

2122
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:54,480
good Collections and I think they both

2123
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:57,239
have unique profiles the admin to the to

2124
01:16:54,479 --> 01:16:59,759
the um the gene pool and we'll be here

2125
01:16:57,238 --> 01:17:01,799
for a while I love that that is that is

2126
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:03,840
really cool and and as you just touched

2127
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:05,880
on the the pink certs has done really

2128
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:08,159
well High times recently named Pink

2129
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:09,779
certs as the strain of the year were you

2130
01:17:08,158 --> 01:17:11,639
anticipating that to be the one that

2131
01:17:09,779 --> 01:17:12,840
stood out of the grape gas drop or was

2132
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:14,340
there another one that you maybe

2133
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:15,300
suspected might have done a little

2134
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:17,039
better

2135
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:19,199
I was actually surprised by that and

2136
01:17:17,039 --> 01:17:21,479
it's still awesome to see that that

2137
01:17:19,198 --> 01:17:22,919
success that strange then so it props to

2138
01:17:21,479 --> 01:17:24,419
the service guys and everyone from the

2139
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:26,539
service family who's kind of been on

2140
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:28,920
board for this this as well I kind of

2141
01:17:26,539 --> 01:17:30,359
made that whole branding and naming on

2142
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:32,219
my own and it really rejected to those

2143
01:17:30,359 --> 01:17:34,079
guys prior to doing it so it was kind of

2144
01:17:32,219 --> 01:17:36,060
cool to see that whole

2145
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:37,559
thing come full circle you get to create

2146
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:39,300
the wave it did so

2147
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:43,080
um it's definitely unique and strong

2148
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:45,539
across I I had a a idea I feel like it

2149
01:17:43,079 --> 01:17:47,340
would be a Powerhouse but the amount of

2150
01:17:45,539 --> 01:17:49,439
momentous received in where it's gone is

2151
01:17:47,340 --> 01:17:50,640
nothing I expected so it's very cool to

2152
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:53,579
see that

2153
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:55,800
incredible incredible now I'm gonna I'm

2154
01:17:53,579 --> 01:17:58,319
gonna put you in a hard spot here if you

2155
01:17:55,800 --> 01:18:00,779
could only pick one pack out of the

2156
01:17:58,319 --> 01:18:03,119
apples and bananas drop and one one pack

2157
01:18:00,779 --> 01:18:04,259
out of the grape gas drop which would be

2158
01:18:03,119 --> 01:18:05,880
your pick

2159
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:07,260
that's a tough question very tough

2160
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:08,819
question

2161
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:11,340
um from the grape grass I have to pick

2162
01:18:08,819 --> 01:18:14,519
pink stores just it's it's it's the one

2163
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:17,100
for sure and from apples bananas um and

2164
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:20,040
things like that either the uh the

2165
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:22,800
goofies the uh the uh Jewelers 31 by

2166
01:18:20,039 --> 01:18:24,539
apples of bananas or the the Exotic

2167
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:26,159
squared the red pop by apples and bears

2168
01:18:24,539 --> 01:18:27,238
from from yeah those are both very

2169
01:18:26,158 --> 01:18:29,460
strong ones

2170
01:18:27,238 --> 01:18:31,198
nice one that's that's cool to hear the

2171
01:18:29,460 --> 01:18:33,960
red pop um hybrid in there getting a

2172
01:18:31,198 --> 01:18:36,059
mention I love that so I would love to

2173
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:37,439
know because I think you would you and a

2174
01:18:36,060 --> 01:18:39,600
few other people would have a good idea

2175
01:18:37,439 --> 01:18:41,879
of this what do you predict will be some

2176
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:44,100
of the big flavor profiles we see roll

2177
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:46,079
in over the coming year or so any any

2178
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:48,120
predictions for what might come back so

2179
01:18:46,079 --> 01:18:49,500
to speak

2180
01:18:48,119 --> 01:18:51,179
um I think the purple gas is here to

2181
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:53,939
stay it's not going to go away anytime

2182
01:18:51,179 --> 01:18:56,760
soon I think um we'll see more of like

2183
01:18:53,939 --> 01:18:58,139
mixtures of old lost strains or more

2184
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:59,940
unique profiles mixed with the current

2185
01:18:58,140 --> 01:19:01,140
strains like purple gas makes with some

2186
01:18:59,939 --> 01:19:03,599
unique cultivars that I've been

2187
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:05,100
forgotten about or is it was hot you

2188
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:06,600
know five years ago it's going to come

2189
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:08,880
back as a new version mixed with purple

2190
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:11,820
gas or mixed with runs or mixed with you

2191
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:13,980
know some hot strings or mixes z-trips

2192
01:19:11,819 --> 01:19:15,420
something like that you know the new

2193
01:19:13,979 --> 01:19:18,059
mixed all that I kind of see that is

2194
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:20,158
kind of a new way for the next wave a

2195
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:22,260
very smart terms you can find some more

2196
01:19:20,158 --> 01:19:24,539
original sculptures it's kind of always

2197
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:26,219
been a desirable thing but yeah just a

2198
01:19:24,539 --> 01:19:28,738
mixture of uh new and old I think it

2199
01:19:26,219 --> 01:19:31,319
will be possibly some new some new stuff

2200
01:19:28,738 --> 01:19:32,698
we'll see coming forward and just you

2201
01:19:31,319 --> 01:19:33,779
know things are on the radar I think

2202
01:19:32,698 --> 01:19:35,279
there's so much of the scene right now

2203
01:19:33,779 --> 01:19:36,779
people are looking for things that are

2204
01:19:35,279 --> 01:19:37,979
different so anything that's different

2205
01:19:36,779 --> 01:19:39,899
that stands out that checks all the

2206
01:19:37,979 --> 01:19:41,759
boxes I think will do well

2207
01:19:39,899 --> 01:19:43,500
too true too true I think we're seeing

2208
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:44,820
that in the industry for sure that some

2209
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:46,920
of the olds coming back but there's

2210
01:19:44,819 --> 01:19:48,960
definitely some new Staples and I like

2211
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:50,880
that term purple gas I'm gonna I'm gonna

2212
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:52,739
adopt that term into my library because

2213
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:54,539
I've never heard it but as soon as you

2214
01:19:52,738 --> 01:19:57,779
said it I knew exactly what you meant so

2215
01:19:54,539 --> 01:20:00,600
yeah or purple candy purple candy purple

2216
01:19:57,779 --> 01:20:03,300
gas they're both very hot right now yeah

2217
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:05,400
yeah yeah I love that okay so final

2218
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:07,860
question for this little award segment

2219
01:20:05,399 --> 01:20:09,899
what can we hope to see from you over

2220
01:20:07,859 --> 01:20:12,179
the coming year do we do we think we

2221
01:20:09,899 --> 01:20:14,279
might see a sea drop at some point or we

2222
01:20:12,179 --> 01:20:15,840
just need to wait and see what happens

2223
01:20:14,279 --> 01:20:17,399
yeah I'm working on some new projects

2224
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:18,360
right now you can't see too much at the

2225
01:20:17,399 --> 01:20:20,698
moment but you'll see some Steve Jobs

2226
01:20:18,359 --> 01:20:22,439
coming soon in the next year hopefully

2227
01:20:20,698 --> 01:20:24,359
and uh also we'll try to work on some

2228
01:20:22,439 --> 01:20:25,198
stuff with Burner in the museum I have

2229
01:20:24,359 --> 01:20:27,059
some new projects I'm working with

2230
01:20:25,198 --> 01:20:29,039
Burner as well so you'll see some some

2231
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:30,960
new stuff from me on my own and some

pick uh

2261
01:21:37,619 --> 01:21:42,059
um I would have gone with exotic that's

2262
01:21:39,719 --> 01:21:43,800
it with exotic just because I think he's

2263
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:47,100
had more of those drops

2264
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:48,900
um you can find so so Chris also did the

2265
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:51,480
the Joker's line right

2266
01:21:48,899 --> 01:21:53,698

2267
01:21:51,479 --> 01:21:55,559

2270
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:02,340
if you go on my website

2271
01:22:00,479 --> 01:22:04,379
under breeder X

2272
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:06,539

all those trains

2274
01:22:06,539 --> 01:22:11,100
female Poland

2275
01:22:09,119 --> 01:22:14,119

01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:18,360
unreleased released

2277
01:22:14,119 --> 01:22:19,859

are you given here

2279
01:22:19,859 --> 01:22:23,639
just just saying maybe I mean I don't I

2280
01:22:22,260 --> 01:22:26,100
don't know that the community would

2281
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:30,000
really go for somebody else using that

2282
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:32,460
many of somebody else's work so to say

2283
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:34,738
like if you look at what was used

2284
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:36,239
but all that all that media and all that

2285
01:22:34,738 --> 01:22:39,779
hype goes to nothing that would be a

2286
01:22:36,238 --> 01:22:42,539
shame so check out breederax on my

2287

packaging is on point and those guys

2294
01:22:54,539 --> 01:22:58,198
that's that's how they got that special

2295
01:22:56,279 --> 01:22:59,219
thing is by running numbers that's what

2296
01:22:58,198 --> 01:23:01,079
you're going to get when you run numbers

2297
01:22:59,219 --> 01:23:02,340
you're gonna find just because you have

2298
01:23:01,079 --> 01:23:03,658
a pack of something doesn't mean it's

2299
01:23:02,340 --> 01:23:05,460
the best something

2300
01:23:03,658 --> 01:23:08,460
