00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:30,399
uh a variety that we've that uh we've

170
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:33,240
been growing for some years now and um

171
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:35,879
it's just uh yeah it's good good good

172
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:40,319
feeling thing it's not too strong not

173
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:44,639
too weak lovely Flav just a good effect

174
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,639
back to bed and had a few hours extra

175
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,280
sleep that's beautiful to hear I can

176
00:06:47,598 --> 00:06:50,918
envision myself doing a similar thing

177
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:52,559
that little night cap to help get you

178
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:55,198
back there i' I'd love to just follow

179
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,038
that up and ask are there any particular

180
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,240
things that are like daily drivers for

181
00:06:57,038 --> 00:06:59,878
you that like you know you're sort of

182
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,038
regularly Reaching For What are the

183
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:06,280
things in your toolkit you

184
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:10,159
know um I was thinking about that the

185
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:13,000
other day um I I don't really have a

186
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,280
kind of I mean I I wake up and I feel

187
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,839
different every day and so I I like to

188
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:21,119
have a big variety from different hashes

189
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:23,239
that I've made even Moroccan and and JIS

190
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,280
sometimes and and then three or four

191
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:29,160
different marijuanas always available so

192
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:31,799
I can choose because some morning I wake

193
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,520
up and and I just want to numb myself

194
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,360
and other morning I wake up and I'm

195
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:39,799
bubbly and I um I just take one or two

196
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:43,120
Puffs of uh you know a mango Haze joint

197
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:45,158
and I'm I'm fine for hours so it's

198
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,199
really I suppose it's to do with the

199
00:07:45,158 --> 00:07:49,360
chemistry going on in your body and how

200
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,360
you slept and things like what's on your

201
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:56,080
mind but yeah I like to keep you know

202
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:58,800
solids and and and Greenery uh available

203
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:02,120
two or three of each thing so uh and mix

204
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,639
it up I mean I mix up stuff all the time

205
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,399
I'm not one of these purists when it

206
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:09,158
comes to you know sort of I I suppose

207
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:11,878
I'm purist in the fact of um I try

208
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:16,439
everything a lot but when I choose to

209
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:19,960
just do a myself just recreational smoke

210
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:24,360
or um then it changes you know but I

211
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:26,839
lately I suppose I I've been towards the

212
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,280
the solids the hashes that we make you

213
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:32,079
know ourselves out of single strains and

214
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:35,838
and they're always very interesting when

215
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:38,240
you try a single strain of hash like

216
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,919
rather than the grass I think we talked

217
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,918
about this last time a little bit about

218
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:44,480
making some different blends and stuff

219
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:47,838
but yeah it's really different when you

220
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,639
you try um the hash version of that

221
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,200
particular grass get a few more

222
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:55,080
different

223
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,839
effects yeah certainly we had a lot of

224
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,720
listeners who were really thrilled with

225
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:00,920
the sort of discussion you gave last

226
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,839
episode as a little followup I'd be

227
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:05,759
curious to ask do you find that there

228
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:08,600
are any particular sativa strains that

229
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:10,799
translate in effect nicely into the

230
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,920
concentrates cuz I think you often hear

231
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:15,599
people saying oh a lot of the times it

232
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:18,679
it just feels sort of like hybrid SL

233
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,440
indre you lose that uplifting euphoric

234
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:22,039
sort of effect are there any strains

235
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,000
that come to mind for you where like you

236
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:28,519
think it does translate over

237
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,720
nicely well I've made um um hashes from

238
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:34,600
obviously I think Afghan Hayes is a

239
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:37,360
really good uh an incredible strain

240
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,480
first of all as a as a marijuana one of

241
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,519
the building blocks of the industry from

242
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:46,519
from our breeding Point both Neville and

243
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:50,879
I um um over the years and uh it's a

244
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:52,480
actually if you grow it well and um you

245
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:54,639
you grow enough of it you can make some

246
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:58,879
really good hash from it maybe you you

247
00:09:54,639 --> 00:10:02,240
don't make 10 to 12% like on a on a dry

248
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:05,838
you know of un yield from whether you do

249
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,519
it ice or dry or or whichever way but

250
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:11,480
you could definitely get you know sort

251
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:14,278
of seven 8% out of some of these Haze

252
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:18,360
hybrids and they're very different

253
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:20,519
they're really um yeah I always try to

254
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,680
describe them a little bit more like the

255
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:26,600
the the effervescent part of like the

256
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:29,399
Champagnes in the industry it's kind of

257
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:33,639
you don't always feel stoned but you're

258
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:35,440
cerebrally High you know and and so um I

259
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:37,838
kind of like that when you go out to a

260
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,160
party uplifted and you're a bit euphoric

261
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,560
and kind of can hear music really well

262
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:45,278
and you you know rather than your body's

263
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:47,838
tired and you want to sort of slap on

264
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:50,039
the couch and what to film and they

265
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:53,440
they're very different effects and so I

266
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:55,000
I suppose um Neville's Haze we made um

267
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,040
we were lucky enough to grow quite a lot

268
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,879
of at one stage

269
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:02,120
outside and like I said to you I mean I

270
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:04,519
like outdoor plants for making hasch I

271
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:07,440
think they actually the resins much more

272
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:10,278
rounded and and bit like wine or or or

273
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,160
olives you know um something to do with

274
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:14,600
the environment in that year and the Sun

275
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:17,159
and aspect and the water and all of the

276
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:20,959
chemicals in the soil you know it's just

277
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:23,838
something different and um and so and

278
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:25,919
the turpens I always find the turpens

279
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,399
are much stronger and they last longer

280
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:31,479
from outdoor variety rather than indoor

281
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:35,240
because in door you open it you get a

282
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:38,720
flush of of of tppon and then it sort of

283
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:41,759
dies down very quickly whereas a good gr

284
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,759
outdoor you open up the the jar and the

285
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:47,759
room remains fragrant you know and it it

286
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:50,600
stays that like that so we'll probably

287
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:54,120
find out a few years that outdoor um has

288
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:56,278
a better Integrity of uh um on the turp

289
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,480
and and the flavonoids and different

290
00:11:56,278 --> 00:12:01,039
compounds on the plant rather than

291
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,800
indoor and Greenhouse sort of you know

292
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:05,360
controlling the climate and then giving

293
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:07,879
you the potentially the best yields of

294
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,839
cannaboids and stuff like that so I

295
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:12,720
think combination of both is always good

296
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,360
that's why I blend you know it's like

297
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,920
what I explained last time blending a

298
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:20,839
bit of the dry with the ice and uh kind

299
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:24,360
of making the flavors the full Integrity

300
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:26,519
of the so and and you know many times

301
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,000
I've I've the hat like what I was

302
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:31,560
explaining before when you do a single

303
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,519
strain and you make a Sie from it a dry

304
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:37,159
C from it for example

305
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:40,039
there's something different about the

306
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:44,078
hash version than the plant version

307
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:47,039
because you probably got some very small

308
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:49,198
amounts of a certain cannaboid that you

309
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:50,879
have a minute amount in a plant but you

310
00:12:49,198 --> 00:12:53,439
never really get the effect of it but in

311
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:55,958
a hash you've got a higher concentration

312
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,560
of that and it it it fits into the

313
00:12:55,958 --> 00:13:01,559
recipe of that plant so that's why I

314
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:06,359
would say the hash version of a single

315
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:08,479
strain uh field is very it allows you to

316
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:12,159
understand exactly the medicine of that

317
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:14,199
plant properly whereas the plant maybe

318
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:16,600
has a completely different feeling

319
00:13:14,198 --> 00:13:19,319
sometimes and and the chlori changes

320
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,440
that affect as well so you know I do

321
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,519
think they're really important to to

322
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:27,839
study them as two different kind of um

323
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:29,320
medicines in a way you know yeah wow

324
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,279
that that's really interesting and and I

325
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:34,800
guess with what you've just said as a

326
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:36,720
follow-up do you specifically breed with

327
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:38,559
the intention of plants performing well

328
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,000
outdoors and is that where you sort of

329
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:42,439
see the global production of cannabis

330
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,600
heading in the

331
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:49,360
future well I mean Outdoors is is

332
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:52,199
obviously the cheapest and and um if you

333
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:56,240
have a good season it's it's the most

334
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:59,639
abundant uh cheapest uh um yielding kind

335
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,720
of prop you can have um in indoor

336
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:04,159
everything has to be climate control and

337
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,959
there's an expense and there's staff and

338
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:11,159
a lot of electricity and and a lot of

339
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:13,919
expenses related to uh an established uh

340
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:17,240
Greenhouse or or an indoor facility you

341
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:19,519
know um outdoor uh you don't always hit

342
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:22,000
it on the head with the the environment

343
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,120
for that year and the climate maybe

344
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,720
affects it in a negative way but when

345
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:30,600
it's hits it in a positive way I I do

346
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:33,959
believe you've got um a huge amount of

347
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:36,800
yield compared to what you could produce

348
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:40,078
um in inside or in a greenhouse you know

349
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:42,919
and uh so there's a lot more scope with

350
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:46,120
the cheaper production lines I mean

351
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:50,719
making hash outdoor for me would be a

352
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:53,480
very sensible um way sensible kind of

353
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:56,000
decision um and and using aspects of

354
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:58,199
indoor Greenhouse to blend with it that

355
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,559
that maybe that would come into it you

356
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:01,559
know but

357
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:03,919
um like Australia doesn't really have

358
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:06,078
havn't had a hash culture for example I

359
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:07,838
mean only pockets of it where people

360
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:10,879
making their own extracts now in the

361
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,920
last sort of 10 15 years but some of the

362
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:14,720
extreme boys have been making a little

363
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:17,399
bit of Civ but you'd have to know them

364
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:21,320
to to to actually experience that in

365
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:23,519
Australia uh whereas Europe had had 80%

366
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:26,639
of their Market had always been

367
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:29,959
solids you know for up until 20 30 years

368
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,839
ago when marijuana started to to kind of

369
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:34,599
come in and become interesting and and

370
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:37,120
different and they see them as different

371
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:40,480
things rather than just marijuana or

372
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,959
weed you know what I mean so yeah it's

373
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,480
been an evolution and and it still is

374
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,679
it's still evolving because not

375
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:50,480
everybody knows everything about you

376
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:53,958
know um strains or or or what they do to

377
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,399
people or how the effect is and you know

378
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:58,318
sometimes year to year they they vary

379
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,600
outdoor and they don't have the same

380
00:15:58,318 --> 00:16:01,278
effect

381
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,319
they smell the same they look the same

382
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:05,000
and there's something missing you know

383
00:16:03,318 --> 00:16:07,318
so I

384
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,360
suppose excuse me I suppose it's the

385
00:16:07,318 --> 00:16:12,679
same with wine and and you know like

386
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:15,199
this year unfortunately a lot of people

387
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:17,599
in Loria in Italy they didn't pick the

388
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:19,879
olives it wasn't worth it there was uh

389
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,079
they got hit during the season with some

390
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:26,879
hails and got a lot of damage and it was

391
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:29,879
just not economic and uh and you know

392
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:32,039
um there's a few areas that that that it

393
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:34,399
wasn't practical and it wasn't there was

394
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:36,000
no value in picking the olives so this

395
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,440
year will be a

396
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,000
particularly average year you know for

397
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,720
production and um that that happens

398
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,720
outside because you can't control

399
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,399
obviously temp the

400
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,800
weather so I mean with that point in

401
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:53,318
mind I guess do you think that the base

402
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:56,198
sort of commodity of medical cannabis in

403
00:16:53,318 --> 00:16:58,399
the future might be some sort of Highly

404
00:16:56,198 --> 00:17:01,039
processed product as opposed to flour

405
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:03,039
because of inherent variation from

406
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:04,599
season to season you reference like you

407
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:08,838
know will there eventually be like a

408
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:10,480
Jack Daniels number seven equivalent of

409
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:13,958
concentrate

410
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:16,679
um you know I've tossed we we talked

411
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:19,798
about this many times when we were

412
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:22,038
riding High suppose um Howard and

413
00:17:19,798 --> 00:17:26,000
Neville and myself and a few other guys

414
00:17:22,038 --> 00:17:28,279
we always talked about having the uh K

415
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,519
connoisseurs Club you know where we've

416
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:31,720
we've kept

417
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:33,759
different years of hash and we've vacuum

418
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:37,319
sealed them and kept them in a Cellar

419
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:39,359
like we do wine you know and we we had a

420
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:41,480
bud but the buds fade because they they

421
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:43,319
yellow out and they the chlorophyll

422
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,440
deteriorates so when you make an

423
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:47,159
extraction they don't fade so quickly

424
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,320
you know maybe some of the cannaboids

425
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:54,919
change to more sleepier cannaboids over

426
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:56,519
time and stuff but if you hold them well

427
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:58,880
um and I've got a friend who's who's

428
00:17:56,519 --> 00:18:01,720
made he's got a sample of every single

429
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,840
piece of has he came across or made from

430
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,720
the early 90s onwards and it's like a

431
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:08,798
coffee it could be a coffee table I mean

432
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:11,960
it was really this is really impressive

433
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:14,720
wow um and you really see the difference

434
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:16,519
and the evolution you see um and we've

435
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,319
become very good at making hashes and

436
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:21,038
stuff but for me early days when I

437
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:24,639
didn't when we were really tossing

438
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:27,759
around we made a lot of plants in the

439
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:32,000
1998 99 in in Switzerland when I first

440
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:34,839
came here um I used to gather the uh the

441
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,798
what fell off the plants they they used

442
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:39,959
to just cut the um the flowers off the

443
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:41,400
wood over the silk screens and in the

444
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,400
end of the day I would just go there

445
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,960
myself and and get it all because they

446
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:49,798
were different plants done different day

447
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:52,519
so I was able to gather say skunk one

448
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:55,000
only hash or super silver hash or early

449
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:57,480
Queen hash or you know and we kept it

450
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,960
and and um we're able to press it up and

451
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,319
and clean it up over time and I used

452
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:04,960
that as the

453
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:08,439
original um I used to melt it with um

454
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,600
olive oil and give that as as drops to

455
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,720
patients right at the beginning of

456
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:15,158
everything and and for me that was the

457
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,279
be I've always used that and then ice

458
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:20,679
then we started with the water hash and

459
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:24,599
that was actually real base of medicine

460
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:26,360
so yes I believe that uh at the moment

461
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:29,519
unfortunately the pharmaceutical

462
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:33,319
industry is so over regulated ated and

463
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:35,359
and corrupt that that I think that the

464
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:37,279
um the only way that the people will

465
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:42,079
take it back eventually the the hash

466
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:44,678
makers or the um like the wine makers um

467
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:48,158
they will be growing little small areas

468
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:51,038
of particular sort of strains that only

469
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:53,720
grow in those areas for example really

470
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:57,359
well and uh they'll be making their kind

471
00:19:53,720 --> 00:20:00,360
of 200 kilos of cottage industry style

472
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:03,158
stuff and that maybe is by a particular

473
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:05,199
pharmaceutical who uses it to make their

474
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:08,400
base product is one of the base products

475
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:12,319
that they blend you know and th those

476
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:15,759
specific uh sort of um kind of unique

477
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:18,439
recipes will will start with like

478
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:21,038
companies that that will only demand

479
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:23,200
high quality and have found a plant

480
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:25,599
that's actually working for a particular

481
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,480
ailman you know and and they see that

482
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:30,000
it's useful and we'll start to

483
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,960
specialize down those lines even more

484
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,440
you'll start getting pockets of of of

485
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,798
people who have worked on particular

486
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:40,919
plants for certain ailments you know and

487
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:43,918
or maybe the the tppon and the cannaboid

488
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:45,799
blend of uh you know a particular mastic

489
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,400
Bush for example does something really

490
00:20:45,798 --> 00:20:51,400
well for depressive people and and when

491
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:54,159
you make the extraction that particular

492
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:56,798
stuff works every time you know and so

493
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:59,880
obviously then we can start to say this

494
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:03,119
is much better for that problem you know

495
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:05,320
at the moment it's um a bit of stab in

496
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:07,279
the dark I'm afraid even the best

497
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:10,678
doctors and and the best Growers they

498
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:12,399
can't really predict you know what what

499
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:14,480
is happening or they can't prove it with

500
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:18,000
science why that plant is better for you

501
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:20,960
if you're suffering from Parkinson's or

502
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,640
or food disorder or you know what I mean

503
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,278
it's very difficult we're at that that

504
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:28,919
level at the moment of trying to work it

505
00:21:25,278 --> 00:21:32,440
out and so a lot of scientific research

506
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:34,360
is going into very small incremental

507
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,440
facets of this industry at the moment

508
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:38,240
you

509
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,159
know wow and and do you think like

510
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,278
longterm I'm talking many years

511
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,720
eventually we'll get to the point where

512
00:21:42,278 --> 00:21:47,079
you'll have a certain cannabis you know

513
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,759
product extract whatever form it is

514
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:52,119
that's for XY Z and it slots in with all

515
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:54,640
your other farmer tablets and as a quick

516
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:56,798
followup how do you think we can help

517
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,120
get the acceptance we need from

518
00:21:56,798 --> 00:21:59,480
healthcare workers cuz I know that

519
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:01,599
around the world there's still a lot of

520
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,919
people in healthcare who are still very

521
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:05,719
dismissive and not particularly

522
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:05,720
interested in medical

523
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:13,359
cannabis you know um that's a difficult

524
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:16,200
one because changing the mentality you

525
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:18,519
saw how slowly the world changed from

526
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,840
marijuana being a drug because of all

527
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:23,599
the negative propaganda for many many

528
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:26,879
many decades uh to it becoming a

529
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:29,359
medicine and being treated with a lot

530
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:32,480
more respect still has a stigma attached

531
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:35,278
in certain areas and there's still old

532
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,558
people who don't you know would put a

533
00:22:35,278 --> 00:22:40,119
pill in their mouth any day of fentanyl

534
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:43,440
but they they would question you know

535
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:47,119
someone smoking a vaporizer uh as using

536
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:50,278
drugs and uh so mindset is really

537
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:53,879
important education is super important

538
00:22:50,278 --> 00:22:58,480
and uh and actually um allowing people

539
00:22:53,880 --> 00:23:01,480
to decide with u a better conf

540
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,720
consultation from maybe an agency or or

541
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:06,200
independent agency that is not profiting

542
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:09,319
from giving out any particular advice

543
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:11,960
but helping the patient before they see

544
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:13,798
the doctor so they have a kind of

545
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:17,640
understanding of what they're looking

546
00:23:13,798 --> 00:23:20,000
for when they describe their symptoms

547
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:22,840
doctors aren't always the people who

548
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,798
prescribe um the best drugs for people

549
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:27,599
because sometimes they're

550
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:30,599
earning um they have sponsorship from

551
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:33,759
certain C compes and I think that that

552
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:39,158
kind of you know sort of um tins the

553
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:44,480
water um so I I would prefer to see um a

554
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:48,320
much more neutral um um committee set up

555
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:51,558
to it help people get knowledge about

556
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:54,399
what things do to them and you know um

557
00:23:51,558 --> 00:23:57,440
and and how they could be uh looking for

558
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,320
the best particular things that that

559
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,320
some people need to a pill they don't

560
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:04,839
smoke because they've got you know

561
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:07,839
particular sickness and and smoking is

562
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:09,959
revolting uh I I personally believe no

563
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:11,720
sick person wants to smoke inhale

564
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:15,919
anything I think they would prefer to

565
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:19,600
take a pill a capsule or slug of oil and

566
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:23,759
so for me um I believe that's the real

567
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:26,038
medical um um that's the real medical

568
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:29,000
fraternity that I look at when I'm

569
00:24:26,038 --> 00:24:32,960
looking at those and not the so that the

570
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,278
people who have um have sort of jumped

571
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,558
on the bandwagon is Medical but they're

572
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:38,278
using it as

573
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:41,119
recreational I don't think there should

574
00:24:38,278 --> 00:24:43,759
be a discre a difference to tell you the

575
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:45,519
truth between medical and recreational

576
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:48,038
thing I think people should be allowed

577
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:51,000
to use most everything as long as they

578
00:24:48,038 --> 00:24:53,398
don't abuse these things and that means

579
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
that you you've got to put it in a

580
00:24:53,398 --> 00:24:58,479
independent sort of committee that that

581
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,398
sets some rules that are not tainted by

582
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,960
by big companies and and by individual

583
00:25:01,398 --> 00:25:06,439
producers you know you don't want them

584
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:08,759
to to to sort of push certain things but

585
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:11,798
you need

586
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:13,519
education difficult question look I'm

587
00:25:11,798 --> 00:25:15,398
sorry to put it to you my friend but I

588
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:17,240
knew you were up to the challenge so

589
00:25:15,398 --> 00:25:20,678
yeah I mean I'm looking at it all the

590
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:22,599
time at the moment um and and because

591
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:25,159
what I I mean I'm working in the medical

592
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:28,439
now where I work in the medical because

593
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:31,720
we have the licenses and and it makes uh

594
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:34,240
the legal side of it much better now we

595
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,038
have have Farms that we can go to and

596
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,240
and hold our head up high and we we can

597
00:25:36,038 --> 00:25:42,480
work with certain strains now and and so

598
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:44,558
I I believe a lot of the people uh who

599
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,120
I'm working with in Switzerland don't

600
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:51,798
come from my industry whatsoever they

601
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:55,199
come from a very um educated uh um sort

602
00:25:51,798 --> 00:25:59,038
of protocol of a pharmaceutical industry

603
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:01,000
where they they realize that uh um some

604
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:02,798
things have been pushed on the public

605
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,278
not really helping and they've actually

606
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:07,480
changed their way and they want to get a

607
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:10,480
natural something natural that they see

608
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:13,240
the next uh level of understanding for a

609
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:16,919
lot of people and the least harmful and

610
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:18,679
least uh you know symptomatic uh post

611
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:21,440
symptomatic problems that you have with

612
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:23,320
taking certain drugs so you know that's

613
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,919
half the time I mean I I don't like to

614
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:27,278
take a pill I really have to be

615
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:29,360
desperate to take a pill of anything but

616
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:34,159
when I know that I've made disc capsure

617
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:38,959
with just 6% CBD and and 40 T I'm I'm

618
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:42,399
I'm on or an extra better Carol U Turan

619
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:44,919
to enhance the CBD I know those things

620
00:26:42,398 --> 00:26:46,599
work for me at the moment but it's just

621
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:50,200
trolling out I mean this is going to

622
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:54,599
take a while to be very confident to

623
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:57,519
know right this is my opinion or this is

624
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:59,359
science you know what I mean at the

625
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:00,839
moment it's my opinion based on a little

626
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:02,798
bit of Home

627
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:05,558
Science you

628
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:07,119
know certainly look I mean we had our

629
00:27:05,558 --> 00:27:09,000
intuitions about the medical values

630
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:11,398
early on I'm I'm sure as time goes by

631
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,960
and we discover more we'll learn more

632
00:27:11,398 --> 00:27:16,079
that probably backs lots of the things

633
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,759
we suspected but uh I wanted to quickly

634
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:19,398
change the topic cuz that that was the

635
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:21,000
reason why I asked you some of the hard

636
00:27:19,398 --> 00:27:23,319
medical questions I knew you were into

637
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,720
it but I wanted to ask the day after we

638
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:27,599
did our last chat you put a post up

639
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:30,120
talking about how you have a new skunk

640
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:32,319
Kine coming out and appropriately it's

641
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:33,959
called new skung can you tell us a

642
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:35,960
little bit about the backstory on this

643
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:38,240
one and what inspired you to do this

644
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:41,919
project now well I I've been busting

645
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:44,278
open a lot of old seed uh from my my um

646
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:47,399
my fridges and a lot of old stuff from

647
00:27:44,278 --> 00:27:49,558
Nils and some of it has been germinating

648
00:27:47,398 --> 00:27:52,158
it's too a bit too old and some of it

649
00:27:49,558 --> 00:27:55,440
we're we're doing different techniques

650
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:58,278
to get some old sea germinating and and

651
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:04,320
I actually was uh the new skunk was

652
00:27:58,278 --> 00:28:06,159
actually uh um a very old skunk seed it

653
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:10,960
was a a skunk

654
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:13,679
one um by uh skunk 187 it was one of

655
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:16,640
Neville's very old thing and I read the

656
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:20,519
thing and I got a male out of it and um

657
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:23,320
I hit it back to my skunk one which is

658
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:26,599
the female and I produced a very small

659
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:28,359
batch of seed and I I then I put it out

660
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:30,480
there I got it tested by quite a a lot

661
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:33,959
of people on the website and stuff and

662
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:36,519
uh um I was trying to develop a good

663
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:39,840
hash making skunk you know actually that

664
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:42,839
was that was the kind of project in mind

665
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:44,839
and uh it just and and it was different

666
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:49,038
smells there was there was definitely

667
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:50,278
that old stink um you know that really

668
00:28:49,038 --> 00:28:53,319
it was not

669
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:55,240
pleasant sometimes it was a little bit

670
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:58,720
you know it's a little bit

671
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:00,720
off-putting um wafted over and and I

672
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:04,600
remember a lot of people used to love

673
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:06,319
that uh the effect of those flowers so I

674
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:08,359
I must have mentioned at one time that I

675
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:10,240
was doing this on the website and then I

676
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:12,199
got a line of people and they all

677
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:15,240
started hustling me so I sent out a

678
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,960
batch of these old I don't have many I

679
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,640
only had a few and I gave them to my

680
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:22,399
daughter to put through the

681
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:26,399
options um so we we kind

682
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:28,759
of excuse me we we kind of um made test

683
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:31,000
batches and we we we've made a small

684
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:35,038
batch but it's still I'm still playing

685
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:38,640
with it I mean selecting um there's a

686
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:41,519
really wide variety in that selection of

687
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:46,720
the brogy seed that I call new skunk at

688
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:49,120
the moment I would prefer to inbreed

689
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,880
some of it back to the male and just

690
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:54,719
keep selecting a female and putting it

691
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:57,360
back to the male and until I really see

692
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:59,440
a particular thing coming out and I I a

693
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:00,798
few people asked me for the stink you

694
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,240
know they wanted to go back and they're

695
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:05,720
trying to find that and create that old

696
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:07,480
old world skunk and I believe you can

697
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,600
find it but you're going to have to bust

698
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:12,200
open a few seeds and so I'm I'm I'm

699
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:14,798
making some more seed at the moment just

700
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:17,360
for a few guys who who are want to do

701
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:21,679
like a thousand and they they want to

702
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:24,398
look for that and so uh yeah I don't say

703
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:26,320
that you know you'll find it every time

704
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:28,000
but I'm trying to give the tools back to

705
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:30,599
some people who are looking for

706
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,278
specifically for certain things again

707
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:35,719
and I've definitely got the the original

708
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:38,359
and all of Neville and all of my old

709
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:41,079
stuff and all of the old stuff that we

710
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:43,240
started all the strains from in the FR

711
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:48,119
upstairs in in the office I have you

712
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:50,759
know six or seven fridges just

713
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:53,398
full I mean I think I could oh wow I

714
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:56,158
could float a few countries with uh with

715
00:30:53,398 --> 00:30:58,038
crops but uh you know they're all at

716
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,919
different levels and I you know when if

717
00:30:58,038 --> 00:31:01,919
I don't have enough time I I kind of put

718
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,519
the notes inside vacuum seal it and put

719
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:06,360
it in the freezer I know I'm going to

720
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:08,798
come to it in a few years because you

721
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:10,759
know there's only so many so many seats

722
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:12,679
you can bust open and so many projects

723
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:16,119
you can do properly and and give your

724
00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:19,240
attention to it at one time but um I

725
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:22,678
have a a a can of Bible I call it it's

726
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:24,720
all my my notes and and sometimes I have

727
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:27,120
to really go back to that to realize

728
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,240
what that particular batch of seed was

729
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:31,319
and I knew that it was a had an orange

730
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:33,000
corner on it for a reason and then I

731
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:34,839
would find the orange corner and then

732
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,599
I'd go oh yeah that was really

733
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:39,798
interesting batch we need to look

734
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:42,599
through that again with you know so so I

735
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:45,000
mean you know um I help a lot of guys at

736
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:46,918
the moment I've sent a few batches of

737
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,960
garlic Bud to one guy in England and

738
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:51,480
some old hash plant and if you find

739
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:54,159
something you'd share it with me but you

740
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:56,679
know these are old seed from 30 40 years

741
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:59,000
now um I'm never going to have enough

742
00:31:56,679 --> 00:32:02,120
time in my life to bust open everything

743
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:05,200
that I've got treasured away and uh so

744
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:08,158
it's it's that sort of time for certain

745
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:11,080
people to uh trust them to to to kind of

746
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:13,159
help with some projects you know and and

747
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:15,480
I I have a really good batch of um

748
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:17,799
people on The Forum and my moderator

playing with their own varieties and

755
00:32:29,798 --> 00:32:34,000
adding some hazes in and then you know

756

he's already done all these things and

757

wonderful diplomatic person to have

762
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:53,159
better than me in fact I I'm I'm a bit

763
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,480
short sometimes when I think people have

764
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:57,679
asked the question 7,000 times and they

765
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:01,278
should have read some of the literature

766
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:03,000
but but uh he's not like that so um yeah

767
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:05,359
I really thank some of the crew around

768
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,599
me that they have been exceptionally

769
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:11,359
helpful my daughter my son my sons

770
00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:13,798
everyone actually they work really

771
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:15,959
well wow that's that's incredible you

772
00:33:13,798 --> 00:33:18,119
know many hands make light work and and

773
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:20,240
so many cool little tivs there we could

774
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:22,038
chase down I guess one of the things

775
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,038
that stuck out to me I'd love to hear

776
00:33:22,038 --> 00:33:25,759
you said your female skunk cutting

777
00:33:24,038 --> 00:33:27,440
what's that one like well it's not

778
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:29,000
actually mine that was from Neville I

779
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,120
mean it's the original skunk one that

780
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,278
Neville had Dave Watson and Rob Clark

781
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:36,439
they had it um they were all playing at

782
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:38,319
the same time Neville found his

783
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:42,038
particular and he called it this his

784
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:45,000
skunk one and Dave Watson called his

785
00:33:42,038 --> 00:33:49,599
version skunk one so you got to remember

786
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:51,200
skunk one was skunk is a very confused

787
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:54,439
term

788
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:57,399
because there's arguments if there

789
00:33:54,440 --> 00:34:00,000
was certain things in it and and of

790
00:33:57,398 --> 00:34:02,079
course you know Dave Dave Watson has his

791
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,440
version and that's everything is

792
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:10,358
probably correct according to him there

793
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:12,838
um whereas uh um you know Neville

794
00:34:10,358 --> 00:34:15,519
probably selected they Pro they were

795
00:34:12,838 --> 00:34:17,078
working similarly at one stage when

796
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:20,320
everyone was friendly

797
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:23,119
until this green Merchants uh you know

798
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:25,000
sort of problem that came in and exposed

799
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,838
a few of the Americans and then you know

800
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,480
things changed and that was all in

801
00:34:26,838 --> 00:34:31,719
Holland at that St and and they all

802
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:34,679
started to then separate their plants

803
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:40,398
you know and Neville was I think he was

804
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:44,878
um he was the real um um go-getter and

805
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:48,000
innovator um of of um specific

806
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:49,039
genetics um at that time whereas the

807
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,440
other guys

808
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:54,559
were were were there for reasons I don't

809
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:57,000
know and they had licenses for reasons

810
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:58,759
I'm not sure and but I I was friends

811
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,199
with all of them and I was using both

812
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:02,839
sides and and there were slight

813
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:05,000
differences in their skunks um I did

814
00:35:02,838 --> 00:35:08,358
like Rob Clark there was a version that

815
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:11,159
Rob Clark gave me once and I made uh

816
00:35:08,358 --> 00:35:14,719
some incredible hash from it so you know

817
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:18,559
they're all that it it's like

818
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:20,719
um um if I pick a haze or Neville picked

819
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:23,960
a haze we'd pick different hazes there

820
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:25,719
were differences that we liked and um

821
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,760
you know it would be the same with you

822
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:29,919
you could put 100 haes in the room and

823
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,880
and there might be 100 different

824
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,240
versions and they're all called Haze you

825
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:38,200
know

826
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:42,879
so um I I think keeping the original in

827
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:45,719
in in um as as mother and living

828
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:50,318
genetics um has been probably the

829
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:52,000
hardest job of of my life and um and

830
00:35:50,318 --> 00:35:54,039
always having four or five backups in

831
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,039
different countries because you lose so

832
00:35:54,039 --> 00:36:00,880
many things I mean uh you know um and

833
00:35:58,039 --> 00:36:05,279
now thank God for tissue culture which

834
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:07,559
is is is going to save us uh get rid of

835
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:10,160
some of the viruses that are now you

836
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:13,000
know the late Lon hop virus and and the

837
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:16,399
mosaic virus and there's other viruses

838
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:21,318
coming and you know we we really need to

839
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:23,400
be aware of um of a lot more things you

840
00:36:21,318 --> 00:36:25,440
know and old seed busting it open there

841
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,639
weren't many viruses so I'm not really

842
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,920
worried about the old seed coming in but

843
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:32,118
lot of this new stuff I'm just I don't

844
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:35,559
take it in my rooms I don't take any

845
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:38,119
plants from from anything that hasn't

846
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:42,199
come from tissue culture regrowing and

847
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:44,160
plenty you know um because I I this this

848
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:47,239
this virus goes around pretty quickly

849
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:49,159
now and it it used to be just talked

850
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:51,759
about in America and a little bit in

851
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:54,199
Canada but I think it's around the world

852
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:57,560
now I mean it's it's one of these things

853
00:36:54,199 --> 00:37:00,000
that maybe doesn't Express itself uh

854
00:36:57,559 --> 00:37:03,199
until the conditions go down but uh it's

855
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,000
definitely um it's spread now you know

856
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:08,439
it's one of those things you just got

857
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,119
sorry yeah hugely look I'm going to have

858
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,920
to loop back to several of the points

859
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:14,079
there especially the hoplon virus and

860
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,639
you know the just maintaining mothers

861
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,480
over years it's definitely some

862
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:19,838
interesting topics but I wanted to

863
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:22,519
quickly ask you before we move on you

864
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:23,719
mentioned Dave Watson and I think in in

865
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:25,318
the grand scheme of things he's

866
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:28,039
considered one of the grandfathers of

867
00:37:25,318 --> 00:37:29,960
the whole industry in a sense um but for

868
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:31,759
a long time he copped a lot of flak like

869
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,679
a lot of people would accuse him of

870
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,480
collaborating with that green merch and

871
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:37,399
operation and I think for the most part

872
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:39,240
people have realized that that wasn't

873
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:41,440
the case and he's a good guy I'd be

874
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:43,879
interested to hear what's your sort of

875
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:46,240
thoughts on the overall roles Dave

876
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:48,640
Watson sand the skunkman has played in

877
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:51,639
the scene any notable stories or

878
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:53,879
encounters you know I don't make an

879
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:56,799
opinion about things that I weren't

880
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:59,880
around for and and I I'm only hearing

881
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,839
from particular people um I was working

882
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,760
with Arian and Neville at that stage

883
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:05,920
Neville was very much against Dave

884
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:08,040
Watson and Rob and and the other crew at

885
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:10,559
that stage I was friendly with them both

886
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:14,358
uh I had different dealings with all

887
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:16,679
everyone I I was not a guy to make my

888
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:21,480
opinion unless I was asked and I was

889
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:23,279
definitely um more Pur purist about

890
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:25,079
breeding at that time and I was a little

891
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,760
bit more focused on that and they were

892
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:30,880
both excellent sources from different

893
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:35,560
things and as well as other guys in in

894
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:40,318
Holland um so um while I was meant to be

895
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:43,480
probably um um on Neville and and and

896
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:45,599
the greenhouse side at that stage uh I

897
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:51,719
kept an open mind and I did business

898
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:55,519
with both sides and um I did prefer the

899
00:38:51,719 --> 00:39:00,358
diversity of seed breeding from Neville

900
00:38:55,519 --> 00:39:01,440
because um say Dave he he wasn't he he

901
00:39:00,358 --> 00:39:04,598
was

902
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:08,200
uh he's a wealth of knowledge he's I met

903
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:10,800
him many times and we we have a a

904
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:12,358
healthy um respect for each other like

905
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,680
Rob Clark's probably a better friend

906
00:39:12,358 --> 00:39:17,598
I've seen him all over the

907
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:19,440
world uh and we were good mates and

908
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,920
still are and I just haven't been in

909
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,639
Holland and seen them for many years and

910
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,680
uh um I don't have any negative feelings

911
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:28,639
about all of that what I wasn't around

912
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:31,440
for the that Merchant thing I heard

913
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:34,199
about it was exposed on the radio one

914
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:37,000
day I was working with Neville and Aran

915
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:39,358
in a in a Big Greenhouse where where we

916
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,960
did our thing and they had on Dutch

917
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:45,358
radio they had a big uh explanation

918
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,358
about that period and and there was some

919
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:50,400
Merit to certain things I don't know

920
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:55,159
what was provable or not my Dutch wasn't

921
00:39:50,400 --> 00:40:00,119
so good then and um it didn't get better

922
00:39:55,159 --> 00:40:03,519
and as I moved to Italy and and so um I

923
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:07,640
I tried to not give my opinion about

924
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:09,759
things that really I'm I don't know um

925
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:12,480
and I always say proof is in the seed

926
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:15,119
that's why I took the seed from what

927
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,280
they said and where it came from and I

928
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:19,280
busted it open and I went through it and

929
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:23,319
so I didn't have to believe anyone I

930
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:26,040
believed me from what I was given and

931
00:40:23,318 --> 00:40:28,000
sometimes it was a little bit of a goose

932
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:30,960
chase and other times it was some gems

933
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:35,079
in it and um and the guys that I

934
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:39,440
respected I worked with and um and the

935
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:41,119
other guys well you know um there was a

936
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:45,039
there's there's there's been a lot of

937
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:47,440
negative uh press uh about me I read

938
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:50,199
stories that never that never even

939
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:52,280
happened and and you know there so I

940
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:54,480
mean I don't know what's to believe

941
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:56,720
anymore you know I know what I did and

942
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,800
and I know what I have and I know who I

943
00:40:56,719 --> 00:41:00,318
did it with

944
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:03,680
um you can ask me questions about those

945
00:41:00,318 --> 00:41:05,639
things all all day long um and I would

946
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:09,159
have a beer with all of them still to

947
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:11,039
this day so I I I'm not really that uh

948
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:12,598
I'm not really that opinionated about

949
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:14,039
those things because it really doesn't

950
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:16,280
have anything to do with the subject

951
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:18,400
that I'm working on and uh usually

952
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:22,599
that's to do with breeding or selecting

953
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:26,280
or finding cannaboid uh specific plants

954
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:30,119
and you know and and for me I still uh

955
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:32,560
use Clark's book he used a lot of my

956
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:35,358
black hashers and Indian hashers for his

957
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:38,838
hashish book photographed many times in

958
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:41,000
in there and uh uh We've we've

959
00:41:38,838 --> 00:41:43,078
collaborated in things that most people

960
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:46,199
would never know

961
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:49,359
um one day I suppose I'll I'll exp some

962
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:52,279
other things but you know

963
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:54,159
yeah o la la I guess we'll all have to

964
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:56,640
wait for that day and you know what you

965
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:58,159
read my mind I was going to say you know

966
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:00,318
I was hooked on on the story about the

967
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:01,920
hash you made that uh Rob gave you the

968
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:03,599
seeds from last time we were chatting

969
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,880
and you mentioned him a few times I

970
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:08,160
guess it's a good time to ask like I

971
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:10,119
think as as well as Rob's known for his

972
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:11,440
like seminal literature the book I also

973
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:13,800
feel like he's kind of a little bit of

974
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:16,318
an unsung hero of the scene you know he

975
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,599
sort of flies a bit under the radar

976
00:42:16,318 --> 00:42:18,800
what's your friendship with Rob been

977
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:20,559
like over the years and do you agree

978
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:23,440
he's a bit of an unsung hero yeah yeah

979
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:26,200
no for me Rob I still recommend his

980
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:28,079
original book marijuana botany as uh the

981
00:42:26,199 --> 00:42:32,519
first book that most people should go I

982
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:34,480
think he's the only um one of the I I

983
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:37,719
believe he is a

984
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:39,440
scientific uh author he he he runs

985
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:41,719
around the world to all the places not

986
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:45,760
the Cannabis cups but to the places

987
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:49,199
where genetics orig originate from where

988
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:52,559
thread and fiber is originated from he's

989
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:55,879
gone deep into that kind of side of

990
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:58,920
things he's gone to the Russian uh areas

991
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:01,960
and and Ukraine and found strains and

992
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:05,039
helped keep preserve a lot of hemp

993
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:07,440
varieties you know in seed form up in in

994
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:10,558
the cold storage and uh he's done a lot

995
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:15,400
of uh unsung uh hero kind of work and

996
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:19,880
and for me he's still a very reliable um

997
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:22,519
um source of um incredible um

998
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:25,880
intelligence when it comes to a

999
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:28,719
practical uh education and a and a theor

1000
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:31,880
theoretical education of cannabis so for

1001
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:34,598
me um I don't really

1002
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:37,480
read a lot of the other guys books I

1003
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:39,760
mean I'm friendly with them all but you

1004
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:41,199
know I don't think that they I think

1005
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,520
they're writing it from a different

1006
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:45,118
perspective uh whereas Rob has always

1007
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:48,519
written it from a scientific point of

1008
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:51,599
view with provable referenced um

1009
00:43:48,519 --> 00:43:54,039
articles and and I like his books and I

1010
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:56,039
think he's to the point and so as far as

1011
00:43:54,039 --> 00:43:57,719
that goes yes I think he's probably the

1012
00:43:56,039 --> 00:44:02,400
best cannabis

1013
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:04,879
writer um around you know in in in a um

1014
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:07,440
when it comes to not having your ego or

1015
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,640
opinion um involved in what you're

1016
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,039
writing

1017
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:14,239
so you know yeah brilliant what a what a

1018
00:44:12,039 --> 00:44:16,079
testament highly regarded by all but

1019
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:18,799
awesome to hear that you you have him in

1020
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:20,760
such high esteems a little earlier you

1021
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,599
mentioned that there's issues of over

1022
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:24,440
the years like parents changing and

1023
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:25,838
stuff of of strains that are offered by

1024
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:27,079
certain companies and I guess I'm

1025
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:29,000
interested in this from the point

1026
00:44:27,079 --> 00:44:31,359
interview that I know like one of the

1027
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,599
notable cases was like Simon of serious

1028
00:44:31,358 --> 00:44:35,679
seeds mentioned that at a certain point

1029
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:37,880
the parents of C Miss changed because

1030
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:39,519
one of the parents got lost I guess it

1031
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:41,838
started getting me thinking like what

1032
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:44,639
are some of the challenges in general of

1033
00:44:41,838 --> 00:44:46,799
maintaining a library of stock over such

1034
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:48,679
a long period of time there's got to be

1035
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,119
things that the average person isn't

1036
00:44:48,679 --> 00:44:52,118
even thinking about when you're

1037
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:54,079
comparing it and have you ever had any

1038
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:55,800
issues with like mixed up stock or

1039
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:58,359
parents accidentally being lost things

1040
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:03,640
like that every single issue in the book

1041
00:44:58,358 --> 00:45:06,880
I've had I can tell you the thing is um

1042
00:45:03,639 --> 00:45:11,159
in the old days when you found something

1043
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:13,599
like medicine man like Widow white r

1044
00:45:11,159 --> 00:45:16,399
whatever it was that we when you found

1045
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:19,318
that genetic and you actually had that

1046
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:21,920
genetic you would have to cut you didn't

1047
00:45:19,318 --> 00:45:23,838
want to share it because that was your

1048
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,599
new baby you've been working on it for a

1049
00:45:23,838 --> 00:45:28,880
while it was your new baby but you put

1050
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:31,599
it in rooms of people who were growing

1051
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:33,400
stuff for you so you had a backup right

1052
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:36,318
in two or three different places because

1053
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:38,240
many time you got busted and you lost

1054
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:40,800
the mother room or someone followed you

1055
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:42,719
home and they ripped you off or every

1056
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,960
story in the book has happened uh

1057
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:46,838
unfortunately and I've lost I've told

1058
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,838
you last time I had in four five

1059
00:45:46,838 --> 00:45:51,639
countries and I lost in four countries

1060
00:45:48,838 --> 00:45:53,799
all my backups only had one left and I

1061
00:45:51,639 --> 00:45:57,279
was in jail at that time when I came out

1062
00:45:53,800 --> 00:46:01,280
I I mean it was a

1063
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:02,559
incredible relief but um I know the same

1064
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:05,760
thing happened to Neville I know the

1065
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:08,760
same things happened to every Simon he

1066
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:10,920
recently had to redo all of his mothers

1067
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:14,960
because he got the viroid uh I speak to

1068
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:17,440
him quite frequently um he buys pills

1069
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:20,559
for his father from my my company in

1070
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:22,599
Czech Republic you know the CBD stuff so

1071
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:24,319
um we're we're all I'm I'm pretty

1072
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:27,480
friendly with most of them and and we're

1073
00:46:24,318 --> 00:46:30,599
all um we talk openly and and uh yes we

1074
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:33,280
do all have problems and yes the the

1075
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:36,160
hardest part of the job has been like I

1076
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:39,280
said keeping Mothers Healthy Mothers

1077
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:41,558
safe and the original genetic labeled

1078
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:45,079
properly in all different countries when

1079
00:46:41,559 --> 00:46:47,960
you're not there um there's no doubt

1080
00:46:45,079 --> 00:46:53,800
that uh we've lost plants during our

1081
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:58,039
lifetimes um he male how never lost died

1082
00:46:53,800 --> 00:47:01,920
a G13 original died uh

1083
00:46:58,039 --> 00:47:06,920
uh he he lost various plants you know um

1084
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:09,760
um I I also went through uh uh Hawaii 5

1085
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:12,119
I lost at one stage heavy duty fruity n

1086
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,000
uh I lost I have it in seed I have a lot

1087
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:16,519
of this in seed form I have can go back

1088
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,519
but the original genetic that I selected

1089
00:47:16,519 --> 00:47:22,960
which I made certain things from we lost

1090
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:25,719
but we have the same gene Geno uh um

1091
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,960
generation so I can always find the

1092
00:47:25,719 --> 00:47:30,558
genotype

1093
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:32,599
but to find the Turin and the all the

1094
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:33,599
other small differences that made that

1095
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:37,440
plant

1096
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:41,200
special uh you know um luckily you know

1097
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:44,039
genetics is based on genes so so you can

1098
00:47:41,199 --> 00:47:46,719
recreate things similarly but maybe not

1099
00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:49,199
exactly you know and um so I know

1100
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:51,519
Simon's got different like me he's got

1101
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:53,960
different Generations in in in in cold

1102
00:47:51,519 --> 00:47:56,039
storage and and you know if you have to

1103
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:58,639
go back and and you got to bust open

1104
00:47:56,039 --> 00:48:02,279
something and find find another father

1105
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:04,799
or mother or or nowadays is just mainly

1106
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:06,440
selections um you know and you can spray

1107
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:09,680
them and self them and do all that sort

1108
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:12,480
of stuff but um I I still don't like to

1109
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:14,318
use humanized or autof flowering in in

1110
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:17,000
the the breeding world because I I still

1111
00:48:14,318 --> 00:48:18,679
think true male and female expresses

1112
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,358
something different but that's just my

1113
00:48:18,679 --> 00:48:25,078
personal thing you know there's a lot of

1114
00:48:20,358 --> 00:48:28,159
guys proving me wrong um but I don't

1115
00:48:25,079 --> 00:48:30,519
know I'm still when it comes to going

1116
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:34,279
back to finding the original parents of

1117
00:48:30,519 --> 00:48:37,159
a particular St like Afghan and hay for

1118
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:41,319
example I the Afghan te that made that

1119
00:48:37,159 --> 00:48:44,159
up originally from Nev he selected that

1120
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:46,558
and then crossed it with the haze C you

1121
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:49,159
know and the haze a and then you got two

1122
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:51,160
different versions and then we have to

1123
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:53,000
start with selection and that took quite

1124
00:48:51,159 --> 00:48:54,879
some time it's not like the first one

1125
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,599
that pops out is the right one you know

1126
00:48:54,880 --> 00:49:00,318
so and then you keep that live and you

1127
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:03,440
know and it's a established building

1128
00:49:00,318 --> 00:49:07,798
block over 30 30 well older than my kids

1129
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:10,559
so still the same so you know wow that's

1130
00:49:07,798 --> 00:49:13,679
impressive just the longevity of its

1131
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:16,079
lifespan is incredible and you mentioned

1132
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:17,759
the the haze dropping off you you picked

1133
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,400
my ears because I had heard rumors and

1134
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,880
I'll be honest I kind of doubted it but

1135
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:24,280
I figured I'll ask you why not have you

1136
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:27,400
heard anything about the haze sea male

1137
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:30,720
still being alive I have it yeah of

1138
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:34,079
course oh look at that I think I'm the

1139
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:37,558
only guy with HC male I mean Neville

1140
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:39,318
gave it to me uh along with pure Haze

1141
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:43,760
and a few other things many years ago

1142
00:49:39,318 --> 00:49:47,400
plus all of the seed stuff um how have I

1143
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:49,079
been making the seeds for the last 30

1144
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:52,880
years in in the midst of night I mean

1145
00:49:49,079 --> 00:49:55,960
it's still if you have a look um I have

1146
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:58,559
now selected a Hayes AC mail which is

1147
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:02,720
something from old feed that I took two

1148
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:04,480
years to to bring to the table but um

1149
00:50:02,719 --> 00:50:07,078
yeah most everything we don't have the

1150
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:10,039
haze any I I don't have it in living

1151
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:15,000
form I only have it in in um seed form

1152
00:50:10,039 --> 00:50:16,719
mixed up um that's why like in the mango

1153
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,880
Haze the difference between mango Haze

1154
00:50:16,719 --> 00:50:23,399
and Super Silver Haze is that is the

1155
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:27,680
haze eight I think it was skunk Haze a

1156
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:31,079
with Northern Light Haze C

1157
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:32,879
um those two were the parents went

1158
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:34,680
eventually they selection and they were

1159
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:39,640
the parents that made the mango a

1160
00:50:34,679 --> 00:50:41,399
whereas the haze sea skunk the skunk hay

1161
00:50:39,639 --> 00:50:45,000
sea

1162
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:47,079
and not not not like H see that made the

1163
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,719
super silver haze line so that went they

1164
00:50:47,079 --> 00:50:51,798
were parallel we call the parallel cross

1165
00:50:49,719 --> 00:50:53,759
though they're all coming into

1166
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:56,159
eventually pedigree if you put it on a

1167
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:58,839
map you'd finally come to a pedigree

1168
00:50:56,159 --> 00:51:02,039
line um when everything had won the

1169
00:50:58,838 --> 00:51:03,639
Cuffs Neville used to started like that

1170
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:05,880
when he won something he used that as a

1171
00:51:03,639 --> 00:51:08,798
pedigree plant and then we only did

1172
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:10,559
pedigree breeding at one stage and with

1173
00:51:08,798 --> 00:51:14,079
the widows and all of that we kept that

1174
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:17,119
going in certain charts so yeah I mean

1175
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:18,760
there's a lot of um and there's a lot of

1176
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:21,119
things that people don't really

1177
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:24,240
understand as such like you know you

1178
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:27,079
sometimes when you select um an old sea

1179
00:51:24,239 --> 00:51:29,000
say a northern light one of and Northern

1180
00:51:27,079 --> 00:51:31,079
Light 2 and Northern Light five I've got

1181
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,519
old seed of that you will select a

1182
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:36,519
female and a male from that thing that

1183
00:51:33,519 --> 00:51:39,079
have been working properly so when you

1184
00:51:36,519 --> 00:51:40,798
cross it back you you you can use a male

1185
00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:42,720
version or a female version that might

1186
00:51:40,798 --> 00:51:44,480
be very slightly different giving

1187
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:47,118
different things but they're from the

1188
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:49,159
same genotype and and that way you're

1189
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:52,640
keeping the the

1190
00:51:49,159 --> 00:51:54,960
genes consistent and um the expression

1191
00:51:52,639 --> 00:51:57,400
maybe is different in the phenotype so

1192
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:59,199
yeah we

1193
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:00,920
no that's that's awesome to hear stok to

1194
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:02,598
hear you've still got it and you know

1195
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:04,280
you mentioned the super silver haze and

1196
00:52:02,599 --> 00:52:06,720
the mango Haze and I'd been thinking

1197
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:08,720
about that in the last episode you you

1198
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:10,480
made a comment that Neville had gone

1199
00:52:08,719 --> 00:52:12,399
through like thousands of seeds to find

1200
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,599
the super silver haze and you'd managed

1201
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,559
to do it with just 250 and I guess I was

1202
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:18,280
wondering do you attribute that sort of

1203
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:20,280
more to luck or do you think just the

1204
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:22,680
way you had bred the line differently to

1205
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:24,599
the way he had bred his allowed you to

1206
00:52:22,679 --> 00:52:26,679
be like a bit more focused and you

1207
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:27,920
didn't need to pop as many because bit

1208
00:52:26,679 --> 00:52:30,598
more of the selection was done in the

1209
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,599
breeding you

1210
00:52:30,679 --> 00:52:38,519
know it's a daisy it's a really hard

1211
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:41,559
thing it it I mean maybe I I I should

1212
00:52:38,519 --> 00:52:43,759
have done a thousand like Neville but

1213
00:52:41,559 --> 00:52:46,920
you know I think I found something that

1214
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:49,599
I I could really work with and it was U

1215
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:52,039
when I crossed it to see basically what

1216
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:54,480
we do is we we we put out a bunch of

1217
00:52:52,039 --> 00:52:56,558
seed and say 100 seed at a time and you

1218
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:59,318
pick the best three females best three

1219
00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:00,079
males you do the combinations you test

1220
00:52:59,318 --> 00:53:03,318
those

1221
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:05,359
seeds when you can easily test throw

1222
00:53:03,318 --> 00:53:07,358
away a male that is not performing you

1223
00:53:05,358 --> 00:53:08,598
see that very quickly in the progeny

1224
00:53:07,358 --> 00:53:11,558
test of

1225
00:53:08,599 --> 00:53:14,039
seed um if you don't do that you've got

1226
00:53:11,559 --> 00:53:16,160
no idea what you selling which a lot of

1227
00:53:14,039 --> 00:53:17,960
companies don't do and they have no idea

1228
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:21,879
what they're selling they just say

1229
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:24,679
that's the combination now um your

1230
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:27,480
punters eventually the guys who are uh

1231
00:53:24,679 --> 00:53:29,919
buying the seat um they they will expose

1232
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:32,760
you if you're not doing a good job and

1233
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:36,720
if you're if what you said is not coming

1234
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:40,880
up trumps and I mean um to this day it's

1235
00:53:36,719 --> 00:53:44,838
like never left what 20 OD 23 years ago

1236
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:47,838
from Europe I mean I can't keep I can't

1237
00:53:44,838 --> 00:53:50,960
have old seed batches in the fridges

1238
00:53:47,838 --> 00:53:53,558
from from old AC it just I couldn't sell

1239
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:55,639
20y old seed you know what I mean I can

1240
00:53:53,559 --> 00:53:59,240
sell 2y old seed because it's still

1241
00:53:55,639 --> 00:54:01,480
maturing at that stage in inside but uh

1242
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:04,000
everything's kept in fridges everything

1243
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:08,480
uh is vacuum sealed it all has dates on

1244
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:11,199
it um old seed I offer to uh certain

1245
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:13,519
Growers who who ready to put out a big

1246
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:16,078
lump and maybe they get 80% germination

1247
00:54:13,519 --> 00:54:18,480
rather than 100 and they still buy it at

1248
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:20,519
at a reduced rate so we we kind of clear

1249
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:24,199
our stocks a lot of the

1250
00:54:20,519 --> 00:54:26,719
time um you know it I don't know how

1251
00:54:24,199 --> 00:54:30,639
other people run their companies but you

1252
00:54:26,719 --> 00:54:33,959
know you you've got to have backups in

1253
00:54:30,639 --> 00:54:36,798
genetics in seed form as well as having

1254
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:38,519
selected um real form mothers I mean

1255
00:54:36,798 --> 00:54:40,199
there's no doubt that that's the hardest

1256
00:54:38,519 --> 00:54:43,199
part of the job a mother room and a

1257
00:54:40,199 --> 00:54:46,480
clone room for me are the Mother

1258
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:48,239
Ship God yeah look kudos to you it just

1259
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:51,280
seems like an overwhelming task the more

1260
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:53,358
I think about it after our last episode

1261
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:55,119
we got a bunch of listeners who messaged

1262
00:54:53,358 --> 00:54:57,759
and they said I've never heard of this

1263
00:54:55,119 --> 00:55:00,280
Dr gavor and this sounds so interesting

1264
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:02,640
and you know everyone's really curious I

1265
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:05,000
guess the the the the summary of the

1266
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:06,480
overall questions I got from people was

1267
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,239
how come you think it didn't catch on

1268
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:11,119
quite as well as the sister lines of

1269
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:14,039
mango hay and Super Silver

1270
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:16,119
Hayes um quite easily can answer that we

1271
00:55:14,039 --> 00:55:20,279
lost the

1272
00:55:16,119 --> 00:55:22,079
plan we um it it it was a project you

1273
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:23,960
know you don't know that all these

1274
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:27,318
things are going to work and so no one

1275
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:29,400
kept backup we just made uh uh some

1276
00:55:27,318 --> 00:55:32,079
mothers we did a whole room of it we

1277
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:34,280
used even the old mothers in the room we

1278
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:35,720
had got compromised we had to go down I

1279
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:37,680
told you the story last time with my

1280
00:55:35,719 --> 00:55:40,919
father we had to go and chop it all up

1281
00:55:37,679 --> 00:55:43,838
and load it in there was not a living

1282
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:46,960
genetic left of Dr kavan there was some

1283
00:55:43,838 --> 00:55:49,719
seed that we'd made with that strain and

1284
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:52,559
maybe one day um I know I've got

1285
00:55:49,719 --> 00:55:55,399
it um

1286
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:57,599
um it's not the easiest plan I remember

1287
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:59,280
it if I smell will just come straight

1288
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:02,079
back in my head

1289
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:04,480
but um there's a lot of work to do and

1290
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:07,880
there's a lot of weeks of flowering of

1291
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:10,358
waiting and you know like I don't know I

1292
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:14,838
mean they're big projects to to try to

1293
00:56:10,358 --> 00:56:18,279
refine I prefer to go into it um and and

1294
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:22,279
bust open old seed and see what I

1295
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:24,319
find rather than try to try to control

1296
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:27,200
what I'm wanting to find you know I want

1297
00:56:24,318 --> 00:56:29,519
to be more open about about it and

1298
00:56:27,199 --> 00:56:32,759
sometimes there's some really unusual

1299
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:36,079
like early Queen for example is a very

1300
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:38,880
different smelling unique

1301
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:42,440
genetic um originating from some early

1302
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:45,480
Pearl Early Girl sort of stuff that was

1303
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:48,079
around and that that was it's still has

1304
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:50,119
a different flavor different smell and a

1305
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:53,200
different effect and I think a lot of

1306
00:56:50,119 --> 00:56:56,920
the people the seed is incredibly small

1307
00:56:53,199 --> 00:56:59,358
and dark and um it's uh it's a real

1308
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:01,240
interesting kind of line and I kept it

1309
00:56:59,358 --> 00:57:03,318
going because you know we we've made

1310
00:57:01,239 --> 00:57:06,798
some Early Skunk vers we've made a lot

1311
00:57:03,318 --> 00:57:09,759
of um plants that have been practical

1312
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:13,159
for Growers with projects in limited

1313
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:15,319
seasons and and I've busted a load of

1314
00:57:13,159 --> 00:57:17,879
seeds for those sort of guys or made

1315
00:57:15,318 --> 00:57:20,599
seeds specifically for certain guys that

1316
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:23,960
had a six week uh demand you know sort

1317
00:57:20,599 --> 00:57:26,640
of flowering season and and and you know

1318
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:28,519
they had to still bust open uh some sees

1319
00:57:26,639 --> 00:57:30,480
but they found the six week or the 5 and

1320
00:57:28,519 --> 00:57:32,838
1/ half week flowering one and they were

1321
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:34,880
done and and they were in and out of

1322
00:57:32,838 --> 00:57:36,679
their operation and uh they're probably

1323
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:39,440
living happily ever after on some little

1324
00:57:36,679 --> 00:57:41,879
island now got nothing to do with

1325
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:43,400
marijuana but we had a lot of unusual

1326
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:46,440
people in those days coming to Holland

1327
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:48,480
to buy you know huge volumes of seed and

1328
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:51,039
uh they describe what they were looking

1329
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:53,119
to do and and I think I never heard of

1330
00:57:51,039 --> 00:57:55,640
them I never heard they got busted and I

1331
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:57,400
think that that's the successful ones

1332
00:57:55,639 --> 00:58:01,639
when you don't hear about

1333
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:02,358
anybody obviously I love that sucessful

1334
00:58:01,639 --> 00:58:04,798
you

1335
00:58:02,358 --> 00:58:06,679
know yeah look hopefully they're off on

1336
00:58:04,798 --> 00:58:09,000
a Caribbean Island somewhere living it

1337
00:58:06,679 --> 00:58:11,118
up as a quick followup I guess I'd love

1338
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,880
to ask firstly what's the most unique

1339
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:14,079
Turpin profile like weirdest thing

1340
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,599
you've ever smelled and as a quick

1341
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:16,920
followup those plants you just

1342
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:18,440
referenced are they the quickest

1343
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:19,760
flowering you've ever heard of or have

1344
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:22,760
you heard of something

1345
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:26,240
quicker oh no they were they were in

1346
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:29,119
some of I mean I've heard people say

1347
00:58:26,239 --> 00:58:31,519
that they've um they found even quicker

1348
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:33,880
stuff whether it's finished or whether

1349
00:58:31,519 --> 00:58:37,159
it's mature I don't know I wasn't there

1350
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:39,599
but uh I I don't I think a natural cycle

1351
00:58:37,159 --> 00:58:43,879
is around you know sort of you pretty

1352
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:46,640
much five six six weeks I mean you know

1353
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:48,519
you can cut things earlier but they're

1354
00:58:46,639 --> 00:58:50,400
not I don't think they're ready and and

1355
00:58:48,519 --> 00:58:53,038
I I honestly

1356
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:55,680
think when you think it's ready one week

1357
00:58:53,039 --> 00:58:59,119
extra you know that's kind of always

1358
00:58:55,679 --> 00:59:01,519
been a R the thumb because uh a lot of

1359
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:04,640
um um a lot of the things that you

1360
00:59:01,519 --> 00:59:06,960
you're not sure about um happen in these

1361
00:59:04,639 --> 00:59:09,960
last two or three weeks of flowering and

1362
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:13,480
and there's some there's some stuff that

1363
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:15,318
still hasn't been exposed with science

1364
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:18,079
that that we need to understand about

1365
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:20,000
that thing like whereas you can find out

1366
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:21,920
the alcohol levels and and all of the

1367
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,719
different things when it comes to grapes

1368
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:27,240
and the sugar content and those sort of

1369
00:59:24,719 --> 00:59:31,598
things we we need a lot more of that in

1370
00:59:27,239 --> 00:59:34,118
in sort of um um in people who have

1371
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:35,519
knowledge about uh what they're breeding

1372
00:59:34,119 --> 00:59:36,798
it for what they're growing it for what

1373
00:59:35,519 --> 00:59:39,318
the production for what the based

1374
00:59:36,798 --> 00:59:42,639
products for what you know there's

1375
00:59:39,318 --> 00:59:45,838
there's a multitude of things you can do

1376
00:59:42,639 --> 00:59:47,480
now with this plant and so I think

1377
00:59:45,838 --> 00:59:52,078
having sometimes a

1378
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:54,719
pure sativa and a pure indic

1379
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:56,880
extract and blending them in different

1380
00:59:54,719 --> 01:00:00,399
concentrations you come up with some

1381
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:03,358
really interesting ideas and um

1382
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:05,000
different flavors and what one of the

1383
01:00:03,358 --> 01:00:08,759
questions that you ask me was what's the

1384
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:12,039
most unique one well I

1385
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:14,079
mean that's an exceptionally difficult

1386
01:00:12,039 --> 01:00:17,240
um question to answer

1387
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:19,440
because um like I said early Queen was

1388
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:22,159
very unusual compared to the fress of

1389
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:24,639
skunks and the and the heavy buiness of

1390
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:27,480
the kushers and the and the the the body

1391
01:00:24,639 --> 01:00:30,118
odors or the onion kind of flavors of

1392
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:33,960
the widows and and then maybe some

1393
01:00:30,119 --> 01:00:35,960
Menthol alpines of the the hazes you can

1394
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:39,159
have rough

1395
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:41,440
generalizations but specific

1396
01:00:39,159 --> 01:00:44,199
plants don't fit into those rough

1397
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:46,200
generalizations when you start to single

1398
01:00:44,199 --> 01:00:48,480
them out you single them out for some

1399
01:00:46,199 --> 01:00:50,759
reason to do with the old factory system

1400
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:54,559
or or the effect or the one of the

1401
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:56,559
sensors that it it hit you with and uh

1402
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:59,000
and uh up until

1403
01:00:56,559 --> 01:01:01,960
um like the CBD crew where with science

1404
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:05,719
was helping us select um these were just

1405
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:08,559
all personal um reasoning behind it and

1406
01:01:05,719 --> 01:01:11,519
personal likes and dislikes and that's

1407
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:14,359
why some structures uh I can identify as

1408
01:01:11,519 --> 01:01:16,318
Neville's plants from other people and

1409
01:01:14,358 --> 01:01:18,679
others I can identify as mine because he

1410
01:01:16,318 --> 01:01:21,480
went for kind of a different flowering

1411
01:01:18,679 --> 01:01:24,279
cluster that looked more like balls that

1412
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:27,159
fit on top of each other where I I had

1413
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:29,839
more individual flowers that were not

1414
01:01:27,159 --> 01:01:32,038
like that structure and so many time I

1415
01:01:29,838 --> 01:01:34,440
see it you know that they've leaned

1416
01:01:32,039 --> 01:01:36,760
towards those sort of thing I mean you

1417
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:38,400
got to face it Neville was uh out there

1418
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:40,680
he was selling seed before most

1419
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:43,639
everybody commercially to many corners

1420
01:01:40,679 --> 01:01:46,919
of the world and I think a lot of that

1421
01:01:43,639 --> 01:01:49,318
um you know it's the Adam and Eve of of

1422
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:51,519
the seed companies it was a lot of

1423
01:01:49,318 --> 01:01:52,920
things evolved out of that original

1424
01:01:51,519 --> 01:01:55,920
stuff you know went

1425
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:57,960
to um different Corners like I said in

1426
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,798
and you know um there's some excellent

1427
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:03,000
grows out there that took it on and and

1428
01:01:59,798 --> 01:02:05,759
ran with it and um we see a lot of those

1429
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:08,119
strains that now pop up every so often

1430
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:11,440
some people say they created but usually

1431
01:02:08,119 --> 01:02:13,519
I think they've been created by

1432
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:15,720
excellent grower and hobby breeders who

1433
01:02:13,519 --> 01:02:19,199
have been staying very quiet and don't

1434
01:02:15,719 --> 01:02:22,000
commercialize their strain someone did

1435
01:02:19,199 --> 01:02:25,199
it for them and and and some ego took it

1436
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:27,239
on and you know and then I call it the

1437
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:29,759
seed circuit nowadays because there's

1438
01:02:27,239 --> 01:02:32,199
just there's not a lot of specific

1439
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:34,440
knowledge where certain things

1440
01:02:32,199 --> 01:02:37,679
originated from they they're all more

1441
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:39,599
poly hybrid kind of things that you

1442
01:02:37,679 --> 01:02:41,719
started at that level and then you went

1443
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:45,200
on with it there so I

1444
01:02:41,719 --> 01:02:49,239
mean I mean it's very difficult to to do

1445
01:02:45,199 --> 01:02:50,960
that you know um to to to start with

1446
01:02:49,239 --> 01:02:53,759
something that you got no idea where the

1447
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:56,039
original parents what they were you

1448
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:57,480
might know theoretically but you wer you

1449
01:02:56,039 --> 01:02:59,880
don't have them or you didn't see them

1450
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:01,559
and and what their parents were and

1451
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:03,358
until you get back to a pure form

1452
01:03:01,559 --> 01:03:06,599
whether it was an Afghan or a taii or a

1453
01:03:03,358 --> 01:03:11,679
Mexican or you know where did come from

1454
01:03:06,599 --> 01:03:15,079
and um so I still prefer that kind of um

1455
01:03:11,679 --> 01:03:16,919
um kind of knowledge about strains

1456
01:03:15,079 --> 01:03:19,960
so of

1457
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:21,920
course now I love the passion the F1

1458
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:24,079
hybrid magic and also for keeping things

1459
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:26,119
pure so you can do that and I mean while

1460
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:28,720
we're on that topic I feel like there's

1461
01:03:26,119 --> 01:03:30,358
a lot of variable terminology used in

1462
01:03:28,719 --> 01:03:31,879
the Cannabis industry you know lots of

1463
01:03:30,358 --> 01:03:33,400
words get used which maybe aren't

1464
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:35,920
necessarily the correct word for that

1465
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:37,760
situation and specifically I'd be

1466
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:39,680
interested in knowing your thoughts on

1467
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:42,440
inbred lines and I guess the question

1468
01:03:39,679 --> 01:03:44,679
for me is is it is it about reaching a

1469
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:46,159
certain number of back crosses or filial

1470
01:03:44,679 --> 01:03:47,318
breeding or is it more just about

1471
01:03:46,159 --> 01:03:50,118
getting it to the point where it

1472
01:03:47,318 --> 01:03:52,639
expresses fairly true and that's like

1473
01:03:50,119 --> 01:03:55,160
kind of independent of the the number of

1474
01:03:52,639 --> 01:03:56,239
Generations how do you think about it

1475
01:03:55,159 --> 01:04:00,159
well

1476
01:03:56,239 --> 01:04:04,239
um I can tell you that honestly when

1477
01:04:00,159 --> 01:04:08,759
when I sold a seed or never sold a seed

1478
01:04:04,239 --> 01:04:11,239
um no matter what we started

1479
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:15,278
from after

1480
01:04:11,239 --> 01:04:17,719
three possibly four generations of

1481
01:04:15,278 --> 01:04:20,278
someone doing it taking that seed from

1482
01:04:17,719 --> 01:04:23,038
us and going over to another corner of

1483
01:04:20,278 --> 01:04:25,358
the world and then choosing his male and

1484
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:28,920
female and making his seat after three

1485
01:04:25,358 --> 01:04:32,239
or four or uh four would be for sure

1486
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:35,400
after four crosses and using that Z it

1487
01:04:32,239 --> 01:04:38,118
is so far away from what originally sold

1488
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:40,278
even though you call it the same let's

1489
01:04:38,119 --> 01:04:42,039
say Northern Lights because most people

1490
01:04:40,278 --> 01:04:45,039
have got a completely different version

1491
01:04:42,039 --> 01:04:47,559
of it it might have started with NE he

1492
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:51,680
crossed to

1493
01:04:47,559 --> 01:04:54,319
nl2 to nl1 or NL and then he selected

1494
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:57,038
the nl5 from one of those combinations

1495
01:04:54,318 --> 01:04:59,038
originally there a lot of stories and

1496
01:04:57,039 --> 01:05:01,359
I've got a lot of that Original Seed and

1497
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:05,599
and as I said there's male and female

1498
01:05:01,358 --> 01:05:07,719
versions of of of these things so um

1499
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:09,640
some people say that I mix it up many

1500
01:05:07,719 --> 01:05:11,598
time now but I use the male version and

1501
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:15,078
the female version or the female version

1502
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:18,960
the my old version to make another line

1503
01:05:15,079 --> 01:05:21,160
um I don't have the time and and um to

1504
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:24,079
to go through every specific strain and

1505
01:05:21,159 --> 01:05:26,598
that with every single person but and

1506
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:30,000
explain why I do certain things but but

1507
01:05:26,599 --> 01:05:34,160
just generally when you uh when when you

1508
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:37,559
you start with um things that have um a

1509
01:05:34,159 --> 01:05:39,598
name and then you do three or four

1510
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:41,278
versions away they're still the same

1511
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:43,000
name people will still call it Northern

1512
01:05:41,278 --> 01:05:44,639
Light for example but it won't be

1513
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,239
anything to do with what originally

1514
01:05:44,639 --> 01:05:48,960
looked

1515
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:50,759
like yeah certainly it is one of those

1516
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,480
things where it does it does change a

1517
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:55,200
lot and it's almost like it Taps into

1518
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:58,719
this secondary topic where sometimes you

1519
01:05:55,199 --> 01:06:02,159
find more novice buyers will have this

1520
01:05:58,719 --> 01:06:05,480
misconception that a certain strain in

1521
01:06:02,159 --> 01:06:07,358
the F4 is inherently better than the F1

1522
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:08,519
or the F2 you know and you must deal

1523
01:06:07,358 --> 01:06:12,000
with this a

1524
01:06:08,519 --> 01:06:15,880
lot um you don't know how much I deal

1525
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:18,358
with that um it's really a lot but I try

1526
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:20,880
to be patient with those things because

1527
01:06:18,358 --> 01:06:22,440
um not not everybody understands exactly

1528
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:26,358
what they're doing you

1529
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:29,079
know um many times when you make a

1530
01:06:26,358 --> 01:06:32,159
selection just again let's say you you

1531
01:06:29,079 --> 01:06:35,079
bought a skunk one seed from us and the

1532
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:37,399
[ __ ] seed I call it and and you you you

1533
01:06:35,079 --> 01:06:38,920
pick a male and a female and you pick

1534
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:41,079
three and three and then you found your

1535
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:44,559
best female and best male you you you

1536
01:06:41,079 --> 01:06:48,079
call it number one and and number one M

1537
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:51,519
for male and and you you you do your

1538
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:53,798
work and you know everybody uh loves

1539
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:56,880
what you're producing and it comes out a

1540
01:06:53,798 --> 01:07:00,239
particular way and every is is sweet you

1541
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:02,720
know and you're known for that um

1542
01:07:00,239 --> 01:07:05,479
however someone else has taken the same

1543
01:07:02,719 --> 01:07:07,399
seed that bought it with you at the shop

1544
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:09,039
and they've gone with their favorite

1545
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:10,720
male and their favorite female and

1546
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:14,119
they've produced something that has got

1547
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:18,278
a lot more flavor it's smaller bud it's

1548
01:07:14,119 --> 01:07:20,720
exactly the same name same genotype

1549
01:07:18,278 --> 01:07:22,760
completely different pheno type and

1550
01:07:20,719 --> 01:07:26,519
you're both calling it the same thing

1551
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:28,480
this is unfortunately um

1552
01:07:26,519 --> 01:07:30,480
the the very difficult thing to explain

1553
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:32,719
to everybody in this industry especially

1554
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:37,358
newcomers that that not everything with

1555
01:07:32,719 --> 01:07:40,519
a generic name is from the same

1556
01:07:37,358 --> 01:07:43,759
generational seed that originated from

1557
01:07:40,519 --> 01:07:45,920
and why get so animated and

1558
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:47,799
argumentative about things or so

1559
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:49,798
passionate about things that you would

1560
01:07:47,798 --> 01:07:53,440
never know even if they put it in front

1561
01:07:49,798 --> 01:07:54,920
of you and you had a vision of it you

1562
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:57,440
wouldn't even know because you were not

1563
01:07:54,920 --> 01:08:00,519
born in it was probably different to

1564
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:03,358
what the original version was and uh

1565
01:08:00,519 --> 01:08:05,159
there's a selection for um making a

1566
01:08:03,358 --> 01:08:08,639
production there's a selection for

1567
01:08:05,159 --> 01:08:11,159
genetics to make seed sometimes I many

1568
01:08:08,639 --> 01:08:14,318
times like I had a widow that was a a

1569
01:08:11,159 --> 01:08:16,079
better producer for uh commercial people

1570
01:08:14,318 --> 01:08:19,519
that wanted to use that so I give them a

1571
01:08:16,079 --> 01:08:21,399
cut of that whereas selling the seed you

1572
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:23,239
know you get a lot of differences coming

1573
01:08:21,399 --> 01:08:24,679
up and and some guys in Australia

1574
01:08:23,238 --> 01:08:26,559
hitting it on the head and other guys in

1575
01:08:24,679 --> 01:08:28,399
Canada not finding it and think it's a

1576
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:31,560
lot of [ __ ]

1577
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:34,278
so it really depends on the person's

1578
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:36,839
knowledge and and what they're looking

1579
01:08:34,279 --> 01:08:40,279
for and and if they know anything about

1580
01:08:36,838 --> 01:08:43,838
the origins uh and what they were and if

1581
01:08:40,279 --> 01:08:47,040
they actually used it because what how I

1582
01:08:43,838 --> 01:08:50,198
describe things when I write it down um

1583
01:08:47,039 --> 01:08:53,399
many people have just photocopied or cut

1584
01:08:50,198 --> 01:08:56,479
and paste and and they that's

1585
01:08:53,399 --> 01:08:58,879
used Forever on every other company that

1586
01:08:56,479 --> 01:09:01,039
I've see you know I've see how people

1587
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:03,039
are quite lazy they just take what's

1588
01:09:01,039 --> 01:09:06,278
online and and they think it as the

1589
01:09:03,039 --> 01:09:08,519
gospel truth but you know I still think

1590
01:09:06,279 --> 01:09:11,000
that everything that you crack open or

1591
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:14,120
you select you should do two or three

1592
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:16,319
times in a grow room before you really

1593
01:09:14,119 --> 01:09:18,960
understand what you're talking about

1594
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:21,159
there and what flavors are there and how

1595
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:22,960
well it it performs because it's easy to

1596
01:09:21,158 --> 01:09:26,439
write a lot of [ __ ] and there's no

1597
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:29,759
one um censoring this because we're

1598
01:09:26,439 --> 01:09:32,119
still in a in a pirate industry where

1599
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:33,399
we're allowed we're not legal because

1600
01:09:32,119 --> 01:09:37,000
making high

1601
01:09:33,399 --> 01:09:41,639
THC uh strains and growing flowers is

1602
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:43,719
still breaking the law of 0.3% THC so

1603
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:47,679
the seed's inside and that's legal once

1604
01:09:43,719 --> 01:09:49,439
it's there but flow is not so you know

1605
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:51,880
still to this day every seed company is

1606
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:56,279
based on that and uh which makes them

1607
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:59,319
all illegal actually you know

1608
01:09:56,279 --> 01:10:01,158
wow there you go there you go I mean

1609
01:09:59,319 --> 01:10:04,920
there's not a legal Seed Company in the

1610
01:10:01,158 --> 01:10:07,359
world unless they're medically allowed

1611
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:08,600
uh and licensed you know but all of the

1612
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:11,799
commercial

1613
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:15,000
companies uh the Dutch Pion the serious

1614
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:17,560
the green the Mr Nice the everyone we're

1615
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:20,679
all based on that principle don't get

1616
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:24,000
caught while you're producing seed and

1617
01:10:20,679 --> 01:10:26,840
uh because you're over 3%

1618
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:29,920
TFC there you go look we're all very

1619
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:32,000
grateful that you do it for us and uh

1620
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:33,640
just as a quick change of topic you know

1621
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,719
I've been thinking a lot recently and I

1622
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:38,480
talked to lots of guests about how

1623
01:10:35,719 --> 01:10:40,239
integral it is as like sort of a new or

1624
01:10:38,479 --> 01:10:43,359
an upand cominging breeder these days to

1625
01:10:40,238 --> 01:10:45,119
be on social media and I see you do a

1626
01:10:43,359 --> 01:10:47,839
good job on social media but I wanted to

1627
01:10:45,119 --> 01:10:49,960
go back a bit back in the day things

1628
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:51,679
like High Times and the like were kind

1629
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:54,198
of the social media in a sense and they

1630
01:10:51,679 --> 01:10:55,880
were a massive player compared to say

1631
01:10:54,198 --> 01:10:57,879
what they are today

1632
01:10:55,880 --> 01:11:00,319
what was it like for you to have won a

1633
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:01,760
cup like was like the mailbox exploding

1634
01:11:00,319 --> 01:11:03,759
the next day with orders like what sort

1635
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:08,920
of an effect did these guys have back in

1636
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:11,360
the day they I agree with you the old

1637
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:15,560
social media work

1638
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:17,799
magazines um their relevance has died

1639
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:20,640
away considerably there now there's a

1640
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:22,840
lot of online magazines and you know

1641
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:25,480
they sort of like online newspapers and

1642
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:28,880
stuff they they're red people still like

1643
01:11:25,479 --> 01:11:30,919

1661
01:12:11,719 --> 01:12:16,679
drop like that so at the post office box

1662
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:19,679

I love the post and there's something

1673
01:12:46,359 --> 01:12:52,198
still seriously great about receiving

1674
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:54,840
physical mail um with Christmas cards

1675
01:12:52,198 --> 01:12:56,960

ask asking please and with an return

1677
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:03,039
address with Joe Smith on it um I've

1678
01:13:00,359 --> 01:13:07,079
seen everything you know people even s

1679
01:13:03,039 --> 01:13:09,039
sending coins from Poland and I it's

1680
01:13:07,079 --> 01:13:11,158
like yeah you have to educate them they

1681
01:13:09,039 --> 01:13:14,479
really think that that this is all it

1682
01:13:11,158 --> 01:13:19,638
was all very ille legal and everything

1683
01:13:14,479 --> 01:13:23,079
but you know um uh it magazines made it

1684
01:13:19,639 --> 01:13:24,760
look like that and they were we were the

1685
01:13:23,079 --> 01:13:26,600
reason High Times went to Holland was

1686
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:28,360
because it was illegal in America and

1687
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:31,920
the only place they could hold the cup

1688
01:13:28,359 --> 01:13:34,960
was in Holland so we we had you know

1689
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:37,279
fantastic seats for that game and and we

1690
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:39,359
we were there and it was just purely

1691
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:42,079
because Holland was the first place that

1692
01:13:39,359 --> 01:13:45,319
allowed the marijuana Refugee to fill it

1693
01:13:42,079 --> 01:13:47,119
own and we were able to do these events

1694
01:13:45,319 --> 01:13:49,719
there and of course they were huge for

1695
01:13:47,119 --> 01:13:52,840
us in those days I don't think they're

1696
01:13:49,719 --> 01:13:55,760
very important anymore um I I actually

1697
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:57,719
don't advertise in I work with one or

1698
01:13:55,760 --> 01:14:00,000
two me I don't really do anything with

1699
01:13:57,719 --> 01:14:04,679
meaz themes anymore I think they lost

1700
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:07,079
their relevance um I think um um they're

1701
01:14:04,679 --> 01:14:08,319
still nice for people to to read

1702
01:14:07,079 --> 01:14:10,238
sometimes when you're at a waiting room

1703
01:14:08,319 --> 01:14:12,319
or something like that but I don't think

1704
01:14:10,238 --> 01:14:16,319
there there's nothing new going on in

1705
01:14:12,319 --> 01:14:19,880
the industry uh that quickly to allow so

1706
01:14:16,319 --> 01:14:22,279
many different uh uh articles to do with

1707
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:25,359
this particular plant and uh so I think

1708
01:14:22,279 --> 01:14:28,639
they regurgitate a lot of the time um

1709
01:14:25,359 --> 01:14:31,198
old old stuff that hasn't really changed

1710
01:14:28,639 --> 01:14:33,239
and the changes are incremental you know

1711
01:14:31,198 --> 01:14:35,279
the scientific changes so every time

1712
01:14:33,238 --> 01:14:38,479
there's a big one everyone wres about it

1713
01:14:35,279 --> 01:14:42,238
all but uh you know they had their

1714
01:14:38,479 --> 01:14:45,399
relevance the '90s was fantastic when I

1715
01:14:42,238 --> 01:14:47,319
was with the greenhouse and we owe

1716
01:14:45,399 --> 01:14:51,119
probably all of our success to the High

1717
01:14:47,319 --> 01:14:53,639
Times magazine at that stage uh then

1718
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:56,198
towards the end it was very corruptible

1719
01:14:53,639 --> 01:14:57,679
kind of organization as well and and

1720
01:14:56,198 --> 01:15:01,279
there was a lot of

1721
01:14:57,679 --> 01:15:03,480
corruptible coffee shop owners and you

1722
01:15:01,279 --> 01:15:06,639
we were also you know part of that whole

1723
01:15:03,479 --> 01:15:09,158
thing and and so I I particularly

1724
01:15:06,639 --> 01:15:12,760
didn't yeah my time had come to leave

1725
01:15:09,158 --> 01:15:14,399
Fallen around 98 and so I did a big

1726
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:16,960
thing with Neville that year and then I

1727
01:15:14,399 --> 01:15:21,719
left that after that I sold my shares

1728
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:24,439
and I I left and went to SS but

1729
01:15:21,719 --> 01:15:26,319
um I did it mainly because I always

1730
01:15:24,439 --> 01:15:28,119
wanted to be

1731
01:15:26,319 --> 01:15:31,399
pharmaceutical I always thought there

1732
01:15:28,119 --> 01:15:34,039
was something much bigger than coffee

1733
01:15:31,399 --> 01:15:36,479
shop kind of mentality and I still

1734
01:15:34,039 --> 01:15:39,119
believe that to this day and um I've

1735
01:15:36,479 --> 01:15:41,799
reached that point where I do sell um a

1736
01:15:39,119 --> 01:15:44,198
lot of medical items now that I've made

1737
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:47,199
from my selection of my individual

1738
01:15:44,198 --> 01:15:49,399
plants that and not in a synthetic way

1739
01:15:47,198 --> 01:15:52,519
in a laboratory how they're meant to be

1740
01:15:49,399 --> 01:15:55,920
made for you know the the pharmaceutical

1741
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:59,320
standard and Regulatory body um I still

1742
01:15:55,920 --> 01:16:03,560
don't believe that the best people are

1743
01:15:59,319 --> 01:16:05,639
um are sitting in the right areas and

1744
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:08,280
making the right

1745
01:16:05,639 --> 01:16:10,279
judgments um but unfortunately it's like

1746
01:16:08,279 --> 01:16:14,039
you know who's the best person for that

1747
01:16:10,279 --> 01:16:15,880
job you know and where're you know it's

1748
01:16:14,039 --> 01:16:18,158
like politic it's like everything in the

1749
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:21,920
end you know money talk [ __ ] walks

1750
01:16:18,158 --> 01:16:25,920
and and uh seems that the the people who

1751
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:28,158
have a lot of money somehow managed to

1752
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:29,800
uh manipulate a little bit stronger than

1753
01:16:28,158 --> 01:16:32,799
people who have less

1754
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:34,920
money yeah isn't that the sad truth but

1755
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:37,039
I I guess if nothing else it's awesome

1756
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:38,840
to hear that you got to experience that

1757
01:16:37,039 --> 01:16:41,880
fantasy of you know the mailbox

1758
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:45,400
exploding with orders after that

1759
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:47,719
success I can tell you I mean it used to

1760
01:16:45,399 --> 01:16:49,319
I I'd go on my bike down to the post

1761
01:16:47,719 --> 01:16:52,198
office it was a little bit out it was

1762
01:16:49,319 --> 01:16:55,039
near Olympic stadium in

1763
01:16:52,198 --> 01:16:58,198
Amsterdam and it was a big one and it

1764
01:16:55,039 --> 01:16:59,960
was jam-packed many time they would they

1765
01:16:58,198 --> 01:17:01,319
knew me and they would come with other

1766
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:04,560
stuff because they couldn't fit it in

1767
01:17:01,319 --> 01:17:06,639
the box and sometime leave with bag and

1768
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:08,440
go home and it's a fan mail it was

1769
01:17:06,639 --> 01:17:14,639
[ __ ] unbelievable I mean people used

1770
01:17:08,439 --> 01:17:16,678
to send like embroided uh um t-shirts of

1771
01:17:14,639 --> 01:17:18,560
our logo and and they made it home

1772
01:17:16,679 --> 01:17:22,000
because I were so inspired by growing

1773
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:25,440
that plant or I mean I had leather work

1774
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:29,039
I had jewelry I had I mean it was

1775
01:17:25,439 --> 01:17:32,039
[ __ ] fantastic before social media

1776
01:17:29,039 --> 01:17:35,359
before TV before these mobile phone

1777
01:17:32,039 --> 01:17:38,880
stupidity but uh now we use it all and

1778
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:40,599
uh I I I try to stay relevant but I mean

1779
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:42,719
I got to tell you that most of the time

1780
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:44,840
the changes of a lot of things come from

1781
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:48,600
my kids like at the moment my son has

1782
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:50,679
been put in charge of changing the the

1783
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:53,360
logos and stuff and and getting the

1784
01:17:50,679 --> 01:17:56,359
shops working he's much more better uh

1785
01:17:53,359 --> 01:17:58,880
on the let's say the framework of the

1786
01:17:56,359 --> 01:18:03,399
the site and uh he's a younger guy he's

1787
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:06,920
16 17 and uh he listens and he learns

1788
01:18:03,399 --> 01:18:09,439
and he educates himself and get him put

1789
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:11,480
him in charge of of that and I think

1790
01:18:09,439 --> 01:18:13,359
he's doing a really good job like my

1791
01:18:11,479 --> 01:18:16,759
daughter he runs the auctions and she

1792
01:18:13,359 --> 01:18:20,198
talks to these unusual characters daily

1793
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:22,480
and she seems to be so tolerant I mean

1794
01:18:20,198 --> 01:18:25,079
he's doing her own thing as well but you

1795
01:18:22,479 --> 01:18:26,759
know I I'm really proud of that point of

1796
01:18:25,079 --> 01:18:29,840
view I suppose that

1797
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:31,800
that um I came out of the black into the

1798
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:34,239
white and now it's a family business you

1799
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:36,800
know it's kind of very

1800
01:18:34,238 --> 01:18:38,799
sweet that's so heartwarming to hear

1801
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:40,440
that it's now a family business I I love

1802
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:41,960
that and I want to touch on the site

1803
01:18:40,439 --> 01:18:44,198
after this but I want to quickly just

1804
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:46,158
ask first in the last answer you

1805
01:18:44,198 --> 01:18:47,919
mentioned how popular the White Widow

1806
01:18:46,158 --> 01:18:49,759
was and I was hoping I could get a

1807
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:51,719
little bit of the back story on that

1808
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:53,480
because I noticed the majority of the

1809
01:18:51,719 --> 01:18:55,279
sources online they say you're the

1810
01:18:53,479 --> 01:18:58,000
Creator but some of them reference this

1811
01:18:55,279 --> 01:19:00,960
guy ingar I was wondering how does that

1812
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:07,079
guy tie into it and how did you make the

1813
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:10,119
seedline um imma was uh was growing he

1814
01:19:07,079 --> 01:19:11,158
was working with us at that stage uh

1815
01:19:10,119 --> 01:19:14,158
right at that

1816
01:19:11,158 --> 01:19:18,000
stage um and

1817
01:19:14,158 --> 01:19:19,719
we he had selected some very good plants

1818
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,719
there was no doubt that he had some

1819
01:19:19,719 --> 01:19:25,000
excellent

1820
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:28,039
stuff um I worked on making the seed

1821
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:30,639
of um selected

1822
01:19:28,039 --> 01:19:32,760
material and so Greenhouse was

1823
01:19:30,639 --> 01:19:35,639
definitely the first company to make the

1824
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:39,760
seed version of the white

1825
01:19:35,639 --> 01:19:42,880
rder however at that time he was

1826
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:45,119
growing shark I mean I can tell you this

1827
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:46,880
we were growing very similar plants

1828
01:19:45,119 --> 01:19:49,840
shark he called

1829
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:52,239
Peacemaker um we c a

1830
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:55,239
shark uh there was probably one or two

1831
01:19:52,238 --> 01:19:56,879
other plants that he were the same name

1832
01:19:55,238 --> 01:19:58,678
and they sometimes were first and second

1833
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:01,840
in some of these competitions you know

1834
01:19:58,679 --> 01:20:03,880
they were they were the same plant uh he

1835
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:06,279
was growing flowers Aran was buying

1836
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:08,960
flowers back from him uh later on I

1837
01:20:06,279 --> 01:20:11,439
suppose they when I left they start to

1838
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:12,920
make some seed um they were very

1839
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:16,399
different for

1840
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:21,079
sure um I never shared the mail that I

1841
01:20:16,399 --> 01:20:24,119
had um and uh the female was probably

1842
01:20:21,079 --> 01:20:26,439
shared with ingma and probably two or

1843
01:20:24,119 --> 01:20:29,079
three other Growers at that stage who

1844
01:20:26,439 --> 01:20:31,279
were growing commercially for the coffee

1845
01:20:29,079 --> 01:20:35,119
shops that

1846
01:20:31,279 --> 01:20:39,359
version uh and um so of course you know

1847
01:20:35,119 --> 01:20:42,359
and he had uh he he wasn't a breeder he

1848
01:20:39,359 --> 01:20:45,000
was a flower producer um his story was

1849
01:20:42,359 --> 01:20:47,880
that he he when he was asked about it he

1850
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:52,319
said he found it in a piece of hash a

1851
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:55,199
seed um I I I gave the where it came

1852
01:20:52,319 --> 01:20:57,439
from carella Brazil and and then what we

1853
01:20:55,198 --> 01:21:00,079
did with it and and I actually that's

1854
01:20:57,439 --> 01:21:02,158
why I know that I'm I was the first seed

1855
01:21:00,079 --> 01:21:05,279
producer of white

1856
01:21:02,158 --> 01:21:07,599
widow um and in Holland there was a lot

1857
01:21:05,279 --> 01:21:11,679
of claims of everything I mean I've met

1858
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:14,480
guys uh still to this day have told me

1859
01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:16,520
that um that they were the original

1860
01:21:14,479 --> 01:21:19,559
creator of Master push for example I

1861
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:23,199
said to them well I have Master push SC

1862
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:25,400
and uh and you know I I know that who

1863
01:21:23,198 --> 01:21:29,039
knows but what would the parent and they

1864
01:21:25,399 --> 01:21:30,839
they would tell me Hindu Kush Hindu Kush

1865
01:21:29,039 --> 01:21:33,158
and I going yeah well I mean that

1866
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:35,719
doesn't I mean that's fine shows me the

1867
01:21:33,158 --> 01:21:38,119
area the valley it comes from but you

1868
01:21:35,719 --> 01:21:40,039
know I mean h Neville was already

1869
01:21:38,119 --> 01:21:42,840
working with so many people in the 80s

1870
01:21:40,039 --> 01:21:45,158
were working with Afghan STS already

1871
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:46,520
privately in Australia and Canada and

1872
01:21:45,158 --> 01:21:49,879
England

1873
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:52,120
everywhere uh you know showing the goods

1874
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:53,760
that was a different thing and that's

1875
01:21:52,119 --> 01:21:55,920
why I always say proof is in the seat

1876
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:57,960
bust open the seed and you'll understand

1877
01:21:55,920 --> 01:22:00,760
if if they've done their work properly

1878
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:03,279
if they haven't done their work properly

1879
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:05,320
um and most people unfortunately because

1880
01:22:03,279 --> 01:22:08,319
of the no regulations in this seed

1881
01:22:05,319 --> 01:22:10,719
industry uh wouldn't know what their the

1882
01:22:08,319 --> 01:22:12,599
original was because maybe they they

1883
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:14,560
heard about it they maybe seen the photo

1884
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:18,199
but their version is

1885
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:20,280
different you can give 10 Growers The

1886
01:22:18,198 --> 01:22:22,919
Identical genetic and they get 10

1887
01:22:20,279 --> 01:22:27,079
versions back that look different so you

1888
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:30,639
got to really understand that there's no

1889
01:22:27,079 --> 01:22:33,639
real story that is 100% correct it's I

1890
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:36,400
know my story what I did but uh all the

1891
01:22:33,639 --> 01:22:39,000
other he say was usually comes from

1892
01:22:36,399 --> 01:22:40,879
people who who were trying to um sort of

1893
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:43,319
commercialize something or or have a

1894
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:46,000
reason or angry or jealous I don't know

1895
01:22:43,319 --> 01:22:47,920
I mean I I don't care what people do I

1896
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:50,960
changed my name from One Widow to Black

1897
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:54,279
Widow that was how much I I wanted to go

1898
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:56,639
away from the misrepresented version of

1899
01:22:54,279 --> 01:22:59,439
what White Widow was turning into and

1900
01:22:56,639 --> 01:23:01,319
and um so I I don't think many people

1901
01:22:59,439 --> 01:23:04,399
copied me since

1902
01:23:01,319 --> 01:23:06,880
then there's a few but I mean uh I won't

1903
01:23:04,399 --> 01:23:09,799
mention them but I mean they critical

1904
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:11,600
mass is a perfect version you know it's

1905
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:13,800
a perfect version in

1906
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:17,239
2000 uh in two

1907
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:20,760
1998 I brought it out first time at one

1908
01:23:17,238 --> 01:23:22,919
uh plan of the Year in Spain 2000 2001 I

1909
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:25,039
don't know one of those and it just took

1910
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:27,600
off everyone used it

1911
01:23:25,039 --> 01:23:31,359
and then there was critical mass it's in

1912
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:35,520
so many European companies uh to this

1913
01:23:31,359 --> 01:23:39,639
day um I still sell the original version

1914
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:41,360
you know so uh probably a better a

1915
01:23:39,639 --> 01:23:43,760
better example tell you the truth

1916
01:23:41,359 --> 01:23:46,198
because you know most people have it

1917
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:49,880
originated from Miss and I and and you

1918
01:23:46,198 --> 01:23:52,519
know a lot of people um always claiming

1919
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:55,319
different things about um different

1920
01:23:52,520 --> 01:24:01,440
strains and stuff like that and

1921
01:23:55,319 --> 01:24:02,599
um to this day um I never really saw

1922
01:24:01,439 --> 01:24:05,519
people

1923
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:08,120
prove things you know so when the The

1924
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:09,600
Growers have bought their stuff and

1925
01:24:08,119 --> 01:24:11,439
everyone would normally if it was

1926
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:14,320
authentic and real they would run over

1927
01:24:11,439 --> 01:24:17,119
to it maybe it was cheaper maybe that

1928
01:24:14,319 --> 01:24:19,840
one brought it out at a you know bulk

1929
01:24:17,119 --> 01:24:23,399
rate and they giving better deal and so

1930
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:26,319
people slowly um let's say tainted the

1931
01:24:23,399 --> 01:24:29,599
the the color of the water and and to

1932
01:24:26,319 --> 01:24:31,399
know what is original oh you know it's

1933
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:34,719
difficult but usually you go back to

1934
01:24:31,399 --> 01:24:36,559
where the seed was made to that company

1935
01:24:34,719 --> 01:24:39,719
and asked to start there that would be

1936
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:41,760
the most original version of who made it

1937
01:24:39,719 --> 01:24:44,039
kind of famous in a seed version and

1938
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:45,760
then that's why people come back to me

1939
01:24:44,039 --> 01:24:48,840
that's why people come back to nille

1940
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:51,600
before he passed away but now I mean I

1941
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:53,440
still have um the critical the widows

1942
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:55,719
the hazers a lot of the old stuff that

1943
01:24:53,439 --> 01:24:57,319
people were looking for and I kept them

1944
01:24:55,719 --> 01:25:01,198
alive and I can only do that with

1945
01:24:57,319 --> 01:25:02,719
original plants and and so um you know

1946
01:25:01,198 --> 01:25:04,559
there's a lot of stories that came out

1947
01:25:02,719 --> 01:25:06,639
that people have gone and busted open

1948
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:08,840
thousands of SE in Africa in South

1949
01:25:06,639 --> 01:25:12,279
America now I haven't seen

1950
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:15,119
anything that that um helps the Africans

1951
01:25:12,279 --> 01:25:17,079
I haven't seen taking femin SE to Africa

1952
01:25:15,118 --> 01:25:19,319
and swapping it for some s it's not

1953
01:25:17,079 --> 01:25:22,000
really helping anybody I mean you're

1954
01:25:19,319 --> 01:25:24,319
tainting the crop and and and you can

1955
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:26,840
claim a lot of things before before

1956
01:25:24,319 --> 01:25:29,319
you've achieved them like a lot of

1957
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:31,199
people do looks like they're helping the

1958
01:25:29,319 --> 01:25:32,960
locals and that but actually they're

1959
01:25:31,198 --> 01:25:34,879
they're helping themselves and and they

1960
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:38,158
haven't really done anything that's

1961
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:40,279
contributed to say the genan bank of the

1962
01:25:38,158 --> 01:25:43,439
world I mean there hasn't been anything

1963
01:25:40,279 --> 01:25:45,479
special they're taking um they're

1964
01:25:43,439 --> 01:25:47,559
commercialist and and you know some

1965
01:25:45,479 --> 01:25:50,399
people believe it and and go along and

1966
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:52,039
they get paid and you know other people

1967
01:25:50,399 --> 01:25:54,479
know what they're doing and and know

1968
01:25:52,039 --> 01:25:58,279
where their origin started from so I

1969
01:25:54,479 --> 01:26:01,879
mean um I think it's better if if for

1970
01:25:58,279 --> 01:26:05,000
that as a a purist that you start from

1971
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:06,840
the original story of of of where that

1972
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:09,439
thing originated from because usually

1973
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:12,000
they had the parents to produce it you

1974
01:26:09,439 --> 01:26:13,759
know yeah certainly and I mean the

1975
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,600
proofs in the pudding right and I guess

1976
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:17,079
as an extension of what you just said

1977
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:20,360
what was it like when you did that

1978
01:26:17,079 --> 01:26:22,238
Rebrand to Mr ni seeds because I think

1979
01:26:20,359 --> 01:26:24,000
on like a technical and a marketing

1980
01:26:22,238 --> 01:26:26,079
level the name change was a brilliant

1981
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:28,039
business move but I also feel like it

1982
01:26:26,079 --> 01:26:30,800
must have felt really daunting at the

1983
01:26:28,039 --> 01:26:34,439
time like how would have you described

1984
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:37,639
it well it's hard to come from a number

1985
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:40,000
one company that have repeatedly for

1986
01:26:37,639 --> 01:26:40,840
four five six years in a row been you

1987
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:44,158
know

1988
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:46,319
outstanding had been the the the New

1989
01:26:44,158 --> 01:26:49,079
Kids on the Block had done all the right

1990
01:26:46,319 --> 01:26:51,198
things got all the right new tools got

1991
01:26:49,079 --> 01:26:54,960
all the right new flavors got all

1992
01:26:51,198 --> 01:26:59,079
everything and then how do you

1993
01:26:54,960 --> 01:27:03,600
how do you better that you know what I

1994
01:26:59,079 --> 01:27:07,279
mean and I thought when I met Howard

1995
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:08,960
um I'd already started in the in 96 I

1996
01:27:07,279 --> 01:27:10,759
met him and then I was still with the

1997
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:12,920
greenhouse and with Neville he just

1998
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:14,880
moved over to us he was just with a

1999
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:18,440
coffee shop as share of not with the SE

2000
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:20,679
company but we were and I thought you

2001
01:27:18,439 --> 01:27:22,638
know we were the the kind of the dream

2002
01:27:20,679 --> 01:27:25,079
breeding team at that stage Neville and

2003
01:27:22,639 --> 01:27:27,719
myself and then Iran was of all those

2004
01:27:25,079 --> 01:27:29,359
things and it was going well we won all

2005
01:27:27,719 --> 01:27:33,319
these things and then I started to think

2006
01:27:29,359 --> 01:27:36,279
you know it's a little bit um corrupt

2007
01:27:33,319 --> 01:27:39,880
the High Times cup was started to go bit

2008
01:27:36,279 --> 01:27:43,079
funny and I thought you know um how it

2009
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:45,000
asked me about making company I went and

2010
01:27:43,079 --> 01:27:47,000
spoke to Neville and I said listen mate

2011
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:51,079
you haven't been involved with the seeds

2012
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:53,079
at m at Greenhouse how about you

2013
01:27:51,079 --> 01:27:57,479
contribute four and I put in eight and

2014
01:27:53,079 --> 01:27:59,198
we start Mr like that and and um I

2015
01:27:57,479 --> 01:28:01,759
thought Howard was the best name in the

2016
01:27:59,198 --> 01:28:04,079
industry better than even green better

2017
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:06,960
than all of us in Holland he was more he

2018
01:28:04,079 --> 01:28:09,600
was uh a brilliant spokesperson and and

2019
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:12,520
really uh wonderful orator and

2020
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:15,639
Incredibly colorful character and a

2021
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:19,080
Gentleman and logically there was

2022
01:28:15,639 --> 01:28:23,039
nowhere for me to go higher than where I

2023
01:28:19,079 --> 01:28:25,559
was then to Switzerland for medical with

2024
01:28:23,039 --> 01:28:28,238
starting a new company with Howard and

2025
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:32,080
Neville uh I owned the company I just

2026
01:28:28,238 --> 01:28:33,919
bought in things and gave them sh some

2027
01:28:32,079 --> 01:28:36,238
finances and stuff like that along the

2028
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:38,960
way as we build it up but it was

2029
01:28:36,238 --> 01:28:41,718
daunting and I had to go down the hill

2030
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:43,399
before I went up the other Hill because

2031
01:28:41,719 --> 01:28:46,279
when you reach the top there's only one

2032
01:28:43,399 --> 01:28:50,118
one thing to do either jump or walk down

2033
01:28:46,279 --> 01:28:52,920
and then uh two things then and I walked

2034
01:28:50,118 --> 01:28:55,118
down the hill and started again and uh

2035
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:58,880
of course you know um other people went

2036
01:28:55,118 --> 01:29:01,158
on with the story and and um but for me

2037
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:03,118
Integrity is everything and and actually

2038
01:29:01,158 --> 01:29:06,000
I didn't have really a problem because I

2039
01:29:03,118 --> 01:29:07,519
I know what I've got and um look I

2040
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:09,520
wouldn't have been so successful I

2041
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:11,960
wouldn't have um made the critical

2042
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:14,480
masses and the CBD crew and and done a

2043
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:16,840
lot of these Innovations in the industry

2044
01:29:14,479 --> 01:29:18,959
if I didn't have the goods and I didn't

2045
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:22,639
have the knowledge and I didn't have the

2046
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:24,760
support from the scientific community so

2047
01:29:22,639 --> 01:29:26,679
um everyone can say what they want they

2048
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:29,280
can say the stories what they want or

2049
01:29:26,679 --> 01:29:32,679
they they can claim things but I

2050
01:29:29,279 --> 01:29:33,880
mean historically you can see things

2051
01:29:32,679 --> 01:29:36,399
that have happened and changed the

2052
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:38,719
industry and I've usually been Vanguard

2053
01:29:36,399 --> 01:29:41,238
there you know I've been

2054
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:43,079
there yeah certainly I mean that's what

2055
01:29:41,238 --> 01:29:45,198
I meant in the intro one of the the

2056
01:29:43,079 --> 01:29:47,238
grandfathers pillars of the scene it's

2057
01:29:45,198 --> 01:29:49,279
it's been consistent which is incredible

2058
01:29:47,238 --> 01:29:51,559
and you mentioned the critical mass a

2059
01:29:49,279 --> 01:29:53,439
few times I wanted to ask you because it

2060
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:55,400
is such a staple especially in the

2061
01:29:53,439 --> 01:29:57,559
European seen it's these you know

2062
01:29:55,399 --> 01:30:00,839
critical mass feminized seeds cross to

2063
01:29:57,560 --> 01:30:02,400
most hybrids these days yeah how did you

2064
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:04,440
make that one was it just line bread

2065
01:30:02,399 --> 01:30:06,759
from some big bud seeds what was the

2066
01:30:04,439 --> 01:30:08,638
process of developing it oh I I actually

2067
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:11,960
selected uh a

2068
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:13,960
different different male um and and hit

2069
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:18,000
it with the original big butt I mean

2070
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:18,960
Neville's big butt to a different male

2071
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:23,118
that I'd

2072
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:26,679
selected and um it was a reworked skunk

2073
01:30:23,118 --> 01:30:29,719
actually to truth a super skunk and so

2074
01:30:26,679 --> 01:30:32,639
it it was made to to be you know sort of

2075
01:30:29,719 --> 01:30:36,719
a huge flower like like you for like a

2076
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:40,400
forearm of a boxer it was compact

2077
01:30:36,719 --> 01:30:43,079
fragrant the effect was incredibly

2078
01:30:40,399 --> 01:30:45,719
narcotic everything that a a grower a

2079
01:30:43,079 --> 01:30:48,079
commercial grower wanted to do there

2080
01:30:45,719 --> 01:30:50,520
with the new work big bud we call a

2081
01:30:48,079 --> 01:30:52,719
critical mess and it just took off I

2082
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:55,440
mean and still to this day it's

2083
01:30:52,719 --> 01:30:57,118
everywhere um I would say that there a

2084
01:30:55,439 --> 01:30:58,799
lot of people use it in strains they

2085
01:30:57,118 --> 01:31:01,079
probably don't even know what it is but

2086
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:04,159
it it grows like a sativa and it flowers

2087
01:31:01,079 --> 01:31:06,559
like an Inda and that's the the

2088
01:31:04,158 --> 01:31:08,079
particular um look about it many people

2089
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:11,400
a bit worried that I've given them the

2090
01:31:08,079 --> 01:31:13,600
wrong plant because the long leaf that

2091
01:31:11,399 --> 01:31:16,158
coming but it's an Excell excellent

2092
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:19,039
plant uh it's still to this day it's a

2093
01:31:16,158 --> 01:31:21,238
incredibly good tool for people who are

2094
01:31:19,039 --> 01:31:24,639
trying to bring in weight to their their

2095
01:31:21,238 --> 01:31:27,079
crops and and strength so you know you

2096
01:31:24,639 --> 01:31:29,440
don't have things like that I mean that

2097
01:31:27,079 --> 01:31:31,158
was uniquely Mr Knight that was forget

2098
01:31:29,439 --> 01:31:33,238
about all the stories of widows of super

2099
01:31:31,158 --> 01:31:35,799
silos whatever you want that was

2100
01:31:33,238 --> 01:31:37,959
uniquely set up by Mr Nice and then

2101
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:40,639
after that a lot of the Mr ice strains

2102
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:42,279
were used in CBD crew and that went on

2103
01:31:40,639 --> 01:31:45,400
and all of them were selling it under

2104
01:31:42,279 --> 01:31:48,279
different names until I made their seed

2105
01:31:45,399 --> 01:31:50,238
with their two varieties so you know

2106
01:31:48,279 --> 01:31:52,719
that's why I keep saying that I'm not

2107
01:31:50,238 --> 01:31:55,359
trying to be egotistical on that I know

2108
01:31:52,719 --> 01:31:59,079
what I did and and I know and they know

2109
01:31:55,359 --> 01:32:01,519
what they did with me and so we kind of

2110
01:31:59,079 --> 01:32:03,840
the honest truth is is one thing and and

2111
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:07,760
maybe the brochures or other things I

2112
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:09,679
don't know you know no of of course we

2113
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:11,000
we trust your word which is you know

2114
01:32:09,679 --> 01:32:12,440
where really grateful to have you here

2115
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:14,399
and we've been talking about all these

2116
01:32:12,439 --> 01:32:16,158
legendary strains you've made and we

2117
01:32:14,399 --> 01:32:17,479
finally need to chat about your new s

2118
01:32:16,158 --> 01:32:19,719
that's in the works you mentioned your

2119
01:32:17,479 --> 01:32:21,479
son's helping to build it what sort of

2120
01:32:19,719 --> 01:32:22,800
things can people expect will there be a

2121
01:32:21,479 --> 01:32:25,198
store there where they can grab your

2122
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:28,119
seeds and will the auctions continue the

2123
01:32:25,198 --> 01:32:32,000
Shany B seeds.com is

2124
01:32:28,118 --> 01:32:33,439
that yeah um yeah we got a project um so

2125
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:36,840
what what I was speaking to the kids

2126
01:32:33,439 --> 01:32:40,198
about was that that I I've made a lot of

2127
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:43,520
um Mr Nice has got a shop and it will St

2128
01:32:40,198 --> 01:32:46,479
how it is at this moment in time um as a

2129
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:50,679
regular seat company um the Integrity is

2130
01:32:46,479 --> 01:32:52,839
impecable we we won't um we won't be

2131
01:32:50,679 --> 01:32:54,920
compromising that in any way so but

2132
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:57,079
chunky Bubba seeds it we've I've got a

2133
01:32:54,920 --> 01:33:00,000
lot of projects going on and I just

2134
01:32:57,079 --> 01:33:02,158
thought I've got a lot sometimes um I

2135
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,118
usually keep back a bunch of seed of

2136
01:33:02,158 --> 01:33:06,319
each project in case something goes

2137
01:33:04,118 --> 01:33:08,479
wrong and I can test it myself from what

2138
01:33:06,319 --> 01:33:10,719
people see and and then it sits in the

2139
01:33:08,479 --> 01:33:13,359
fridge when everything goes right uh we

2140
01:33:10,719 --> 01:33:15,960
go on with it and we and that seeds just

2141
01:33:13,359 --> 01:33:19,599
out there so the options came about

2142
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:21,639
originally um but now um my son was

2143
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:23,400
talking to me he said dad you know we

2144
01:33:21,639 --> 01:33:25,719
we' seem to have quite a lot of

2145
01:33:23,399 --> 01:33:27,319
different things that no one knows about

2146
01:33:25,719 --> 01:33:29,800
you know that it's like the project

2147
01:33:27,319 --> 01:33:31,639
stuff and I said yeah but I mean just

2148
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:33,719
give it away to people who are less

2149
01:33:31,639 --> 01:33:35,880
fortunate or people who come and ask me

2150
01:33:33,719 --> 01:33:37,639
for help or something and I send them

2151
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:40,079
batches to see he said yeah he got

2152
01:33:37,639 --> 01:33:44,319
enough to [ __ ] feed the Army excuse

2153
01:33:40,079 --> 01:33:46,519
me to uh um you know and and maybe we

2154
01:33:44,319 --> 01:33:48,920
should just release it under a different

2155
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:51,239
project seed so it's a limited editions

2156
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:53,840
that they we've made them and they're

2157
01:33:51,238 --> 01:33:55,279
finished and that's a l a deadline and

2158
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:57,079
and if you want to continue it on and

2159
01:33:55,279 --> 01:33:59,158
you want some work and there's always

2160
01:33:57,079 --> 01:34:02,000
people looking for projects and and so

2161
01:33:59,158 --> 01:34:04,559
up until then i' been offering in in the

2162
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:06,880
some some seeds with uh with the

2163
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:09,320
auctions with SAR and my daughter she's

2164
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:12,440
been doing all of that but I thought you

2165
01:34:09,319 --> 01:34:14,679
know um Toody hadn't made sense and and

2166
01:34:12,439 --> 01:34:16,678
um he's coming back in the Easter time

2167
01:34:14,679 --> 01:34:19,239
and we're going to start to separate

2168
01:34:16,679 --> 01:34:21,000
some of these batches and I I'll give

2169
01:34:19,238 --> 01:34:23,279
the dates when we made them and that so

2170
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:25,198
people know that but we'll probably

2171
01:34:23,279 --> 01:34:29,198
offer a lot of those things some bulk

2172
01:34:25,198 --> 01:34:31,319
you 100 back like older Seed where the

2173
01:34:29,198 --> 01:34:33,000
germinations are down but there's

2174
01:34:31,319 --> 01:34:33,840
definitely some interesting genetic to

2175
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:38,198
be

2176
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:40,840
found um I don't sell feminized a but I

2177
01:34:38,198 --> 01:34:42,439
will Shany Bubba seeds because I've made

2178
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:45,279
so many for different

2179
01:34:42,439 --> 01:34:50,919
people um I'm not making opinion about

2180
01:34:45,279 --> 01:34:52,599
it um um just um make available whatever

2181
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:56,239
seed that we're not using and we're not

2182
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:59,239
keeping for back up um to other people

2183
01:34:56,238 --> 01:35:00,959
if they want to you know try it I did a

2184
01:34:59,238 --> 01:35:03,279
project like I told you with grounded

2185
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:05,359
genetics with their tsunami plant and

2186
01:35:03,279 --> 01:35:07,960
five my thing and I've now offered that

2187
01:35:05,359 --> 01:35:09,759
out to different Growers just sent it

2188
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:12,158
out this week and and so that's on the

2189
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:15,159
Miss and icing but it's a Shany Bubba

2190
01:35:12,158 --> 01:35:17,559
project so when we get the website up

2191
01:35:15,158 --> 01:35:19,719
and everything done uh we'll probably

2192
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:22,280
you know still continue to use the Miss

2193
01:35:19,719 --> 01:35:25,359
Forum to discuss shuny B seeds and stuff

2194
01:35:22,279 --> 01:35:27,599
but it'll probably just a little bit of

2195
01:35:25,359 --> 01:35:30,079
other things that that have been um

2196
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:31,800
working on over the years you know wow

2197
01:35:30,079 --> 01:35:33,639
that's really exciting I'm sure everyone

2198
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:35,679
listening to this is ears have perked up

2199
01:35:33,639 --> 01:35:38,319
and they're Keen to check it out out of

2200
01:35:35,679 --> 01:35:40,440
curiosity are there any like names that

2201
01:35:38,319 --> 01:35:42,158
come to mind of strains that might be

2202
01:35:40,439 --> 01:35:44,000
offered just to give people an idea of

2203
01:35:42,158 --> 01:35:48,559
some of the things they might you know

2204
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:52,279
we we um original hash plant um garlic

2205
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:55,360
Bud um heavy duty fruity

2206
01:35:52,279 --> 01:36:01,118
nug um some projects that I've done you

2207
01:35:55,359 --> 01:36:05,000
know some uh some original uh pushes

2208
01:36:01,118 --> 01:36:07,759
some very old uh

2209
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:09,600
Mexican let's just say the preludes to a

2210
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:12,000
lot of skunks that were Mexican

2211
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:15,960
Colombian and um

2212
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:18,079
Afghan um in them

2213
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:19,679
um

2214
01:36:18,079 --> 01:36:23,880
um

2215
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:26,239
oragas uh Howard Howard not Howard

2216
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:29,960
Neville beg you pardon had a lot of

2217
01:36:26,238 --> 01:36:33,198
different um numbered Orga plants and

2218
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:35,359
and we've busted open a lot you know I

2219
01:36:33,198 --> 01:36:37,599
think someone criticized me for mixing

2220
01:36:35,359 --> 01:36:40,399
up the things last time about Ora but

2221
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:42,719
the nille had everything Ora one two 3

2222
01:36:40,399 --> 01:36:46,118
four 5 6 Seven 8 nine cross with Orga 1

2223
01:36:42,719 --> 01:36:48,840
2 3 4 and so um the seed I was just

2224
01:36:46,118 --> 01:36:50,920
trying to copy what he's busting open

2225
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:52,960
and and what we're we're collecting and

2226
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:55,359
and where it came from originally so I'm

2227
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:57,158
documenting everything I mean I I I keep

2228
01:36:55,359 --> 01:36:59,279
it as honest and truthful as where it

2229
01:36:57,158 --> 01:37:01,759
come from and and where where the source

2230
01:36:59,279 --> 01:37:05,519
was but you know I've got so many

2231
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:07,239
different things like got this zamal

2232
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:09,239
which we've been we worked on quite a

2233
01:37:07,238 --> 01:37:11,039
lot and and then we stopped because I

2234
01:37:09,238 --> 01:37:13,638
just didn't have any room anymore it's a

2235
01:37:11,039 --> 01:37:16,198
big plant you know it's a so I mean

2236
01:37:13,639 --> 01:37:17,000
there's so many color colors you know in

2237
01:37:16,198 --> 01:37:19,479
the

2238
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:23,000
rainbow um I really have don't have a

2239
01:37:19,479 --> 01:37:25,359
plan at the moment um Daisy I really

2240
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:28,000
basically thinking that you know my son

2241
01:37:25,359 --> 01:37:30,639
is going to probably direct traffic in

2242
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:34,920
that one but but I've got medical rooms

2243
01:37:30,639 --> 01:37:37,840
opening up for me this in swiftland so

2244
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:41,079
I'm getting gearing up for uh busting

2245
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:45,159
open some really really old stuff

2246
01:37:41,079 --> 01:37:46,559
80s and you know some 90s stuff and and

2247
01:37:45,158 --> 01:37:50,198
just see if we

2248
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:53,159
can uh find some really interesting kind

2249
01:37:50,198 --> 01:37:55,879
of fenos and and and differences rather

2250
01:37:53,158 --> 01:37:59,839
than all these gush skunk mixtures that

2251
01:37:55,880 --> 01:38:02,079
are poly hybriding at the moment and

2252
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:05,279
feel like lollipops sometimes you know

2253
01:38:02,079 --> 01:38:08,679
what I mean there's too many uh it's

2254
01:38:05,279 --> 01:38:10,960
it's more to the Turin and the high can

2255
01:38:08,679 --> 01:38:14,960
you know the high THC and and rather

2256
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:18,560
than the whole plant um kind of natural

2257
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:20,679
whole plant that that happened when it

2258
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:25,239
combined with different sort of Origins

2259
01:38:20,679 --> 01:38:27,359
you know um so I you know just kind of

2260
01:38:25,238 --> 01:38:28,479
looking for some old old school stuff

2261
01:38:27,359 --> 01:38:31,479
again you

2262
01:38:28,479 --> 01:38:33,118
know wow incredibly exciting I'm sure

2263
01:38:31,479 --> 01:38:34,718
some Jaws hit the ground when they heard

2264
01:38:33,118 --> 01:38:37,880
that like you know maybe get some garlic

2265
01:38:34,719 --> 01:38:39,719
butd or some more TGA I could never

2266
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:41,840
really find good info is that one like

2267
01:38:39,719 --> 01:38:43,719
does it come from Jim oraga or is it

2268
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:45,599
like in honor of him in the way like the

2269
01:38:43,719 --> 01:38:48,920
Jack Harris train is and how would you

2270
01:38:45,599 --> 01:38:51,679
describe those plans well it Neville

2271
01:38:48,920 --> 01:38:55,440
Neville um it originally came from um

2272
01:38:51,679 --> 01:38:57,719
Neville's in um he was handed some stuff

2273
01:38:55,439 --> 01:39:00,079
to MGA I don't know whether I wasn't

2274
01:38:57,719 --> 01:39:03,118
there again uh he told me a lot of

2275
01:39:00,079 --> 01:39:07,158
things but uh I busted open the seed

2276
01:39:03,118 --> 01:39:12,079
that he he left me with and um there's

2277
01:39:07,158 --> 01:39:15,198
definitely you know a lot of um heavy

2278
01:39:12,079 --> 01:39:18,479
Afghan influence in this line okay it's

2279
01:39:15,198 --> 01:39:22,719
a really for me uh

2280
01:39:18,479 --> 01:39:27,079
it's solidly coming to probably an area

2281
01:39:22,719 --> 01:39:29,439
in that was like a family Legacy line

2282
01:39:27,079 --> 01:39:34,039
that was growing in Afghan for many

2283
01:39:29,439 --> 01:39:36,559
years uh I don't know if Jer or Neville

2284
01:39:34,039 --> 01:39:38,319
um um docked up the story or whatever

2285
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:40,800
but you know when I bust open some of

2286
01:39:38,319 --> 01:39:43,880
those old stuff I can see that there's

2287
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:47,199
some really heavy hitting kind of uh

2288
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:49,400
indicia based plant and I never really

2289
01:39:47,198 --> 01:39:53,559
been one for that but I mean it's time

2290
01:39:49,399 --> 01:39:57,000
to to sort of release the the Kraken and

2291
01:39:53,560 --> 01:39:59,760
let it all open up and and see if we uh

2292
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:02,800
if we can find something interesting I

2293
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:05,320
mean I'm I I've been in it too long to

2294
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:06,920
to promise anything to anyone any

2295
01:40:05,319 --> 01:40:08,759
because you never know where you're

2296
01:40:06,920 --> 01:40:10,800
going that's the thing with seed you

2297
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:13,560
bust it open and you you're on for the

2298
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:17,679
ride you know and it can really surprise

2299
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:21,039
you um it can sometimes disappoint you

2300
01:40:17,679 --> 01:40:23,840
and other times you're elated with the

2301
01:40:21,039 --> 01:40:25,960
Eureka moments but uh

2302
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:28,400
you know uh that's the beautiful

2303
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:30,520
adventure of busting open

2304
01:40:28,399 --> 01:40:32,439
seed that's it you know one of my

2305
01:40:30,520 --> 01:40:34,800
favorite quotes every seed is Like a

2306
01:40:32,439 --> 01:40:36,079
Prayer I love it it's uh it's it's

2307
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:38,039
interesting the journey it'll take you

2308
01:40:36,079 --> 01:40:39,800
on and you must have been reading my

2309
01:40:38,039 --> 01:40:41,719
mind CU you've preempted this next

2310
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:43,679
question perfectly with the best caveat

2311
01:40:41,719 --> 01:40:45,079
ever but it's actually a fan submitted

2312
01:40:43,679 --> 01:40:46,719
question from one of our listeners and

2313
01:40:45,079 --> 01:40:49,439
they said I really want to grow out some

2314
01:40:46,719 --> 01:40:51,719
Mr Nice seeds I'm wondering how many

2315
01:40:49,439 --> 01:40:55,319
packs does Shanty recommend I pop in

2316
01:40:51,719 --> 01:41:02,158
order to hopefully find special normally

2317
01:40:55,319 --> 01:41:06,079
I I I say a sample a small sample is

2318
01:41:02,158 --> 01:41:09,839
usually 100 seats five pack we we'd sell

2319
01:41:06,079 --> 01:41:11,679
we say we sell 15 per pack we put 18 in

2320
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:13,840
give the grower a little bit heads up

2321
01:41:11,679 --> 01:41:16,158
and and help in case something doesn't

2322
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:18,880
work for them and we've always done that

2323
01:41:16,158 --> 01:41:22,638
but you know four five packs of a strain

2324
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:24,118
is probably the best way to go um with

2325
01:41:22,639 --> 01:41:25,920
with uh

2326
01:41:24,118 --> 01:41:27,359
if you want to give it a fair thing I

2327
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:30,480
understand if you can't do that you

2328
01:41:27,359 --> 01:41:32,679
maybe you know minimum would be 20 you

2329
01:41:30,479 --> 01:41:34,799
can't do it with two or three not

2330
01:41:32,679 --> 01:41:37,719
regular

2331
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:39,719
seeds you mind if I hit my going to hit

2332
01:41:37,719 --> 01:41:43,239
my vapor I got a new vaporizer I just

2333
01:41:39,719 --> 01:41:45,158
show you can oh cool that looks Nifty oh

2334
01:41:43,238 --> 01:41:48,079
wow it's got your logo on it and it what

2335
01:41:45,158 --> 01:41:50,598
it does is it it keeps the cartrid in

2336
01:41:48,079 --> 01:41:53,599
the battery at the bottom and it has

2337
01:41:50,599 --> 01:41:56,119
different uh different modes you can do

2338
01:41:53,599 --> 01:41:59,319
it on so we'll be that that'll be in the

2339
01:41:56,118 --> 01:42:01,000
shop soon as well I was going to say

2340
01:41:59,319 --> 01:42:03,158
Okay cool so people can look forward to

2341
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:04,560
these nice Vapes yeah yeah it's

2342
01:42:03,158 --> 01:42:06,799
fantastic Vape I really I've been

2343
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:09,199
looking around for them I usually use

2344
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:11,920
the C cell stuff that uh when I was

2345
01:42:09,198 --> 01:42:14,799
driving if I just wanted it but this

2346
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:17,760
one's just a bit more powerful and um

2347
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:20,719
now some of the the THC mixtures that

2348
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:23,320
we're using which are much thicker um

2349
01:42:20,719 --> 01:42:26,840
this is better for it's got different uh

2350
01:42:23,319 --> 01:42:30,198
heat um um on the coil different heat

2351
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:31,800
settings on the coil and so um yeah it

2352
01:42:30,198 --> 01:42:35,118
actually works really well with some of

2353
01:42:31,800 --> 01:42:36,960
the the thick THC stuff you know I'd

2354
01:42:35,118 --> 01:42:39,039
love to quickly ask do you feel the

2355
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:43,279
future is in these sort of really

2356
01:42:39,039 --> 01:42:46,960
convenient portable pen style Vapes um

2357
01:42:43,279 --> 01:42:50,359
well you know it's a bit like analog

2358
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:52,719
digital um I think I think a lot of

2359
01:42:50,359 --> 01:42:55,759
people still like to roll joints to this

2360
01:42:52,719 --> 01:43:00,319
day um a lot of recreational the ritual

2361
01:42:55,760 --> 01:43:04,000
of joint rolling still is uh is a big

2362
01:43:00,319 --> 01:43:05,920
factor for some people and um uh I think

2363
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:08,679
Vapes make sense

2364
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:11,679
for medical people who really don't want

2365
01:43:08,679 --> 01:43:14,440
to consume combustibles and but they

2366
01:43:11,679 --> 01:43:16,760
want a quick hit and they want to you

2367
01:43:14,439 --> 01:43:18,879
know the volcano was one of the

2368
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:20,800
wonderful things that was developer not

2369
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:25,118
everyone can carry around a volcano with

2370
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:25,119
a big bag attached yeah exactly

2371
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:32,198
um uh I I think um what we what what you

2372
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:35,159
find is that there'll be a a certain

2373
01:43:32,198 --> 01:43:36,479
section of the market let's say you know

2374
01:43:35,158 --> 01:43:39,399
sort

2375
01:43:36,479 --> 01:43:40,759
of I think it's going to rise because

2376
01:43:39,399 --> 01:43:43,198
people want

2377
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:45,920
clean um

2378
01:43:43,198 --> 01:43:49,319
non-contaminated nonheavy metal non-

2379
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:52,000
pesticide non insecticide material and

2380
01:43:49,319 --> 01:43:54,719
that's coming in these distillates that

2381
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:58,599
we're making now because we have very

2382
01:43:54,719 --> 01:44:01,639
heavy um um sort of rules for those

2383
01:43:58,599 --> 01:44:06,400
things to be made under GMP basically

2384
01:44:01,639 --> 01:44:10,118
and and um they're very clean um if

2385
01:44:06,399 --> 01:44:13,279
they're not sort of pirated and um and

2386
01:44:10,118 --> 01:44:15,839
we've got all the paperwork so if for me

2387
01:44:13,279 --> 01:44:19,039
it it's definitely a medical

2388
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:21,480
tool um and I think it's very convenient

2389
01:44:19,039 --> 01:44:23,399
for those who are driving long distance

2390
01:44:21,479 --> 01:44:25,919
that don't don't want to roll joint

2391
01:44:23,399 --> 01:44:27,839
don't want to stick out the car but they

2392
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:30,359
need a quick hit and that just you know

2393
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:33,560
back pain or something I mean for me

2394
01:44:30,359 --> 01:44:36,319
what we what I advise is we make a a

2395
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:40,239
pill basically there's THC and CBD in it

2396
01:44:36,319 --> 01:44:42,519
and that's for the long hall and then

2397
01:44:40,238 --> 01:44:44,839
the Vape is for when it's starting to

2398
01:44:42,520 --> 01:44:48,080
fade you hit it up for another hour or

2399
01:44:44,840 --> 01:44:50,360
so and we we use that and so we kind of

2400
01:44:48,079 --> 01:44:52,800
prescribed that to people who in the

2401
01:44:50,359 --> 01:44:55,839
medical fraternity over here and that's

2402
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:58,320
how we use it um so I suppose that it

2403
01:44:55,840 --> 01:45:00,480
will be continually growing until you

2404
01:44:58,319 --> 01:45:02,599
reach a a level in the market in

2405
01:45:00,479 --> 01:45:03,479
Australia that is maybe you know I don't

2406
01:45:02,599 --> 01:45:06,679
know

2407
01:45:03,479 --> 01:45:09,279
300,000 at the moment maybe a million

2408
01:45:06,679 --> 01:45:12,719
people sign up to be medical users over

2409
01:45:09,279 --> 01:45:14,759
the next few years you'll reach a level

2410
01:45:12,719 --> 01:45:16,599
and maybe you'll see 20 30% of the

2411
01:45:14,760 --> 01:45:18,880
market is doing Vapes and that will

2412
01:45:16,599 --> 01:45:21,840
probably be the medical Ones Still the

2413
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:24,960
ones doing the pills or the the oils

2414
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:29,279
then you've got a live section of let's

2415
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:33,158
say um freethinking people who use it

2416
01:45:29,279 --> 01:45:35,279
for both and uh maybe uh then there's

2417
01:45:33,158 --> 01:45:37,118
going to be uh the black Market's going

2418
01:45:35,279 --> 01:45:38,800
to be fed by the White Market eventually

2419
01:45:37,118 --> 01:45:41,719
because it's going cheaper than Black

2420
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:43,639
Market in Australia and So eventually

2421
01:45:41,719 --> 01:45:45,679
those things will happen naturally as

2422
01:45:43,639 --> 01:45:48,359
well I mean you can't help them it's

2423
01:45:45,679 --> 01:45:51,679
just Logic for people who are in

2424
01:45:48,359 --> 01:45:54,719
different situations you know and so I

2425
01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:56,359
suppose I I mean you know I'm just

2426
01:45:54,719 --> 01:45:58,880
trying to call it how I see it but I

2427
01:45:56,359 --> 01:46:01,399
mean it's probably something like that I

2428
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:04,319
would say

2429
01:46:01,399 --> 01:46:07,759
yeah on a slightly unrelated note I

2430
01:46:04,319 --> 01:46:10,000
wanted to ask Citrus tpin are really

2431
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:14,000
popular in modern Canabis your Mandarin

2432
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:16,399
and orange flavors and lemons yeah and I

2433
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:19,279
noticed that there isn't really a ton of

2434
01:46:16,399 --> 01:46:21,679
citrus in your genetic lineup on face

2435
01:46:19,279 --> 01:46:23,279
value is this because you're not

2436
01:46:21,679 --> 01:46:25,319
particularly into that is it is it just

2437
01:46:23,279 --> 01:46:27,960
coincidence how do you feel about orange

2438
01:46:25,319 --> 01:46:30,238
and citrus I think um when you bust open

2439
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:33,079
a few things you get the citrusy stuff I

2440
01:46:30,238 --> 01:46:35,559
mean the mango and and the super silver

2441
01:46:33,079 --> 01:46:39,719
ha there's definitely uh things that go

2442
01:46:35,560 --> 01:46:41,440
towards that um I used to have a uh and

2443
01:46:39,719 --> 01:46:44,560
and actually that was one of the other

2444
01:46:41,439 --> 01:46:46,719
ones the original orange Bud um which

2445
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:49,239
was really orange I mean what we were

2446
01:46:46,719 --> 01:46:52,599
selling in the coffee shops in the early

2447
01:46:49,238 --> 01:46:56,718
90s um the Californian orange was one of

2448
01:46:52,599 --> 01:46:57,560
those first skunks they really combined

2449
01:46:56,719 --> 01:47:01,198
its

2450
01:46:57,560 --> 01:47:04,159
flavor specifically to that line of

2451
01:47:01,198 --> 01:47:06,839
Turpin and and uh and then there were

2452
01:47:04,158 --> 01:47:09,439
some that deviated a little bit were a

2453
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:13,239
bit more lemony and and some mandarini

2454
01:47:09,439 --> 01:47:16,399
and and you know I I suppose that the

2455
01:47:13,238 --> 01:47:18,559
berries and and the you know they all

2456
01:47:16,399 --> 01:47:22,399
sort of slightly there it just depends

2457
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:25,080
on the selection of plants but um I kind

2458
01:47:22,399 --> 01:47:27,960
of think that I've got a lot of them in

2459
01:47:25,079 --> 01:47:31,399
my plants already it's just that I don't

2460
01:47:27,960 --> 01:47:35,520
have uh specifically targeted that that

2461
01:47:31,399 --> 01:47:38,039
line of toin but I believe that um in in

2462
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:41,199
in my 40 odd strains that that you can

2463
01:47:38,039 --> 01:47:43,118
find specific things there but you know

2464
01:47:41,198 --> 01:47:45,279
it depends I I try to keep it open like

2465
01:47:43,118 --> 01:47:48,319
I explained to you before

2466
01:47:45,279 --> 01:47:50,679
70% similar 15 to each side of the

2467
01:47:48,319 --> 01:47:53,960
parents that kind of what I consider

2468
01:47:50,679 --> 01:47:57,719
stable genetics and and that allows

2469
01:47:53,960 --> 01:48:01,960
hobby hobby go Growers to to go to that

2470
01:47:57,719 --> 01:48:05,960
15% either side and find things to to

2471
01:48:01,960 --> 01:48:08,359
more pure form to work on so you know I

2472
01:48:05,960 --> 01:48:10,000
mean I'm passing the the Baton at at

2473
01:48:08,359 --> 01:48:11,198
most of the time nowadays and I'm

2474
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,920
starting to think that there's some

2475
01:48:11,198 --> 01:48:15,919
really good guys out there that that

2476
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:18,560
need just a hand with some old genetic

2477
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:23,079
tools and and I still got them in the in

2478
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:24,719
the Arsenal so uh pass them out you know

2479
01:48:23,079 --> 01:48:27,118
that's that's beautiful to hear and i'

2480
01:48:24,719 --> 01:48:28,679
I've certainly heard more recently a lot

2481
01:48:27,118 --> 01:48:30,000
of the more sort of newer modern

2482
01:48:28,679 --> 01:48:31,480
breeders referencing that they're

2483
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:33,399
actually really keen and specifically

2484
01:48:31,479 --> 01:48:36,000
throw your name out there as stock they

2485
01:48:33,399 --> 01:48:37,920
want to run through and I have to admit

2486
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:40,158
bit of an oversight in my last question

2487
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:42,359
I have a super silver ha hybrid that is

2488
01:48:40,158 --> 01:48:44,279
very citrusy so I want to correct the

2489
01:48:42,359 --> 01:48:46,519
record I was I was not good in the

2490
01:48:44,279 --> 01:48:48,679
phrasing of that one so kudos to you

2491
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:51,760
yeah no it's it's the truth though there

2492
01:48:48,679 --> 01:48:53,560
there are a lot of uh sort of strains

2493
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:55,800
that I don't really write it down I

2494
01:48:53,560 --> 01:48:58,880
prefer you to find what you're liking

2495
01:48:55,800 --> 01:49:02,199
and yeah I mean I heard that many times

2496
01:48:58,880 --> 01:49:05,159
from from those trins that there's a lot

2497
01:49:02,198 --> 01:49:06,879
of those things available there so yeah

2498
01:49:05,158 --> 01:49:08,759
certainly and and it Segways nicely into

2499
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:11,319
the next question which is like you've

2500
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:13,239
worked with this same really solid base

2501
01:49:11,319 --> 01:49:15,479
of genetics for the longest time and I

2502
01:49:13,238 --> 01:49:16,879
know in the last episode you mentioned

2503
01:49:15,479 --> 01:49:18,399
that for the most part you're not

2504
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:21,239
particularly interested in some of the

2505
01:49:18,399 --> 01:49:23,439
more new stuff I'd love to know do you

2506
01:49:21,238 --> 01:49:25,519
ever see yourself maybe in incorporating

2507
01:49:23,439 --> 01:49:28,319
a little more modern or new stuff into

2508
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:30,960
the Arsenal that project with grounded

2509
01:49:28,319 --> 01:49:34,920
genetics is using one of their I think

2510
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:37,480
it it arrived from Skittles and um y

2511
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:39,279
Scout I can't maybe I'm wrong but I know

2512
01:49:37,479 --> 01:49:41,678
that he's working with that the all the

2513
01:49:39,279 --> 01:49:44,840
new stuff he's a young guy I like him a

2514
01:49:41,679 --> 01:49:48,840
lot and uh he's very open and honest and

2515
01:49:44,840 --> 01:49:51,199
he's very fanatical about um um his sort

2516
01:49:48,840 --> 01:49:55,039
of ideas in his head and he he goes for

2517
01:49:51,198 --> 01:49:58,158
them and uh I I was hoping to find

2518
01:49:55,039 --> 01:50:00,560
something um we sell a lot of seats to

2519
01:49:58,158 --> 01:50:02,479
Morocco you know a lot of bulk seats and

2520
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:04,760
and they're they're looking specifically

2521
01:50:02,479 --> 01:50:06,879
for hash strains that are really good

2522
01:50:04,760 --> 01:50:09,880
that are producing large amounts of

2523
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:13,480
resin and so I think in this tsunami I

2524
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:15,319
think the nor Live 5 ha with the tsunami

2525
01:50:13,479 --> 01:50:16,718
or the Black Widow with the tsunami

2526
01:50:15,319 --> 01:50:18,880
might be really

2527
01:50:16,719 --> 01:50:21,639
interesting hash

2528
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:24,400
varieties uh also there's a G13 with the

2529
01:50:21,639 --> 01:50:27,159
tsunami which uh I think he's already

2530
01:50:24,399 --> 01:50:31,799
growing indoors and then with the seed

2531
01:50:27,158 --> 01:50:34,399
and look toxic so uh you know I think

2532
01:50:31,800 --> 01:50:36,800
um um it will be really interesting

2533
01:50:34,399 --> 01:50:38,359
either way we you usually see the year

2534
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:40,159
after we've made the seed some people

2535
01:50:38,359 --> 01:50:43,039
have bought it put it out and then that

2536
01:50:40,158 --> 01:50:46,279
Poland comes back to Europe and you you

2537
01:50:43,039 --> 01:50:49,359
gets a name if it's uh if it's knocking

2538
01:50:46,279 --> 01:50:51,359
people out and you know it's kind of or

2539
01:50:49,359 --> 01:50:53,960
if it's some sort of extreme flavor or

2540
01:50:51,359 --> 01:50:55,719
something like that you know so um yeah

2541
01:50:53,960 --> 01:50:59,198
I mean we we work with all different

2542
01:50:55,719 --> 01:51:00,760
types of characters and and uh try to

2543
01:50:59,198 --> 01:51:03,158
take them all

2544
01:51:00,760 --> 01:51:05,320
seriously yeah wow that's so interesting

2545
01:51:03,158 --> 01:51:07,719
I guess in a in a long- winded sense you

2546
01:51:05,319 --> 01:51:09,679
get to reap the fruit of your labor when

2547
01:51:07,719 --> 01:51:11,679
you say when the hash comes back out of

2548
01:51:09,679 --> 01:51:14,118
out of curiosity is that you just have

2549
01:51:11,679 --> 01:51:16,158
like a a contact who you just offload

2550
01:51:14,118 --> 01:51:18,479
seeds to and they distribute it locally

2551
01:51:16,158 --> 01:51:22,759
or is it just to like a big farm yeah

2552
01:51:18,479 --> 01:51:24,279
we've got uh there's let's just say um

2553
01:51:22,760 --> 01:51:27,239
how would I best describe this without

2554
01:51:24,279 --> 01:51:30,399
hurting any well there's a few people

2555
01:51:27,238 --> 01:51:33,118
who uh um who have been working in in

2556
01:51:30,399 --> 01:51:37,279
Morocco for many years for example a lot

2557
01:51:33,118 --> 01:51:39,839
of Spanish Dutch English people and um a

2558
01:51:37,279 --> 01:51:42,399
lot of them have blocks of land now and

2559
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:44,679
they come and purchase you know a few

2560
01:51:42,399 --> 01:51:46,158
hundred thousand seeds at a time of you

2561
01:51:44,679 --> 01:51:48,158
know four or five different strains and

2562
01:51:46,158 --> 01:51:50,359
then they go over and then the year

2563
01:51:48,158 --> 01:51:53,359
later you come they come back with a lot

2564
01:51:50,359 --> 01:51:56,359
of the uh um pollen or already semi-

2565
01:51:53,359 --> 01:51:58,279
pressed or pressed and and goes on the

2566
01:51:56,359 --> 01:52:02,679
market commercial marketers the Moroccan

2567
01:51:58,279 --> 01:52:05,238
hashes and you know you see uh you see

2568
01:52:02,679 --> 01:52:06,639
this year I saw P pineapple skunk and

2569
01:52:05,238 --> 01:52:09,118
different all these different things

2570
01:52:06,639 --> 01:52:10,840
that we've been you know sort of making

2571
01:52:09,118 --> 01:52:12,479
for different people and and it comes

2572
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:14,679
back as pollen and and some of it's

2573
01:52:12,479 --> 01:52:16,718
fantastic you know there's nothing

2574
01:52:14,679 --> 01:52:18,560
nothing wrong it's it's again like the

2575
01:52:16,719 --> 01:52:20,679
wine Mak the hash maker depends on the

2576
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:23,520
hash maker and how clean they are and

2577
01:52:20,679 --> 01:52:25,118
what what press it is is what pass it is

2578
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:27,320
if it's a first pass you know you can

2579
01:52:25,118 --> 01:52:30,598
see it's really gray and

2580
01:52:27,319 --> 01:52:32,519
incredible Ash and uh then it gets down

2581
01:52:30,599 --> 01:52:35,199
to the green stuff which is you know

2582
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:37,560
like the old French papers or or

2583
01:52:35,198 --> 01:52:39,919
different versions of just commercial

2584
01:52:37,560 --> 01:52:44,119
quality stuff you know probably second

2585
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:46,880
third or fourth PR pass you know so um

2586
01:52:44,118 --> 01:52:50,319
yeah when it gets too green I start to

2587
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:52,679
go the other direction

2588
01:52:50,319 --> 01:52:54,158
usually yeah sure that that's

2589
01:52:52,679 --> 01:52:56,480
interesting to hear there you go I would

2590
01:52:54,158 --> 01:52:58,359
have I would have never known while

2591
01:52:56,479 --> 01:53:00,359
we're kind of on the tail end of it

2592
01:52:58,359 --> 01:53:01,799
we've got a few fan submitted questions

2593
01:53:00,359 --> 01:53:03,279
I'd love to run by you but the first one

2594
01:53:01,800 --> 01:53:05,480
I want to quickly ask before we jump

2595
01:53:03,279 --> 01:53:07,039
into them is a bit earlier on we were

2596
01:53:05,479 --> 01:53:09,479
talking about the challenges in

2597
01:53:07,039 --> 01:53:12,519
maintaining a library over the long term

2598
01:53:09,479 --> 01:53:14,718
and I wanted to ask you there's a common

2599
01:53:12,520 --> 01:53:17,520
topic discussed in the community about

2600
01:53:14,719 --> 01:53:19,920
sort of the loss of vigor or maybe you'd

2601
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:22,599
call it like genetic deterioration

2602
01:53:19,920 --> 01:53:24,359
there's various terms used have you seen

2603
01:53:22,599 --> 01:53:27,239
this do you think that plants

2604
01:53:24,359 --> 01:53:29,118
deteriorate over time and would you say

2605
01:53:27,238 --> 01:53:31,959
that it's genetic drift or just some

2606
01:53:29,118 --> 01:53:34,078
alternative sort of deterioration no I

2607
01:53:31,960 --> 01:53:37,078
mean that's I think that's a lot of

2608
01:53:34,078 --> 01:53:38,799
[ __ ] to the truth I think if you're

2609
01:53:37,078 --> 01:53:41,880
preserving plants in a very good

2610
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:44,400
environment and uh specifically we grow

2611
01:53:41,880 --> 01:53:47,000
we take our old mothers outside after

2612
01:53:44,399 --> 01:53:48,479
nine months and we grow them for one or

2613
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:50,920
two months outside and take a new

2614
01:53:48,479 --> 01:53:52,839
cutting a new cutting from the new

2615
01:53:50,920 --> 01:53:54,399
growth and bring it in for the next

2616
01:53:52,840 --> 01:53:56,639
season and we've been doing that for

2617
01:53:54,399 --> 01:53:59,839
some plants that are like 30 odd years

2618
01:53:56,639 --> 01:54:01,319
old so uh I didn't see any deterioration

2619
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:04,159
I don't see anything the only thing that

2620
01:54:01,319 --> 01:54:05,759
I see nowadays is a lot more people

2621
01:54:04,158 --> 01:54:08,118
passing different things to different

2622
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:12,000
people and viruses are now becoming

2623
01:54:08,118 --> 01:54:14,679
impacting the industry um and uh the

2624
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:16,920
cleanliness and and that's why I don't

2625
01:54:14,679 --> 01:54:19,679
bring in any plants in my Greenhouse in

2626
01:54:16,920 --> 01:54:21,560
America or in Europe from anywhere else

2627
01:54:19,679 --> 01:54:24,279
we do all of our mothers and all of our

2628
01:54:21,560 --> 01:54:28,440
clones are done in the facility for the

2629
01:54:24,279 --> 01:54:31,118
production only dry flow go out or seeds

2630
01:54:28,439 --> 01:54:34,638
go out from that we're already cleaned

2631
01:54:31,118 --> 01:54:39,000
have cleaned uh SC laboratory uh

2632
01:54:34,639 --> 01:54:42,960
controlled uh testing and uh if anything

2633
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:45,800
uh like just recently there was a a pink

2634
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:49,679
lemonade clone found in in one

2635
01:54:45,800 --> 01:54:52,920
particular room uh in swiftland that was

2636
01:54:49,679 --> 01:54:57,960
growing and and it looked like it had

2637
01:54:52,920 --> 01:55:00,319
the virus so I had my my uh the CEO of

2638
01:54:57,960 --> 01:55:02,840
the company I work with now ber gluton

2639
01:55:00,319 --> 01:55:05,799
in Switzerland and I went over he went

2640
01:55:02,840 --> 01:55:07,840
there straight away took a sample and

2641
01:55:05,800 --> 01:55:12,239
then we took a sample

2642
01:55:07,840 --> 01:55:15,319
from our mother room and then I took a

2643
01:55:12,238 --> 01:55:19,158
sample from another mother room that I

2644
01:55:15,319 --> 01:55:21,158
have espcially away from those ones two

2645
01:55:19,158 --> 01:55:22,839
of them were infected don't know how

2646
01:55:21,158 --> 01:55:26,799
they got infected and one one of them

2647
01:55:22,840 --> 01:55:29,078
was not at all so we killed

2648
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:30,880
everything I've got all of them backed

2649
01:55:29,078 --> 01:55:32,279
up in the tissue culture but the thing

2650
01:55:30,880 --> 01:55:36,239
is that it's going to take nine months

2651
01:55:32,279 --> 01:55:40,000
to grow out before we can get it back so

2652
01:55:36,238 --> 01:55:43,158
um the the last one which is closer to

2653
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:45,639
me that was clean and I and I was able

2654
01:55:43,158 --> 01:55:49,439
to take a cutting from that and bring it

2655
01:55:45,639 --> 01:55:51,440
back into the new into the old area when

2656
01:55:49,439 --> 01:55:53,000
they cleaned out everything and sprayed

2657
01:55:51,439 --> 01:55:55,078
it all down

2658
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:56,679
and and you know it was not it was maybe

2659
01:55:55,078 --> 01:55:58,039
from scissors it might have been from

2660
01:55:56,679 --> 01:56:00,760
someone touching something who could

2661
01:55:58,039 --> 01:56:02,078
have been brought in from other rooms to

2662
01:56:00,760 --> 01:56:05,119
that room because there's a lot of

2663
01:56:02,078 --> 01:56:07,559
traffic there unfortunately and you know

2664
01:56:05,118 --> 01:56:09,479
that's why I say this um I'm not trying

2665
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:13,400
to frighten anyone I'm just trying to

2666
01:56:09,479 --> 01:56:17,118
say you know work clean uh dip in

2667
01:56:13,399 --> 01:56:19,078
alcohol um wash your hands use gloves uh

2668
01:56:17,118 --> 01:56:22,319
when you're working with mothers and

2669
01:56:19,078 --> 01:56:24,960
clones just that area for me is the most

2670
01:56:22,319 --> 01:56:27,399
important if you keep that solid if you

2671
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:29,880
grow out mothers each year outside in

2672
01:56:27,399 --> 01:56:31,960
the sunlight bring them in you those

2673
01:56:29,880 --> 01:56:34,440
sort of precautionary things you'll

2674
01:56:31,960 --> 01:56:37,000
never have issues to deal with with

2675
01:56:34,439 --> 01:56:39,319
genetic drift and this so-called genetic

2676
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:41,760
drift anyway it's they they they treat

2677
01:56:39,319 --> 01:56:44,118
it like a photocopy of a photocopy of a

2678
01:56:41,760 --> 01:56:47,360
photocopy I don't believe that because

2679
01:56:44,118 --> 01:56:49,920
every year I reset it outside and I

2680
01:56:47,359 --> 01:56:52,880
bring it in and it's more fit than it

2681
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:55,920
was the nine months before

2682
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:58,960
indoor light um will eventually it's not

2683
01:56:55,920 --> 01:57:02,319
natural um anything growing not

2684
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:04,359
naturally uh for for too long we'll

2685
01:57:02,319 --> 01:57:09,759
start to have

2686
01:57:04,359 --> 01:57:12,158
some um changes taking place and and and

2687
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:13,960
possibly uh they're not as healthy they

2688
01:57:12,158 --> 01:57:15,759
might not be there might be some animal

2689
01:57:13,960 --> 01:57:17,920
issues that are going on thing and then

2690
01:57:15,760 --> 01:57:20,119
all of a sudden you start to see this

2691
01:57:17,920 --> 01:57:22,399
plant not performing very well anymore

2692
01:57:20,118 --> 01:57:24,000
and and it's not genetic drift it's just

2693
01:57:22,399 --> 01:57:26,759
unhealthy

2694
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:29,078
nonfit mothers you

2695
01:57:26,760 --> 01:57:30,880
know yeah certainly and look that's

2696
01:57:29,078 --> 01:57:33,238
reassuring to hear that you can sort of

2697
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:35,159
reinvigorate them by giving them that

2698
01:57:33,238 --> 01:57:38,319
that uh that season outside that the sun

2699
01:57:35,158 --> 01:57:39,519
is revitalizing like that and building

2700
01:57:38,319 --> 01:57:41,519
on what you've said you know you've

2701
01:57:39,520 --> 01:57:44,880
expressed a pretty clear concern about

2702
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:47,320
the hoplon virus and it does feel a bit

2703
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:49,800
out of sight out of mind which is a bit

2704
01:57:47,319 --> 01:57:51,799
concerning do you have concerns that

2705
01:57:49,800 --> 01:57:53,639
like a new virus will emerge or do you

2706
01:57:51,800 --> 01:57:56,840
think The Hop plon is the one to be

2707
01:57:53,639 --> 01:57:58,599
concerned about and it's just going to

2708
01:57:56,840 --> 01:58:02,279
persist I

2709
01:57:58,599 --> 01:58:05,319
think there are I'm a biologist a plant

2710
01:58:02,279 --> 01:58:08,920
biologist in in in if you wanted do

2711
01:58:05,319 --> 01:58:12,238
label in the end and of course

2712
01:58:08,920 --> 01:58:14,679
monoculture breeds new viruses

2713
01:58:12,238 --> 01:58:17,279
unfortunately and and we're

2714
01:58:14,679 --> 01:58:21,118
monocultural uh really intensely at the

2715
01:58:17,279 --> 01:58:23,759
moment like anything that the um

2716
01:58:21,118 --> 01:58:25,158
everyone thinks is riging money you know

2717
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:27,920
all of a sudden you get the big guns

2718
01:58:25,158 --> 01:58:29,920
come in set up the big greenh houses and

2719
01:58:27,920 --> 01:58:31,319
and they don't really they're not

2720
01:58:29,920 --> 01:58:34,800
passionate about the plant they're just

2721
01:58:31,319 --> 01:58:37,599
looking for the the business and and um

2722
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:40,320
yes with those sort of uh operations

2723
01:58:37,599 --> 01:58:43,599
we're going to see a lot more viruses

2724
01:58:40,319 --> 01:58:47,840
coming in the beat J there's a there's a

2725
01:58:43,599 --> 01:58:51,000
really a couple of weird viruses already

2726
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:53,319
very minutely affecting things I keep an

2727
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:56,279
eye on everything

2728
01:58:53,319 --> 01:58:59,679
um and you know there's one that that

2729
01:58:56,279 --> 01:59:02,399
that makes the plant kind of look like a

2730
01:58:59,679 --> 01:59:04,480
a cousin it at the top of the plant I

2731
01:59:02,399 --> 01:59:09,118
forgot the name I think

2732
01:59:04,479 --> 01:59:11,759
beat be virus or something this uh so it

2733
01:59:09,118 --> 01:59:15,039
looks very unusual you realize that's

2734
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:17,880
distinctly bacterial issues

2735
01:59:15,039 --> 01:59:21,599
and uh I don't know I mean you know if

2736
01:59:17,880 --> 01:59:24,039
you Rob Rob Rob Clark made a book hemp

2737
01:59:21,599 --> 01:59:27,039
and he he went covered a lot of viruses

2738
01:59:24,039 --> 01:59:29,118
in that uh that had already been

2739
01:59:27,039 --> 01:59:30,760
established in h for many years already

2740
01:59:29,118 --> 01:59:31,920
and they're going to jump they're going

2741
01:59:30,760 --> 01:59:35,320
to

2742
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:37,480
change uh people uh networking and

2743
01:59:35,319 --> 01:59:40,880
crossing over and passing plants I mean

2744
01:59:37,479 --> 01:59:43,759
that's for me it's natural we have

2745
01:59:40,880 --> 01:59:46,800
viruses living in in in the atmosphere

2746
01:59:43,760 --> 01:59:49,719
and and around us but uh I think if you

2747
01:59:46,800 --> 01:59:52,679
want to keep your room clean um and

2748
01:59:49,719 --> 01:59:54,198
devoid of that sort of stuff then have a

2749
01:59:52,679 --> 01:59:57,319
quarantine if you're going to bring in

2750
01:59:54,198 --> 02:00:00,078
plants into a certain area quarantine

2751
01:59:57,319 --> 02:00:03,479
them in a in another tent first for a

2752
02:00:00,078 --> 02:00:05,039
few weeks make sure or or do a flowering

2753
02:00:03,479 --> 02:00:08,078
make sure that everything's clean and

2754
02:00:05,039 --> 02:00:10,599
you're using clean tools before you let

2755
02:00:08,078 --> 02:00:12,599
them come into the main room so we we do

2756
02:00:10,599 --> 02:00:14,599
a lot of that protocol nowadays with

2757
02:00:12,599 --> 02:00:17,119
everything and and I don't allow people

2758
02:00:14,599 --> 02:00:19,319
who don't need to be there to be there

2759
02:00:17,118 --> 02:00:20,598
it used to take you know a lot of people

2760
02:00:19,319 --> 02:00:22,679
around and show them around and

2761
02:00:20,599 --> 02:00:24,639
everything like that but now it was to

2762
02:00:22,679 --> 02:00:27,480
our detriment in the end and and you

2763
02:00:24,639 --> 02:00:30,480
know some so basically we're close shop

2764
02:00:27,479 --> 02:00:32,039
now and I I don't really come out in

2765
02:00:30,479 --> 02:00:33,799
public I don't do the show so much

2766
02:00:32,039 --> 02:00:36,000
anymore I don't do any of that but I

2767
02:00:33,800 --> 02:00:38,800
mean I'm still available online and I'm

2768
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:41,840
very easy to talk to with the if you're

2769
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:43,800
a grower and and um I I I love to be

2770
02:00:41,840 --> 02:00:45,800
involved with the kids helping them and

2771
02:00:43,800 --> 02:00:48,520
and they're helping me and and it's kind

2772
02:00:45,800 --> 02:00:52,000
of I find it in a really good stage at

2773
02:00:48,520 --> 02:00:54,639
the moment of life where uh the next

2774
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:55,920
generation is uh I don't say that

2775
02:00:54,639 --> 02:00:58,520
they're going to be always interested

2776
02:00:55,920 --> 02:01:00,960
but at the moment they they uh they need

2777
02:00:58,520 --> 02:01:03,400
some Financial Independence and so I've

2778
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:06,639
got them on a a carrot at the moment and

2779
02:01:03,399 --> 02:01:08,598
and hopefully they they do they bring to

2780
02:01:06,639 --> 02:01:11,560
the table stuff that I've got no idea

2781
02:01:08,599 --> 02:01:13,520
about which is pretty evident they are

2782
02:01:11,560 --> 02:01:15,599
and so we're we're a pretty good team at

2783
02:01:13,520 --> 02:01:18,159
the moment I really like

2784
02:01:15,599 --> 02:01:19,520
that wow yeah look understandable that

2785
02:01:18,158 --> 02:01:22,198
you have to tighten the belt with the

2786
02:01:19,520 --> 02:01:24,719
quarantine given the viruses and gosh if

2787
02:01:22,198 --> 02:01:26,759
only we could all be so lucky to have a

2788
02:01:24,719 --> 02:01:29,000
father like yourself dangling such an

2789
02:01:26,760 --> 02:01:32,079
incredible carrot that's uh that's

2790
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:34,158
awesome to hear you want I mean you're a

2791
02:01:32,078 --> 02:01:36,880
sweet

2792
02:01:34,158 --> 02:01:38,238
guy um you mentioned the Next Generation

2793
02:01:36,880 --> 02:01:40,960
I wanted to ask you because I know you

2794
02:01:38,238 --> 02:01:43,078
work with some big facilities the new

2795
02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:45,520
generation of lighting are you sold on

2796
02:01:43,078 --> 02:01:49,880
LEDs do you prefer the old school HPS

2797
02:01:45,520 --> 02:01:52,560
metal H well not sold on anything that

2798
02:01:49,880 --> 02:01:56,719
doesn't prove itself

2799
02:01:52,560 --> 02:02:03,440
I um I use a lot of LEDs in the mother

2800
02:01:56,719 --> 02:02:06,319
rooms um with a I've gone back to

2801
02:02:03,439 --> 02:02:10,799
combination um so in my mother rooms

2802
02:02:06,319 --> 02:02:13,639
I've still used some um Sante uh

2803
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:16,760
Phillips uh um High Press

2804
02:02:13,639 --> 02:02:19,400
sodium U interspersed with a lot of LEDs

2805
02:02:16,760 --> 02:02:22,520
and stuff so I've got a blend of of

2806
02:02:19,399 --> 02:02:26,439
spectrum there um the mother

2807
02:02:22,520 --> 02:02:29,119
respond well they're good the Clones um

2808
02:02:26,439 --> 02:02:32,118
LEDs fine and I use the LEDs in the

2809
02:02:29,118 --> 02:02:35,118
Clone I used to use T light you know

2810
02:02:32,118 --> 02:02:39,598
fluoresence and and I've always very

2811
02:02:35,118 --> 02:02:43,118
soft cool cool white you know kind of um

2812
02:02:39,599 --> 02:02:44,078
tubes um so I've G on everything but um

2813
02:02:43,118 --> 02:02:47,319
you

2814
02:02:44,078 --> 02:02:50,359
know uh in Big Greenhouse in America

2815
02:02:47,319 --> 02:02:54,319
we're basically not on LEDs at all we're

2816
02:02:50,359 --> 02:02:59,158
only we just changed all the glob on 600

2817
02:02:54,319 --> 02:03:02,599
Waters um and we're producing

2818
02:02:59,158 --> 02:03:04,839
um huge amounts on living soil and and

2819
02:03:02,599 --> 02:03:08,039
excellent quality so uh you know I'm

2820
02:03:04,840 --> 02:03:10,119
open to everything it's whatever what

2821
02:03:08,039 --> 02:03:12,599
I'm not a guy that that is the first on

2822
02:03:10,118 --> 02:03:14,679
the Block to to get new technology I

2823
02:03:12,599 --> 02:03:19,239
like to see it proven I might be the

2824
02:03:14,679 --> 02:03:21,960
first on the Block to to try out new new

2825
02:03:19,238 --> 02:03:24,638
reads and things like that and and the

2826
02:03:21,960 --> 02:03:26,118
double in in making keeping males alive

2827
02:03:24,639 --> 02:03:28,400
there's no value for people keeping

2828
02:03:26,118 --> 02:03:31,439
males alive most of the time and

2829
02:03:28,399 --> 02:03:34,319
I'm driving males from five different

2830
02:03:31,439 --> 02:03:36,559
countries to all you know I mean my and

2831
02:03:34,319 --> 02:03:38,679
there's no value for anybody you know I

2832
02:03:36,560 --> 02:03:42,639
have to pay them to keep them there and

2833
02:03:38,679 --> 02:03:44,078
and growing in so yeah my jobs uh vary

2834
02:03:42,639 --> 02:03:45,840
depending on what jumper I'm wearing

2835
02:03:44,078 --> 02:03:48,960
that day and you know now we make

2836
02:03:45,840 --> 02:03:52,360
flowers for for certain companies and in

2837
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:54,719
Europe and in Australia and kind of you

2838
02:03:52,359 --> 02:03:57,679
know now we we're trying to spread our

2839
02:03:54,719 --> 02:04:00,359
wings a little bit and while the the

2840
02:03:57,679 --> 02:04:03,599
market is still emerging in Europe the

2841
02:04:00,359 --> 02:04:06,639
the legal Medical Market still not tight

2842
02:04:03,599 --> 02:04:10,239
and and with a distinct Direction in

2843
02:04:06,639 --> 02:04:12,679
Europe and and as it's not as developed

2844
02:04:10,238 --> 02:04:16,039
as in Australia or America or Canada at

2845
02:04:12,679 --> 02:04:18,960
the moment and and so we're we're just

2846
02:04:16,039 --> 02:04:21,319
getting aligned for that time I think

2847
02:04:18,960 --> 02:04:23,960
it's coming this year I believe very

2848
02:04:21,319 --> 02:04:27,238
strongly that France and Germany will

2849
02:04:23,960 --> 02:04:29,000
will um will be at the Forefront of

2850
02:04:27,238 --> 02:04:31,439
those things and you know some other

2851
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:33,158
countries Italy Spain and Greece maybe

2852
02:04:31,439 --> 02:04:35,359
they're they're lingering behind

2853
02:04:33,158 --> 02:04:38,118
watching you know Europe's not one

2854
02:04:35,359 --> 02:04:40,799
country it might sound like it's a

2855
02:04:38,118 --> 02:04:43,279
conglomerate but it's still they've

2856
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:45,400
still got different uh cultural

2857
02:04:43,279 --> 02:04:47,279
differences you know and and there

2858
02:04:45,399 --> 02:04:50,920
there's definitely

2859
02:04:47,279 --> 02:04:54,439
um some differences in in the stigmas

2860
02:04:50,920 --> 02:04:56,559
unfortunately and and but um in Swiss

2861
02:04:54,439 --> 02:04:59,198
I'm we great I mean I I I really

2862
02:04:56,559 --> 02:05:01,960
appreciate the Swiss for for that reason

2863
02:04:59,198 --> 02:05:04,238
that they actually allowing a lot of

2864
02:05:01,960 --> 02:05:06,760
stuff to happen take place indoor

2865
02:05:04,238 --> 02:05:08,678
facilities in certain things they know

2866
02:05:06,760 --> 02:05:10,400
what we're doing we have to announce it

2867
02:05:08,679 --> 02:05:13,319
and we have to try to describe it as

2868
02:05:10,399 --> 02:05:15,279
best we can before we've done it then

2869
02:05:13,319 --> 02:05:17,439
they come along and check and you know

2870
02:05:15,279 --> 02:05:19,399
they they they do what they say and we

2871
02:05:17,439 --> 02:05:22,960
do what we say and as long as that's all

2872
02:05:19,399 --> 02:05:24,799
going along pretty okay our uh our last

2873
02:05:22,960 --> 02:05:27,960
question for this interview I've been

2874
02:05:24,800 --> 02:05:30,880
waiting to ask you what in your opinion

2875
02:05:27,960 --> 02:05:32,279
is some of the best genetic stock you've

2876
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:34,719
ever worked

2877
02:05:32,279 --> 02:05:37,880
with well I

2878
02:05:34,719 --> 02:05:41,039
suppose um if I have

2879
02:05:37,880 --> 02:05:42,880
to think about it over all my

2880
02:05:41,039 --> 02:05:45,319
career

2881
02:05:42,880 --> 02:05:48,118
okay um I was

2882
02:05:45,319 --> 02:05:51,158
probably the most excited of my life

2883
02:05:48,118 --> 02:05:54,158
when I came across U when I we started

2884
02:05:51,158 --> 02:05:56,238
to develop V something from Main AR in

2885
02:05:54,158 --> 02:05:59,198
Australia many years ago when I was at

2886
02:05:56,238 --> 02:06:00,919
University we called it m Madness but

2887
02:05:59,198 --> 02:06:03,238
there was a lot of diff I think we

2888
02:06:00,920 --> 02:06:05,800
talked about this last time I just

2889
02:06:03,238 --> 02:06:07,678
remember growing this from seed with

2890
02:06:05,800 --> 02:06:10,920
with Rob the one of the guys that with

2891
02:06:07,679 --> 02:06:13,000
the main grower and smuggling it down in

2892
02:06:10,920 --> 02:06:15,440
pillows you know someone in the pillows

2893
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:17,479
and down at Melbourne University and

2894
02:06:15,439 --> 02:06:22,439
goes in a matter of hours you know it

2895
02:06:17,479 --> 02:06:24,879
was like it was um it never disappointed

2896
02:06:22,439 --> 02:06:26,078
it was one of these strains that it's

2897
02:06:24,880 --> 02:06:29,880
like Neville's

2898
02:06:26,078 --> 02:06:33,000
Hayes it was very similar I I still see

2899
02:06:29,880 --> 02:06:35,840
no matter what anyone says uh how you

2900
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:38,559
use the name Haz or mal or whatever it

2901
02:06:35,840 --> 02:06:40,880
was an early development of of of

2902
02:06:38,559 --> 02:06:45,440
definitely Colombian

2903
02:06:40,880 --> 02:06:48,719
Tha things in that that time you know

2904
02:06:45,439 --> 02:06:51,078
and I I we used to grow it year after

2905
02:06:48,719 --> 02:06:52,800
year from seed and and it was it never

2906
02:06:51,078 --> 02:06:54,359
disappointed it was an exciting thing

2907
02:06:52,800 --> 02:06:57,920
and then I came across it when I bumped

2908
02:06:54,359 --> 02:07:01,078
into Neville in Europe many years later

2909
02:06:57,920 --> 02:07:03,840
in the the the haze version so I that's

2910
02:07:01,078 --> 02:07:06,558
why I always called it an Australian Haz

2911
02:07:03,840 --> 02:07:09,039
but uh I can't prove that it came from

2912
02:07:06,559 --> 02:07:11,279
completely different sources I think but

2913
02:07:09,039 --> 02:07:12,760
it might not have the origins originally

2914
02:07:11,279 --> 02:07:15,238
the countries it came from it might have

2915
02:07:12,760 --> 02:07:18,920
been very similar we weren't there and

2916
02:07:15,238 --> 02:07:22,439
so uh you know like I I said to you many

2917
02:07:18,920 --> 02:07:26,239
times mate that uh we the hands of

2918
02:07:22,439 --> 02:07:28,078
nature at best and we get things from

2919
02:07:26,238 --> 02:07:30,718
the last generation and they got things

2920
02:07:28,078 --> 02:07:33,238
from the generation before and hopefully

2921
02:07:30,719 --> 02:07:38,198
we improve on it and and we don't sort

2922
02:07:33,238 --> 02:07:41,519
of uh you know sort of diverse um um

2923
02:07:38,198 --> 02:07:43,319
deviate sorry from from the the good

2924
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:46,480
direction and and just make it

2925
02:07:43,319 --> 02:07:47,679
commercial we we kind of continue

2926
02:07:46,479 --> 02:07:49,759
there's a certain amount of breeders

2927
02:07:47,679 --> 02:07:51,840
that do a really good cottage industry

2928
02:07:49,760 --> 02:07:54,039
job with certain strains and they don't

2929
02:07:51,840 --> 02:07:57,078
need to do 50 strin they need to do two

2930
02:07:54,039 --> 02:08:00,599
or one and they do that incredibly well

2931
02:07:57,078 --> 02:08:02,439
and uh they should be uh acknowledged

2932
02:08:00,599 --> 02:08:05,159
for that as well I mean there's a lot of

2933
02:08:02,439 --> 02:08:07,759
really fantastic Growers out there that

2934
02:08:05,158 --> 02:08:10,759
have been keeping things alive for a lot

2935
02:08:07,760 --> 02:08:13,440
lot of years and um it's just timing of

2936
02:08:10,760 --> 02:08:16,599
my life was probably I was in a lucky

2937
02:08:13,439 --> 02:08:18,279
situation you know and I had all the

2938
02:08:16,599 --> 02:08:20,000
guys around me I didn't know they were

2939
02:08:18,279 --> 02:08:21,639
the guys at that time you know we're

2940
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:24,719
just normal guys smoking a joint

2941
02:08:21,639 --> 02:08:25,920
drinking a glass of wine or something

2942
02:08:24,719 --> 02:08:28,760
you in

2943
02:08:25,920 --> 02:08:31,199
Amsterdam wow in incredible I'm I'm so

2944
02:08:28,760 --> 02:08:32,760
stoked to hear again how special the

2945
02:08:31,198 --> 02:08:34,919
Mullen bimy Madness was to you and the

2946
02:08:32,760 --> 02:08:36,400
similarities with Neville Hayes I think

2947
02:08:34,920 --> 02:08:37,840
that just about brings us to the end of

2948
02:08:36,399 --> 02:08:39,519
it for this one any comments or shout

2949
02:08:37,840 --> 02:08:41,800
outs you want to make no I just

2950

appreciate you taking the time to uh

2951

your viewers uh into and if they ever

2954
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:55,679

2955
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:59,960
than welcome to come to the website and

2956
02:08:55,679 --> 02:09:01,920
and uh and talk directly there um I'm

2957
02:08:59,960 --> 02:09:05,960
pretty approachable I don't I treat

2958
02:09:01,920 --> 02:09:08,960
everyone as equal so we uh and boys and

2959
02:09:05,960 --> 02:09:10,800
girls every type of whatever and we're

2960
02:09:08,960 --> 02:09:13,319
all fine with that you know we're in an

2961
02:09:10,800 --> 02:09:15,639
industry which is trying there's still

2962
02:09:13,319 --> 02:09:17,519
some people in there trying to maintain

2963
02:09:15,639 --> 02:09:20,679
a good integrity and try to do the right

2964
02:09:17,520 --> 02:09:22,960
job and and I think we're linking up

2965
02:09:20,679 --> 02:09:26,520
with a lot of them so I still think that

2966
02:09:22,960 --> 02:09:29,719
there's um as much as the cops of

2967
02:09:26,520 --> 02:09:31,199
negative um feedback from even people

2968
02:09:29,719 --> 02:09:33,800
within the industry I think there's a

2969
02:09:31,198 --> 02:09:35,960
lot of great people and I'm hoping the

2970
02:09:33,800 --> 02:09:39,119
direction that takes will be the right

2971
02:09:35,960 --> 02:09:42,559
one eventually and uh we'll be there for

2972
02:09:39,118 --> 02:09:44,558
