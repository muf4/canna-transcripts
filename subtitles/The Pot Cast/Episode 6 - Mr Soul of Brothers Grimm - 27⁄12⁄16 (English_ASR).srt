25
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,549
like to ask everyone is let's go back to

26
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:25,919
the start the first time you ever smoked

27
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:29,490
weed what was it like that's a good

28
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,379
story actually I was at my uncle's well

29
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:33,839
I should say where my uncle lived with

30
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:36,328
my grandparents and I have an uncle who

31
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,810
my father being the oldest in the family

32
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:42,478
has a has a brother who's only five

33
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:45,359
years older than myself and so I always

34
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:47,849
admired him you know is the cool uncle

35
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:50,578
that being that bit older than myself

36
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:51,959
when I would visit my grandparents house

37
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:53,578
he would always have interesting things

38
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:55,259
in the drawers and all around in his

39
00:01:53,578 --> 00:01:59,429
room and I'd always go in and explore

40
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:01,680
one day I found what was a 1/2 ounce of

41
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,118
Acapulco gold in his drawer and I picked

42
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,460
that up and he happened to be in the

43
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:07,549
room as I did it and

44
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:09,439
I said wow what is this easily I said is

45
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:11,450
this real marijuana and he's like yeah

46
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:14,030
that's Acapulco gold it's some of the

47
00:02:11,449 --> 00:02:15,530
best in the world and I said he said

48
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,568
have you already smoked marijuana I said

49
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,129
my friends and I have been trying you

50
00:02:17,568 --> 00:02:21,139
know then out in the woods and trying to

51
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:22,939
find like if there's any wild marijuana

52
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:24,859
growing then you know we tried to dry it

53
00:02:22,939 --> 00:02:27,409
out and smoke it and I don't know how

54
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:29,330
crazy that is if everyone's had that but

55
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:31,639
growing up in the 70s you know I guess

56
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:33,770
mm-hmm we didn't have access to

57
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:36,909
information like you do today realize

58
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:39,439
our folly so at that moment I was then

59
00:02:36,909 --> 00:02:41,659
taken away from all of that silliness

60
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,400
and my uncle rolled a real joint and

61
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:46,069
took me out in the backyard where he had

62
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,360
this a good old van that was a abandoned

63
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:50,959
back there we sat in the front seat and

64
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,900
smoked a joint when I went into a dream

65
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,849
as the Beatles said and everything you

66
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,700
know from the moment someone spoke you

67
00:02:55,849 --> 00:03:01,579
know it was like this spell had been

68
00:02:58,699 --> 00:03:03,768
cast where I'm guessing I'm gonna wake

69
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:06,140
up later and this didn't really happen

70
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:08,150
you know I was just dreaming at all you

71
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:12,768
know that was hmm

72
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:15,500
I just felt a an affinity to and a great

73
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:18,230
liking of that experience and sought it

74
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:20,209
out you know in years after hmm didn't

75
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:21,679
come as frequently as you know someone

76
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:23,239
might today where they say hey I really

77
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,860
like marijuana I'm gonna start smoking

78
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:26,539
it all the time and the availability is

79
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:29,959
there mm-hmm

80
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:32,840
it was more of over the next year or two

81
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:35,239
I'd have a few experiences where working

82
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,120
in a nightclub as a busboy or a waiter

83
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:40,310
or something and those circles there

84
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:43,099
were people who were dealing pounds of

85
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:44,689
marijuana and you know I was just 17 or

86
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:47,810
18 in high school and I could remember

87
00:03:44,689 --> 00:03:49,849
them sort of implying what they were

88
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,829
doing and saying do you want some and

89
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:55,039
they gave me like a matchbox full of

90
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:56,810
this great weed and I remember enjoying

91
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:58,519
that to myself you know and having a

92
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:00,530
couple of joints of that you know and

93
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:03,049
then from there I started to you know

94
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:04,419
obviously meet people and have friends

95
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:07,750
in the school that were

96
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:09,699
into this culture and we started having

97
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:12,039
the availability of marijuana much more

98
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:14,829
frequently and it got better and better

99
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:19,000
at a rapid rate I was in high school I

100
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:22,660
was in tenth grade in 1975 and you would

101
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,839
buy an ounce of weed for $40 it was you

102
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:27,939
know $10 per quarter basically at that

103
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:30,339
time and then all of a sudden you know

104
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:32,259
like five or ten years later you know

105
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:35,379
all those prices sort of tripled and

106
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:36,849
went crazy and it was like three and

107
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:39,699
four hundred and five hundred dollars

108
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:41,770
for an ounce in the 90s and now things

109
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:44,620
have calmed back down from there

110
00:04:41,769 --> 00:04:46,269
such but I know I'm going tangential on

111
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:49,509
you so yeah that was my first experience

112
00:04:46,269 --> 00:04:51,789
getting high and experiencing what

113
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:53,740
marijuana was and I I've never had

114
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:55,479
another drug I liked LSD very much

115
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,150
obviously I don't know why that's

116
00:04:55,478 --> 00:04:59,469
obvious sorry I take that back but I

117
00:04:58,149 --> 00:05:01,418
have commented many times that my

118
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:03,790
photography is influenced by LSD and

119
00:05:01,418 --> 00:05:05,620
comic books so that that could be out

120
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:07,389
there you know people know that yeah

121
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:11,050
anyway I definitely think it shows so

122
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:12,370
those two drugs if you will have always

123
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,949
been something that I felt we're very

124
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:17,228
natural and my body had an affinity to I

125
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:19,149
never liked barbiturates and speed and

126
00:05:17,228 --> 00:05:22,449
these kinds of drugs they always felt

127
00:05:19,149 --> 00:05:25,319
like an artificial thing whereas those

128
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:29,050
other other two that I mentioned are

129
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:30,668
either natural or synthesis synthetic

130
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:35,860
version of something that is natural

131
00:05:30,668 --> 00:05:39,099
like suicide them and so yeah I guess

132
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:41,590
yeah what feels good for my body this is

133
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,970
what I go for rather than you know I

134
00:05:41,589 --> 00:05:44,679
don't like to beat myself up with

135
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:47,020
alcohol and drink all night like some

136
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,209
people and not that anything's wrong

137
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:51,969
with that lifestyle if they liked it but

138
00:05:49,209 --> 00:05:55,000
it's not for me because I was a sporty I

139
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:57,190
rode bicycles most of my life and and

140
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,519
did that sort of thing motocross bicycle

141
00:05:57,189 --> 00:06:01,839
racing I appreciated being able to get

142
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:03,549
on the bike the next morning and not

143
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:04,899
feel like [ __ ] and be able to actually

144
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:07,150
go out there and punish the other guys

145
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:07,879
you know it's a big testosterone thing

146
00:06:07,149 --> 00:06:10,250
you know

147
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:12,709
when you're all out on your bicycles and

148
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,959
racing each other to the town line or

149
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:17,629
who can get to the hill at the top

150
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:19,399
fastest and such so how long did it take

151
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:23,019
before you transition from just

152
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:25,669
enthusiasts to your home grow up I

153
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:29,029
always felt like oh groaning it would be

154
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:31,400
so difficult and I was a child of about

155
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:33,049
a ten and I remember planting some

156
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:35,389
pumpkin seeds and that they didn't come

157
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:37,370
up and I felt like oh growing the plants

158
00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:40,699
very hard you know I had that mindset

159
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:42,949
for some reason but then mmm so

160
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:45,050
consequently never really tried all

161
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:46,759
through high school you know and I

162
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:49,460
didn't even understand the concept of

163
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:51,680
like photo size photo periods and

164
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:54,620
triggering the flowering response in the

165
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:58,819
plant in fact when I was in college at

166
00:06:54,620 --> 00:07:00,980
the age of about 21 I did discover that

167
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:04,310
having picked up a book marijuana

168
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:07,189
horticulture by Jorge Cervantes and I

169
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:09,170
took that hmm read it you know like

170
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:11,810
cover to cover in a day and I was just

171
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:14,060
fascinated by the whole idea that so

172
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:15,680
that's how it works you mean you can

173
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,509
keep them from flowering and you can

174
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,340
make them flower just by changing the

175
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:21,289
amount of daylight that they receive I

176
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:24,919
mean that was just phenomenal for me to

177
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:27,350
just that concept was like so simple and

178
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,509
elegant and beautiful all at once and

179
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:31,250
gave me such power and you know control

180
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:32,810
over what I could do in my mind just

181
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:37,040
start my imagination started to go like

182
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:38,750
wow that means you know X Y Z and I went

183
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,700
from there and it was a pretty short

184
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:43,279
time within a year I had done some

185
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:47,349
closet grows and outdoor grows and near

186
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:49,459
the college had lots of questions

187
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:51,800
started finding that you know you could

188
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:54,319
order seeds online got super sativa seed

189
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:57,110
club going and ordered one or two of

190
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,430
their packs of seeds and in those days

191
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,379
you know you just send a letter back and

192
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:04,730
forth if you had questions there was no

193
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:06,980
email that was a 84 probably 286

194
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:09,410
somewhere in that period and when we

195
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:12,410
first started connecting and through

196
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:14,180
those even those mails the company's

197
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:17,509
owner guy named

198
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,620
que es wrote back to me

199
00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:20,300
saying you know you asked some very

200
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:22,100
interesting questions you seem to be an

201
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,810
intelligent guy you seem to understand

202
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,639
what you're doing and we need people

203
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:27,139
like yourself over in the United States

204
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:29,478
to help us would you be willing to work

205
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:31,340
with us not knowing exactly what that

206
00:08:29,478 --> 00:08:33,620
meant it was a little dig I said sure

207
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:35,478
let me know what you have in mind you

208
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,879
know here's my phone number and he

209
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:38,930
called me after got after he got that

210
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:41,360
letter mm-hmm

211
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:43,399
told me what it was is that they would

212
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,560
send me bulk quantities of each of the

213
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:48,049
strains of their seeds my job would be

214
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:50,239
to receive letters from them with the

215
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:51,740
addresses and quantities of each of the

216
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,589
seeds that are to be sent to each of

217
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:56,240
those addresses and I'd be their courier

218
00:08:54,589 --> 00:08:59,089
you know inside the United States

219
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,339
domestic forwarding yeah distribute

220
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:03,980
their seeds to the individuals who had

221
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:07,670
purchased them from them they paid them

222
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:09,139
and they're then paying me in envelopes

223
00:09:07,669 --> 00:09:11,870
of hundred-dollar bills that would come

224
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:13,909
weekly as well with the orders and they

225
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:15,799
would you know pay more for a larger

226
00:09:13,909 --> 00:09:17,208
order you know for the processing of the

227
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:19,009
larger and a smaller order you don't

228
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:21,439
need to know all the details but anyway

229
00:09:19,009 --> 00:09:23,360
that was my job for them for four years

230
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,390
basically while I went through the last

231
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,639
year of graduate school been working

232
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:31,580
probably the first two years of my job

233
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:33,230
out of college then I met a woman who

234
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:36,740
insisted that I give up all the

235
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:38,360
marijuana stuff so if we just backtrack

236
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:41,750
a little bit while you were growing out

237
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:43,759
the SSC stock what was your favorite of

238
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:45,830
all of this dr. grad because we've heard

239
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:47,659
from skunk PA he mentioned that the

240
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:49,639
beatrix choice was one of his favorites

241
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:52,399
that doesn't often get a mention I never

242
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:54,259
grew it I would probably agree I you

243
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,360
know I always sort of drooled over when

244
00:09:54,259 --> 00:10:00,708
I saw the pictures that they posted of

245
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:03,350
it in their brochures and so on but I

246
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:04,759
never did for any I don't know what

247
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:06,649
reason I guess there were other things I

248
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:09,980
wanted to try first and never got around

249
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:11,750
to Patrick's choice but that and what's

250
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:15,050
that Williams wonder also is one I never

251
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:16,458
grew but for me the Derbent I was the

252
00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:18,729
thing that I thought was like wow that

253
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:21,949
was the most impressive and most

254
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:23,528
personally pleasing to me and I crushed

255
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:26,829
it with spunk number one one

256
00:10:23,528 --> 00:10:29,169
and then grew it outdoors seedlings not

257
00:10:26,828 --> 00:10:30,458
not a female that I had picked out of a

258
00:10:29,169 --> 00:10:32,289
group that I had already flowered

259
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:34,688
indoors and chosen like I would do today

260
00:10:32,289 --> 00:10:38,019
but at that time I just said let me put

261
00:10:34,688 --> 00:10:39,759
out like 30 50 seeds in this field that

262
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:41,649
I had chosen that I thought was secure

263
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:44,350
enough and safe enough and hidden enough

264
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:46,509
but still got a lot of sunlight mmm went

265
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:48,730
out there hacked up the field and got

266
00:10:46,509 --> 00:10:49,990
poison ivy all over myself later I found

267
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:51,699
out that I'd gotten that and I would

268
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:53,610
happen to be going Amsterdam for a week

269
00:10:51,698 --> 00:10:56,229
for a vacation right at that same time

270
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:57,909
just made it to a doctor in time before

271
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:59,079
leaving she gave me some steroids and it

272
00:10:57,909 --> 00:11:01,480
cleared it up in like three days

273
00:10:59,078 --> 00:11:03,789
but anyway back to the story I dug

274
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:06,519
although you know ground up and planted

275
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:08,078
all these seeds and they came up I went

276
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:10,839
out like you know two months later

277
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:13,508
called the male's and then two months

278
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:18,329
later I had all these big beautiful

279
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:21,308
finished purplish bugs and very sticky

280
00:11:18,328 --> 00:11:23,828
impressive females that were ready like

281
00:11:21,308 --> 00:11:26,860
at the end of October you know

282
00:11:23,828 --> 00:11:28,568
relatively early for the cross so when I

283
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,669
reported back to cash that I had made

284
00:11:28,568 --> 00:11:33,278
that cross it was like that's amazing

285
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:34,719
like we don't usually get that result we

286
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:37,299
really have a hard time getting them to

287
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,670
flower fast enough to finish outdoors in

288
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:41,469
a climate like Connecticut he said

289
00:11:39,669 --> 00:11:43,539
that's you should hold on to those and I

290
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:44,860
didn't have any more or whatever and

291
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:47,019
then having met the woman who I

292
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:48,519
eventually married that she made me give

293
00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:51,610
it all up and I had to send the seeds

294
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:53,620
all back to s s SC back in Amsterdam and

295
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:56,199
didn't keep the cash of them for myself

296
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:58,750
other than a couple odd packs that were

297
00:11:56,198 --> 00:12:01,568
discovered by my wife and thrown out so

298
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:07,089
I had to start all over after our

299
00:12:01,568 --> 00:12:09,128
divorce say take us to the day when you

300
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:10,660
went to sensi small and found those

301
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:12,188
seeds was that during one of those

302
00:12:10,659 --> 00:12:16,629
answered in troops you just mentioned

303
00:12:12,188 --> 00:12:19,000
nope what it was then was I had been in

304
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:21,550
Belgium having gotten divorced from my

305
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:25,120
first wife and spent two years in

306
00:12:21,549 --> 00:12:27,008
Belgium I worked on contracts there as a

307
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,110
nuclear engineer for attractive L

308
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:30,419
company it's a civil engineering group

309
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:33,310
that does all of the

310
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:36,759
that type of work for the country that's

311
00:12:33,309 --> 00:12:39,188
a national establishment whatever so

312
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:41,800
while I was there I had met a Belgian

313
00:12:39,188 --> 00:12:44,078
girl we started living together and then

314
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:46,599
as my contract came to an end after two

315
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:48,638
years she proposed that if you're going

316
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,100
back to America because you have no work

317
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,318
permit here and can't continue to get a

318
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:55,540
job we could be married and you'd be

319
00:12:53,318 --> 00:12:59,078
able to do that either stay here or go

320
00:12:55,539 --> 00:13:01,328
back to America and I said okay hmm we

321
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:03,188
got married and I looked for work in

322
00:13:01,328 --> 00:13:05,198
Europe I like Europe I would like to

323
00:13:03,188 --> 00:13:07,328
have stayed but I did have that conflict

324
00:13:05,198 --> 00:13:09,609
of being a divorced dad and my children

325
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:11,588
were like three and six years old or

326
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:14,769
something too perhaps even a little bit

327
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:16,660
less like two and five and that was you

328
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:18,759
know pulling at my heartstrings and so

329
00:13:16,659 --> 00:13:23,049
in the end I didn't find suitable work

330
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:24,100
there I speak French now very well at

331
00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:26,409
that time it was a little bit

332
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,300
rudimentary you know so I think that

333
00:13:26,409 --> 00:13:30,370
probably in my interviews they felt like

334
00:13:28,299 --> 00:13:32,349
as French isn't really strong enough you

335
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:34,659
might not be able to you know keep up

336
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:37,629
and and what for whatever reason it

337
00:13:34,659 --> 00:13:39,370
didn't work so in the end the things

338
00:13:37,629 --> 00:13:41,680
that always seem to have happened in my

339
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:43,629
life fall in place well and a

340
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:45,399
disappointment in one place it's always

341
00:13:43,629 --> 00:13:48,069
like one door shutting while another

342
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:51,610
opens we had an opportunity to go to

343
00:13:48,068 --> 00:13:53,469
Boston and we did that and then before

344
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:55,528
leaving I knew that when I got there I

345
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:57,790
would want to be able to grow my own

346
00:13:55,528 --> 00:13:59,828
having gotten used to being able to get

347
00:13:57,789 --> 00:14:02,289
on a train and go up to Amsterdam or

348
00:13:59,828 --> 00:14:04,419
even just over the border in Breda I

349
00:14:02,289 --> 00:14:06,250
often go there just to save myself the

350
00:14:04,419 --> 00:14:08,528
trip of going all the way up to

351
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:11,769
Amsterdam but point being I would always

352
00:14:08,528 --> 00:14:13,688
have available smoke and of very high

353
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:15,519
quality I wouldn't necessarily be able

354
00:14:13,688 --> 00:14:17,318
to do that moving to bus and I had no

355
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,928
idea what the availability of good weed

356
00:14:17,318 --> 00:14:22,409
would be and my Belgian wife was

357
00:14:19,928 --> 00:14:26,889
something of a little bit you know

358
00:14:22,409 --> 00:14:28,629
reclusive introverted type and so a

359
00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:29,829
really appealed to her as well that oh

360
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:31,659
great you know you won't have to go out

361
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:33,489
on the street for your weed and I know

362
00:14:31,659 --> 00:14:34,899
you'll be home all the time taking care

363
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,519
of your plants and so on what a great

364
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:39,100
hobby for my husband you know it's such

365
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:43,360
so she was a very supportive wife and

366
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:45,278
after about two years living in Boston I

367
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,240
was doing the cannabis cultivation

368
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:50,828
full-time in supporting myself sending

369
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,448
child support back to my ex-wife and

370
00:14:50,828 --> 00:14:54,099
everything all from proceeds that I made

371
00:14:52,448 --> 00:14:56,500
in the basement of that home you know

372
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,449
and that felt great doing that but at

373
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,129
the same time was very stressful in the

374
00:14:58,448 --> 00:15:03,519
sense that if it had ever blown up but

375
00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:06,069
those at the time you know late 90s you

376
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,139
could do 20 25 years for cultivation in

377
00:15:06,068 --> 00:15:10,419
Boston and my wife would have had a

378
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:10,928
field day you know didn't alert the

379
00:15:10,419 --> 00:15:12,789
media

380
00:15:10,928 --> 00:15:14,860
you know my husband is a complete

381
00:15:12,789 --> 00:15:16,808
scandal look at this man you know

382
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:18,579
raising our children and having them

383
00:15:16,808 --> 00:15:23,289
every other weekend in this den of

384
00:15:18,578 --> 00:15:25,208
inequity you know so there was that

385
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:26,798
aspect of it it was stressful and I

386
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:29,078
think I said to you once before that I

387
00:15:26,798 --> 00:15:31,838
was also day-trading as most people were

388
00:15:29,078 --> 00:15:35,558
during like 99 and just stuff leading up

389
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:38,740
into 2000 I turned a $5,000 starting

390
00:15:35,558 --> 00:15:42,159
point with into about 55,000 and a year

391
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:45,009
and then lost about 25 of it as things

392
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:47,169
started to come down in March of 2000

393
00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:49,839
and then I just decided don't let any

394
00:15:47,169 --> 00:15:52,360
more go and save that we sold the house

395
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:55,299
right a little bit after 9/11 maybe

396
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,678
three four months later mmm and having

397
00:15:55,298 --> 00:15:59,528
done that we had some cash in our

398
00:15:56,678 --> 00:16:01,448
pockets and I had closed up everything

399
00:15:59,528 --> 00:16:03,548
from what I was doing with the Brothers

400
00:16:01,448 --> 00:16:05,979
Grimm operation in my basement and we

401
00:16:03,548 --> 00:16:07,419
moved back to Belgium with fair chunk of

402
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:09,639
money in our pockets

403
00:16:07,419 --> 00:16:12,308
and I thought I'd sit on my hands for a

404
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:14,230
little while and then maybe look for a

405
00:16:12,308 --> 00:16:16,509
place in Belgium where I'd have

406
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:19,360
greenhouse facilities indoor facilities

407
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:22,449
and such and restart up the company yeah

408
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:25,539
you may remember chip to Nirvana from

409
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:28,659
what was that company London direct the

410
00:16:25,539 --> 00:16:31,028
seeds direct UK I believe it was

411
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:33,159
whatever anyway a little dodgy kind of a

412
00:16:31,028 --> 00:16:34,958
dodgy character you know that's his

413
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:37,360
reputation and I found it to be a little

414
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:39,969
bit so as well when I met him we spent a

415
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,318
day hanging out maybe the weekend we may

416
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:43,298
have seen each other the next day -

417
00:16:41,318 --> 00:16:46,259
drove around a little bit visited some

418
00:16:43,298 --> 00:16:49,350
people Shanti Baba was one of them

419
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:51,568
mmm-hmm what was that woman's the woman

420
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:54,209
who does the hash in Amsterdam

421
00:16:51,568 --> 00:16:55,918
I always her name Mila Mila yeah and she

422
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:59,518
made the machine yeah yeah yeah the ice

423
00:16:55,918 --> 00:17:01,438
I know the isolator is her invention

424
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:05,669
she's touted to be the inventor of that

425
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:06,449
anyway met her lovely time there where

426
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:12,028
was I

427
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:14,669
incident yeah why was I there yeah so I

428
00:17:12,028 --> 00:17:16,169
I had come back as I say from Boston and

429
00:17:14,669 --> 00:17:17,639
I was trying to establish something

430
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:20,639
that's why I was up there talking to

431
00:17:17,638 --> 00:17:22,528
folks like Mila and gypsy Nirvana but

432
00:17:20,638 --> 00:17:24,178
nothing seemed to click they never felt

433
00:17:22,528 --> 00:17:25,888
comfortable that I'd be able to like get

434
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:29,100
the whole thing started again there and

435
00:17:25,888 --> 00:17:30,959
again went to sitting on my hands mode

436
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:33,269
and enjoyed Belgium and played guitar

437
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,579
for four hours a day and rode a bicycle

438
00:17:33,269 --> 00:17:38,460
two hours a day or was four hours a day

439
00:17:35,579 --> 00:17:40,980
or whatever rode with the bicycle clubs

440
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:42,480
on the weekends and so on and just

441
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,940
really had a great time you know I

442
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,528
firmed up my glenwood skills very much

443
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,570
so in that time you know people just

444
00:17:46,528 --> 00:17:51,450
assumed I spoke French and spoke French

445
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:53,519
full you know all the time so it was

446
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:55,889
pretty cool great experience for me and

447
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:57,509
then I came back to the United States at

448
00:17:55,888 --> 00:17:59,939
a certain moment after two years in

449
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:01,710
Belgium because of the children I said

450
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,808
you know the kids are crying on the

451
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:06,000
phone you know daddy's basically

452
00:18:03,808 --> 00:18:08,569
abandoned them and decided to go off and

453
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,849
live his selfish life in Europe you know

454
00:18:08,569 --> 00:18:13,200
satisfying his dreams [ __ ] us and I

455
00:18:11,849 --> 00:18:15,719
you know I just felt maybe they weren't

456
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,210
saying that you know obviously but felt

457
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,669
that way and I just felt very guilty and

458
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:23,519
I had been in this marriage more as

459
00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:25,379
convenience as you know we were in love

460
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:27,628
in a certain sense but there was also a

461
00:18:25,378 --> 00:18:29,638
limitation to that where when push came

462
00:18:27,628 --> 00:18:31,798
to shove we were at a fork in our

463
00:18:29,638 --> 00:18:33,808
existence where she couldn't return to

464
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:36,509
America because her parents were older

465
00:18:33,808 --> 00:18:38,730
and failing and needed her my children

466
00:18:36,509 --> 00:18:41,849
were young and developing and needing me

467
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:43,620
and so we had to sort of degree that I'm

468
00:18:41,849 --> 00:18:45,359
going back to America you've got to stay

469
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:48,119
here we'll see what happens

470
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:50,490
we stayed married on paper for the next

471
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:54,519
seven years and then finally decided

472
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:57,400
well let's put it on paper that were

473
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:59,410
not married anymore still great friends

474
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,180

and hello at Christmas and email and

476
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:06,880
what have you so that ended in an

477
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:11,460
amicable way and then during about the

478
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:14,380
next seven years in America I worked as

like and so that was how I was as a kid

492
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:44,440
and so when I went into sales I just

493
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:46,269
really enjoyed that whole razzle-dazzle

494
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,640
of you know getting the person

495
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:50,200
interested in having their kitchen done

496
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,390
and getting them excited about doing

497
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,759
closing the deal that was the way that

498
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:56,500
thing worked was you had to be in and

499
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:58,420
out of their home in three hours turn

500
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,519
and either they bought then or they

501
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:02,560
never would it was the one one call

502
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:04,389
close they called it got to be pretty

503
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,159
good at that they made me a manager and

504
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:09,220
put me in charge of you know the sales

505
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,900
team and so for about four or five years

506
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:13,329
I did that and then I was called back to

507
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:15,280
engineer and fellow called me up and

508
00:20:13,329 --> 00:20:18,069
said I found your resume on monster.com

509
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:20,349
you're a nuclear engineer blah blah blah

510
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:22,750
we are here in Boston and we really need

511
00:20:20,349 --> 00:20:25,719
a guy like you all right I'll come in an

512
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:29,920
interview got the job started working

513
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:32,890
for Arriva it's a French company mmm

514
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:35,289
finished with them after four years and

515
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:37,230
moved to New York City married a woman

516
00:20:35,289 --> 00:20:40,720
that I knew from high school having

517
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:42,610
reconnected through Facebook and after

518
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,210
four years of living in New York City

519
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:47,500
with her working as eventually

520
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:50,049
professional photographer as a sideline

521
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:53,440
job I did also work as a nuclear

522
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:55,990
engineer but in sales for a company

523
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,840
called high torque and after four years

524
00:20:55,990 --> 00:21:01,960
with them my job was basically phased

525
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:02,569
out they were changing their strategy on

526
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,730
how they do

527
00:21:02,569 --> 00:21:06,950
their sales and such and it wasn't

528
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:08,720
working for me and them anymore but it

529
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:10,548
was again a door closing that seemed

530
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,620
like a disappointing moment at the time

531
00:21:10,548 --> 00:21:15,548
and then a couple of months later I'm

532
00:21:12,619 --> 00:21:18,199
finding myself being swept back into

533
00:21:15,548 --> 00:21:20,538
cannabis cultivation and seed production

534
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:25,548
and reopening Brothers Grimm and being

535
00:21:20,538 --> 00:21:27,710
very excited at the realization that you

536
00:21:25,548 --> 00:21:29,720
know after all of Lading these years on

537
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:31,340
the sidelines and cheering along the

538
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,130
legalization that was happening in

539
00:21:31,339 --> 00:21:35,599
various states finally the two-by-four

540
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,980
slapped me on the side of the head and

541
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:38,719
said hey by the way you know if you were

542
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:40,819
to move to one of those states you may

543
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,379
well to restart your business and do

544
00:21:40,819 --> 00:21:45,558
what you really love to do as you're

545
00:21:42,378 --> 00:21:47,418
living and so having started to you know

546
00:21:45,558 --> 00:21:50,210
scratch the surface of reaching out to

547
00:21:47,419 --> 00:21:52,429
my old partners and friends and of

548
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:54,230
course lie to this day has never

549
00:21:52,429 --> 00:21:56,809
resurfaced I don't know what ever

550
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:59,089
happened to him hmm our working

551
00:21:56,808 --> 00:22:02,569
relationship was always pristine and we

552
00:21:59,089 --> 00:22:05,240
got along famously left everything on

553
00:22:02,569 --> 00:22:07,908
good terms but he's either lost interest

554
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,319
in this business or been killed or is in

555
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:11,870
prison or who knows you know what

556
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:13,730
happens to people but anyway the

557
00:22:11,869 --> 00:22:16,878
opportunity was to partner up with

558
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:20,599
someone who could be that other side of

559
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:22,519
Brothers Grimm Duke diamond and you know

560
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:25,278
I was connected to him through

561
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:27,919
sub-cooled and I took the chance on

562
00:22:25,278 --> 00:22:30,250
coming out and meeting and found that he

563
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:33,440
was beyond my expectations

564
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:36,259
excellent mate for me to do this

565
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,480
business and we slowly put it together

566
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:40,308
from the very early beginnings of

567
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,429
starting seeds that would be used to

568
00:22:40,308 --> 00:22:45,138
find the right males to cross to the

569
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:46,730
clones of genius and princess that I had

570
00:22:45,138 --> 00:22:49,699
recovered from the people who had been

571
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:51,679
holding them and you can imagine you

572
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:53,720
know wanting to have rooms full of

573
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:57,350
plants and making seeds you know great

574
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:59,808
guns and looking at this little 4x4 area

575
00:22:57,349 --> 00:23:01,878
you know lit by one lamp and like that's

576
00:22:59,808 --> 00:23:03,079
everything my pockets are empty I have

577
00:23:01,878 --> 00:23:07,069
everything right there in this little

578
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:07,490
4x4 area and that's got to throw and

579
00:23:07,069 --> 00:23:09,558
cross

580
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:12,130
or and multiply and become everything

581
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:14,960
though you know here we are a year later

582
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:18,170
and it's a full-blown you know seed

583
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:23,179
growing operation with we're in the

584
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:26,929
black and operating you know and with a

585
00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:28,759
future yeah and always planning to ramp

586
00:23:26,929 --> 00:23:32,120
things up from where we are and it's

587
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:35,529
growing at a great rate that it doesn't

588
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:39,109
seem inordinately fast or slow yeah

589
00:23:35,529 --> 00:23:41,420
organic just likely grow our plans so

590
00:23:39,109 --> 00:23:43,129
while you were a nuclear engineer among

591
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,960
other things how did you feel about

592
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,309
having this secret the whole time did

593
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,539
you feel like you were the anomaly or

594
00:23:46,308 --> 00:23:49,549
did you think that maybe there's another

595
00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:53,359
a nuclear engineer who's you know a mr.

596
00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:55,369
soll by nine that's a great question now

597
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:59,269
there's two answers to it really I think

598
00:23:55,369 --> 00:24:02,779
I through that whole time felt like yeah

599
00:23:59,269 --> 00:24:05,359
this is a secret not only from employers

600
00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:07,789
but I also felt in dating you know that

601
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:09,589
was always sort of the delicate at that

602
00:24:07,789 --> 00:24:13,250
time maybe it isn't so much today I'm

603
00:24:09,589 --> 00:24:17,359
now 57 years old so imagine when I'm 30

604
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:19,400
or you know 25 and yeah I have that

605
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:21,409
education yeah I'm in that profession

606
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:25,340
and when I'm out needing lemon or

607
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:28,308
something dropping that I also happen to

608
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:30,619
enjoy smoking cannabis you know in my

609
00:24:28,308 --> 00:24:33,649
free time on weekends and evenings I'm

610
00:24:30,619 --> 00:24:36,439
almost a daily smoker it could chase

611
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:40,519
away potentially interesting women and I

612
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:41,808
guess I should have realized that yeah

613
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:44,119
you know the right girls are gonna

614
00:24:41,808 --> 00:24:46,579
accept me for that and the hell with the

615
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:48,229
ones who don't you know but that was my

616
00:24:46,579 --> 00:24:50,269
mindset at the time and then with the

617
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:52,539
employer it was also like jeez I can't

618
00:24:50,269 --> 00:24:55,339
let my hair down and let them know that

619
00:24:52,539 --> 00:24:56,599
would be something that maybe I'm

620
00:24:55,339 --> 00:24:57,889
getting away with the fact that I'm

621
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:59,899
working for an employer who won't

622
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:03,220
randomly drug test me and I know I'm

623
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:06,350
safe there's no sense you know raising

624
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:08,210
you know an alarm to myself or calling

625
00:25:06,349 --> 00:25:12,109
any attention to it so I had to keep

626
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:15,980
that quiet so yeah there's that and to

627
00:25:12,109 --> 00:25:18,379
cap off that side of it I think that I

628
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:19,400
love this new expression I've come up

629
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:21,830
with where

630
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:23,720
the letters are the same number of

631
00:25:21,829 --> 00:25:27,289
letters and everything fits in place you

632
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:29,930
know pops is the new gay we're the ones

633
00:25:27,289 --> 00:25:31,940
coming out of the closet now you know so

634
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:36,950
I think that would make a great slogan

635
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:38,058
and this so I do that segues until your

636
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:40,250
other had the other half of your

637
00:25:38,058 --> 00:25:42,319
question feel that there are so many

638
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:45,079
people yeah who were in the closet

639
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:48,919
didn't reveal as I didn't that they were

640
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:51,199
cannabis aficionados in the closet you

641
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,670
know and that's all coming out and there

642
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,160
are statistics right now that I just

643
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:59,420
read the other day that the fastest

644
00:25:55,160 --> 00:26:00,950
growing cannabis consumption age group

645
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:03,470
is something like you know the baby

646
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:05,539
boomers you know or just my I'm a little

647
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:08,240
B little bit younger than baby boomer

648
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:11,289
age so they're saying like people of

649
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,910
fifty to sixty or something like that

650
00:26:11,289 --> 00:26:16,519
seventy-five that's the biggest most

651
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:18,050
burgeoning group of pot smokers because

652
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:19,759
they're all coming out of the closet and

653
00:26:18,049 --> 00:26:21,980
saying hey [ __ ] it man I've always

654
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:23,900
wanted a I've always enjoyed this I have

655
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:26,960
a lawyer who was a great friend of mine

656
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:28,850
who lives in Chicago who only revealed

657
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,200
to me like during this past year when he

658
00:26:28,849 --> 00:26:33,439
found out what I did and I was being

659
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:35,000
open about it I had come out he reached

660
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,308
out to me and said oh my god you know

661
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,200
I've been a path smoker since the 60s I

662
00:26:37,308 --> 00:26:41,029
loved really the good stuff I can see

663
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,100
from your pictures that you're posting

664
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:44,599
and so that you're amazing I didn't know

665
00:26:43,099 --> 00:26:46,069
about your whole history you know that

666
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:47,480
we've been friends you know on and off

667
00:26:46,069 --> 00:26:49,308
over the years but we lost touch for a

668
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,019
really long time and he's like so you're

669
00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:54,170
mister soul it's amazing you know said

670
00:26:51,019 --> 00:26:56,210
and in the end you know I send him some

671
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:58,340
samples and he smokes and when he's like

672
00:26:56,210 --> 00:27:00,799
I can't use writing back to me I cannot

673
00:26:58,339 --> 00:27:02,599
believe this amazing you make better

674
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:05,359
marijuana than I've ever smoked in my

675
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:09,889
life you know like oh you know the whole

676
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:13,519
thing like we are so it's wonderful to

677
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:14,809
have that sort of openness now I do feel

678
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:15,960
like you know coming it's like a

679
00:27:14,808 --> 00:27:17,490
coming-out and

680
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,220
and it's a great feeling especially

681
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:21,900
being open about the company and I'm

682
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:26,100
proud of everything I've ever done with

683
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:27,870
Brothers Grimm and to have not done what

684
00:27:26,099 --> 00:27:31,019
I just recently did oaktree open the

685
00:27:27,869 --> 00:27:34,139
company and pull this back to the Future

686
00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:36,329
thing I would have always felt like you

687
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:39,420
have to understand we'd go to cocktail

688
00:27:36,329 --> 00:27:41,519
parties or be at friends homes and this

689
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:43,259
story would be trotted out by my wife or

690
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:44,519
some friend you know you know that you

691
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:46,410
know wreck Harry

692
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:49,379
famous in the cannabis world he used to

693
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:51,420
be this world famous breeder he created

694
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:53,850
the strain Cinderella 99 and you know

695
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:55,529
that's really alien but you know it was

696
00:27:53,849 --> 00:27:57,299
making me feel like a has-been

697
00:27:55,529 --> 00:27:59,430
I don't want to hear these stories and

698
00:27:57,299 --> 00:28:02,279
I'm not doing it anymore it's like oh

699
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:05,430
yeah you know don't trot that old story

700
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:07,410
come on you know it's like I talked

701
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:09,180
about what I do now you know and I'm a

702
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:11,009
photographic artist I'm having

703
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:13,560
exhibitions in New York City and to do

704
00:28:11,009 --> 00:28:16,049
that you know forget the pot thing but

705
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:18,389
then there was this excellent segue

706
00:28:16,049 --> 00:28:21,240
between that last job and before I came

707
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:23,190
out here to Colorado which was that a

708
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:27,180
friend of my wife's having heard that

709
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:30,059
old story you know about me and he was

710
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:31,560
on vacation talking to a fellow who she

711
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:32,909
had met two couples you know on the

712
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:34,379
beach night let's have dinner or drinks

713
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:36,870
or whatever later on they started

714
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:39,780
talking about their lives the guy says I

715
00:28:36,869 --> 00:28:42,689
work as the operations manager for tweed

716
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:47,190
she says what's tweet-tweet is a company

717
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:48,960
in Canada that is the sole producer of

718
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:51,240
all the medical marijuana that is

719
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,799
consumed in the entire country they are

720
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:55,799
the one official source that the

721
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:59,940
government says is at least that's what

722
00:28:55,799 --> 00:29:02,730
I believe the arrangement is so he hears

723
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:04,920
through her little story about mr. Stoll

724
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:07,110
and who I am and she's friends with my

725
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:08,460
wife and he says I'd love to interview

726
00:29:07,109 --> 00:29:11,669
the guy you know we would probably want

727
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:13,590
to employ him she says really I'll find

728
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:15,810
out if he's ok with you calling him so

729
00:29:13,589 --> 00:29:17,730
she did and I said ok he calls me we

730
00:29:15,809 --> 00:29:19,589
have a conversation he says we're gonna

731
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:22,710
get you tickets and fly you up here I

732
00:29:19,589 --> 00:29:25,148
flew up I spent a day touring the

733
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:27,579
facility talking to the master grower

734
00:29:25,148 --> 00:29:29,998
all of the other you know people yeah

735
00:29:27,579 --> 00:29:33,189
yeah they have a master grower there in

736
00:29:29,999 --> 00:29:35,200
the interview went really well everybody

737
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:37,210
liked each other and I felt like you

738
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,469
know the guy wants me and he told me he

739
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:40,058
wanted me for the job they were

740
00:29:38,469 --> 00:29:41,619
considering some other people a woman

741
00:29:40,058 --> 00:29:43,088
included who had come from an entirely

742
00:29:41,618 --> 00:29:46,388
different background they were looking

743
00:29:43,088 --> 00:29:48,700
for an operation of cultivation manager

744
00:29:46,388 --> 00:29:52,508
that would be the boss of this fellow

745
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:54,999
who would be the master grower and he

746
00:29:52,509 --> 00:29:57,128
told me about a month later that okay

747
00:29:54,999 --> 00:29:58,960
management made a decision to go with

748
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:00,668
somebody who was more immediately

749
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,338
available even if they didn't have the

750
00:30:00,669 --> 00:30:05,080
cannabis specific experience due to the

751
00:30:03,338 --> 00:30:06,848
fact that our lawyers are saying it'd

752
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:08,319
take us a lot of time to immigrate you

753
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:09,548
into Canada and blah blah blah we

754
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:10,658
haven't even made you an offer you may

755
00:30:09,548 --> 00:30:12,460
very well say you don't want to move to

756
00:30:10,659 --> 00:30:14,320
Canada and I said yeah you know you're

757
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:16,778
doing the right thing it's cool I see

758
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:19,118
what's happening here he said but we are

759
00:30:16,778 --> 00:30:21,159
really interested in another side idea

760
00:30:19,118 --> 00:30:25,478
which would be to license the Brothers

761
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:27,489
Grimm name on products like if we were

762
00:30:25,479 --> 00:30:29,200
to produce Cinderella 99 and we could

763
00:30:27,489 --> 00:30:31,960
say that you know it's bonafide and

764
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,119
licensed by Brothers Grimm and I thought

765
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:36,038
that's brilliant sure let's talk about

766
00:30:34,118 --> 00:30:38,019
that whenever you're comfortable he let

767
00:30:36,038 --> 00:30:39,819
that sit on the back burner way too long

768
00:30:38,019 --> 00:30:42,098
and after like four months went by and

769
00:30:39,819 --> 00:30:44,259
then in touch once a month or so and

770
00:30:42,098 --> 00:30:45,848
yeah yeah well right now we can't and

771
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:48,519
there are you know these nuts is okay

772
00:30:45,848 --> 00:30:50,288
look I'm gonna have to let that whole

773
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:53,138
thing go I wrote him an email and said

774
00:30:50,288 --> 00:30:55,658
look that's not gonna move forward I

775
00:30:53,138 --> 00:30:57,338
feel and I am gonna relocate to Colorado

776
00:30:55,659 --> 00:31:00,099
I'm gonna reopen the company Brothers

777
00:30:57,338 --> 00:31:02,079
Grimm and I will not probably be

778
00:31:00,098 --> 00:31:03,460
interested in that right away but down

779
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:06,668
the road we could talk about it what

780
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:08,108
have you but the seed that that put in

781
00:31:06,669 --> 00:31:10,960
my mind of you know this was a

782
00:31:08,108 --> 00:31:12,398
possibility I could return to being mr.

783
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,278
soll and running Brothers Grimm again

784
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:17,168
and just based on having been

785
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:19,538
interviewed by them and the little

786
00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:22,629
lightbulb went on in my head and as the

787
00:31:19,538 --> 00:31:25,569
one door was closing with the job with

788
00:31:22,628 --> 00:31:29,168
high torque as an engineer there I saw

789
00:31:25,569 --> 00:31:30,788
that well I either dig deep and try to

790
00:31:29,169 --> 00:31:32,169
continue being a photographer in New

791
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:34,658
York City and

792
00:31:32,169 --> 00:31:38,710
potential is not that great photography

793
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:43,059
and photographers are starting to go

794
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:45,548
into a very it's also ubiquitous just

795
00:31:43,058 --> 00:31:47,918
like music you know pay for like $15

796
00:31:45,548 --> 00:31:49,629
albums anymore you download music for

797
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:52,299
next to nothing same things happening

798
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:53,830
with images and photography and so many

799
00:31:52,298 --> 00:31:56,470
people are taking so many wonderful

800
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:58,210
pictures with the technology that's

801
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:59,319
available and the information that's

802
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:01,750
available to become a better

803
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:05,079
photographer so much faster imagine if

804
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:07,179
you are learning photography now you're

805
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:10,109
able to immediately see the results of

806
00:32:07,179 --> 00:32:13,179
every picture you take that's a huge

807
00:32:10,109 --> 00:32:14,798
biofeedback mechanism that was absent in

808
00:32:13,179 --> 00:32:17,350
the days of film when I was learning

809
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:19,000
photography in the 80s and I had to wait

810
00:32:17,349 --> 00:32:20,740
until I went to a drug store and dropped

811
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,880
off a roll of film and got it several

812
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:25,599
days later to figure out what I did

813
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:28,059
wrong a week ago it's akin to you're a

814
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:30,638
musician if you had been forced to learn

815
00:32:28,058 --> 00:32:33,609
how to play guitar by having ear plugs

816
00:32:30,638 --> 00:32:36,969
in your ears and recording your lessons

817
00:32:33,609 --> 00:32:40,148
while you played by sight and then later

818
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:42,278
had to listen back to them but not right

819
00:32:40,148 --> 00:32:43,959
away that was only after you brought the

820
00:32:42,278 --> 00:32:45,220
tape down and had it processed and got

821
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,960
it back a week later and then you could

822
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:49,298
figure out what the you're doing right

823
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,909
now that lack of immediate biofeedback

824
00:32:49,298 --> 00:32:53,288
would slow down the learning process and

825
00:32:51,909 --> 00:32:54,970
extend advice is such a great amount of

826
00:32:53,288 --> 00:32:56,980
time that's what was happening to us as

827
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:59,429
you know burgeoning photographers of

828
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:02,919
those days now I've seen guys where

829
00:32:59,429 --> 00:33:03,970
they've had two years experienced as a

830
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:05,950
photographer and they're taking

831
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:08,169
professional level amazing pictures

832
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:10,179
because they paid attention and tried to

833
00:33:08,169 --> 00:33:12,700
educate themself with all of the

834
00:33:10,179 --> 00:33:14,710
available videos on YouTube and

835
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:18,278
information from other sources that they

836
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:20,259
can just immediately learn how to create

837
00:33:18,278 --> 00:33:23,079
a great image and kind of master the

838
00:33:20,259 --> 00:33:26,589
technology of their own camera and light

839
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:29,349
and everything else so price of that is

840
00:33:26,589 --> 00:33:32,678
all going down wow I went a long way off

841
00:33:29,349 --> 00:33:34,418
on a tangent to explain why I didn't

842
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:36,669
decide to stay in New York and stay a

843
00:33:34,419 --> 00:33:38,769
photographer well have you ever

844
00:33:36,669 --> 00:33:39,080
considered like moving your passion over

845
00:33:38,769 --> 00:33:40,788
to

846
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:42,288
photography yeah yeah yeah I mean that's

847
00:33:40,788 --> 00:33:44,298
happening actually you know there was an

848
00:33:42,288 --> 00:33:47,589
immediate need for me to be able to take

849
00:33:44,298 --> 00:33:50,839
pictures and transmit what we're doing

850
00:33:47,589 --> 00:33:53,629
visually on Instagram and other medium

851
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:55,009
you know social media and old and I

852
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:56,750
thought is a comment from you and not

853
00:33:55,009 --> 00:33:58,490
Duke well no don't

854
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:59,778
he's amazing do you know most of his

855
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:02,870
pictures have been done with his cell

856
00:33:59,778 --> 00:34:05,240
phone until very recently and I just

857
00:34:02,869 --> 00:34:06,648
think you know I showed him like here

858
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,659
here's where the sliders are on

859
00:34:06,648 --> 00:34:10,098
Instagram one day and then I never said

860
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:12,079
another word to him and immediately

861
00:34:10,099 --> 00:34:15,039
started doing like really great pictures

862
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:17,929
and moving the you know controls around

863
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:19,969
but yeah I would never it's not a

864
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:21,858
competition mate this is how I look at

865
00:34:19,969 --> 00:34:23,569
everything in life it's like we're all

866
00:34:21,858 --> 00:34:25,338
colleagues and we're all unique and

867
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:27,320
we're all trying to do our own thing I

868
00:34:25,338 --> 00:34:29,269
don't want to make comparison so you

869
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,460
know who Jack Kerouac is the writer at

870
00:34:29,269 --> 00:34:35,869
American writer did on the road in his

871
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:39,108
book the car doctor Dharma bums there's

872
00:34:35,869 --> 00:34:43,159
one character who says comparisons are

873
00:34:39,108 --> 00:34:45,259
odious yeah that's true you know like

874
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:46,909
we're all doing our own thing so

875
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:50,480
everybody's got their own scene it's not

876
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:53,389
a competition they know so again with

877
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:57,289
the photography it did it did a parlay

878
00:34:53,389 --> 00:35:00,440
right into an immediate it became an

879
00:34:57,289 --> 00:35:03,349
immediate benefit to me to be able to do

880
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:05,300
that I looked at my Instagram feed today

881
00:35:03,349 --> 00:35:07,460
and thought to myself yeah you know it

882
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:10,160
just dawns on me that's good that I've

883
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:12,139
been able to produce good images of what

884
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:14,029
we're doing and make nice artistic

885
00:35:12,139 --> 00:35:15,949
sometimes and sometimes just very you

886
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:18,920
know this is what it is just so you can

887
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:20,629
see the reality of what it is so yeah I

888
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,639
have been able to play around with my

889
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:24,440
style of photography and adapting that

890
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:25,029
to taking pictures of cannabis rather

891
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:27,789
than

892
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:30,220
you know architecture and cityscapes

893
00:35:27,789 --> 00:35:32,199
which is what I used to do so if we

894
00:35:30,219 --> 00:35:34,719
title back in mm-hm I guess my question

895
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:36,579
would be if you knew that things would

896
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:38,529
go the way they have would you have

897
00:35:36,579 --> 00:35:41,889
considered coming back sooner Oh totally

898
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:44,650
but remember even two years ago Colorado

899
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:46,000
had just started to have legalization

900
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:49,030
and I don't know if any other states

901
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,489
were quite so accessible in terms would

902
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:53,080
be a good enough place to live in terms

903
00:35:51,489 --> 00:35:57,789
of creature comforts and where I would

904
00:35:53,079 --> 00:36:00,639
want to be and also have the ability to

905
00:35:57,789 --> 00:36:03,250
grow with basically you know an impunity

906
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:05,139
that I had never experienced before and

907
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:08,590
that could feel comfortable doing it

908
00:36:05,139 --> 00:36:10,059
openly as we are so yeah I mean if all

909
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:14,019
the conditions had been right I would

910
00:36:10,059 --> 00:36:15,969
have done it or earlier I had gotten a

911
00:36:14,019 --> 00:36:18,759
mindset over the years that yeah you

912
00:36:15,969 --> 00:36:22,409
know I don't think the numbers work and

913
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:25,870
so on but as I started to explore it and

914
00:36:22,409 --> 00:36:27,489
legalization had been running for some

915
00:36:25,869 --> 00:36:29,799
time then I did see that

916
00:36:27,489 --> 00:36:33,579
oh okay other people are showing me how

917
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:35,890
this would work as a seed company and it

918
00:36:33,579 --> 00:36:38,679
could be profitable whereas I had never

919
00:36:35,889 --> 00:36:41,949
really considered the seed money being

920
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:43,839
enough to live on as it wasn't back in

921
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:47,049
the day when I was in doing this in my

922
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:49,750
basement in Boston the most of the money

923
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:52,390
I made was through a contact I had in

924
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:55,150
southern Massachusetts who would take

925
00:36:52,389 --> 00:36:58,359
pounds of high-grade weed from me and I

926
00:36:55,150 --> 00:37:00,730
was breeding for you know growing good

927
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:03,120
sinsemilla to send to this guy and make

928
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:05,679
my rent every month and pay the bills

929
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:07,869
whereas the seed money was an occasional

930
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:10,329
pop that came from Canada that was like

931
00:37:07,869 --> 00:37:11,980
oh that's nice to have that extra a few

932
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:13,509
thousand dollars or whatever it happened

933
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:17,980
to be might have been as much as fifteen

934
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:19,600
at a time or so but I didn't think that

935
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:22,630
there was a way to make a living but as

936
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:25,869
I say you know it was shown to me no no

937
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:27,430
it works so yeah here we are and like I

938
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:28,338
said we were able to pay the bills every

939
00:37:27,429 --> 00:37:31,248
month and

940
00:37:28,338 --> 00:37:32,748
what we love so pretty happy with the

941
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:35,778
way things are going so when we think

942
00:37:32,748 --> 00:37:37,548
back to the initial incarnation a lot of

943
00:37:35,778 --> 00:37:39,528
growers and breeders alike think of it

944
00:37:37,548 --> 00:37:41,088
as this golden area you know you had the

945
00:37:39,528 --> 00:37:43,099
original Brothers Grimm people like

946
00:37:41,088 --> 00:37:45,858
Tommy Hill and big high releasing

947
00:37:43,099 --> 00:37:48,259
strains did you ever realize that you're

948
00:37:45,858 --> 00:37:50,630
a part of a age that would be looked

949
00:37:48,259 --> 00:37:53,239
back on with you know this kind of

950
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:55,400
reminiscent envy or did it just feel

951
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:58,909
like same old same old at the time this

952
00:37:55,400 --> 00:38:01,700
is again you know with the experience of

953
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:04,098
my age and so on I've come across things

954
00:38:01,699 --> 00:38:06,919
where I can answer that pretty simply

955
00:38:04,099 --> 00:38:09,259
because everybody who's ever gone

956
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:11,239
through this can can relate to there's a

957
00:38:09,259 --> 00:38:14,599
quote by I can't remember exactly who to

958
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:17,749
attribute it to but he said one never

959
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:21,229
knows when one is making history so it's

960
00:38:17,748 --> 00:38:23,298
like while you're making history you're

961
00:38:21,228 --> 00:38:24,978
just doing it you're not thinking you're

962
00:38:23,298 --> 00:38:27,768
making history and then you look back

963
00:38:24,978 --> 00:38:29,389
and you realize how I made history so

964
00:38:27,768 --> 00:38:32,629
there's your answer I guess it's

965
00:38:29,389 --> 00:38:34,400
universal it's not you yet it to me but

966
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:35,989
it fits I feel that that's a good

967
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:39,229
response for myself as well as being

968
00:38:35,989 --> 00:38:42,528
sort of universal responsible awesome

969
00:38:39,228 --> 00:38:44,449
so one of those things I always noticed

970
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:46,548
in also you know really kind of praised

971
00:38:44,449 --> 00:38:48,889
the original release of Cindy was was

972
00:38:46,548 --> 00:38:51,588
that when you did the original Cindy

973
00:38:48,889 --> 00:38:53,960
there wasn't really many cubing projects

974
00:38:51,588 --> 00:38:55,909
going on and I always wondered where did

975
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:58,219
you get the idea to do a cube it's it's

976
00:38:55,909 --> 00:38:59,759
even today not many people think of it

977
00:38:58,219 --> 00:39:01,889
as a breeding project a lot of nibbler

978
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,930
to F Long's yeah how did you find out

979
00:39:01,889 --> 00:39:07,500
about what would be regarded as a fairly

980
00:39:03,929 --> 00:39:09,899
advanced breeding idea nobody I know at

981
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:11,608
that time were had ever heard of or I

982
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:15,090
don't think anybody has ever claimed to

983
00:39:11,608 --> 00:39:17,069
be have been doing a breeding project

984
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:18,990
that involved cubing or was cubing

985
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:21,570
anything at that time I think I was the

986
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:24,929
first person to actually actively take

987
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:28,920
that idea and run with it he just felt

988
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:31,799
that I read an article once in a High

989
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:34,680
Times Magazine that alluded to that

990
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:36,539
process and it seemed like nobody ever

991
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:39,118
talked about it or no one ever really

992
00:39:36,539 --> 00:39:42,659
noticed it but it piqued my interest and

993
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:45,900
I said huh it may sound simplistic but

994
00:39:42,659 --> 00:39:49,379
each time a male and female mate the

995
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:56,269
children get 50% of the mother and

996
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:58,590
father and and humans and mammals and

997
00:39:56,269 --> 00:40:01,349
that live on a timeline that's

998
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:03,420
continuous whereas cannabis can be

999
00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:07,349
brought back in time and forward in time

1000
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:09,269
if you will by taking a clone from a

1001
00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:11,519
female plant that's being kept in a

1002
00:40:09,269 --> 00:40:14,400
vegetative state it's as though time is

1003
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:17,009
being made to stand still there and then

1004
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:20,070
you can take cuttings from that female

1005
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:22,800
and do any kind of breeding and growing

1006
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:28,640
with them that you like and then the

1007
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:31,710
offspring of say a male of that

1008
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:34,559
generation being bred back to the

1009
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:37,349
original female if you think about it

1010
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:40,139
it's already got 50% of that of his

1011
00:40:37,349 --> 00:40:43,789
mother's genes so if we take a boy from

1012
00:40:40,139 --> 00:40:46,559
the first generation he's already half

1013
00:40:43,789 --> 00:40:48,980
p-princess let's say from the cubing

1014
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:53,219
process I did to make Cinderella 99 and

1015
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:56,219
she's contributing again half of her pea

1016
00:40:53,219 --> 00:40:59,429
to the mix that becomes the the children

1017
00:40:56,219 --> 00:41:02,489
of that cross so having half of her

1018
00:40:59,429 --> 00:41:04,739
already he can contribute only 25% so

1019
00:41:02,489 --> 00:41:07,649
there he's contributed 25% she always

1020
00:41:04,739 --> 00:41:12,058
contributes 50% so each time you're

1021
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:15,059
hitting 25% plus the 50% that

1022
00:41:12,059 --> 00:41:18,989
generations going to have 75% so then

1023
00:41:15,059 --> 00:41:22,589
half of 75% is like 37.5 so you get

1024
00:41:18,989 --> 00:41:24,179
round it you get a P 88 generation and

1025
00:41:22,588 --> 00:41:26,849
then if you do the P 88 generation

1026
00:41:24,179 --> 00:41:31,318
you're adding 44 and 50 so now you're at

1027
00:41:26,849 --> 00:41:33,920
94% P if you will sounds simplistic

1028
00:41:31,318 --> 00:41:37,558
there's probably some flaws to the whole

1029
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:39,930
process right hmm however if you're

1030
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:42,329
careful about the male selection each

1031
00:41:39,929 --> 00:41:45,328
time it's almost like you're doing a

1032
00:41:42,329 --> 00:41:47,068
little bit of guidance like f2 to f3 f4

1033
00:41:45,329 --> 00:41:49,469
and such when you're guiding those

1034
00:41:47,068 --> 00:41:52,708
generations you're also choosing which

1035
00:41:49,469 --> 00:41:56,579
plants to mate each generation so I had

1036
00:41:52,708 --> 00:42:00,808
in each generation of P 88 p94 in such

1037
00:41:56,579 --> 00:42:03,749
the males that would resemble princess

1038
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:05,880
was my simplistic way of looking at okay

1039
00:42:03,748 --> 00:42:08,488
the more it resembles the female the

1040
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:10,619
more this one is carrying that trait and

1041
00:42:08,489 --> 00:42:12,298
each time it did seem to make

1042
00:42:10,619 --> 00:42:15,689
improvements and bring the plant more

1043
00:42:12,298 --> 00:42:19,759
toward the princess however I did want

1044
00:42:15,688 --> 00:42:24,719
to choose four more larger branches

1045
00:42:19,759 --> 00:42:26,278
bigger colas sweeter flavors more

1046
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:28,528
pleasing high rather than the

1047
00:42:26,278 --> 00:42:30,208
devastating knocked you down kind of

1048
00:42:28,528 --> 00:42:31,679
high from the original princess you've

1049
00:42:30,208 --> 00:42:32,009
been smoking a little bit of a bit

1050
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:36,358
lately

1051
00:42:32,009 --> 00:42:39,568
yeah so when you started the cubing

1052
00:42:36,358 --> 00:42:44,130
process we know now that you use the

1053
00:42:39,568 --> 00:42:45,358
shiva skunk as the original email why

1054
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:47,640
did you choose that and were you

1055
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:50,788
considering any others no I

1056
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:53,098
mmm I had two choices in my mind I could

1057
00:42:50,789 --> 00:42:56,219
choose a very similar plant and use a

1058
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:58,109
brother and then more likelihood that

1059
00:42:56,219 --> 00:42:59,639
some family genes are already in the

1060
00:42:58,108 --> 00:43:02,848
male side and you wouldn't have to back

1061
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:05,129
cross this far but then it would meet

1062
00:43:02,849 --> 00:43:09,630
Lee leave me a little more confused as

1063
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:12,059
to how to choose where I'm getting away

1064
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:13,528
from the male side the original male

1065
00:43:12,059 --> 00:43:16,140
side and getting more and more toward

1066
00:43:13,528 --> 00:43:17,670
just the princess qualities so I felt

1067
00:43:16,139 --> 00:43:18,989
the other option was to go with

1068
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:20,938
something that was so obviously

1069
00:43:18,989 --> 00:43:23,208
different that every generation I'd be

1070
00:43:20,938 --> 00:43:26,969
able to sort of culluh way the

1071
00:43:23,208 --> 00:43:29,308
skunky side of it and go more toward the

1072
00:43:26,969 --> 00:43:31,019
princess phenotypes and see that the

1073
00:43:29,309 --> 00:43:34,109
females in each generation we're also

1074
00:43:31,018 --> 00:43:36,598
producing better and better quality with

1075
00:43:34,108 --> 00:43:38,639
the sweeter flavors the larger coal is

1076
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:41,309
the larger branches and more structure

1077
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:43,708
than princess had so princess turns out

1078
00:43:41,309 --> 00:43:46,319
to be more valuable plant as a breeding

1079
00:43:43,708 --> 00:43:49,440
female than she would be in terms of

1080
00:43:46,318 --> 00:43:54,389
just growing that for people consumers

1081
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:56,999
to want to buy that bud so some people

1082
00:43:54,389 --> 00:43:59,458
would argue that genius is almost as

1083
00:43:56,998 --> 00:44:00,988
valuable as a plant as princess in terms

1084
00:43:59,458 --> 00:44:03,419
of the strains that they've gone to

1085
00:44:00,989 --> 00:44:05,548
create so if you ever considered doing a

1086
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:07,858
similar cubing project with genius I

1087
00:44:05,548 --> 00:44:10,650
didn't have time I ran out of time back

1088
00:44:07,858 --> 00:44:12,748
in the day and now I can do so I might

1089
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:16,769
there's your answer I mean it's likely

1090
00:44:12,748 --> 00:44:19,228
you know I think that having done the

1091
00:44:16,768 --> 00:44:22,858
green Avenger we really got sort of a

1092
00:44:19,228 --> 00:44:26,639
plant that was so much beefier and more

1093
00:44:22,858 --> 00:44:29,818
compact and easier to grow and he still

1094
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:33,088
had the flavor and the mind the the

1095
00:44:29,818 --> 00:44:35,009
psychoactivity of genius so right right

1096
00:44:33,088 --> 00:44:37,469
there with green Avenger we sort of hit

1097
00:44:35,009 --> 00:44:40,739
on a nice what would be a seed form of

1098
00:44:37,469 --> 00:44:42,900
genius but with many improvements but if

1099
00:44:40,739 --> 00:44:47,159
you were to try to go and get somebody

1100
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:48,630
the genius in seed form thing I kind of

1101
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:52,469
questioned the value of it you know I

1102
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:57,449
don't know I want to I think we've

1103
00:44:52,469 --> 00:45:01,048
improved it yeah yeah so who died that

1104
00:44:57,449 --> 00:45:05,249
valuable as a breeding female yeah

1105
00:45:01,048 --> 00:45:07,228
so have you got any rough ideas as to

1106
00:45:05,248 --> 00:45:09,328
what might have been the mail which

1107
00:45:07,228 --> 00:45:12,909
pollinated the jack arrow which to end

1108
00:45:09,329 --> 00:45:16,839
up creating the princess genius

1109
00:45:12,909 --> 00:45:20,559
I would like to say from everything that

1110
00:45:16,838 --> 00:45:22,750
I've seen now in the past year or so of

1111
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:24,460
observing more plants of different

1112
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:27,219
varieties that are available for me to

1113
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:29,349
observe than I ever had before I've now

1114
00:45:27,219 --> 00:45:31,568
got a much better handle on where before

1115
00:45:29,349 --> 00:45:33,838
I said look it's whatever I don't know

1116
00:45:31,568 --> 00:45:37,269
like really I wouldn't like to even

1117
00:45:33,838 --> 00:45:38,949
throw out a guess because it's just

1118
00:45:37,269 --> 00:45:40,809
meaningless to guess isn't it you know

1119
00:45:38,949 --> 00:45:43,389
so today

1120
00:45:40,809 --> 00:45:46,029
having seen the structure of Jack Herer

1121
00:45:43,389 --> 00:45:48,809
sorry having seen the structure of a

1122
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:52,990
Durbin pure Durbin and knowing that

1123
00:45:48,809 --> 00:45:54,969
super sativa seed club and sensi you

1124
00:45:52,989 --> 00:45:56,858
know they all worked with some Durbin

1125
00:45:54,969 --> 00:45:58,959
and it's likely they may have had some

1126
00:45:56,858 --> 00:46:01,179
Durbin pollen floating around in just a

1127
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:03,929
few you know that like I said that bud

1128
00:46:01,179 --> 00:46:06,399
that I broke open and since he smile

1129
00:46:03,929 --> 00:46:09,699
which I have to return to that story by

1130
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:12,039
the way was mostly but I mean it really

1131
00:46:09,699 --> 00:46:14,139
didn't have more than six seeds in it

1132
00:46:12,039 --> 00:46:16,239
and I mean it was a reasonable size bag

1133
00:46:14,139 --> 00:46:19,239
that you get from an Amsterdam coffee

1134
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:22,779
shop and the reason I was there just to

1135
00:46:19,239 --> 00:46:24,608
finish that story was before leaving and

1136
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:27,700
knowing that I would want to grow weed

1137
00:46:24,608 --> 00:46:29,619
in America when we got to Boston we went

1138
00:46:27,699 --> 00:46:31,419
to Amsterdam specifically to go buy a

1139
00:46:29,619 --> 00:46:34,930
bunch of seeds and I went in the sensi

1140
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:37,480
shop right next to the right nearby the

1141
00:46:34,929 --> 00:46:40,389
hash Museum on that little canal there

1142
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:43,929
and I bought a few packs of seeds and

1143
00:46:40,389 --> 00:46:46,989
one of them being the especially the

1144
00:46:43,929 --> 00:46:51,909
skunk yeah and a couple of others mm-hmm

1145
00:46:46,989 --> 00:46:53,618
and lo and behold after having bought

1146
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:55,659
the seeds you know we want to get a cup

1147
00:46:53,619 --> 00:46:56,890
of coffee and go smoke the joint or

1148
00:46:55,659 --> 00:46:58,480
something that's how I ended up in the

1149
00:46:56,889 --> 00:47:01,629
sense he smiled just to finish the recap

1150
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:04,630
that little missing did that did you

1151
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:06,390
ever after having popped the seeds get

1152
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:08,880
the urge to go back to senses

1153
00:47:06,389 --> 00:47:12,538
and try to now that was just such a

1154
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:14,400
chance thing that you know find a

1155
00:47:12,539 --> 00:47:15,809
hundred dollar bill you know in a

1156
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,430
parking lot you don't go back there

1157
00:47:15,809 --> 00:47:20,039
everyday walking the parking lot looking

1158
00:47:17,429 --> 00:47:22,169
for dollar bills but it was really was

1159
00:47:20,039 --> 00:47:23,609
just an off thing that hey great but I

1160
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:25,318
did coincidentally I don't think I've

1161
00:47:23,608 --> 00:47:28,288
ever told anybody this story but when I

1162
00:47:25,318 --> 00:47:29,969
came back a few days after having gone

1163
00:47:28,289 --> 00:47:31,920
on that little sojourn and bought the

1164
00:47:29,969 --> 00:47:33,389
seeds I thought well the ones that came

1165
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,460
out of that but just for the hell of it

1166
00:47:33,389 --> 00:47:37,588
I'll try to germinate a couple and grow

1167
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:39,510
and see what they looked like before we

1168
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:41,099
leave we had another week or so or a

1169
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:43,109
month before we were going to leave

1170
00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:45,200
we had a balcony and a little you know

1171
00:47:43,108 --> 00:47:47,670
space there I could set a pot out and

1172
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:49,469
two or three of those seeds popped up

1173
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:51,119
and grew and I ended up having to call

1174
00:47:49,469 --> 00:47:52,739
them just before leaving and just like

1175
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:54,480
you know yeah they seemed to be healthy

1176
00:47:52,739 --> 00:47:59,328
and they grew well who knows what they

1177
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:59,329
could have been you know I don't know

1178
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:05,190
well every good story has to have that

1179
00:48:02,789 --> 00:48:08,210
low moment you know for us to crawl out

1180
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:10,798
of them become champions at the end okay

1181
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:12,599
so that wasn't such a low moment at all

1182
00:48:10,798 --> 00:48:14,429
because I still did have you know four

1183
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:15,960
to six seeds left that I brought to

1184
00:48:14,429 --> 00:48:17,818
America and when I ended up German

1185
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:19,349
everything from the packets as well as

1186
00:48:17,818 --> 00:48:22,528
those freebie seeds that rolled out of

1187
00:48:19,349 --> 00:48:24,088
my weed in this coffee shop they turned

1188
00:48:22,528 --> 00:48:27,750
out to have been the stars you know

1189
00:48:24,088 --> 00:48:29,400
weirdly enough and you know I don't

1190
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:31,619
recommend to people as you know today to

1191
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:33,358
buy seeds that have a lot of variety and

1192
00:48:31,619 --> 00:48:34,890
you know be on Fino hunts you know

1193
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:37,828
you're causing yourself a lot of

1194
00:48:34,889 --> 00:48:39,629
unnecessary work I feel that one should

1195
00:48:37,829 --> 00:48:42,028
just simply ask a few questions to

1196
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:43,920
himself like what did what is it that I

1197
00:48:42,028 --> 00:48:45,900
would like in terms of what type of

1198
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,880
plant if I were to have to write down

1199
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:49,858
all the characteristics of what I'd like

1200
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:52,259
might vary from person to person

1201
00:48:49,858 --> 00:48:55,018
wouldn't you agree but there is such a

1202
00:48:52,259 --> 00:48:57,269
strain out there are likely to line up

1203
00:48:55,018 --> 00:48:59,639
with what every what someone's wish list

1204
00:48:57,268 --> 00:49:02,538
would contain and wouldn't it be logical

1205
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:06,179
to just buy a pack of those seeds and

1206
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:09,299
grow them and have an get to the finish

1207
00:49:06,179 --> 00:49:11,699
line do you really want to buy you know

1208
00:49:09,298 --> 00:49:14,849
something that is a poly hybrid with

1209
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:18,409
another poly hybrid saying oh boy those

1210
00:49:14,849 --> 00:49:22,110
are both great things well you

1211
00:49:18,409 --> 00:49:24,210
chicken cordon bleu and asparagus is a

1212
00:49:22,110 --> 00:49:26,970
lovely meal but I don't want to mix it

1213
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:29,070
with a hot fudge sundae at the same time

1214
00:49:26,969 --> 00:49:30,839
they're both lovely things but putting

1215
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:33,120
them together doesn't necessarily make a

1216
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:37,140
great thing and many people who are

1217
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:39,420
neophytes to this craft or this passion

1218
00:49:37,139 --> 00:49:41,400
or you know want to grow marijuana I

1219
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:43,889
think they get caught up in the lore as

1220
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:45,660
many beginners in any field do there's

1221
00:49:43,889 --> 00:49:47,159
an old saying a beginner never under

1222
00:49:45,659 --> 00:49:48,750
does anything you know that usually

1223
00:49:47,159 --> 00:49:50,549
you'll find that their errors come from

1224
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:53,099
overdoing something over watering over

1225
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:55,530
fertilizing over loving you know over

1226
00:49:53,099 --> 00:49:59,519
handling until they get to where they

1227
00:49:55,530 --> 00:50:01,800
learn to let things be you know and not

1228
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:04,500
disturb them too much and know that less

1229
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:05,940
is more sometimes so I just feel that

1230
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:08,969
sometimes people get caught up in the

1231
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:12,450
names like you know superstar [ __ ] and

1232
00:50:08,969 --> 00:50:14,459
and porn star imagine you know it's like

1233
00:50:12,449 --> 00:50:16,199
a [ __ ] porn movie the the you know

1234
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:17,880
the guy with the 12-inch dick is gonna

1235
00:50:16,199 --> 00:50:19,679
[ __ ] the woman with the huge ass or

1236
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:21,780
whatever I don't know but what they

1237
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:26,250
think is gonna come out of these crosses

1238
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:28,110
but having not at least asked yourself

1239
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:30,239
what would I really like to have as an

1240
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:31,890
ideal plant and is does it already exist

1241
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:34,500
in can I buy a pack of seeds where I'll

1242
00:50:31,889 --> 00:50:37,440
reliably did a dozen of them instead of

1243
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:41,489
maybe I'll get that special one out of

1244
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:42,990
this I don't know you boys I may be from

1245
00:50:41,489 --> 00:50:44,369
a different generation or something some

1246
00:50:42,989 --> 00:50:46,649
of the younger folks seem to enjoy that

1247
00:50:44,369 --> 00:50:48,239
and take some pride in I'm on a phyno

1248
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:50,789
hunt of some sort like they're on a

1249
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:53,489
safari in Africa slashing away with a

1250
00:50:50,789 --> 00:50:56,759
machete somewhere writing home wants

1251
00:50:53,489 --> 00:50:58,379
some fun I don't know yeah now it's

1252
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:00,780
interesting every one of them spoken to

1253
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:03,599
is always said that they don't like FINA

1254
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:04,320
hunting per se like it's just kind of

1255
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:07,409
viewed as

1256
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:08,970
that's me so is there any plans for any

1257
00:51:07,409 --> 00:51:11,190
feminist projects from Brothers Grimm

1258
00:51:08,969 --> 00:51:13,379
we're working on it because there's such

1259
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:15,269
a demand I've always been against it but

1260
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:19,079
again you know I come back into this

1261
00:51:15,269 --> 00:51:20,820
craft years later with many advancements

1262
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:22,949
in the technology as well as an

1263
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:25,350
understanding of soil that was

1264
00:51:22,949 --> 00:51:28,949
unprecedented at my time you know in the

1265
00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:31,079
90s and I think that knowing how to

1266
00:51:28,949 --> 00:51:34,230
properly make feminized seeds and not

1267
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:36,480
doing it willy-nilly if we can prove to

1268
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:40,619
ourselves it's a reliable method that we

1269
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:42,329
can master that I don't produce

1270
00:51:40,619 --> 00:51:45,539
hermaphrodites that's something I've

1271
00:51:42,329 --> 00:51:47,309
never you know grown anything that's a

1272
00:51:45,539 --> 00:51:48,779
term afroditi deuced any seeds that

1273
00:51:47,309 --> 00:51:50,909
produce from Africa it's I'm really

1274
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:52,710
proud of that and my fear has always

1275
00:51:50,909 --> 00:51:55,109
been if we tried to make feminized seeds

1276
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:56,970
we may be making some percentage of

1277
00:51:55,110 --> 00:52:00,240
hermaphrodites and I want to avoid that

1278
00:51:56,969 --> 00:52:03,179
at all cost so if I get the chance I

1279
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:05,849
sorry if I should prove to myself in and

1280
00:52:03,179 --> 00:52:09,029
over this next period of time that we're

1281
00:52:05,849 --> 00:52:10,650
working on that project I am convinced

1282
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:12,870
that yes we can reliably produce

1283
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:15,150
feminized seeds and people will not have

1284
00:52:12,869 --> 00:52:19,619
hermaphrodites still have great feminine

1285
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:21,599
feminized seed or 10 feminine plants by

1286
00:52:19,619 --> 00:52:23,699
all means I'd love to do that yeah so

1287
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:26,369
we're trying we're working on it would

1288
00:52:23,699 --> 00:52:29,669
you ever consider trying to get a Jack

1289
00:52:26,369 --> 00:52:32,039
Hera with a Devon and try to recreate

1290
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:36,180
the original seeds you got in a certain

1291
00:52:32,039 --> 00:52:40,230
regard I don't think so you know that

1292
00:52:36,179 --> 00:52:41,789
cross isn't possible with what we have

1293
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:49,349
in the house at the moment that we'd

1294
00:52:41,789 --> 00:52:51,750
have to demonstrate it with that in that

1295
00:52:49,349 --> 00:52:54,380
direction we have so many combinations

1296
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:56,789
that you could sit back and you know

1297
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:59,940
Monday Morning Quarterback about how

1298
00:52:56,789 --> 00:53:01,860
wouldn't that be cool if you did there's

1299
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:05,309
so many combinations you have to

1300
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:07,320
prioritize and select the ones that all

1301
00:53:05,309 --> 00:53:09,750
right these are what we're doing as a

1302
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:12,930
company and moving forward and this is

1303
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:15,179
just you know mm-hmm

1304
00:53:12,929 --> 00:53:17,519
maybe not an interesting thing

1305
00:53:15,179 --> 00:53:19,259
I don't even make those choices I'm

1306
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:22,139
sorry yeah they could very well be a

1307
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:24,660
great idea I just don't know if that's

1308
00:53:22,139 --> 00:53:25,289
on the horizon anytime soon no worries

1309
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:28,618
yeah

1310
00:53:25,289 --> 00:53:30,690
so if we look at the average order even

1311
00:53:28,619 --> 00:53:33,210
the better Jack haircut we noticed that

1312
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:36,780
it's not really as potent as say genius

1313
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:39,088
sorry I say princess do you think that

1314
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:40,530
princess was kind of just a one in a

1315
00:53:39,088 --> 00:53:42,989
million where that point you see got

1316
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:44,490
really jacked up because I mean if we

1317
00:53:42,989 --> 00:53:46,500
think about dev and it's not a strain

1318
00:53:44,489 --> 00:53:49,108
it's typically known for its potency so

1319
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:50,608
it it doesn't appear on papers though it

1320
00:53:49,108 --> 00:53:54,289
would Jack the potency up of a jack

1321
00:53:50,608 --> 00:53:57,179
herer and yet it did yeah

1322
00:53:54,289 --> 00:54:00,869
genetics is a lottery you know it's a

1323
00:53:57,179 --> 00:54:04,889
it's a statistics game and with every

1324
00:54:00,869 --> 00:54:08,119
strain that exists at the moment sort of

1325
00:54:04,889 --> 00:54:12,449
deriving from you know a few basic

1326
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:15,960
starting points and then being more from

1327
00:54:12,449 --> 00:54:19,769
there when you combine in a Jack Herer

1328
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:22,230
that probably has at least three to five

1329
00:54:19,769 --> 00:54:24,599
different lines that come into it from

1330
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:27,690
various origins and then the Durbin

1331
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:32,010
which is just a land race you're gonna

1332
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:35,630
get less variation than two poly hybrids

1333
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:37,920
but you're still going to have those odd

1334
00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:39,568
numbers that come up those odd lottery

1335
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:41,789
numbers you know because each plant is

1336
00:54:39,568 --> 00:54:43,858
basically like a lottery number and if

1337
00:54:41,789 --> 00:54:45,900
you have this if you can envision a jug

1338
00:54:43,858 --> 00:54:48,539
of marbles you know that we're gonna put

1339
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:51,568
in a hopper and spin them and you know

1340
00:54:48,539 --> 00:54:54,989
you can only take out six at a time and

1341
00:54:51,568 --> 00:54:57,420
that's your plan and you have only two

1342
00:54:54,989 --> 00:54:58,919
different colors in that hopper there

1343
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:00,599
aren't going to be a lot of variations

1344
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:03,599
among the plants and they're gonna be

1345
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:05,309
pretty predictable but when you have 18

1346
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:08,280
different color marbles in there and

1347
00:55:05,309 --> 00:55:10,230
you're taking out six at a time you may

1348
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:13,170
very well have six of one color you may

1349
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:15,389
have you know one or one is each of the

1350
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:17,818
six a different color and another one

1351
00:55:15,389 --> 00:55:19,318
that has six where each of them is a

1352
00:55:17,818 --> 00:55:21,298
different color but not the same colors

1353
00:55:19,318 --> 00:55:23,940
as its neighbor you know so there's so

1354
00:55:21,298 --> 00:55:26,559
many ways those lottery numbers can come

1355
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:30,490
out princess is just one

1356
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:33,460
that the right combination to get those

1357
00:55:30,489 --> 00:55:35,439
qualities existed and the next-door

1358
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:38,170
neighbor in the same bud

1359
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:40,960
the genius seed grew into genius which

1360
00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:44,230
doesn't looked a lot like in many

1361
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:45,909
regards princess except in certain ways

1362
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:49,110
that you can see a family resemblance

1363
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:51,699
maybe more in flowering than in veg yeah

1364
00:55:49,110 --> 00:55:55,090
so yeah it's it's that lottery number

1365
00:55:51,699 --> 00:55:58,599
business of the lack of predictability

1366
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:59,170
when you have a lot of genes in play

1367
00:55:58,599 --> 00:56:02,230
like that

1368
00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:04,480
yep you just can't say well hey we got a

1369
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:07,210
thought crossing durbin to the jack

1370
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:09,730
herer would have boosted potency no I

1371
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:11,559
bet if you looked at the averages that

1372
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:14,019
didn't but you have those outs the

1373
00:56:11,559 --> 00:56:16,900
outliers and she's an outlier basically

1374
00:56:14,019 --> 00:56:18,909
yeah how's that so the Brothers Grimm

1375
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:20,800
are now looking at working with various

1376
00:56:18,909 --> 00:56:22,929
members of the chem dog family the

1377
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:24,820
cuttings what is it about the chem dogs

1378
00:56:22,929 --> 00:56:26,589
that are appealing to you and what type

1379
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:29,880
of projects would you envision with them

1380
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:33,250
I think because they are almost so

1381
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:35,079
opposite from the types of strains that

1382
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:38,440
I've always concentrated on and then

1383
00:56:35,079 --> 00:56:43,679
known for the more cerebral fruitier

1384
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:47,289
flavored you know those up highs and the

1385
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:49,269
Terps and so on that are more akin to

1386
00:56:47,289 --> 00:56:54,070
what people are smoking in dabs today I

1387
00:56:49,269 --> 00:56:55,559
guess the chem dog line especially 91 oh

1388
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:59,610
excuse me

1389
00:56:55,559 --> 00:57:02,469
appeals to me in that it's a

1390
00:56:59,610 --> 00:57:04,570
counterpoint to the types of weed that I

1391
00:57:02,469 --> 00:57:07,779
normally smoke and it's such a nice

1392
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:11,019
refreshing change and you know it's

1393
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:13,660
almost unbeknownst to me that my

1394
00:57:11,019 --> 00:57:16,719
attitude my energy level and so on is

1395
00:57:13,659 --> 00:57:19,359
what it is when I'm smoking my usual

1396
00:57:16,719 --> 00:57:22,029
types of strains and I could actually

1397
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:25,420
use a little bit of chill pill sometimes

1398
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:29,440
and the ninety one chem dog will give me

1399
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:31,450
that like deep earthy connect back to

1400
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:37,220
earth kind of thing instead of being out

1401
00:57:31,449 --> 00:57:40,639
in space and it makes me feel a body hi

1402
00:57:37,219 --> 00:57:45,108
it's relaxing and can put me in a state

1403
00:57:40,639 --> 00:57:47,719
of relaxation and also has that

1404
00:57:45,108 --> 00:57:50,449
old-world like back in high school

1405
00:57:47,719 --> 00:57:53,779
people would sell brown Colombian weed

1406
00:57:50,449 --> 00:57:56,659
and the taste had that earthiness to it

1407
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:58,970
and that Kevin dog has that earthy

1408
00:57:56,659 --> 00:58:02,589
flavor so there's a nostalgia to the

1409
00:57:58,969 --> 00:58:05,980
flavor there's a counterpoint

1410
00:58:02,590 --> 00:58:09,410
counter-reaction that sort of is a good

1411
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:12,139
mate to the highs that I get from the

1412
00:58:09,409 --> 00:58:15,019
more sativa leaning cerebral pot that I

1413
00:58:12,139 --> 00:58:16,309
smoked most of the time and so do you

1414
00:58:15,019 --> 00:58:18,590
have any projects you'd be willing to

1415
00:58:16,309 --> 00:58:21,380
share that you might even just vaguely

1416
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:24,140
envision doing with it yeah we're trying

1417
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:27,349
to think about ways where that heavier

1418
00:58:24,139 --> 00:58:29,960
indica leaning you know there's you just

1419
00:58:27,349 --> 00:58:33,080
can't get much more into this than these

1420
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:34,699
you know hash plants and 91 of the chem

1421
00:58:33,079 --> 00:58:38,239
dogs and those types of things that

1422
00:58:34,699 --> 00:58:42,379
bring that Tommy brings to the table do

1423
00:58:38,239 --> 00:58:44,989
diamond and he he and I always think

1424
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:46,940
about like wow you know what if we did

1425
00:58:44,989 --> 00:58:50,269
this and you know recently we went the

1426
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:53,059
other way we're not the indica side but

1427
00:58:50,269 --> 00:58:56,949
we used the hazy thunder l99 haze

1428
00:58:53,059 --> 00:59:00,529
supercilious super Silver Haze to get

1429
00:58:56,949 --> 00:59:02,239
princess and Paula make that Apollo haze

1430
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:04,940
and the princesses from genius and

1431
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:09,289
princess so the next logical step is to

1432
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:11,599
sort of take a heavy indica side thing

1433
00:59:09,289 --> 00:59:13,880
and go the other way you know and take

1434
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:16,280
princess and genius and see what would

1435
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:18,320
happen I'd be excited to see and we have

1436
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:20,150
seeds produced already from some of

1437
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:23,990
those heavy and at this side of course

1438
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:26,030
we have had to not take the female and

1439
00:59:23,989 --> 00:59:28,939
reverse it to get pollen we don't do

1440
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:32,480
that or haven't done yet so if we were

1441
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:35,510
to try to incorporate chem dog into say

1442
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:37,969
Cinderella 99 we'd do something like

1443
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:40,550
cross the chem dog to another suitable

1444
00:59:37,969 --> 00:59:44,619
male have a male from that generation

1445
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:47,170
work back to the Cinderella 99 and

1446
00:59:44,619 --> 00:59:50,920
and see how those heavy indica

1447
00:59:47,170 --> 00:59:53,320
influences can combine with the

1448
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:55,450
Cinderella 99 there are people I'll just

1449
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:56,769
give you a little heads up - we didn't

1450
00:59:55,449 --> 01:00:00,879
do it ourselves but out on the west

1451
00:59:56,769 --> 01:00:03,099
coast there are some folks who grew out

1452
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:06,220
Cinderella 99 crust - some very heavy

1453
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:08,739
like og cush type and they said

1454
01:00:06,219 --> 01:00:10,269
Cinderella 99 was so dominant that he

1455
01:00:08,739 --> 01:00:14,919
would have thought that that indica

1456
01:00:10,269 --> 01:00:16,719
would be throwing his stuff in in that

1457
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:19,329
next generation but they were mostly

1458
01:00:16,719 --> 01:00:22,119
Cinderella 90 not dominant so that's

1459
01:00:19,329 --> 01:00:23,889
interesting you know and I'd like to you

1460
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:30,400
know see how that plays out for us as

1461
01:00:23,889 --> 01:00:32,829
well so kind of just on the topic of

1462
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:35,590
feminized seeds would you ever consider

1463
01:00:32,829 --> 01:00:37,480
crossing princess - genius singers a lot

1464
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:38,890
of people including myself consider

1465
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:41,230
these two to be kind of you know the

1466
01:00:38,889 --> 01:00:42,730
Brothers Grimm holy grails but as I

1467
01:00:41,230 --> 01:00:43,929
mentioned to Tommy the other day he said

1468
01:00:42,730 --> 01:00:48,010
oh I don't think it would be too

1469
01:00:43,929 --> 01:00:50,049
different to a poet yeah yeah yeah we

1470
01:00:48,010 --> 01:00:53,050
kind of to tie them together in a nice

1471
01:00:50,050 --> 01:00:55,269
way Apollo 11 in particular was the goal

1472
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:57,820
all along to do that sort of the

1473
01:00:55,269 --> 01:01:01,590
combination never having thought about

1474
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:06,090
or wanting to you know engage in this

1475
01:01:01,590 --> 01:01:08,890
reversing the plans so yeah Apollo 11

1476
01:01:06,090 --> 01:01:12,180
has that princess structure with the

1477
01:01:08,889 --> 01:01:15,519
more vertically angled branches and

1478
01:01:12,179 --> 01:01:18,969
denser structure at the same time looks

1479
01:01:15,519 --> 01:01:21,820
a lot like genius and veg at the time

1480
01:01:18,969 --> 01:01:25,529
when the buds are fully formed they have

1481
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:29,440
a lot of the shape of the princess and

1482
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:33,400
at the same time our much frost year

1483
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:38,079
have a lot of resin a lighter looking

1484
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:39,280
than either genius or princess so I felt

1485
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:41,349
like it really brought the two together

1486
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:43,960
and the flavors and the high and

1487
01:01:41,349 --> 01:01:46,179
everything or it is kind of like best of

1488
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:47,470
both worlds there yeah well I guess the

1489
01:01:46,179 --> 01:01:48,899
reason why I bring that up is because as

1490
01:01:47,469 --> 01:01:51,989
you just mentioning we

1491
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:54,269
be Cinderella dominating that og cross

1492
01:01:51,989 --> 01:01:56,399
your friends had made it does feel

1493
01:01:54,269 --> 01:01:58,289
somewhat the same with the Apollo and I

1494
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:00,210
guess we attribute that to the true

1495
01:01:58,289 --> 01:02:01,619
greening nature of Cindy's gonna tend to

1496
01:02:00,210 --> 01:02:03,300
be more dominant yeah

1497
01:02:01,619 --> 01:02:06,029
just like when we were using the example

1498
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:08,370
of the land race yet across to a poly

1499
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:10,740
hybrid you know she kind of comes from

1500
01:02:08,369 --> 01:02:13,409
that say do you think he's c99

1501
01:02:10,739 --> 01:02:16,049
stabilized enough that making

1502
01:02:13,409 --> 01:02:17,759
predictable contributions each time so

1503
01:02:16,050 --> 01:02:19,740
do you think if you did do a feminized

1504
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:22,080
of princess ingenious it would come out

1505
01:02:19,739 --> 01:02:23,819
more different to Apollo seeing as there

1506
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:25,319
isn't that dominating nature you know

1507
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:28,650
like princess isn't as dominating as

1508
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:31,559
seen you necessarily fun let's yeah it's

1509
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:34,050
likely that you'd be you'd be seeing

1510
01:02:31,559 --> 01:02:36,420
more variety interesting

1511
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:37,560
so you referenced earlier on that the

1512
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:39,960
Brothers Grimm you do everything

1513
01:02:37,559 --> 01:02:41,639
organically what's your thoughts behind

1514
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:44,550
this is it just simply I prefer Gaara

1515
01:02:41,639 --> 01:02:47,159
stall or do you really think it's you

1516
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:48,539
know I am really a pragmatic guy I

1517
01:02:47,159 --> 01:02:51,659
wouldn't be doing this for any other

1518
01:02:48,539 --> 01:02:54,259
reason and I find it to be giving me the

1519
01:02:51,659 --> 01:02:58,399
best results with the least effort and

1520
01:02:54,260 --> 01:03:00,540
you know there's going back to earlier

1521
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:03,210
conversation we mentioned you know

1522
01:03:00,539 --> 01:03:05,279
beginners getting kind of carried away

1523
01:03:03,210 --> 01:03:07,440
you know and always making mistakes on

1524
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:08,940
the high side of overdoing things well

1525
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:11,340
there's also what I call the gee whiz

1526
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:14,010
factor and when you first come into

1527
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:16,230
learning about cannabis cultivation you

1528
01:03:14,010 --> 01:03:18,450
kind of go gee whiz that's cool about a

1529
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:21,269
lot of things that are beyond your

1530
01:03:18,449 --> 01:03:22,739
present skills and abilities and may not

1531
01:03:21,269 --> 01:03:25,889
actually be the better way of doing

1532
01:03:22,739 --> 01:03:28,289
things anyway but I know that setting up

1533
01:03:25,889 --> 01:03:31,500
an automated room with all hydroponics

1534
01:03:28,289 --> 01:03:33,210
and co2 and lights that you know are on

1535
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:35,670
crazy cycles that you read about

1536
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:38,490
somewhere and you know these are the

1537
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:44,090
kinds of things that the early guys jump

1538
01:03:38,489 --> 01:03:44,089
into sometimes and what was the question

1539
01:03:45,059 --> 01:03:49,029
so they get carried away but they get

1540
01:03:48,070 --> 01:03:51,940
carried away

1541
01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:54,490
and I did too I guess in the beginning

1542
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:56,889
and wanted to do hydroponics and night

1543
01:03:54,489 --> 01:03:58,719
so I have you dabbled in that and did it

1544
01:03:56,889 --> 01:04:01,690
even during the time when I was doing

1545
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:04,750
Brothers Grimm in Boston I had sort of

1546
01:04:01,690 --> 01:04:07,929
pebble bed draining tables with rock

1547
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:09,429
wool cubes lying on top of them and then

1548
01:04:07,929 --> 01:04:12,819
you have to stabilize the top of the

1549
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:14,579
plants with screening or steaks or

1550
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:16,870
however you can manage to do it I was

1551
01:04:14,579 --> 01:04:19,329
stretching strings across the room and

1552
01:04:16,869 --> 01:04:24,009
making kind of a grid to get them stand

1553
01:04:19,329 --> 01:04:26,049
inside of it so to cap off and answer

1554
01:04:24,010 --> 01:04:31,420
the question fully it's just the fact

1555
01:04:26,050 --> 01:04:33,820
that I find super easy seems so natural

1556
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:35,710
maybe there's no gee whiz factor to it

1557
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:37,480
but I get my hands right in the soil and

1558
01:04:35,710 --> 01:04:39,220
I mix it up you can ask Tommy he says

1559
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:42,639
I'm the best soil mixer he's ever seen

1560
01:04:39,219 --> 01:04:44,980
in his life but every grain of soil is

1561
01:04:42,639 --> 01:04:47,349
like evenly mixed and evenly moist you

1562
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:49,240
know and that's in that van and I'm

1563
01:04:47,349 --> 01:04:51,039
touching that with my bare hands and

1564
01:04:49,239 --> 01:04:53,529
getting that soil ready and when I

1565
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:57,730
transplant something into that pot it

1566
01:04:53,530 --> 01:05:00,010
just takes off like a jet plane or

1567
01:04:57,730 --> 01:05:02,320
something and I love that every time I'd

1568
01:05:00,010 --> 01:05:04,360
never tire of seeing I

1569
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:06,280
I think transplant is one of my favorite

1570
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:08,019
things to do I love taking them from the

1571
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:10,390
smaller pot and putting them in that big

1572
01:05:08,019 --> 01:05:12,460
final pot and watching how there's a

1573
01:05:10,389 --> 01:05:14,710
room behind you right there where I was

1574
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:17,679
remarking to myself only 15 minutes ago

1575
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:19,510
how this room just really really just

1576
01:05:17,679 --> 01:05:21,369
jumped right up out of the soil in a

1577
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:24,910
very short time and it's they're just

1578
01:05:21,369 --> 01:05:27,940
growing like mad so I love that process

1579
01:05:24,909 --> 01:05:30,579
and working with the soil moving a few

1580
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:32,950
pots around mixing soil it doesn't

1581
01:05:30,579 --> 01:05:35,500
bother me in the least I enjoy it and I

1582
01:05:32,949 --> 01:05:38,039
feel like we get great yields and great

1583
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:40,849
productivity doesn't slow us down at all

1584
01:05:38,039 --> 01:05:42,829
yes there's some bother too you know

1585
01:05:40,849 --> 01:05:47,059
around hand-feeding soil plants with a

1586
01:05:42,829 --> 01:05:49,729
wand of whatever food we were giving

1587
01:05:47,059 --> 01:05:52,099
them that day which is all dragonfly

1588
01:05:49,728 --> 01:05:56,179
earth medicine mixed into water and pH

1589
01:05:52,099 --> 01:05:58,519
balanced and such yeah you know we have

1590
01:05:56,179 --> 01:06:00,469
mixed our own soil and we're also

1591
01:05:58,518 --> 01:06:04,399
feeding with those types of products and

1592
01:06:00,469 --> 01:06:07,939
to me it just seems really simple you

1593
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:11,079
know we can do a lot of I feel I'm the

1594
01:06:07,940 --> 01:06:12,920
kind of I feel person my goodness so

1595
01:06:11,079 --> 01:06:14,690
touching back on something you mentioned

1596
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:18,639
at the very start of the interview you

1597
01:06:14,690 --> 01:06:20,869
said you had the Acapulco gold and

1598
01:06:18,639 --> 01:06:22,518
recently some tests were done on some

1599
01:06:20,869 --> 01:06:25,670
samples they found and they found it

1600
01:06:22,518 --> 01:06:27,528
that it still was fairly high in THC do

1601
01:06:25,670 --> 01:06:29,650
you think I could attest to that yeah so

1602
01:06:27,528 --> 01:06:33,170
do you think that modern cannabis has

1603
01:06:29,650 --> 01:06:35,210
improved the levels of THC or more so

1604
01:06:33,170 --> 01:06:37,909
just refined characteristics about the

1605
01:06:35,210 --> 01:06:40,548
high because I think a lot of people and

1606
01:06:37,909 --> 01:06:42,498
I used to be guilty of this think that

1607
01:06:40,548 --> 01:06:44,568
you know all the Acapulco gold for

1608
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:46,159
example was maybe not very good and it's

1609
01:06:44,568 --> 01:06:49,130
through hybridizing cannabis that we've

1610
01:06:46,159 --> 01:06:50,598
got it to the THC point it is now do you

1611
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:54,048
feel that that's maybe not necessarily

1612
01:06:50,599 --> 01:06:57,588
the truth I think in those days in the

1613
01:06:54,048 --> 01:07:00,920
sixties and seventies those fields were

1614
01:06:57,588 --> 01:07:03,498
grown not by people who are really

1615
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:06,048
consciously cultivating them the way we

1616
01:07:03,498 --> 01:07:09,858
are now and that there were standout

1617
01:07:06,048 --> 01:07:12,139
plants and you got certain batches you

1618
01:07:09,858 --> 01:07:14,358
know in those days from your local

1619
01:07:12,139 --> 01:07:17,328
dealer and he had gotten a pound that

1620
01:07:14,358 --> 01:07:18,828
happened to be better than usual or

1621
01:07:17,329 --> 01:07:20,778
something and so you got some

1622
01:07:18,829 --> 01:07:24,349
outstanding ones and you probably got

1623
01:07:20,778 --> 01:07:26,809
some mediocre ones but that's it's just

1624
01:07:24,349 --> 01:07:29,210
the variation I think in the in that but

1625
01:07:26,809 --> 01:07:32,749
certainly there had to have been very

1626
01:07:29,210 --> 01:07:35,210
high THC content and very potent plants

1627
01:07:32,748 --> 01:07:39,558
coming from that region during that time

1628
01:07:35,210 --> 01:07:42,259
and people having stood on that shoulder

1629
01:07:39,559 --> 01:07:45,349
and bred from there could absolutely

1630
01:07:42,259 --> 01:07:47,860
improve it and I feel that maybe the

1631
01:07:45,349 --> 01:07:51,490
advantages one has today are

1632
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:53,860
that you have this variety available to

1633
01:07:51,489 --> 01:07:56,409
you very easily and there's been a lot

1634
01:07:53,860 --> 01:08:00,220
of experimentation and people have

1635
01:07:56,409 --> 01:08:02,829
created information and written and

1636
01:08:00,219 --> 01:08:05,199
spoken on all these subjects so that

1637
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:08,799
today with the instant information of

1638
01:08:05,199 --> 01:08:10,960
the Internet you're well informed about

1639
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:14,140
what the different types of marijuana

1640
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:17,859
might do and which ones you might like

1641
01:08:14,139 --> 01:08:19,449
and how to get them and which ones taste

1642
01:08:17,859 --> 01:08:24,640
the way you want them to taste and you

1643
01:08:19,449 --> 01:08:26,079
know so many more refined menu I guess

1644
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:28,210
you could say you know you can build

1645
01:08:26,079 --> 01:08:30,850
build your own what you like to smoke

1646
01:08:28,210 --> 01:08:32,439
based on the information that's out

1647
01:08:30,850 --> 01:08:33,970
there and a little bit of sampling but

1648
01:08:32,439 --> 01:08:36,729
in those days it was like whatever was

1649
01:08:33,970 --> 01:08:38,170
around that week or you know happened to

1650
01:08:36,729 --> 01:08:41,909
be circulating through your neighborhood

1651
01:08:38,170 --> 01:08:44,588
or your school that's what you got and

1652
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:46,029
it's kind of hard to compare the apples

1653
01:08:44,588 --> 01:08:49,329
to oranges you know you know you just

1654
01:08:46,029 --> 01:08:51,849
look back on it and there's a nostalgia

1655
01:08:49,329 --> 01:08:57,600
to that every human being I think

1656
01:08:51,850 --> 01:09:00,010
suffers from you today have a lot of

1657
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:03,220
resistance to you know you're building

1658
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:06,130
up resistance people have high tolerance

1659
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:08,470
tolerances to marijuana that we didn't

1660
01:09:06,130 --> 01:09:10,930
have in those days that it was a lot of

1661
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:12,430
times periods of time would pass that

1662
01:09:10,930 --> 01:09:14,230
there was nothing around and then when

1663
01:09:12,430 --> 01:09:16,420
you did finally get some Wow you know

1664
01:09:14,229 --> 01:09:17,858
knock you on your ass and you'd be

1665
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:20,500
talking about how great that weed was

1666
01:09:17,859 --> 01:09:21,010
and is it really psychological or was it

1667
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:23,949
really

1668
01:09:21,010 --> 01:09:25,720
pharmaceutical you know in in origin you

1669
01:09:23,949 --> 01:09:26,319
know the feelings and sensations that

1670
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:28,390
you had

1671
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:30,579
I remember having not smoked marijuana

1672
01:09:28,390 --> 01:09:33,280
after marrying that woman who I told you

1673
01:09:30,579 --> 01:09:35,109
made me give it all up and I gotten a

1674
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:39,939
project as an engineer working on a

1675
01:09:35,109 --> 01:09:43,359
project in Scotland and it was 1991 and

1676
01:09:39,939 --> 01:09:46,569
as part of my job I was required to just

1677
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:48,640
make a quick trip out of the UK and fly

1678
01:09:46,569 --> 01:09:50,319
back in with my paperwork in order

1679
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:51,970
because when they first called me and it

1680
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:53,469
was an emergency and I had to get there

1681
01:09:51,970 --> 01:09:56,170
and they put me in as a tourist you know

1682
01:09:53,470 --> 01:09:58,070
so I took the opportunity to go to

1683
01:09:56,170 --> 01:10:00,590
Amsterdam you know and turn around it

1684
01:09:58,069 --> 01:10:04,189
well and go back to wherever ed and

1685
01:10:00,590 --> 01:10:07,789
birth and while there of course I went

1686
01:10:04,189 --> 01:10:09,799
in a coffee shop and the first thing I

1687
01:10:07,789 --> 01:10:11,868
ordered was spunk number one because at

1688
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:15,320
that time 1991 that was something that

1689
01:10:11,868 --> 01:10:17,238
was like highly touted strain that

1690
01:10:15,319 --> 01:10:19,698
everyone should try and I had been

1691
01:10:17,238 --> 01:10:21,379
growing it at home and you know going in

1692
01:10:19,698 --> 01:10:22,789
a coffee shop in Amsterdam and actually

1693
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:26,179
trying it there was something I really

1694
01:10:22,789 --> 01:10:27,710
wanted to do but my point is that having

1695
01:10:26,179 --> 01:10:29,599
not smoked for so long and my tolerance

1696
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:32,000
being so low and having been living this

1697
01:10:29,599 --> 01:10:36,199
really straight life with my wife and

1698
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:38,689
you know was like a huge freakout that

1699
01:10:36,198 --> 01:10:40,219
almost was akin to that first time I got

1700
01:10:38,689 --> 01:10:41,719
high with my uncle in his backyard and

1701
01:10:40,219 --> 01:10:43,368
came back in the house and felt like I

1702
01:10:41,719 --> 01:10:45,319
was in a dream you know and then my

1703
01:10:43,368 --> 01:10:47,868
grandmother came home and made us soup

1704
01:10:45,319 --> 01:10:50,179
and we were sitting at the table and I

1705
01:10:47,868 --> 01:10:51,649
couldn't stop giggling and my uncle is

1706
01:10:50,179 --> 01:10:53,210
like kicking me under the table stop

1707
01:10:51,649 --> 01:10:56,779
giggling your grandmother's gonna think

1708
01:10:53,210 --> 01:10:58,819
something's wrong you know and so when I

1709
01:10:56,779 --> 01:11:00,679
went into that coffee shop after having

1710
01:10:58,819 --> 01:11:02,299
not gotten high for so long I remember

1711
01:11:00,679 --> 01:11:04,908
that skunk number one just made me feel

1712
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:06,710
like oh my god I'm seeing all these

1713
01:11:04,908 --> 01:11:08,328
incredible visual things around here

1714
01:11:06,710 --> 01:11:09,980
like if I had a camera right now that

1715
01:11:08,328 --> 01:11:12,078
would be such a cool shot you know that

1716
01:11:09,979 --> 01:11:15,019
the floor and the way it goes into the

1717
01:11:12,078 --> 01:11:18,289
jukebox over there that way and so on so

1718
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:21,980
I mean there is some subjectivity and

1719
01:11:18,289 --> 01:11:25,010
some you have to pay attention to two

1720
01:11:21,979 --> 01:11:27,169
things the subjectivity of the set and

1721
01:11:25,010 --> 01:11:28,940
setting of the people who are smoking

1722
01:11:27,170 --> 01:11:31,429
the marijuana and judging how great it

1723
01:11:28,939 --> 01:11:34,039
is where they coming from before they

1724
01:11:31,429 --> 01:11:36,109
get there you know and then in that same

1725
01:11:34,039 --> 01:11:37,488
vein what was their tolerance you know

1726
01:11:36,109 --> 01:11:38,380
what are they used to smoking all the

1727
01:11:37,488 --> 01:11:42,939
time

1728
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:45,159
that can totally change a review you

1729
01:11:42,939 --> 01:11:46,929
know I would do yeah I mean if I hadn't

1730
01:11:45,159 --> 01:11:49,479
smoked marijuana for a month

1731
01:11:46,930 --> 01:11:51,100
mm-hmm been out hiking in mountains

1732
01:11:49,479 --> 01:11:52,899
drinking from streams and you know

1733
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:55,810
living off the land and having this pure

1734
01:11:52,899 --> 01:11:58,059
life or whatever and came back to you

1735
01:11:55,810 --> 01:12:00,130
know here and everybody say yeah welcome

1736
01:11:58,060 --> 01:12:03,180
back you know hey let's all smoke

1737
01:12:00,130 --> 01:12:06,010
something that first joint would be some

1738
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:07,810
strategies yeah man stuff that I didn't

1739
01:12:06,010 --> 01:12:10,270
think was that strong before would

1740
01:12:07,810 --> 01:12:12,039
probably knock me on my ass so take

1741
01:12:10,270 --> 01:12:14,430
those things into consideration and also

1742
01:12:12,039 --> 01:12:17,500
you know kind of reminds me that

1743
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:20,650
cannabis cup competitions and such are

1744
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:22,689
oftentimes very subjective and might

1745
01:12:20,649 --> 01:12:26,799
I'll put a lot of stock in okay that

1746
01:12:22,689 --> 01:12:28,149
strain one this time who knows you that

1747
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,650
may have been three or four other ones

1748
01:12:28,149 --> 01:12:33,729
that I would have preferred better you

1749
01:12:29,649 --> 01:12:37,599
know yeah so so if we kind of keep on

1750
01:12:33,729 --> 01:12:41,559
that topic of tolerance there's a bit of

1751
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:44,620
a kind of a trend in the breeding

1752
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:46,510
community to quote unquote breed for

1753
01:12:44,619 --> 01:12:48,189
concentrates you know breeding for

1754
01:12:46,510 --> 01:12:50,650
terpenes that will translate to

1755
01:12:48,189 --> 01:12:52,989
concentrates all of these type of

1756
01:12:50,649 --> 01:12:55,000
general ideas these Brothers Grimm

1757
01:12:52,989 --> 01:12:57,729
getting aboard that pipe train or no I

1758
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:59,439
would like to say that we have something

1759
01:12:57,729 --> 01:13:03,099
already that maybe it isn't even

1760
01:12:59,439 --> 01:13:05,500
recognized or appreciated or people

1761
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:09,520
aren't aware of it that Cinderella 99

1762
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:13,960
itself it just completely dumps huge

1763
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:16,150
amounts of resin off of the buds and if

1764
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:21,149
I understand well how that whole process

1765
01:13:16,149 --> 01:13:23,829
works with extracts the more the

1766
01:13:21,149 --> 01:13:27,699
resident you know that comes off the bud

1767
01:13:23,829 --> 01:13:29,890
you the more what do they call yield of

1768
01:13:27,699 --> 01:13:33,159
concentrate that that particular strain

1769
01:13:29,890 --> 01:13:35,289
would be rated sa you know I think that

1770
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:36,189
if someone did a good grow of Cinderella

1771
01:13:35,289 --> 01:13:39,579
99

1772
01:13:36,189 --> 01:13:41,710
then were to process it and do

1773
01:13:39,579 --> 01:13:43,600
extraction they may find that it's

1774
01:13:41,710 --> 01:13:45,340
hitting numbers for yield that are

1775
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,690
unprecedented you know I just don't

1776
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:50,020
think anybody's tried yet

1777
01:13:46,689 --> 01:13:52,059
you know we released the seeds in April

1778
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:54,730
enough times passed that somebody should

1779
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:56,440
have done but maybe nobody has or

1780
01:13:54,729 --> 01:13:57,639
anybody hasn't stuck their head up out

1781
01:13:56,439 --> 01:14:00,339
of the rabbit hole and told anybody

1782
01:13:57,640 --> 01:14:03,489
about it you know yeah but I would feel

1783
01:14:00,340 --> 01:14:05,230
I would like to say you know if there

1784
01:14:03,488 --> 01:14:07,059
are people who want to buy seeds and

1785
01:14:05,229 --> 01:14:10,029
grow a plant that will give you a high

1786
01:14:07,060 --> 01:14:12,070
yield of high quality you couldn't go

1787
01:14:10,029 --> 01:14:14,800
wrong buying the Cinderella 99 and just

1788
01:14:12,069 --> 01:14:17,439
saying you know this will give it an

1789
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:20,469
amazing terpene profile it's gonna give

1790
01:14:17,439 --> 01:14:23,488
an amazing yield of resin and it's gonna

1791
01:14:20,469 --> 01:14:27,840
have a psycho activity that you know is

1792
01:14:23,488 --> 01:14:30,389
world famous for you know really being

1793
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:33,430
enjoyable and the kind of thing that

1794
01:14:30,390 --> 01:14:34,750
like the ladies for some reason I have

1795
01:14:33,430 --> 01:14:36,039
many times women come up to me

1796
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:38,380
Cinderella and I mean that is my

1797
01:14:36,039 --> 01:14:41,229
favorite strain I just love that this

1798
01:14:38,380 --> 01:14:45,190
tastes so good makes me feel so good and

1799
01:14:41,229 --> 01:14:46,869
so I'm pretty easy I I yeah exactly and

1800
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:48,159
it's funny you say that because I was

1801
01:14:46,869 --> 01:14:52,149
just about to segue into

1802
01:14:48,159 --> 01:14:53,619
foria is this spray for a you know it's

1803
01:14:52,149 --> 01:14:56,139
a sexual lubricant actually with

1804
01:14:53,619 --> 01:14:58,599
cannabis infused in it and one of my

1805
01:14:56,140 --> 01:15:01,390
girlfriends told me that she read

1806
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:03,699
somewhere that Cinderella 99 is used in

1807
01:15:01,390 --> 01:15:06,130
that formula because of the effort

1808
01:15:03,698 --> 01:15:09,488
easyacc qualities that they found in

1809
01:15:06,130 --> 01:15:11,529
testing other strains and it yeah so I

1810
01:15:09,488 --> 01:15:14,409
did not see that with my own eyes but

1811
01:15:11,529 --> 01:15:16,750
I'd like to believe it's true and yeah I

1812
01:15:14,409 --> 01:15:19,119
remember I was talking to Duke the other

1813
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:22,359
day and in regards to the hash making

1814
01:15:19,119 --> 01:15:23,859
stuff and he said that uh Cindy is like

1815
01:15:22,359 --> 01:15:26,229
the neverending golf stuff but it just

1816
01:15:23,859 --> 01:15:28,000
just keeps giving you more resin every

1817
01:15:26,229 --> 01:15:31,179
before you handle it it's crazy

1818
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:34,779
so you guys are looking to re-release

1819
01:15:31,180 --> 01:15:38,230
the Killer Queen slash you have yeah now

1820
01:15:34,779 --> 01:15:40,029
yeah so it's out there go get it can we

1821
01:15:38,229 --> 01:15:41,859
expect any other little special Reed

1822
01:15:40,029 --> 01:15:45,969
oxes from some of these old-school

1823
01:15:41,859 --> 01:15:48,729
popular strains to make it out there let

1824
01:15:45,969 --> 01:15:52,750
me think about something we were

1825
01:15:48,729 --> 01:15:54,698
probably kicking around recently let's

1826
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:56,529
see there was something that crossed my

1827
01:15:54,698 --> 01:15:58,750
mind I forget what it was like the sugar

1828
01:15:56,529 --> 01:16:02,319
blossoms or something where yeah look

1829
01:15:58,750 --> 01:16:05,350
using the white widow c99 white widow

1830
01:16:02,319 --> 01:16:08,019
type of earth and would probably be the

1831
01:16:05,350 --> 01:16:12,489
recreation of the what we called sugar

1832
01:16:08,020 --> 01:16:14,080
blossoms back then we also have talked a

1833
01:16:12,488 --> 01:16:16,000
little bit about there was a plant we

1834
01:16:14,079 --> 01:16:19,269
called the Green Giant back in the day

1835
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:21,429
and we're sort of working toward a

1836
01:16:19,270 --> 01:16:24,640
similar thing we probably won't call it

1837
01:16:21,429 --> 01:16:27,190
green giant but it's an improvement on

1838
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:29,320
that idea that now having stood on the

1839
01:16:27,189 --> 01:16:32,259
shoulders of previous work I can see

1840
01:16:29,319 --> 01:16:36,069
that we can do even better and we'll do

1841
01:16:32,260 --> 01:16:38,800
some you know big yielding outdoor

1842
01:16:36,069 --> 01:16:41,019
strain that you know can still mature in

1843
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:44,050
time for the northeasterners here in the

1844
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:47,560
United States and such where in

1845
01:16:44,050 --> 01:16:49,960
Australia do you have sort of a dividing

1846
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:52,900
line of where people can start to be

1847
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:55,090
getting too far south where it's too

1848
01:16:52,899 --> 01:16:57,039
cold in the winters or something or has

1849
01:16:55,090 --> 01:16:59,980
not not happen in Australia at all I

1850
01:16:57,039 --> 01:17:02,738
know people in New Zealand and they

1851
01:16:59,979 --> 01:17:04,718
still are able to do outdoor crops so I

1852
01:17:02,738 --> 01:17:06,738
don't think there is a too far south so

1853
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:10,730
to speak

1854
01:17:06,738 --> 01:17:12,979
around there's you know like I I

1855
01:17:10,729 --> 01:17:14,449
struggle like I kind of cringe to say

1856
01:17:12,979 --> 01:17:16,069
but there's an area in Australia called

1857
01:17:14,449 --> 01:17:19,039
there the Emerald triangle

1858
01:17:16,069 --> 01:17:21,319
you know akin to the one here and that's

1859
01:17:19,039 --> 01:17:22,880
kind of what I consider to be the sweet

1860
01:17:21,319 --> 01:17:25,849
spot of Australia we grow in the

1861
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:29,539
outdoors and they get like three four

1862
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:31,400
crops into the outdoor season it goes

1863
01:17:29,539 --> 01:17:34,519
for quite a long time I guess

1864
01:17:31,399 --> 01:17:36,889
so is it daylight sort of not varying so

1865
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:38,750
much from twelve twelve yeah yeah very

1866
01:17:36,890 --> 01:17:44,329
close very close so I think we get about

1867
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:47,930
14 hours max sorry 14 hours max eleven

1868
01:17:44,329 --> 01:17:50,180
and a half minimum so yeah we we get uhm

1869
01:17:47,930 --> 01:17:52,670
basically from speaking to my friend who

1870
01:17:50,180 --> 01:17:54,680
does a lot of outdoors he says so

1871
01:17:52,670 --> 01:17:56,149
they're at first outdoor crops things

1872
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:57,800
are starting to flower right now and

1873
01:17:56,149 --> 01:18:00,259
they'll be harvested a little bit after

1874
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:01,610
Christmas he said those crops don't turn

1875
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:03,350
out the best because it's still really

1876
01:18:01,609 --> 01:18:08,229
hot it's summer you know it's like 100

1877
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:12,320
degrees resin production is coming yeah

1878
01:18:08,229 --> 01:18:13,939
really laughs you know density and then

1879
01:18:12,319 --> 01:18:15,738
he said but the last two you get in

1880
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:18,349
which as you're just getting towards

1881
01:18:15,738 --> 01:18:20,139
July they're really frosty nice colors

1882
01:18:18,350 --> 01:18:22,610
because you get in towards winter and

1883
01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:26,450
yeah I look forward to those our autumn

1884
01:18:22,609 --> 01:18:28,639
there's also some other so obviously you

1885
01:18:26,449 --> 01:18:31,399
have a bit of an intertwined past with

1886
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:34,060
the SSS see yeah being the u.s.

1887
01:18:31,399 --> 01:18:38,269
distributor when you decided to do the

1888
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:40,219
Durban Tyson in 99 did they kind of give

1889
01:18:38,270 --> 01:18:42,070
you you know a lot of approval as it

1890
01:18:40,219 --> 01:18:44,140
thank you for the help earlier or

1891
01:18:42,069 --> 01:18:46,509
we don't really in contact with lost

1892
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:48,490
contact for some time at that point I

1893
01:18:46,510 --> 01:18:50,980
hadn't spoken to them for something like

1894
01:18:48,489 --> 01:18:53,199
eight years and they were upset with me

1895
01:18:50,979 --> 01:18:54,969
for giving up working for them you know

1896
01:18:53,199 --> 01:18:57,159
and it was sort of abrupt because of

1897
01:18:54,970 --> 01:18:59,260
having met that woman and yet married

1898
01:18:57,159 --> 01:19:03,010
and so on I was a young man and easily

1899
01:18:59,260 --> 01:19:04,750
swayed by you know the influence yeah

1900
01:19:03,010 --> 01:19:08,650
you know there was some urgency

1901
01:19:04,750 --> 01:19:11,159
I don't know sort of the primal pressure

1902
01:19:08,649 --> 01:19:15,009
to breed or something at that moment

1903
01:19:11,159 --> 01:19:17,380
myself so I took five years and made a

1904
01:19:15,010 --> 01:19:23,409
couple of kids and came back to making

1905
01:19:17,380 --> 01:19:25,329
plants again now thousands yeah so when

1906
01:19:23,409 --> 01:19:28,389
you did that when I they were still

1907
01:19:25,329 --> 01:19:30,220
releasing the original Devon time by

1908
01:19:28,390 --> 01:19:32,530
flower or did you hold and track down a

1909
01:19:30,220 --> 01:19:35,409
packet of it or Oh No yeah that was

1910
01:19:32,529 --> 01:19:42,159
actually a friend out in the North

1911
01:19:35,409 --> 01:19:45,579
Pacific Northwest who I traded a cutting

1912
01:19:42,159 --> 01:19:48,970
of princess to who gave me the Durban

1913
01:19:45,579 --> 01:19:50,890
tie and he was meant to keep that under

1914
01:19:48,970 --> 01:19:53,380
wraps and not spread it around and I

1915
01:19:50,890 --> 01:19:55,360
believe he has done and you know I think

1916
01:19:53,380 --> 01:19:58,510
it may have circulated to another fellow

1917
01:19:55,359 --> 01:20:01,750
but so from that friend who I traded the

1918
01:19:58,510 --> 01:20:06,550
princess clone to and he gave me Durban

1919
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:09,399
tie as see and I grew out those seeds

1920
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:11,320
and having done many years before I knew

1921
01:20:09,399 --> 01:20:15,789
what to look for and found a really nice

1922
01:20:11,319 --> 01:20:18,399
early maturing little group there and

1923
01:20:15,789 --> 01:20:21,760
got the mail that was similar to that

1924
01:20:18,399 --> 01:20:24,469
and read that to oh I'm sorry I used the

1925
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:28,039
female and used the amount the male c99

1926
01:20:24,469 --> 01:20:30,619
that's right so then so I got the Durban

1927
01:20:28,039 --> 01:20:35,359
tie c99 I found a nice early maturing

1928
01:20:30,619 --> 01:20:37,939
female and went with the c99 male so do

1929
01:20:35,359 --> 01:20:41,359
you have any beliefs on the effects of

1930
01:20:37,939 --> 01:20:42,710
using males and females and the

1931
01:20:41,359 --> 01:20:45,049
differences in the cross so what I mean

1932
01:20:42,710 --> 01:20:47,300
by that is I from memory I'm quoting

1933
01:20:45,050 --> 01:20:49,820
this DJ short said that he always found

1934
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:51,920
you wanted to have the most achiever of

1935
01:20:49,819 --> 01:20:53,029
the two parents being the female I think

1936
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:54,529
you said you've got the best results

1937
01:20:53,029 --> 01:20:55,969
from that have you found something like

1938
01:20:54,529 --> 01:20:57,889
that way you know what maybe you prefer

1939
01:20:55,969 --> 01:21:00,050
to use Cindy as a male more than a

1940
01:20:57,890 --> 01:21:03,320
female or you know anything along those

1941
01:21:00,050 --> 01:21:05,420
lines well here's the thing that's funny

1942
01:21:03,319 --> 01:21:07,939
you asked that question and after all

1943
01:21:05,420 --> 01:21:11,239
this time it was that question that I

1944
01:21:07,939 --> 01:21:12,769
asked to super sativa seed club that

1945
01:21:11,238 --> 01:21:14,359
piqued their interest in me and made

1946
01:21:12,770 --> 01:21:17,960
them think that this guy actually is

1947
01:21:14,359 --> 01:21:19,909
thinking and has a good understanding of

1948
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:21,010
what what's going on with reading and so

1949
01:21:19,909 --> 01:21:23,510
on because I asked them the question

1950
01:21:21,010 --> 01:21:27,140
when you make a cross like you know

1951
01:21:23,510 --> 01:21:30,230
Afghani scum gunk Afghani you know does

1952
01:21:27,140 --> 01:21:31,940
it matter the offspring whether the male

1953
01:21:30,229 --> 01:21:34,519
was the Afghan year the female was the

1954
01:21:31,939 --> 01:21:37,789
Afghani or vice versa the males stump or

1955
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:39,860
the female skunk and so he said because

1956
01:21:37,789 --> 01:21:41,238
of that question I really want to talk

1957
01:21:39,859 --> 01:21:45,979
to you can I get your phone number it's

1958
01:21:41,238 --> 01:21:48,769
Destin and in my experience he never did

1959
01:21:45,979 --> 01:21:51,109
answer you know to my satisfaction and

1960
01:21:48,770 --> 01:21:52,699
anything but in my experience now after

1961
01:21:51,109 --> 01:21:56,859
all these years I've found that what you

1962
01:21:52,698 --> 01:21:59,599
want to do is that the offspring are

1963
01:21:56,859 --> 01:22:01,698
presumably female that you're interested

1964
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:03,860
in if we can just like assume that let's

1965
01:22:01,698 --> 01:22:07,909
say you want to grow seeds that will

1966
01:22:03,859 --> 01:22:11,420
give you a great female in general you

1967
01:22:07,909 --> 01:22:13,789
want the mother to be the type that's

1968
01:22:11,420 --> 01:22:17,149
most like the offspring you're looking

1969
01:22:13,789 --> 01:22:20,300
for and the male will be less and less

1970
01:22:17,149 --> 01:22:23,000
of an influence because of the following

1971
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:24,860
reason daughters are going to look more

1972
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:27,140
like there are mothers in general and

1973
01:22:24,859 --> 01:22:27,808
their feminine qualities will come from

1974
01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:32,209
mother

1975
01:22:27,809 --> 01:22:36,469
more likely and the male contributes a

1976
01:22:32,208 --> 01:22:39,418
why crumbs x-chromosome and the female

1977
01:22:36,469 --> 01:22:43,168
contributes an X chromosome so each of

1978
01:22:39,418 --> 01:22:47,038
them is contributing something to make

1979
01:22:43,168 --> 01:22:49,318
up that female daughter and when a son

1980
01:22:47,038 --> 01:22:53,068
is created it has the Y chromosome from

1981
01:22:49,319 --> 01:22:55,739
the male and therefore you know has his

1982
01:22:53,069 --> 01:22:57,599
influence and being his sons you tend to

1983
01:22:55,738 --> 01:23:00,478
see sons looking like their dads and

1984
01:22:57,599 --> 01:23:05,819
such in human beings and mammals and so

1985
01:23:00,479 --> 01:23:09,599
on and also when you are trying to breed

1986
01:23:05,819 --> 01:23:14,159
a female you're looking for the female

1987
01:23:09,599 --> 01:23:18,449
traits to show you what the daughters

1988
01:23:14,158 --> 01:23:20,098
will have and it's obvious right I mean

1989
01:23:18,448 --> 01:23:22,259
because of the female the mother's a

1990
01:23:20,099 --> 01:23:25,199
female the daughters a female that

1991
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:27,179
traits those female traits that you want

1992
01:23:25,198 --> 01:23:31,588
the daughters to have are going to be

1993
01:23:27,179 --> 01:23:33,989
expressed in the female hopefully and if

1994
01:23:31,588 --> 01:23:37,948
you're hoping to get some of the female

1995
01:23:33,988 --> 01:23:41,398
traits from the male side it's gonna be

1996
01:23:37,948 --> 01:23:48,259
a subtler influence but you know what

1997
01:23:41,399 --> 01:23:53,039
will end up happening you have yeah yeah

1998
01:23:48,260 --> 01:23:59,099
yeah yeah so where was I if you press

1999
01:23:53,038 --> 01:24:02,849
them right also how does one pick in the

2000
01:23:59,099 --> 01:24:05,099
phenotype of a male and judge what

2001
01:24:02,849 --> 01:24:07,050
female traits he'll be able to

2002
01:24:05,099 --> 01:24:09,869
contribute when he has no feminine

2003
01:24:07,050 --> 01:24:13,109
traits to exhibit now one of the

2004
01:24:09,868 --> 01:24:16,889
examples I use is imagine you wanted to

2005
01:24:13,109 --> 01:24:19,229
breed humans you know you uh you wanted

2006
01:24:16,889 --> 01:24:21,659
to have large breasted women okay and

2007
01:24:19,229 --> 01:24:24,119
it'd be obvious that yeah you would want

2008
01:24:21,658 --> 01:24:25,529
to start with take a woman who's large

2009
01:24:24,118 --> 01:24:29,488
breasted she'll probably have large

2010
01:24:25,529 --> 01:24:32,608
breasted daughters yeah now if you make

2011
01:24:29,488 --> 01:24:33,838
that link to potency in marijuana and

2012
01:24:32,609 --> 01:24:36,510
you say all right well we're gonna want

2013
01:24:33,838 --> 01:24:37,920
a female that has high potency right you

2014
01:24:36,510 --> 01:24:40,949
know and

2015
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:42,719
potency comes from high resin production

2016
01:24:40,948 --> 01:24:45,869
and the female parts of the marijuana

2017
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:49,800
plant so it's very obvious to be able to

2018
01:24:45,869 --> 01:24:53,250
pick a female that has the drug quality

2019
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:55,610
that you want but in the male he doesn't

2020
01:24:53,250 --> 01:25:01,890
have any female parts to judge that from

2021
01:24:55,609 --> 01:25:03,839
so what do you do guys in the old days

2022
01:25:01,890 --> 01:25:06,510
would do the following they would try to

2023
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:08,250
smoke the male's leaves and flowers and

2024
01:25:06,510 --> 01:25:10,350
try to find out which males had the

2025
01:25:08,250 --> 01:25:12,119
highest potency and figure that would be

2026
01:25:10,350 --> 01:25:14,460
the one that will give the female more

2027
01:25:12,119 --> 01:25:16,800
potency and bring that into the cross

2028
01:25:14,460 --> 01:25:19,829
well if you think about it that's

2029
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:22,310
analogous to in our little example of

2030
01:25:19,829 --> 01:25:25,289
trying to breed for large breasted women

2031
01:25:22,310 --> 01:25:27,360
finding men with large breasts to breed

2032
01:25:25,289 --> 01:25:28,738
with your large breasted woman that

2033
01:25:27,359 --> 01:25:30,630
doesn't make sense does it

2034
01:25:28,738 --> 01:25:33,238
yeah because you're looking for a

2035
01:25:30,630 --> 01:25:35,670
feminine trait in a male yeah that's not

2036
01:25:33,238 --> 01:25:39,329
necessarily going to happen that the man

2037
01:25:35,670 --> 01:25:41,489
whose breasts are the largest SAR going

2038
01:25:39,329 --> 01:25:43,229
to be a trait that he transmits to his

2039
01:25:41,488 --> 01:25:48,178
daughters he might more likely have

2040
01:25:43,229 --> 01:25:50,159
large breasted sons so that's the [ __ ]

2041
01:25:48,179 --> 01:25:52,440
up thing about doing it that way so what

2042
01:25:50,159 --> 01:25:54,869
I found was that I would grow out a

2043
01:25:52,439 --> 01:25:57,059
generation of plants and I'd have the

2044
01:25:54,869 --> 01:25:59,670
females and males growing through their

2045
01:25:57,060 --> 01:26:02,219
vegetative states together and I'd group

2046
01:25:59,670 --> 01:26:05,279
the ones that were similar in their

2047
01:26:02,219 --> 01:26:07,948
structure you know given all of the

2048
01:26:05,279 --> 01:26:11,009
neutral gender traits stuff that's not

2049
01:26:07,948 --> 01:26:15,049
specific to a male or a female thickness

2050
01:26:11,010 --> 01:26:18,900
of the stalk density of Internode's

2051
01:26:15,050 --> 01:26:21,690
the thinness or longness of the leaves

2052
01:26:18,899 --> 01:26:24,000
and such and group them together and

2053
01:26:21,689 --> 01:26:28,559
whichever ones turned out to be females

2054
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:31,079
and males from each group I'd say okay

2055
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:33,870
the males from that group that had all

2056
01:26:31,079 --> 01:26:36,119
of those vegetative properties that were

2057
01:26:33,869 --> 01:26:39,689
similar to the females in that group be

2058
01:26:36,119 --> 01:26:41,880
it you know tall short whatever I have

2059
01:26:39,689 --> 01:26:44,389
found that they are the ones that will

2060
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:47,909
then transmit the type of female

2061
01:26:44,390 --> 01:26:50,249
characteristics from the sisters

2062
01:26:47,908 --> 01:26:52,288
the next generation and if you do a

2063
01:26:50,248 --> 01:26:54,929
little bit of reverse engineering and

2064
01:26:52,288 --> 01:26:57,139
sort of time-traveling you can go back

2065
01:26:54,929 --> 01:27:01,498
to our experiment with humans and say

2066
01:26:57,139 --> 01:27:03,679
okay how do we know a man who has

2067
01:27:01,498 --> 01:27:06,328
already proven himself to create

2068
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:08,368
daughters who have large breasts that

2069
01:27:06,328 --> 01:27:11,009
would be what one one way of finding a

2070
01:27:08,368 --> 01:27:13,109
man who is a good match for your bit

2071
01:27:11,010 --> 01:27:15,059
large breasted woman right because the

2072
01:27:13,109 --> 01:27:17,698
proofs in the pudding it's not in his

2073
01:27:15,059 --> 01:27:21,208
breasts that he just that he exhibits on

2074
01:27:17,698 --> 01:27:23,219
himself the real test of a breeding stud

2075
01:27:21,208 --> 01:27:25,708
of a guy who can make daughters who have

2076
01:27:23,219 --> 01:27:27,569
large breasts is a guy who makes

2077
01:27:25,708 --> 01:27:29,429
daughters with large breasts you've

2078
01:27:27,569 --> 01:27:31,578
proven it he's done it a few times right

2079
01:27:29,429 --> 01:27:34,139
so you know how you find guys like that

2080
01:27:31,578 --> 01:27:37,228
find large breasted women and get their

2081
01:27:34,139 --> 01:27:39,630
dad so you go back to the father of that

2082
01:27:37,229 --> 01:27:41,668
large breasted woman yeah that guy

2083
01:27:39,630 --> 01:27:44,059
already has been shown to make a large

2084
01:27:41,668 --> 01:27:47,399
breasted daughter he's a good

2085
01:27:44,059 --> 01:27:49,590
probability so you can do that if anyone

2086
01:27:47,399 --> 01:27:51,268
is ever smart enough to you know hold

2087
01:27:49,590 --> 01:27:53,788
the male back and see what happens in

2088
01:27:51,269 --> 01:27:55,708
future generations say oh look you know

2089
01:27:53,788 --> 01:27:57,599
that male would have been very generally

2090
01:27:55,708 --> 01:27:59,130
you know valuable but we called him

2091
01:27:57,599 --> 01:28:00,869
because you know we already pollinated

2092
01:27:59,130 --> 01:28:02,788
something that wants you know sometimes

2093
01:28:00,868 --> 01:28:04,168
people do that but we tend to hold on to

2094
01:28:02,788 --> 01:28:07,228
our males for a while and prove them out

2095
01:28:04,168 --> 01:28:10,109
before we whatever so with this in mind

2096
01:28:07,229 --> 01:28:11,760
is that almost does that the school of

2097
01:28:10,109 --> 01:28:13,498
thought or mursaleen itself to make you

2098
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:17,099
want to use Cindy more as the male

2099
01:28:13,498 --> 01:28:18,179
because yeah if you really restrains you

2100
01:28:17,099 --> 01:28:20,189
could look out for example in

2101
01:28:18,179 --> 01:28:22,429
straightaway say our well Cindy was the

2102
01:28:20,189 --> 01:28:24,959
dad like I mean space Queens a great one

2103
01:28:22,429 --> 01:28:28,050
well you're talking feminized now and

2104
01:28:24,958 --> 01:28:31,168
when you feminized and reverse a female

2105
01:28:28,050 --> 01:28:34,800
clone I mean it's almost a certainty

2106
01:28:31,168 --> 01:28:37,559
that this will now was Holland that

2107
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:39,119
pardon was space Queen feminized no I'm

2108
01:28:37,559 --> 01:28:40,889
not talking about it I'm just saying in

2109
01:28:39,118 --> 01:28:43,228
general yeah not using space Queen as

2110
01:28:40,889 --> 01:28:49,139
the example but if you take a clone

2111
01:28:43,229 --> 01:28:51,769
female clone and colloidal silver spray

2112
01:28:49,139 --> 01:28:54,748
the things to reverse it and make pollen

2113
01:28:51,769 --> 01:28:56,969
the characteristics that are going to be

2114
01:28:54,748 --> 01:29:00,210
carried in that pollen

2115
01:28:56,969 --> 01:29:01,980
is much much more likely to carry all of

2116
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:04,529
the feminine characteristics of the

2117
01:29:01,979 --> 01:29:08,218
plant that it came from than a male who

2118
01:29:04,529 --> 01:29:10,170
came from that generation and may have

2119
01:29:08,219 --> 01:29:12,380
an entirely different lottery ticket as

2120
01:29:10,170 --> 01:29:15,300
we were using that analogy earlier and

2121
01:29:12,380 --> 01:29:17,460
wouldn't give so reliably all of the

2122
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:20,400
characteristics that that female clone

2123
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:22,829
would have done in its pollen that would

2124
01:29:20,399 --> 01:29:24,719
be my assumption going into this and

2125
01:29:22,829 --> 01:29:26,550
that's what you know scientifically

2126
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:28,739
makes sense to me but again proofs in

2127
01:29:26,550 --> 01:29:30,719
the pudding yeah in the next year or so

2128
01:29:28,738 --> 01:29:32,579
as we go through the process of learning

2129
01:29:30,719 --> 01:29:37,170
how that works for us

2130
01:29:32,579 --> 01:29:39,149
I will like to think that that will ring

2131
01:29:37,170 --> 01:29:43,050
true eventually but that's my gut

2132
01:29:39,149 --> 01:29:46,649
feeling yeah so do you have any plans or

2133
01:29:43,050 --> 01:29:50,190
want to do any kind of CBD project to be

2134
01:29:46,649 --> 01:29:53,399
right it's so ubiquitous at the moment

2135
01:29:50,189 --> 01:29:56,279
that people ask for the CBD and ask if

2136
01:29:53,399 --> 01:29:58,920
we're doing anything and I mean I've

2137
01:29:56,279 --> 01:30:00,750
always just felt yeah you know I'm an

2138
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:02,760
old-school guy I'm the stuck a stick in

2139
01:30:00,750 --> 01:30:05,430
the mud or whatever I'm in this for the

2140
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:07,489
THC I'm all about you know smoking

2141
01:30:05,430 --> 01:30:10,380
marijuana for the pleasurable

2142
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:12,269
recreational value of it I know that it

2143
01:30:10,380 --> 01:30:15,239
helps people you know on the medical

2144
01:30:12,270 --> 01:30:17,940
side and my partner's Dukes much more

2145
01:30:15,238 --> 01:30:19,319
into that side of it and good you know

2146
01:30:17,939 --> 01:30:21,419
there should be one part of this company

2147
01:30:19,319 --> 01:30:23,819
that wants to devote you know energy to

2148
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:26,640
that but and I will certainly go along

2149
01:30:23,819 --> 01:30:30,509
with anything we come up with the he

2150
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:32,430
wants to do but it's not a big concern

2151
01:30:30,510 --> 01:30:34,500
for me or a priority for me for some

2152
01:30:32,430 --> 01:30:36,150
reason I don't know I guess I need more

2153
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:38,279
experience with it I did have one nice

2154
01:30:36,149 --> 01:30:40,920
experience where I had come from New

2155
01:30:38,279 --> 01:30:43,019
York to Colorado and had a dodgy knee

2156
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:45,449
for a while and it had been sort of like

2157
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:47,310
a tendinitis that wasn't just from

2158
01:30:45,448 --> 01:30:50,219
recently I mean I had been suffering for

2159
01:30:47,310 --> 01:30:52,350
a while somebody gave me some CBD pills

2160
01:30:50,219 --> 01:30:56,010
I think there were 30 milligrams of CBD

2161
01:30:52,350 --> 01:30:57,870
oil and took one or two of them right

2162
01:30:56,010 --> 01:30:59,610
away never came back

2163
01:30:57,869 --> 01:31:01,859
I've never still to this day had that

2164
01:30:59,609 --> 01:31:03,849
tendonitis ever come back so I feel like

2165
01:31:01,859 --> 01:31:05,979
the stuff is pretty miraculous

2166
01:31:03,850 --> 01:31:08,289
the way that it can work and I'd love to

2167
01:31:05,979 --> 01:31:11,349
have people also experience you know a

2168
01:31:08,289 --> 01:31:12,489
really good result like that like I did

2169
01:31:11,350 --> 01:31:16,450
yeah

2170
01:31:12,489 --> 01:31:18,099
and so I'd love to get my hands on some

2171
01:31:16,449 --> 01:31:19,779
more there's one fellow who I did get

2172
01:31:18,100 --> 01:31:21,520
that from that I'd kind of like to see

2173
01:31:19,779 --> 01:31:23,679
again and I'll put the word out to

2174
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:25,690
assume that come see me with more of

2175
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:26,409
those CBD pills man my wife is asking

2176
01:31:25,689 --> 01:31:30,579
about him now

2177
01:31:26,409 --> 01:31:32,559
yeah so so do you feel that the true

2178
01:31:30,579 --> 01:31:34,869
medet world when i say truth obviously

2179
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:37,600
subjective do you feel that you know the

2180
01:31:34,869 --> 01:31:40,750
largest amount of conditions are treated

2181
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:43,780
by not simply CBD but a mixture of maybe

2182
01:31:40,750 --> 01:31:47,199
THC and CBD yeah I've always maintained

2183
01:31:43,779 --> 01:31:48,399
that it's the cannabinoid profile itself

2184
01:31:47,199 --> 01:31:52,239
and the ratios of the different

2185
01:31:48,399 --> 01:31:55,629
cannabinoids that go into any one plant

2186
01:31:52,239 --> 01:31:59,519
that give it all of its myriad qualities

2187
01:31:55,630 --> 01:32:02,619
of different high flavors and so on and

2188
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:04,690
the high you're getting is influenced by

2189
01:32:02,619 --> 01:32:07,000
that you know almost like a chord being

2190
01:32:04,689 --> 01:32:09,399
played on an instrument that it's you

2191
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:11,170
know first third fifth you know maybe

2192
01:32:09,399 --> 01:32:12,489
it's got a minor seventh thrown into it

2193
01:32:11,170 --> 01:32:15,369
and these kinds of things and they're

2194
01:32:12,489 --> 01:32:17,889
all subtle things it's always amazed me

2195
01:32:15,369 --> 01:32:20,050
in music how with 12 notes you know that

2196
01:32:17,890 --> 01:32:22,630
everything can just be created that is

2197
01:32:20,050 --> 01:32:27,699
created from that and it's the same

2198
01:32:22,630 --> 01:32:30,369
thing with the marijuana yeah so if you

2199
01:32:27,699 --> 01:32:33,550
could give some advice to some of the

2200
01:32:30,369 --> 01:32:35,590
breeders starting out what would be some

2201
01:32:33,550 --> 01:32:36,619
of the things you try to emphasize as

2202
01:32:35,590 --> 01:32:40,340
you know the more

2203
01:32:36,618 --> 01:32:43,460
things to be keeping in mind I'd say you

2204
01:32:40,340 --> 01:32:45,590
know there's a tendency to want to try a

2205
01:32:43,460 --> 01:32:49,158
lot of different things and bring a lot

2206
01:32:45,590 --> 01:32:53,389
of elements and there's the old adage

2207
01:32:49,158 --> 01:32:55,039
you know too many cooks spoil the soup

2208
01:32:53,389 --> 01:32:57,920
or you know adding too many ingredients

2209
01:32:55,039 --> 01:33:00,920
is you know keep it simple the kiss

2210
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:02,389
method if you know know what you're

2211
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:05,060
working with

2212
01:33:02,389 --> 01:33:07,940
and realize that you don't really

2213
01:33:05,060 --> 01:33:10,969
necessarily need to have any wild swings

2214
01:33:07,939 --> 01:33:14,238
and variation of what you're breeding to

2215
01:33:10,969 --> 01:33:15,920
start moving your phenotypes toward the

2216
01:33:14,238 --> 01:33:19,638
phenotype that you really want you know

2217
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:23,829
I've gotten such a good lot of variation

2218
01:33:19,639 --> 01:33:26,118
from such similar plants that you know

2219
01:33:23,829 --> 01:33:28,010
imagine you know they're only sister

2220
01:33:26,118 --> 01:33:30,348
they're actually sisters of each other

2221
01:33:28,010 --> 01:33:31,610
genius and princess and the different

2222
01:33:30,349 --> 01:33:35,119
things that have been created out of

2223
01:33:31,609 --> 01:33:37,279
them can show you how from very little

2224
01:33:35,118 --> 01:33:39,380
variation and the gene pool you're

2225
01:33:37,279 --> 01:33:43,269
starting from you can achieve what you

2226
01:33:39,380 --> 01:33:46,429
want and you don't have to overshoot by

2227
01:33:43,270 --> 01:33:49,429
introducing more elements than necessary

2228
01:33:46,429 --> 01:33:52,520
or two too great of a difference in

2229
01:33:49,429 --> 01:33:56,090
where you are to what you're crossing it

2230
01:33:52,520 --> 01:33:57,500
to so keeping it simple always be sure

2231
01:33:56,090 --> 01:33:59,659
of what you're actually what you really

2232
01:33:57,500 --> 01:34:03,139
have you know never take something from

2233
01:33:59,658 --> 01:34:05,359
somebody and trust that they say it's

2234
01:34:03,139 --> 01:34:08,599
what it is and you know I believe them

2235
01:34:05,359 --> 01:34:10,880
you know really do your diligence and

2236
01:34:08,599 --> 01:34:12,739
make sure that it is what the person

2237
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:14,719
says it is I can't tell you how many

2238
01:34:12,738 --> 01:34:16,669
times I've turned down people offering

2239
01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:20,389
me cuttings and seeds and anything else

2240
01:34:16,670 --> 01:34:21,980
and I just say dude you know thank you

2241
01:34:20,389 --> 01:34:24,050
for your generosity it's very nice of

2242
01:34:21,979 --> 01:34:27,428
you to offer they send me free stuff and

2243
01:34:24,050 --> 01:34:32,570
you know I just don't philosophically

2244
01:34:27,429 --> 01:34:35,889
fit into the kind of breeder who tries a

2245
01:34:32,569 --> 01:34:38,269
bunch of odd [ __ ] you know I have very

2246
01:34:35,889 --> 01:34:40,069
definite idea of where I'm going with

2247
01:34:38,270 --> 01:34:40,929
something I know I already have the

2248
01:34:40,069 --> 01:34:43,389
tools in my

2249
01:34:40,929 --> 01:34:45,940
toolkit here I don't need to reach

2250
01:34:43,390 --> 01:34:48,369
outside too much when I do is for a

2251
01:34:45,939 --> 01:34:50,198
really specific reason it's something

2252
01:34:48,369 --> 01:34:52,689
that I think like okay that really makes

2253
01:34:50,198 --> 01:34:55,779
sense and I really know that this is

2254
01:34:52,689 --> 01:34:56,369
what it's supposed to be and I'll take

2255
01:34:55,779 --> 01:34:59,769
it from there

2256
01:34:56,369 --> 01:35:02,769
and I would advocate that people be a

2257
01:34:59,770 --> 01:35:05,320
little bit more choosy I guess and ask

2258
01:35:02,770 --> 01:35:08,800
yourself when you do buy seeds and you

2259
01:35:05,319 --> 01:35:10,630
know to have a starting point what am I

2260
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:13,179
really looking for what characteristics

2261
01:35:10,630 --> 01:35:15,429
do I desire in the plants that I want to

2262
01:35:13,179 --> 01:35:19,090
grow is there anything that already

2263
01:35:15,429 --> 01:35:21,760
exists that does all that and you know

2264
01:35:19,090 --> 01:35:24,400
matches up to my wishlist why don't I

2265
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:26,590
try buying some of those seeds and if

2266
01:35:24,399 --> 01:35:28,000
they aren't exactly what I want isn't

2267
01:35:26,590 --> 01:35:29,650
that a great place to start your

2268
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:32,350
breeding project with something that was

2269
01:35:29,649 --> 01:35:34,839
geez you know touted to be what I really

2270
01:35:32,350 --> 01:35:36,610
want and it wasn't quite what I wanted

2271
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:38,590
but if I were to breed it a couple of

2272
01:35:36,609 --> 01:35:41,829
generations just some back crossing

2273
01:35:38,590 --> 01:35:43,869
maybe I might have something here but

2274
01:35:41,829 --> 01:35:47,710
you know she was a good starting place

2275
01:35:43,869 --> 01:35:49,960
no I don't know so that make sense yes

2276
01:35:47,710 --> 01:35:52,090
so with that same kind of thought in

2277
01:35:49,960 --> 01:35:54,310
mind and how do you feel about breeders

2278
01:35:52,090 --> 01:35:56,920
using your work and more specifically

2279
01:35:54,310 --> 01:35:58,810
I'll give you a few examples how do you

2280
01:35:56,920 --> 01:36:02,079
feel about a breeder using one of your

2281
01:35:58,810 --> 01:36:05,640
strains in an f1 how do you feel about a

2282
01:36:02,079 --> 01:36:07,988
breeder selling say not Cindy because

2283
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:11,789
you'll understand why but maybe say the

2284
01:36:07,988 --> 01:36:17,250
Apollo and just say the pure f4 form and

2285
01:36:11,789 --> 01:36:19,079
how do you feel about someone selling

2286
01:36:17,250 --> 01:36:21,810
cross that maybe they have knives even

2287
01:36:19,079 --> 01:36:24,029
f1 Cindy then tighten to the f4 as

2288
01:36:21,810 --> 01:36:27,960
opposed to just the pure Apollo a Titan

2289
01:36:24,029 --> 01:36:30,119
to the m4 I feel that it's always a

2290
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:33,930
compliment whenever anybody uses

2291
01:36:30,119 --> 01:36:35,909
Brothers Grimm seed stock and creates

2292
01:36:33,930 --> 01:36:39,480
something from it if they've taken

2293
01:36:35,909 --> 01:36:42,359
Apollo 13 to f4 and it's done

2294
01:36:39,479 --> 01:36:43,559
intelligently I mean it's another thing

2295
01:36:42,359 --> 01:36:45,029
that I think that newbies don't

2296
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:47,190
understand is that they think maybe a

2297
01:36:45,029 --> 01:36:49,979
bigger number means better you know like

2298
01:36:47,189 --> 01:36:51,179
a four-star general is you know asthma

2299
01:36:49,979 --> 01:36:54,689
higher rank than a three-star general

2300
01:36:51,180 --> 01:36:58,950
and a f3 f4 is better than an f3 well

2301
01:36:54,689 --> 01:37:02,789
that may be only if the steps along the

2302
01:36:58,949 --> 01:37:05,130
way from f1 to f2 to f2 to f3 and so on

2303
01:37:02,789 --> 01:37:07,409
were done intelligently and correctly

2304
01:37:05,130 --> 01:37:08,940
then yeah you are improving in each

2305
01:37:07,409 --> 01:37:12,210
generation but just don't go by the

2306
01:37:08,939 --> 01:37:14,819
number as long as people understand what

2307
01:37:12,210 --> 01:37:17,640
that all means and I know that you know

2308
01:37:14,819 --> 01:37:20,189
the general public probably doesn't to a

2309
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:22,050
large degree understand the terminology

2310
01:37:20,189 --> 01:37:24,479
and what they're really buying and so on

2311
01:37:22,050 --> 01:37:26,130
so you won't be able to reach everybody

2312
01:37:24,479 --> 01:37:28,289
but you're asking for advice to people

2313
01:37:26,130 --> 01:37:32,420
who are in the know and would know

2314
01:37:28,289 --> 01:37:34,500
better and so on and my advice is yeah I

2315
01:37:32,420 --> 01:37:36,270
know I had a good point going there

2316
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:36,840
don't let me lose it what was the

2317
01:37:36,270 --> 01:37:39,270
question again

2318
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:41,220
oh you how they how I feel about them

2319
01:37:39,270 --> 01:37:44,010
using my stuff so it's a compliment that

2320
01:37:41,220 --> 01:37:46,590
they do that the people who are the

2321
01:37:44,010 --> 01:37:51,079
buyers are probably not savvy enough to

2322
01:37:46,590 --> 01:37:53,190
really in in any great numbers

2323
01:37:51,079 --> 01:37:55,979
differentiate you know what's going on

2324
01:37:53,189 --> 01:37:58,579
there but I believe that it'll all sort

2325
01:37:55,979 --> 01:38:01,019
of settle to a common denominator where

2326
01:37:58,579 --> 01:38:03,899
everyone no matter who you are whether

2327
01:38:01,020 --> 01:38:05,520
you're buying soap or electronics or

2328
01:38:03,899 --> 01:38:07,920
whatever it is you don't buy the

2329
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:09,750
knockoff you buy the real thing if you

2330
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:12,300
know it exists it's and it's available

2331
01:38:09,750 --> 01:38:15,390
and there's no real price difference to

2332
01:38:12,300 --> 01:38:16,949
consider you go with the name-brand

2333
01:38:15,390 --> 01:38:18,030
you know and the originator of

2334
01:38:16,949 --> 01:38:19,529
Cinderella 19

2335
01:38:18,029 --> 01:38:23,969
his Brothers Grimm so if someone were

2336
01:38:19,529 --> 01:38:26,189
doing a knockoff of Cinderella 99 two

2337
01:38:23,970 --> 01:38:29,670
things come to mind about that you know

2338
01:38:26,189 --> 01:38:33,809
for the present I think of it as well

2339
01:38:29,670 --> 01:38:38,159
the guy who's doing that is probably at

2340
01:38:33,810 --> 01:38:40,260
this point gonna want to just either

2341
01:38:38,159 --> 01:38:42,269
sell out all of his stock or realize

2342
01:38:40,260 --> 01:38:43,860
that it's sort of worthless because only

2343
01:38:42,270 --> 01:38:45,240
somebody who's not in the know and

2344
01:38:43,859 --> 01:38:46,559
doesn't realize that they could get the

2345
01:38:45,239 --> 01:38:48,960
real thing would even want to buy that

2346
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:50,640
so she'd probably have a fire sale and

2347
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:52,470
just get rid of as much of it as he can

2348
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:55,020
as freebies for buying you know here's a

2349
01:38:52,470 --> 01:38:57,150
promotional pack of our knockoffs t99

2350
01:38:55,020 --> 01:38:59,880
that you is free with anything we sell

2351
01:38:57,149 --> 01:39:01,769
you know and get rid of it because it's

2352
01:38:59,880 --> 01:39:03,840
like stock that has suddenly dropped to

2353
01:39:01,770 --> 01:39:06,990
zero values over holding on to you might

2354
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:08,610
as well get rid of it right so there's

2355
01:39:06,989 --> 01:39:13,380
the present that's the present situation

2356
01:39:08,609 --> 01:39:15,960
but the past that led up to the present

2357
01:39:13,380 --> 01:39:18,720
if you think about it none of these guys

2358
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:22,500
ever played with Cinderella 99 made

2359
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:24,150
crosses with it Polo's and the names

2360
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:26,130
weren't bandied about for this last

2361
01:39:24,149 --> 01:39:28,079
dozen years and I come back into the

2362
01:39:26,130 --> 01:39:30,720
business where would I be I'd be sitting

2363
01:39:28,079 --> 01:39:32,609
here trying to remind everybody who the

2364
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:36,300
hell I was what my strains were you know

2365
01:39:32,609 --> 01:39:39,569
the so they actually kept the buzz alive

2366
01:39:36,300 --> 01:39:42,150
and I am complimented by the fact that

2367
01:39:39,569 --> 01:39:45,229
they were so you know driven to continue

2368
01:39:42,149 --> 01:39:47,789
in our absence the the work if you will

2369
01:39:45,229 --> 01:39:50,029
I've only tried a couple of people's

2370
01:39:47,789 --> 01:39:52,979
knockoffs and you know obviously

2371
01:39:50,029 --> 01:39:54,420
something went awry somewhere they got

2372
01:39:52,979 --> 01:39:56,279
something from somebody who claimed that

2373
01:39:54,420 --> 01:39:57,960
it was c99 it wasn't or something

2374
01:39:56,279 --> 01:39:59,189
because the plants that I've seen that

2375
01:39:57,960 --> 01:40:01,230
were grown from the seeds that I've been

2376
01:39:59,189 --> 01:40:03,679
given by the knockoff companies just

2377
01:40:01,229 --> 01:40:06,299
come out looking like Cinderella 99 or

2378
01:40:03,680 --> 01:40:09,450
anything that no it's not it's not

2379
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:11,340
really even close so story yeah and that

2380
01:40:09,449 --> 01:40:12,929
happens it's like the story that tell is

2381
01:40:11,340 --> 01:40:14,220
told at one end of the classroom gets to

2382
01:40:12,930 --> 01:40:15,780
the other end of the classroom and it's

2383
01:40:14,220 --> 01:40:17,850
totally different from where it started

2384
01:40:15,779 --> 01:40:20,550
and you can imagine in the 14 years that

2385
01:40:17,850 --> 01:40:24,690
it took to go from shutting down in 2002

2386
01:40:20,550 --> 01:40:28,130
and coming back up in 2016 now that

2387
01:40:24,689 --> 01:40:30,349
story has gone all around

2388
01:40:28,130 --> 01:40:34,969
upside down and who knows what's what

2389
01:40:30,350 --> 01:40:37,030
anymore so push reap now push the reset

2390
01:40:34,969 --> 01:40:39,619
button then you can obtain the original

2391
01:40:37,029 --> 01:40:42,250
strains from the original breeder and

2392
01:40:39,619 --> 01:40:44,359
you know easy now to and now we're

2393
01:40:42,250 --> 01:40:49,420
internationally distributed worldwide

2394
01:40:44,359 --> 01:40:52,399
and easy to get no more complaining so

2395
01:40:49,420 --> 01:40:54,319
there seems to be a current fad in the

2396
01:40:52,399 --> 01:40:57,619
breeding community for people wanting to

2397
01:40:54,319 --> 01:41:00,380
take things to like say the f2 or the f3

2398
01:40:57,619 --> 01:41:03,079
as opposed to say doing a B x2 or a B X

2399
01:41:00,380 --> 01:41:04,639
3 how do you think these two techniques

2400
01:41:03,079 --> 01:41:06,920
compare to each other they've obviously

2401
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:08,630
got there's different reasons why you

2402
01:41:06,920 --> 01:41:10,279
should do them but I'm of the opinion

2403
01:41:08,630 --> 01:41:12,500
that maybe some people just do it

2404
01:41:10,279 --> 01:41:14,300
because it seems like they've put in a

2405
01:41:12,500 --> 01:41:17,350
lot of work or something like that like

2406
01:41:14,300 --> 01:41:19,760
how do you feel yeah you know I'd say

2407
01:41:17,350 --> 01:41:22,250
exceptional people are in the minority

2408
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:24,260
by definition right I mean the average

2409
01:41:22,250 --> 01:41:26,179
person is probably gonna make a lot of

2410
01:41:24,260 --> 01:41:28,489
mistakes and do a lot of guesswork and

2411
01:41:26,179 --> 01:41:30,050
say well maybe this will you know they

2412
01:41:28,488 --> 01:41:32,238
don't have a rhyme or reason for what

2413
01:41:30,050 --> 01:41:34,239
they're doing so that's a major fault

2414
01:41:32,238 --> 01:41:36,738
right there but then when people are

2415
01:41:34,238 --> 01:41:39,589
intelligent about their choices and they

2416
01:41:36,738 --> 01:41:40,879
say okay what am I doing here and they

2417
01:41:39,590 --> 01:41:42,590
ask all these questions that I always

2418
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:44,210
advocate you ask yourself like you know

2419
01:41:42,590 --> 01:41:45,860
what is it that I really want my ideal

2420
01:41:44,210 --> 01:41:49,359
plant where am I going with this what's

2421
01:41:45,859 --> 01:41:53,259
the end what's the end goal and

2422
01:41:49,359 --> 01:41:56,509
traditionally you had this crossing of

2423
01:41:53,260 --> 01:42:00,469
one land race to another and so you'd

2424
01:41:56,510 --> 01:42:01,730
have your p1 generation these two land

2425
01:42:00,469 --> 01:42:06,050
race strains and then you create a

2426
01:42:01,729 --> 01:42:08,809
hybrid from that an f1 generation now in

2427
01:42:06,050 --> 01:42:10,369
that f1 generation you're gonna see a

2428
01:42:08,810 --> 01:42:17,300
certain ratio that everybody's familiar

2429
01:42:10,369 --> 01:42:19,519
with 1 3 1 and you then decide if you

2430
01:42:17,300 --> 01:42:22,400
were crossing these two to start with

2431
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:26,690
neither one of them p1 generation

2432
01:42:22,399 --> 01:42:28,488
parents was the ideal plant right but

2433
01:42:26,689 --> 01:42:29,750
must have had some characteristics that

2434
01:42:28,488 --> 01:42:30,979
you felt were important and the other

2435
01:42:29,750 --> 01:42:33,020
one did too and that's why you're

2436
01:42:30,979 --> 01:42:34,309
bringing them together otherwise you

2437
01:42:33,020 --> 01:42:35,829
would have just stayed with either one

2438
01:42:34,310 --> 01:42:38,020
of those plants and said hey I'm

2439
01:42:35,828 --> 01:42:40,448
with these what's the point of trying to

2440
01:42:38,020 --> 01:42:41,920
improve on something that I feel is

2441
01:42:40,448 --> 01:42:43,988
already perfect why reinvent the wheel

2442
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:45,699
yeah so you're constantly asking

2443
01:42:43,988 --> 01:42:47,709
yourself where we going why am I doing

2444
01:42:45,698 --> 01:42:51,868
this what is it that I what are my goals

2445
01:42:47,710 --> 01:42:56,529
and if back crossing comes into play

2446
01:42:51,868 --> 01:42:59,979
it's because one of those two parents is

2447
01:42:56,529 --> 01:43:01,929
heavily carries he's carrying heavily

2448
01:42:59,979 --> 01:43:03,819
many of the characteristics that you are

2449
01:43:01,929 --> 01:43:05,559
trying to go for in the goal and the

2450
01:43:03,819 --> 01:43:09,009
other one was contributing for some

2451
01:43:05,559 --> 01:43:12,010
minor reason okay but if they're sort of

2452
01:43:09,010 --> 01:43:15,340
equally contributing there's not much

2453
01:43:12,010 --> 01:43:19,300
reason to back cross but then you start

2454
01:43:15,340 --> 01:43:21,190
looking at that larger group that came

2455
01:43:19,300 --> 01:43:24,159
from the f1 generation that has the

2456
01:43:21,189 --> 01:43:26,319
variations in it that isn't the oh these

2457
01:43:24,158 --> 01:43:28,089
are just you know clones the mum this is

2458
01:43:26,319 --> 01:43:30,819
just the clones of dad you know that

2459
01:43:28,090 --> 01:43:33,760
that jet that part that proportion of

2460
01:43:30,819 --> 01:43:36,158
your progeny that falls into that

2461
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:39,520
category and you concentrate on the ones

2462
01:43:36,158 --> 01:43:41,049
that varied and are some mix of the two

2463
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:42,550
because isn't that what you're going for

2464
01:43:41,050 --> 01:43:44,590
right you're looking to mix them and

2465
01:43:42,550 --> 01:43:47,619
blend them in some way but it doesn't

2466
01:43:44,590 --> 01:43:50,800
always work like a blender but in the f1

2467
01:43:47,618 --> 01:43:52,929
generation that larger population is

2468
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:55,539
generally like a blender so there is a

2469
01:43:52,929 --> 01:43:57,130
great tendency for them to be an equal

2470
01:43:55,539 --> 01:43:58,448
balance of the two and if that's what

2471
01:43:57,130 --> 01:43:59,920
you're going through you've already

2472
01:43:58,448 --> 01:44:02,348
arrived you've got the pack of seeds

2473
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:05,380
that you just keep crossing that mother

2474
01:44:02,349 --> 01:44:06,969
and father ad infinitum and why go any

2475
01:44:05,380 --> 01:44:10,300
further is there a reason to create an

2476
01:44:06,969 --> 01:44:13,948
f2 or a three or four no no we're the

2477
01:44:10,300 --> 01:44:16,659
end goal is and stop there so what's

2478
01:44:13,948 --> 01:44:18,250
presumably from that f1 generation the

2479
01:44:16,658 --> 01:44:21,789
person who looks to make an f2

2480
01:44:18,250 --> 01:44:23,859
generation is saying I see a phenotype

2481
01:44:21,789 --> 01:44:26,198
in here that I want to isolate and then

2482
01:44:23,859 --> 01:44:29,109
further refine in the next generation

2483
01:44:26,198 --> 01:44:32,500
such that more of the progeny are of

2484
01:44:29,109 --> 01:44:35,170
that type yeah yeah so you have to

2485
01:44:32,500 --> 01:44:36,520
intelligently choose the F ones that

2486
01:44:35,170 --> 01:44:39,520
you're going to use to make your f2

2487
01:44:36,520 --> 01:44:40,780
generation maybe do it with several of

2488
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:42,790
the brothers and sisters so that you

2489
01:44:40,779 --> 01:44:44,139
have a few different groups to try to

2490
01:44:42,789 --> 01:44:46,090
see

2491
01:44:44,140 --> 01:44:47,980
now I'm starting to see a rhyme or a

2492
01:44:46,090 --> 01:44:50,980
reason here which ones actually do what

2493
01:44:47,979 --> 01:44:53,199
I want to do then you intelligently

2494
01:44:50,979 --> 01:44:54,519
choose from them how to make your f3

2495
01:44:53,199 --> 01:44:56,710
generation if that isn't where you

2496
01:44:54,520 --> 01:44:58,390
really wanted to go yeah and then you're

2497
01:44:56,710 --> 01:45:01,239
looking for stability are we starting to

2498
01:44:58,390 --> 01:45:02,500
get now all the females are like you

2499
01:45:01,239 --> 01:45:04,569
know and they all have the great

2500
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:09,310
qualities that I want you know and those

2501
01:45:04,569 --> 01:45:11,349
are the reasons to accept the challenge

2502
01:45:09,310 --> 01:45:13,390
of going one more generation and trying

2503
01:45:11,350 --> 01:45:16,390
to find the right mothers and fathers to

2504
01:45:13,390 --> 01:45:18,100
give you that seed that you can throw in

2505
01:45:16,390 --> 01:45:20,470
the ground and reliably say I know what

2506
01:45:18,100 --> 01:45:21,600
I'm gonna get here every time if that's

2507
01:45:20,470 --> 01:45:24,400
your goal

2508
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:26,620
okay but yeah I mean that's that's how

2509
01:45:24,399 --> 01:45:29,259
an intelligent breeder goes about

2510
01:45:26,619 --> 01:45:32,340
working toward creating a strain or

2511
01:45:29,260 --> 01:45:35,650
getting a plant and I think that

2512
01:45:32,340 --> 01:45:37,569
listening to going back if you rewind

2513
01:45:35,649 --> 01:45:41,979
through this and you see how starting

2514
01:45:37,569 --> 01:45:43,989
from a and B mother and father blending

2515
01:45:41,979 --> 01:45:45,819
them together and having a goal and

2516
01:45:43,989 --> 01:45:47,349
asking yourself in each generation am I

2517
01:45:45,819 --> 01:45:49,779
getting there and what am i doing right

2518
01:45:47,350 --> 01:45:51,789
or wrong and adjusting for that that's

2519
01:45:49,779 --> 01:45:54,309
how each generation gets better and if

2520
01:45:51,789 --> 01:45:57,029
you don't get a better generation you

2521
01:45:54,310 --> 01:46:00,010
better go back and you fix something

2522
01:45:57,029 --> 01:46:02,619
because there's no point moving on when

2523
01:46:00,010 --> 01:46:06,070
you have an f3 generation that just is

2524
01:46:02,619 --> 01:46:07,539
dismal compared to f2 you better go back

2525
01:46:06,069 --> 01:46:09,699
in the f2 generation either across

2526
01:46:07,539 --> 01:46:12,489
different brothers and sisters to get a

2527
01:46:09,699 --> 01:46:14,409
better result org realized that f2 is

2528
01:46:12,489 --> 01:46:16,449
where you need to stop with this and you

2529
01:46:14,409 --> 01:46:20,680
may actually have created a seed strain

2530
01:46:16,449 --> 01:46:24,189
that that generation when sold to the

2531
01:46:20,680 --> 01:46:26,320
customer is producing an amazing plant

2532
01:46:24,189 --> 01:46:29,139
however if he tries to play for us his

2533
01:46:26,319 --> 01:46:31,599
mother the females and males he's going

2534
01:46:29,140 --> 01:46:34,329
to get [ __ ] they need to buy back seized

2535
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:36,430
people in many other communities not the

2536
01:46:34,329 --> 01:46:39,909
cannabis community as much or maybe not

2537
01:46:36,430 --> 01:46:43,470
as vocally have used that strategy you

2538
01:46:39,909 --> 01:46:46,389
know for all of history basically

2539
01:46:43,470 --> 01:46:48,329
sellers of seeds of all different types

2540
01:46:46,390 --> 01:46:50,250
of flowers and so on and veg

2541
01:46:48,329 --> 01:46:52,979
and prized tomatoes or what have you

2542
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:55,350
they want you to not be able to just

2543
01:46:52,979 --> 01:46:56,609
make more of their seeds that they sell

2544
01:46:55,350 --> 01:46:58,140
do they want you they want to come back

2545
01:46:56,609 --> 01:46:59,579
and they want you to come back to repeat

2546
01:46:58,140 --> 01:47:01,710
business they and that's the sort of

2547
01:46:59,579 --> 01:47:02,970
thing so that may have been a part of

2548
01:47:01,710 --> 01:47:06,390
somebody's goal in a breeding program

2549
01:47:02,970 --> 01:47:08,699
right yeah so that might have been like

2550
01:47:06,390 --> 01:47:10,289
wow this is great look at the result

2551
01:47:08,699 --> 01:47:13,199
we're getting the f2 generation is like

2552
01:47:10,289 --> 01:47:14,640
this is amazing plant but when you press

2553
01:47:13,199 --> 01:47:17,309
the brothers and sisters the f3

2554
01:47:14,640 --> 01:47:20,220
generation just falls apart

2555
01:47:17,310 --> 01:47:23,090
perfect let's keep making F twos and

2556
01:47:20,220 --> 01:47:26,039
selling those seats yeah and you're good

2557
01:47:23,090 --> 01:47:29,340
yeah so there's some on the santur level

2558
01:47:26,039 --> 01:47:30,960
stuff yeah so yeah it smacks of Monsanto

2559
01:47:29,340 --> 01:47:35,130
but you know I'm just talking about

2560
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:38,159
every possibility what could be possible

2561
01:47:35,130 --> 01:47:41,789
whether you know sounds of morally just

2562
01:47:38,159 --> 01:47:42,960
or nefarious or what you know so I mean

2563
01:47:41,789 --> 01:47:45,329
if we were to think about the

2564
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:47,069
epigenetics of seeds you mentioned

2565
01:47:45,329 --> 01:47:48,269
earlier that the soil we have now is

2566
01:47:47,069 --> 01:47:50,519
much better than the soil we had before

2567
01:47:48,270 --> 01:47:52,080
how do you find the seeds we have

2568
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:54,480
Cinderella for example are coming out

2569
01:47:52,079 --> 01:47:56,489
now versus before do you see they're

2570
01:47:54,479 --> 01:47:58,679
about the same germination ratio or do

2571
01:47:56,489 --> 01:48:00,929
you think that as our you know input

2572
01:47:58,680 --> 01:48:03,630
ingredients have improved so as the seed

2573
01:48:00,930 --> 01:48:06,539
output quality no I don't think so I

2574
01:48:03,630 --> 01:48:09,090
mean they because of a better

2575
01:48:06,539 --> 01:48:10,170
nutritional program that they're on now

2576
01:48:09,090 --> 01:48:12,659
you think is that what your question

2577
01:48:10,170 --> 01:48:15,119
like they may have we've got dentists or

2578
01:48:12,659 --> 01:48:18,090
a better understanding of how slow truly

2579
01:48:15,119 --> 01:48:19,649
built-in complete I don't know it's

2580
01:48:18,090 --> 01:48:21,930
difficult to say we had great

2581
01:48:19,649 --> 01:48:23,969
germination rate back in the 90s with

2582
01:48:21,930 --> 01:48:26,070
what I was doing then and you know I

2583
01:48:23,970 --> 01:48:27,960
think when I see this form that's formed

2584
01:48:26,069 --> 01:48:31,739
it's you know it's gonna be healthy it's

2585
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:33,480
it may be larger you know if it had it

2586
01:48:31,739 --> 01:48:36,269
had more energy devoted to it while it

2587
01:48:33,479 --> 01:48:37,939
was growing many times we see that like

2588
01:48:36,270 --> 01:48:41,130
when you just pollinate a few of the

2589
01:48:37,939 --> 01:48:43,019
sort of pre flowers on a veg plant and

2590
01:48:41,130 --> 01:48:45,359
they end up growing you see that's often

2591
01:48:43,020 --> 01:48:46,920
time a big one isn't it yeah so when the

2592
01:48:45,359 --> 01:48:50,189
plant has a lot of energy to be able to

2593
01:48:46,920 --> 01:48:53,970
devote to it the seed gets larger so I

2594
01:48:50,189 --> 01:48:57,059
would say if I start just to notice like

2595
01:48:53,970 --> 01:48:59,249
the seeds now that I'm making are bigger

2596
01:48:57,060 --> 01:49:01,829
and darker and healthier than the

2597
01:48:59,248 --> 01:49:03,569
I remember from back in the day then I

2598
01:49:01,828 --> 01:49:05,698
would say yeah that's right

2599
01:49:03,569 --> 01:49:07,259
I don't think it's to a degree that's a

2600
01:49:05,698 --> 01:49:10,259
you know noticeable though I haven't

2601
01:49:07,260 --> 01:49:12,360
said to myself wow it's not like the old

2602
01:49:10,260 --> 01:49:15,150
days these are really much bigger and

2603
01:49:12,359 --> 01:49:19,139
darker I think I had healthy seeds then

2604
01:49:15,149 --> 01:49:21,839
you know yeah so would you consider

2605
01:49:19,139 --> 01:49:24,150
doing a limited release kind of similar

2606
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:26,038
to how the original Apollo 13 was done

2607
01:49:24,149 --> 01:49:28,348
and if you did would you do it in a

2608
01:49:26,038 --> 01:49:29,728
similar way because there is a small

2609
01:49:28,349 --> 01:49:31,078
trend in the breeding community for

2610
01:49:29,729 --> 01:49:33,300
people to do very limited release

2611
01:49:31,078 --> 01:49:35,609
batches and consequently that the cost

2612
01:49:33,300 --> 01:49:37,920
per pack is sometimes astronomical

2613
01:49:35,609 --> 01:49:39,328
sometimes quite justifiable uh-huh how

2614
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:41,699
would you feel about doing it if you

2615
01:49:39,328 --> 01:49:43,978
were to do it well I think just doing

2616
01:49:41,698 --> 01:49:47,638
something in a limited quality as in

2617
01:49:43,979 --> 01:49:50,400
limited quantity so that you would have

2618
01:49:47,639 --> 01:49:53,699
fewer of them to sell and drive demand

2619
01:49:50,399 --> 01:49:56,848
and price up and that's not how I would

2620
01:49:53,698 --> 01:50:00,149
like to do things if it were released in

2621
01:49:56,849 --> 01:50:01,979
a small quantity it's just because we

2622
01:50:00,149 --> 01:50:06,569
only had this small quantity we don't

2623
01:50:01,979 --> 01:50:09,780
intend to do anything more with this it

2624
01:50:06,569 --> 01:50:11,998
was a side project and I would tend to

2625
01:50:09,779 --> 01:50:13,920
charge a low price for it or give it

2626
01:50:11,998 --> 01:50:16,139
away as it free me when people bought

2627
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:18,019
our other strains you know and I guess

2628
01:50:16,139 --> 01:50:24,599
that was the case with the Apollo 13

2629
01:50:18,019 --> 01:50:26,909
kind of back in that time I was giving

2630
01:50:24,599 --> 01:50:29,429
them to Richard at heaven's stairway and

2631
01:50:26,908 --> 01:50:32,670
he was sort of making those marketing

2632
01:50:29,429 --> 01:50:35,368
decisions as to should I sell these or

2633
01:50:32,670 --> 01:50:37,979
you know and how many of them he had and

2634
01:50:35,368 --> 01:50:39,960
he decided to sell them but it was only

2635
01:50:37,979 --> 01:50:42,690
the one batch and I didn't have more so

2636
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:45,929
he sold out of whatever 500 seeds or

2637
01:50:42,689 --> 01:50:48,149
maybe 50 packs and and that was that and

2638
01:50:45,929 --> 01:50:50,269
so we recreated it this year but I

2639
01:50:48,149 --> 01:50:52,738
didn't want to again you know do it

2640
01:50:50,269 --> 01:50:54,059
forever but we made a lot more than the

2641
01:50:52,738 --> 01:50:56,069
first time so that there's plenty

2642
01:50:54,059 --> 01:50:58,979
available for everyone so they can

2643
01:50:56,069 --> 01:51:00,599
really see what that was but Apollo 11

2644
01:50:58,979 --> 01:51:04,110
was really the goal and we'll make that

2645
01:51:00,599 --> 01:51:06,239
as a reliably you know appearance

2646
01:51:04,109 --> 01:51:06,389
appearing on our menu all the time kind

2647
01:51:06,238 --> 01:51:10,109
of

2648
01:51:06,390 --> 01:51:12,450
strain but Apollo 13 for the moment I

2649
01:51:10,109 --> 01:51:13,469
think we made quite a good lot of it and

2650
01:51:12,449 --> 01:51:16,229
when it's gone

2651
01:51:13,470 --> 01:51:20,850
we won't immediately replaced with okay

2652
01:51:16,229 --> 01:51:23,489
yes still semi semi unique so people

2653
01:51:20,850 --> 01:51:25,560
sometimes talk about returning to our

2654
01:51:23,489 --> 01:51:27,359
land race roots and we already mentioned

2655
01:51:25,560 --> 01:51:30,630
that Brothers Grimm is working with the

2656
01:51:27,359 --> 01:51:33,539
Durban would you ever consider crossing

2657
01:51:30,630 --> 01:51:35,489
it to another land race or heirloom so

2658
01:51:33,539 --> 01:51:38,640
to speak and really trying to work out

2659
01:51:35,489 --> 01:51:44,510
those raw genetics you know like a

2660
01:51:38,640 --> 01:51:47,369
somewhat unseen waiver for sea that's

2661
01:51:44,510 --> 01:51:51,770
always on the table I mean when you feel

2662
01:51:47,369 --> 01:51:55,829
like hey I've been thinking about a

2663
01:51:51,770 --> 01:51:58,020
project and it doesn't necessarily have

2664
01:51:55,829 --> 01:52:00,779
to come from what we already have on our

2665
01:51:58,020 --> 01:52:03,480
palate you know I could be out on a trip

2666
01:52:00,779 --> 01:52:05,969
somewhere and make a point of going to

2667
01:52:03,479 --> 01:52:08,669
someplace where I think I'm gonna go out

2668
01:52:05,970 --> 01:52:11,760
and do like a land race seed expedition

2669
01:52:08,670 --> 01:52:14,130
and come back with some cool stuff and

2670
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:15,840
who knows in our future you know I'm an

2671
01:52:14,130 --> 01:52:17,520
adventurous type of person and I'd like

2672
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:19,409
to probably do that one of these times

2673
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:22,290
so yeah what would be wrong with that

2674
01:52:19,409 --> 01:52:24,659
I would only hesitate to do that if it

2675
01:52:22,289 --> 01:52:26,850
was just like you know to slap two

2676
01:52:24,659 --> 01:52:29,119
things together we don't do that you

2677
01:52:26,850 --> 01:52:31,890
know we always have some purpose like a

2678
01:52:29,119 --> 01:52:35,279
forethought of why are we crossing these

2679
01:52:31,890 --> 01:52:37,740
two what's the what's the goal and make

2680
01:52:35,279 --> 01:52:39,300
maybe at some point I go somewhere and I

2681
01:52:37,739 --> 01:52:40,889
find something unique and interesting

2682
01:52:39,300 --> 01:52:42,390
that I think like oh this would be a

2683
01:52:40,890 --> 01:52:44,880
great project to cross this with

2684
01:52:42,390 --> 01:52:46,950
whatever else I mean then I'd do it but

2685
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:50,699
you know it'd have to be thought out a

2686
01:52:46,949 --> 01:52:52,949
little bit say you know just just from

2687
01:52:50,699 --> 01:52:54,960
the way your brain works you kind of I

2688
01:52:52,949 --> 01:52:55,769
get the feel that you're always intended

2689
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:58,590
to be afraid of

2690
01:52:55,770 --> 01:53:01,650
was it the discovery of those seeds that

2691
01:52:58,590 --> 01:53:03,329
really plant the seed in your mind to do

2692
01:53:01,649 --> 01:53:04,829
the greeting was it like these seeds are

2693
01:53:03,329 --> 01:53:07,128
so amazing I've got a breathing or were

2694
01:53:04,829 --> 01:53:10,559
you always kind of proof we think

2695
01:53:07,128 --> 01:53:13,798
dealings with SS SC I think it was more

2696
01:53:10,559 --> 01:53:17,010
a sense of preservation of the judgment

2697
01:53:13,798 --> 01:53:19,198
genetics for myself and not not losing

2698
01:53:17,010 --> 01:53:22,229
them I kind of wanted to say like what

2699
01:53:19,198 --> 01:53:24,658
if ever you know I shut down and I want

2700
01:53:22,229 --> 01:53:27,239
to be able to start up I'd like to have

2701
01:53:24,658 --> 01:53:28,828
seeds that could replace the clones I've

2702
01:53:27,238 --> 01:53:31,828
been drawing it growing you know or

2703
01:53:28,828 --> 01:53:35,938
whatever that was one emotion I had and

2704
01:53:31,828 --> 01:53:38,548
I just feel like growing the plants and

2705
01:53:35,939 --> 01:53:40,559
is one part of it but seeing that

2706
01:53:38,548 --> 01:53:44,219
progression of when you're crossing them

2707
01:53:40,559 --> 01:53:47,369
and breeding them is fascinating and to

2708
01:53:44,219 --> 01:53:49,889
try to get handles on that and you know

2709
01:53:47,368 --> 01:53:51,688
learn how to control it like anything

2710
01:53:49,889 --> 01:53:53,248
you know like became an engineer I think

2711
01:53:51,689 --> 01:53:55,260
because I was always curious about how

2712
01:53:53,248 --> 01:53:56,908
does that work I don't want to walk

2713
01:53:55,260 --> 01:53:59,099
through the world and not know why it

2714
01:53:56,908 --> 01:54:00,929
takes five seconds for the ball to fall

2715
01:53:59,099 --> 01:54:03,149
from the hundred foot bridge or whatever

2716
01:54:00,929 --> 01:54:06,479
you know Matt I'd like to be able to

2717
01:54:03,149 --> 01:54:08,459
work that out so when I see all of this

2718
01:54:06,479 --> 01:54:11,128
coming together like building blocks and

2719
01:54:08,458 --> 01:54:14,578
you know it gives me great joy and

2720
01:54:11,128 --> 01:54:16,948
satisfaction to feel like I have some

2721
01:54:14,578 --> 01:54:19,259
control over that remember when I first

2722
01:54:16,948 --> 01:54:21,448
got sparked my interest to be a grower

2723
01:54:19,260 --> 01:54:24,208
in the first place is learning that you

2724
01:54:21,448 --> 01:54:27,748
mean that photo period and the 12 hours

2725
01:54:24,208 --> 01:54:31,198
of the 18 I can stall time or forced it

2726
01:54:27,748 --> 01:54:33,898
into flowering learning that was so you

2727
01:54:31,198 --> 01:54:37,618
know inspiring that it really launched

2728
01:54:33,899 --> 01:54:39,779
me my motivation from that point so were

2729
01:54:37,618 --> 01:54:42,929
there ever any strains you smokes

2730
01:54:39,779 --> 01:54:44,279
while you were in between the first and

2731
01:54:42,929 --> 01:54:45,119
the current incarnation of Brothers

2732
01:54:44,279 --> 01:54:46,830
Grimm

2733
01:54:45,119 --> 01:54:48,809
you were smoking them and you just kind

2734
01:54:46,829 --> 01:54:51,000
of thought well like if I ever come back

2735
01:54:48,810 --> 01:54:53,670
I want to work with that or maybe now

2736
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:55,829
I'm also thinking back you thought of a

2737
01:54:53,670 --> 01:54:57,600
certain strain you had during the hiatus

2738
01:54:55,829 --> 01:55:02,519
and thought yeah we need to work with

2739
01:54:57,600 --> 01:55:04,530
that hmm yeah you know I always come

2740
01:55:02,520 --> 01:55:05,700
back to the Durbin tie and say like you

2741
01:55:04,529 --> 01:55:08,340
know that was something that I would

2742
01:55:05,699 --> 01:55:10,590
love to try to get get ourselves back

2743
01:55:08,340 --> 01:55:13,020
into and we're working on that and I

2744
01:55:10,590 --> 01:55:16,110
think we will have a good one very soon

2745
01:55:13,020 --> 01:55:18,540
so and then like I said you know there's

2746
01:55:16,109 --> 01:55:21,049
a sense that during the time I had those

2747
01:55:18,539 --> 01:55:24,960
seeds and the access to everything I

2748
01:55:21,050 --> 01:55:27,390
never tried as much of it as I would

2749
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:29,939
have liked to have done and learned you

2750
01:55:27,390 --> 01:55:32,430
know like what I was missing Bey tricks

2751
01:55:29,939 --> 01:55:34,559
and Williams wondered those kinds of

2752
01:55:32,430 --> 01:55:37,050
things that huh I wonder what they were

2753
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:38,520
like you know if I went over the menu

2754
01:55:37,050 --> 01:55:40,470
and I looked at you know item by item

2755
01:55:38,520 --> 01:55:42,840
which ones I grew and which ones I have

2756
01:55:40,470 --> 01:55:44,750
some experience with you know there

2757
01:55:42,840 --> 01:55:47,550
would definitely be some where I'd go

2758
01:55:44,750 --> 01:55:49,800
yeah I wish I had during that time had

2759
01:55:47,550 --> 01:55:51,920
thought to myself to grow a little of

2760
01:55:49,800 --> 01:55:54,360
this and see what that was like but

2761
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:56,100
remember earlier when we almost started

2762
01:55:54,359 --> 01:55:57,779
the thing up you know there was that

2763
01:55:56,100 --> 01:55:59,070
question about you know do you realize

2764
01:55:57,779 --> 01:56:00,599
you're making history when you're making

2765
01:55:59,069 --> 01:56:02,759
history you don't you know and at the

2766
01:56:00,600 --> 01:56:05,250
time you're not really thinking like

2767
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:07,320
well one day this won't be here I won't

2768
01:56:05,250 --> 01:56:09,180
have it to try that other cam you know

2769
01:56:07,319 --> 01:56:11,130
over there of seeds and I just always

2770
01:56:09,180 --> 01:56:12,420
thought you know yeah I'm messing around

2771
01:56:11,130 --> 01:56:14,279
with this one and that one and that one

2772
01:56:12,420 --> 01:56:16,199
I'll get around to those ones someday

2773
01:56:14,279 --> 01:56:17,639
and then that someday never came and the

2774
01:56:16,199 --> 01:56:19,529
rug was kind of pulled out from under me

2775
01:56:17,640 --> 01:56:24,840
and I got married to a woman who wanted

2776
01:56:19,529 --> 01:56:27,689
me to give up marijuana so yeah let's

2777
01:56:24,840 --> 01:56:30,779
talk about lab percentages and most

2778
01:56:27,689 --> 01:56:33,509
specifically if you guys started getting

2779
01:56:30,779 --> 01:56:37,319
numbers that were like you trusted them

2780
01:56:33,510 --> 01:56:38,940
and they said why legitimately 15% but

2781
01:56:37,319 --> 01:56:40,529
you were really happy with the high you

2782
01:56:38,939 --> 01:56:42,599
swear I was killer

2783
01:56:40,529 --> 01:56:43,829
would you be happy to tell people those

2784
01:56:42,600 --> 01:56:46,350
numbers like I you of the belief that

2785
01:56:43,829 --> 01:56:49,350
the numbers of really kind of not a true

2786
01:56:46,350 --> 01:56:50,640
picture of what you're getting or do you

2787
01:56:49,350 --> 01:56:51,510
think that they are important in the

2788
01:56:50,640 --> 01:56:53,610
current climate

2789
01:56:51,510 --> 01:56:55,470
I think the reliability of the labs is

2790
01:56:53,609 --> 01:56:57,869
in question I know that there's a

2791
01:56:55,470 --> 01:56:59,850
motivation whenever you're in a business

2792
01:56:57,869 --> 01:57:01,859
like that and one of the biggest

2793
01:56:59,850 --> 01:57:03,570
examples I could give you a standard and

2794
01:57:01,859 --> 01:57:06,529
poor's and moody's when they were

2795
01:57:03,569 --> 01:57:09,750
evaluating stocks during the the whole

2796
01:57:06,529 --> 01:57:11,789
housing bubble they were competing with

2797
01:57:09,750 --> 01:57:14,819
each other for their customers business

2798
01:57:11,789 --> 01:57:18,569
and so consequently there they had to

2799
01:57:14,819 --> 01:57:20,549
rate the stocks higher than they would

2800
01:57:18,569 --> 01:57:22,380
have normally done if they didn't know

2801
01:57:20,550 --> 01:57:24,750
that their competitor would have rated

2802
01:57:22,380 --> 01:57:27,569
them high just to get the customers

2803
01:57:24,750 --> 01:57:29,189
business there's certainly that going on

2804
01:57:27,569 --> 01:57:31,500
right now there are labs who are just

2805
01:57:29,189 --> 01:57:33,689
bumping numbers more and more just to

2806
01:57:31,500 --> 01:57:36,300
say jeez you know where'd you get your

2807
01:57:33,689 --> 01:57:37,619
tested you know then the guys talk to

2808
01:57:36,300 --> 01:57:39,630
one another and then everybody goes

2809
01:57:37,619 --> 01:57:42,539
scrambling for that lab because they

2810
01:57:39,630 --> 01:57:44,400
give the big numbers come on I mean I

2811
01:57:42,539 --> 01:57:47,460
don't know I don't believe the numbers

2812
01:57:44,399 --> 01:57:49,139
it's there's there's no I don't think

2813
01:57:47,460 --> 01:57:51,569
there's enough standardization and

2814
01:57:49,140 --> 01:57:53,460
enough reliability to those numbers that

2815
01:57:51,569 --> 01:57:56,250
anybody can really say much about it

2816
01:57:53,460 --> 01:57:58,050
yeah maybe there are people who can do

2817
01:57:56,250 --> 01:57:59,489
but I don't think that those people are

2818
01:57:58,050 --> 01:58:04,409
the ones that most people are listening

2819
01:57:59,489 --> 01:58:09,029
to or working with but some group of

2820
01:58:04,409 --> 01:58:11,250
scientists say that oK we've done all of

2821
01:58:09,029 --> 01:58:13,679
the necessary testing and such just to

2822
01:58:11,250 --> 01:58:15,449
prove that this is true then it's

2823
01:58:13,680 --> 01:58:17,760
believable you know but I don't think

2824
01:58:15,449 --> 01:58:19,829
that everybody's using the right

2825
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:22,949
equipment or interpreting it properly

2826
01:58:19,829 --> 01:58:24,210
but if like I say you know the right

2827
01:58:22,949 --> 01:58:25,800
equipment and the right people who know

2828
01:58:24,210 --> 01:58:28,619
how to use that are saying that we've

2829
01:58:25,800 --> 01:58:32,070
calibrated all of this this is the true

2830
01:58:28,619 --> 01:58:35,130
number we'll stand on this you know for

2831
01:58:32,069 --> 01:58:38,989
all time going forward you'll never find

2832
01:58:35,130 --> 01:58:42,900
that we did this wrong we got it right

2833
01:58:38,989 --> 01:58:45,689
right you know but I don't see in the

2834
01:58:42,899 --> 01:58:47,489
forms that people hand out you know like

2835
01:58:45,689 --> 01:58:50,699
oh here's the piece of paper that said

2836
01:58:47,489 --> 01:58:51,198
you know the results come on a child fit

2837
01:58:50,699 --> 01:58:53,300
of Korea

2838
01:58:51,198 --> 01:58:55,159
the software program kicked those

2839
01:58:53,300 --> 01:58:57,350
numbers that make it look just the same

2840
01:58:55,159 --> 01:58:58,399
as that piece of paper right doesn't

2841
01:58:57,350 --> 01:59:00,860
prove anything

2842
01:58:58,399 --> 01:59:04,309
yes so I would like to see a lot more

2843
01:59:00,859 --> 01:59:06,079
you know a proof of is that number

2844
01:59:04,310 --> 01:59:08,420
believable is that something that's a

2845
01:59:06,079 --> 01:59:10,399
standard that everybody's using and and

2846
01:59:08,420 --> 01:59:13,699
everything else I don't I don't think

2847
01:59:10,399 --> 01:59:15,279
we're there for that yeah so and then

2848
01:59:13,698 --> 01:59:17,689
there's the greed and the motivation to

2849
01:59:15,279 --> 01:59:20,359
yeah have a higher number than the next

2850
01:59:17,689 --> 01:59:22,669
lab so what do you think is the future

2851
01:59:20,359 --> 01:59:25,269
of growing if we was sighted kind of

2852
01:59:22,670 --> 01:59:28,489
break it down into components of say

2853
01:59:25,270 --> 01:59:32,510
lighting technology growing mediums and

2854
01:59:28,488 --> 01:59:34,819
nutrients genetics what do you think

2855
01:59:32,510 --> 01:59:36,409
will be the next big leap we make it's

2856
01:59:34,819 --> 01:59:38,119
probably pretty easy to say that the

2857
01:59:36,409 --> 01:59:39,500
most recent leap is being in the

2858
01:59:38,119 --> 01:59:42,170
lighting with the advent of the

2859
01:59:39,500 --> 01:59:44,300
double-ended bulbs have you seen any

2860
01:59:42,170 --> 01:59:48,140
kind of new prototype technology we'll

2861
01:59:44,300 --> 01:59:49,789
just caught your eye nope the lighting

2862
01:59:48,140 --> 01:59:50,929
is the main thing really you know

2863
01:59:49,789 --> 01:59:55,729
because everything else is basically

2864
01:59:50,929 --> 02:00:06,829
HVAC and soil and what do we have

2865
01:59:55,729 --> 02:00:08,299
I don't know eyes own at MIT I missed

2866
02:00:06,829 --> 02:00:10,939
some things I don't know what do we talk

2867
02:00:08,300 --> 02:00:15,130
about yeah yeah

2868
02:00:10,939 --> 02:00:17,059
the technology of in a soil for sure

2869
02:00:15,130 --> 02:00:19,940
yeah I think so

2870
02:00:17,060 --> 02:00:24,129
technology so to speak has improved a

2871
02:00:19,939 --> 02:00:26,799
lot but then again so is mine

2872
02:00:24,128 --> 02:00:28,628
now there's so many there's a lot of

2873
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:31,329
little subtle things and you know I tend

2874
02:00:28,628 --> 02:00:35,828
to just sort of make broad sweeps with

2875
02:00:31,328 --> 02:00:42,128
my brush sometimes not always to great

2876
02:00:35,828 --> 02:00:44,139
effect but anyway okay today what yeah

2877
02:00:42,128 --> 02:00:48,399
stopping yeah you know I'm just gonna

2878
02:00:44,139 --> 02:00:50,859
say we we see a lot of news about the

2879
02:00:48,399 --> 02:00:53,139
new skunk lines coming out do you guys

2880
02:00:50,859 --> 02:00:56,260
have any plans to release any other old

2881
02:00:53,139 --> 02:00:58,300
staples and do you want to give us any

2882
02:00:56,260 --> 02:01:01,809
more info on when we can expect to see

2883
02:00:58,300 --> 02:01:04,329
these skunk varieties available when you

2884
02:01:01,809 --> 02:01:07,269
say old staples not necessarily our old

2885
02:01:04,328 --> 02:01:11,469
staples yeah things that we're going

2886
02:01:07,269 --> 02:01:13,659
back to yeah well it's all about back to

2887
02:01:11,469 --> 02:01:16,868
the future a little bit with us I guess

2888
02:01:13,658 --> 02:01:18,998
you know we we we'd like to go back to

2889
02:01:16,868 --> 02:01:22,988
the roots and bring people the old

2890
02:01:18,998 --> 02:01:26,469
original strains reliable consistent

2891
02:01:22,988 --> 02:01:29,858
plants you know that our seeds aren't

2892
02:01:26,469 --> 02:01:31,929
all over the place and they are what we

2893
02:01:29,859 --> 02:01:37,570
claim them to be in the descriptions are

2894
02:01:31,929 --> 02:01:41,288
accurate and such but going back to any

2895
02:01:37,569 --> 02:01:44,198
particular crosses it's not necessarily

2896
02:01:41,288 --> 02:01:50,578
always in mind as to which ones they

2897
02:01:44,198 --> 02:01:54,819
might be but I guess I go by feel in

2898
02:01:50,578 --> 02:01:56,498
life quite a bit and those those things

2899
02:01:54,819 --> 02:01:58,840
aren't something where I can say like Oh

2900
02:01:56,498 --> 02:02:01,679
over the next two years there's a plan

2901
02:01:58,840 --> 02:02:04,269
to do this that and the other thing but

2902
02:02:01,679 --> 02:02:07,269
three to six months out we usually know

2903
02:02:04,269 --> 02:02:10,179
what we're doing and it's kind of like

2904
02:02:07,269 --> 02:02:15,820
who gets me the projects suggest

2905
02:02:10,179 --> 02:02:18,340
themselves to us you know yeah so when

2906
02:02:15,819 --> 02:02:21,279
you go back to when you were first doing

2907
02:02:18,340 --> 02:02:24,219
the initial backcross project to even

2908
02:02:21,279 --> 02:02:26,139
now who is some of the breeders who you

2909
02:02:24,219 --> 02:02:28,029
looked up to slash do you still look up

2910
02:02:26,139 --> 02:02:31,940
20 breeders or is it more so now I just

2911
02:02:28,029 --> 02:02:34,130
I mean necessarily no favor knew who

2912
02:02:31,939 --> 02:02:36,409
were I mean Nevel was the name that was

2913
02:02:34,130 --> 02:02:38,980
bandied about back then as a breeder who

2914
02:02:36,409 --> 02:02:41,869
you know was in the news and in the

2915
02:02:38,979 --> 02:02:46,459
magazine high times and such and so I

2916
02:02:41,869 --> 02:02:50,779
did know of him and then you know

2917
02:02:46,460 --> 02:02:53,569
there's DJ short and breeder Steve and

2918
02:02:50,779 --> 02:02:55,789
dick high and you know the mates that I

2919
02:02:53,569 --> 02:02:58,279
knew off of the internet that we were

2920
02:02:55,789 --> 02:03:01,698
all kind of colleagues at the time doing

2921
02:02:58,279 --> 02:03:03,948
similar things and like I say no

2922
02:03:01,698 --> 02:03:05,988
competition really it's just everybody

2923
02:03:03,948 --> 02:03:10,159
doing their own thing and kind of being

2924
02:03:05,988 --> 02:03:12,439
friendly about it that was my little

2925
02:03:10,159 --> 02:03:13,849
community but I didn't ever know any of

2926
02:03:12,439 --> 02:03:15,619
the big you know like a name like

2927
02:03:13,850 --> 02:03:17,930
Neville somebody who's not on the same

2928
02:03:15,619 --> 02:03:20,000
continent as me and I'd cross paths with

2929
02:03:17,930 --> 02:03:26,719
and the communication and information

2930
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:30,590
was not as good then so we found out

2931
02:03:26,719 --> 02:03:34,189
that cash was actually Neville probably

2932
02:03:30,590 --> 02:03:35,480
and he you know and he wanted to work

2933
02:03:34,189 --> 02:03:37,219
with you on something is that something

2934
02:03:35,479 --> 02:03:40,519
he wanted to do or you think it's just

2935
02:03:37,219 --> 02:03:42,980
divorce I mean I'm I like you know I'm

2936
02:03:40,520 --> 02:03:44,750
friendly pursed and I've always been

2937
02:03:42,979 --> 02:03:47,209
open-minded and I'll talk to anybody

2938
02:03:44,750 --> 02:03:50,479
about anything and I have respectful I

2939
02:03:47,210 --> 02:03:53,960
have respect for him so why would I turn

2940
02:03:50,479 --> 02:03:57,198
down a conversation you know I'm trying

2941
02:03:53,960 --> 02:03:59,630
to make these dtc 9,900 yeah well if

2942
02:03:57,198 --> 02:04:01,309
he's got the other half and yeah there

2943
02:03:59,630 --> 02:04:05,449
was something in said he does have seats

2944
02:04:01,310 --> 02:04:06,469
yeah yeah I'm sure so he's waiting the

2945
02:04:05,448 --> 02:04:09,889
pro he knows what he's gonna do with

2946
02:04:06,469 --> 02:04:12,829
them so how do you feel about the

2947
02:04:09,890 --> 02:04:14,780
Colorado kind of us seem happy and you

2948
02:04:12,829 --> 02:04:16,698
know and specifically do you think

2949
02:04:14,779 --> 02:04:18,649
Colorado has it the best so do you think

2950
02:04:16,698 --> 02:04:19,859
maybe some other states have figured it

2951
02:04:18,649 --> 02:04:21,599
out

2952
02:04:19,859 --> 02:04:24,210
I don't have a lot of experience in the

2953
02:04:21,600 --> 02:04:28,740
other states and in Colorado the

2954
02:04:24,210 --> 02:04:32,850
cannabis scene is almost you know read

2955
02:04:28,739 --> 02:04:35,729
aBSI you know like it's not a cannabis

2956
02:04:32,850 --> 02:04:40,020
scene so much as a DAB scene and a glass

2957
02:04:35,729 --> 02:04:41,579
scene and a pecking order of folks who

2958
02:04:40,020 --> 02:04:44,700
are sort of trying to find their place

2959
02:04:41,579 --> 02:04:48,180
here and you know there's a lot of very

2960
02:04:44,699 --> 02:04:52,529
heady no pun intended

2961
02:04:48,180 --> 02:04:56,039
you know very heady atmosphere them for

2962
02:04:52,529 --> 02:04:59,609
them to at a young age come and have an

2963
02:04:56,039 --> 02:05:01,890
exposure to so much freedom and an

2964
02:04:59,609 --> 02:05:04,500
ability to be in a community like this

2965
02:05:01,890 --> 02:05:05,760
where they may have had a dream of what

2966
02:05:04,500 --> 02:05:07,470
it was going to be like before they got

2967
02:05:05,760 --> 02:05:08,670
here and found that the reality wasn't

2968
02:05:07,470 --> 02:05:10,409
quite what they thought it was going to

2969
02:05:08,670 --> 02:05:13,980
be in many turn around and have to come

2970
02:05:10,409 --> 02:05:16,409
go back where they came from so you see

2971
02:05:13,979 --> 02:05:18,629
all of that sort of thing and then you

2972
02:05:16,409 --> 02:05:20,250
know you also have at the other end of

2973
02:05:18,630 --> 02:05:22,500
the spectrum folks who have made a

2974
02:05:20,250 --> 02:05:24,539
business of inviting all of these folks

2975
02:05:22,500 --> 02:05:28,590
who do very well in the business out to

2976
02:05:24,539 --> 02:05:32,819
big parties and they have after parties

2977
02:05:28,590 --> 02:05:36,179
you know the coming elbows with you know

2978
02:05:32,819 --> 02:05:39,179
all of the muckety-muck of glassblowing

2979
02:05:36,179 --> 02:05:43,230
artists and who knows what else you know

2980
02:05:39,179 --> 02:05:44,699
so it's a that's what I've experienced

2981
02:05:43,229 --> 02:05:46,348
and I don't have another state to

2982
02:05:44,698 --> 02:05:49,259
compare it to but it's a vastly

2983
02:05:46,349 --> 02:05:50,909
different terrain and growing up you

2984
02:05:49,260 --> 02:05:52,619
know you consumed in cannabis as a

2985
02:05:50,908 --> 02:05:54,689
teenager and a young adult

2986
02:05:52,618 --> 02:05:57,289
throughout the other parts of my life

2987
02:05:54,689 --> 02:06:00,779
the dabbing and glass alone is a

2988
02:05:57,289 --> 02:06:03,029
game-changer it's just like this oh my

2989
02:06:00,779 --> 02:06:07,219
you know it's it's not a whole different

2990
02:06:03,029 --> 02:06:10,800
way of doing that enjoying this cannabis

2991
02:06:07,219 --> 02:06:12,868
which you know a little bit neutral on I

2992
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:18,320
like it sometimes but I don't make it

2993
02:06:12,868 --> 02:06:20,759
you know my main thing at all yeah so

2994
02:06:18,319 --> 02:06:22,649
we're at the end of it and we just got

2995
02:06:20,760 --> 02:06:25,940
some little short answer questions to

2996
02:06:22,649 --> 02:06:28,198
blast through quickly yes and no yeah

2997
02:06:25,939 --> 02:06:30,149
I'll give you two questions you can

2998
02:06:28,198 --> 02:06:33,809
answer with yes I'm sorry you don't have

2999
02:06:30,149 --> 02:06:35,908
to give me yes or no question so true

3000
02:06:33,810 --> 02:06:41,010
influence what's your favorite strain

3001
02:06:35,908 --> 02:06:44,729
right now I am pretty partial to the

3002
02:06:41,010 --> 02:06:48,360
genius haze that's a you know really

3003
02:06:44,729 --> 02:06:52,859
nice a new strain that we have

3004
02:06:48,359 --> 02:06:54,599
and Apollo 11 I mean I have to pick a

3005
02:06:52,859 --> 02:06:56,609
favorite right now so you know it's

3006
02:06:54,600 --> 02:06:58,409
we're playing around the princess Phase

3007
02:06:56,609 --> 02:07:00,420
two we haven't released it yet because

3008
02:06:58,408 --> 02:07:03,750
we don't have large enough quantities so

3009
02:07:00,420 --> 02:07:07,408
yeah you know that's tough Sophie's

3010
02:07:03,750 --> 02:07:09,779
Choice you know and what's one of your

3011
02:07:07,408 --> 02:07:16,649
favorite strains from the past that's

3012
02:07:09,779 --> 02:07:18,750
now lost you know lost huh it wasn't

3013
02:07:16,649 --> 02:07:21,839
anything known to anybody else but I I

3014
02:07:18,750 --> 02:07:23,520
grew you know across from when I was

3015
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:25,469
working with this I says see that I just

3016
02:07:23,520 --> 02:07:26,969
thought it was encased thought as well

3017
02:07:25,469 --> 02:07:28,710
when I shared it with them I told them

3018
02:07:26,969 --> 02:07:30,569
what I had done and I'd taken that

3019
02:07:28,710 --> 02:07:33,719
Derbent eye and crust it to a skunk

3020
02:07:30,569 --> 02:07:37,289
number one and got these early maturing

3021
02:07:33,719 --> 02:07:39,868
purple abutted outdoor plants that were

3022
02:07:37,289 --> 02:07:43,408
absolutely killer in both flavor and

3023
02:07:39,868 --> 02:07:46,589
aroma and great potency I sold some to a

3024
02:07:43,408 --> 02:07:49,319
guy thanks I sold some to a guy who

3025
02:07:46,590 --> 02:07:51,600
worked in a restaurant and I only had

3026
02:07:49,319 --> 02:07:53,189
the bit that I sold him and he came back

3027
02:07:51,600 --> 02:07:54,619
to me asked me for Morris that I don't

3028
02:07:53,189 --> 02:07:56,969
have the same one I have something else

3029
02:07:54,618 --> 02:07:58,799
even though the second one was a very

3030
02:07:56,969 --> 02:08:01,350
good weed he came back to me complaining

3031
02:07:58,800 --> 02:08:03,989
later like you know that first one was

3032
02:08:01,350 --> 02:08:06,389
killer you know the second one what the

3033
02:08:03,988 --> 02:08:08,459
[ __ ] was that you know I'm like I'm

3034
02:08:06,389 --> 02:08:10,500
sorry dude you know it's perfectly

3035
02:08:08,460 --> 02:08:12,359
respectable weed it's just that that

3036
02:08:10,500 --> 02:08:15,420
first one was like this mind blowing

3037
02:08:12,359 --> 02:08:18,118
[ __ ] that I grew outdoors and I lost the

3038
02:08:15,420 --> 02:08:20,908
seeds from that so I I guess that would

3039
02:08:18,118 --> 02:08:23,219
have been one of the biggest I wish I

3040
02:08:20,908 --> 02:08:27,448
had those seeds today that that was

3041
02:08:23,219 --> 02:08:30,270
quite amazing if you could go to one

3042
02:08:27,448 --> 02:08:32,279
place geographically and one place in

3043
02:08:30,270 --> 02:08:37,140
time to get scenes where

3044
02:08:32,279 --> 02:08:44,250
Wow what a great question huh hey ma'am

3045
02:08:37,140 --> 02:08:46,770
back in time Julie I guess you know it

3046
02:08:44,250 --> 02:08:49,380
would be thrilling I guess is that go

3047
02:08:46,770 --> 02:08:52,470
back and be in Vietnam with the during

3048
02:08:49,380 --> 02:08:55,739
the war and Thailand or Cambodia or one

3049
02:08:52,470 --> 02:08:58,380
of those places and and get you know

3050
02:08:55,739 --> 02:09:00,359
have some adventure that I don't get

3051
02:08:58,380 --> 02:09:02,640
killed right but I have a bunch of

3052
02:09:00,359 --> 02:09:06,809
really exciting moments where you know

3053
02:09:02,640 --> 02:09:09,030
yeah the whole you know raiders of the

3054
02:09:06,810 --> 02:09:11,460
lost tomb' for a weekend or something

3055
02:09:09,029 --> 02:09:14,039
where i get laid three times and let me

3056
02:09:11,460 --> 02:09:17,670
know find a whole pile of cash and come

3057
02:09:14,039 --> 02:09:21,210
back with sacks of original seeds from

3058
02:09:17,670 --> 02:09:23,960
these amazing plants yeah I'll take that

3059
02:09:21,210 --> 02:09:23,960
thank you

3060
02:09:24,680 --> 02:09:30,300
so what's the worst strain in your

3061
02:09:27,659 --> 02:09:32,010
opinion or you know in maybe a more

3062
02:09:30,300 --> 02:09:33,869
politically sensitive way would be

3063
02:09:32,010 --> 02:09:36,630
what's the strain you just didn't agree

3064
02:09:33,869 --> 02:09:39,750
with personally the most hmm didn't

3065
02:09:36,630 --> 02:09:41,699
agree with me when I spoke something and

3066
02:09:39,750 --> 02:09:43,920
it just didn't really let me see about

3067
02:09:41,699 --> 02:09:46,920
that you know it's I don't want to try

3068
02:09:43,920 --> 02:09:52,380
and slag anybody's feet or anything but

3069
02:09:46,920 --> 02:09:56,050
I can't even say you know it would be

3070
02:09:52,380 --> 02:09:59,469
embarrassing to someone and it's just

3071
02:09:56,050 --> 02:10:02,440
stuff that's been sent to me and I grew

3072
02:09:59,469 --> 02:10:04,328
it out and said hmm oh right

3073
02:10:02,439 --> 02:10:06,638
at least then it kind of lets me know

3074
02:10:04,328 --> 02:10:10,090
what that person thinks is good you know

3075
02:10:06,639 --> 02:10:12,368
but and then it kind of confirms why

3076
02:10:10,090 --> 02:10:14,710
when I send people samples of my buzz

3077
02:10:12,368 --> 02:10:19,539
they raved and like oh my god I'm like

3078
02:10:14,710 --> 02:10:21,399
really it's that good seriously so but

3079
02:10:19,539 --> 02:10:25,840
yeah I wouldn't put single out anyone

3080
02:10:21,399 --> 02:10:27,519
strain or any any one person who has

3081
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:29,800
sent me something that didn't work out

3082
02:10:27,520 --> 02:10:31,900
but you know those that would be the

3083
02:10:29,800 --> 02:10:33,880
basket I would turn to this to answer

3084
02:10:31,899 --> 02:10:37,299
that question and say this is something

3085
02:10:33,880 --> 02:10:38,559
that was a disappointment okay so what

3086
02:10:37,300 --> 02:10:39,760
did you want a disappointment or

3087
02:10:38,559 --> 02:10:41,440
something that just turned me off

3088
02:10:39,760 --> 02:10:43,840
altogether and I hate it I don't want to

3089
02:10:41,439 --> 02:10:47,319
smoke that pot yeah I know you're not

3090
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:51,179
that exciting it's really a wonderful

3091
02:10:47,319 --> 02:10:54,779
answer there the dramatic answer it I

3092
02:10:51,179 --> 02:10:57,609
kind of do have a common denominator

3093
02:10:54,779 --> 02:11:01,319
feeling about smoking marijuana that you

3094
02:10:57,609 --> 02:11:03,308
know it's all getting high on marijuana

3095
02:11:01,319 --> 02:11:05,859
there are a lot of subtle differences

3096
02:11:03,309 --> 02:11:07,029
between the strains and valgus type of

3097
02:11:05,859 --> 02:11:09,789
thing but there's a common denominator

3098
02:11:07,029 --> 02:11:13,000
there where it's like did you get high

3099
02:11:09,789 --> 02:11:16,149
on pot yep I'm high on pot you know and

3100
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:19,118
they all do that to you to some degree

3101
02:11:16,149 --> 02:11:22,649
and with some flavors of one thing or

3102
02:11:19,118 --> 02:11:28,029
another either psychoactivity or actual

3103
02:11:22,649 --> 02:11:31,359
taste bug palates but it's all pot you

3104
02:11:28,029 --> 02:11:35,078
know maybe I can simplify sometimes a

3105
02:11:31,359 --> 02:11:38,558
little too much but it's all pot you

3106
02:11:35,078 --> 02:11:40,840
know you smoke some hash it's different

3107
02:11:38,559 --> 02:11:42,909
than smoking flowers you spoke some

3108
02:11:40,840 --> 02:11:45,400
debits look different than the other

3109
02:11:42,908 --> 02:11:47,348
thing but there's you still know you

3110
02:11:45,399 --> 02:11:53,500
have a marijuana hide I'm sure you know

3111
02:11:47,349 --> 02:11:56,199
yeah so so final question to disappoint

3112
02:11:53,500 --> 02:11:58,689
to my point so yeah the final question

3113
02:11:56,199 --> 02:12:02,529
that are you gonna do any more photo

3114
02:11:58,689 --> 02:12:06,219
exhibitions and when probably not in any

3115
02:12:02,529 --> 02:12:08,109
time soon if the the bug strikes me and

3116
02:12:06,220 --> 02:12:09,880
I start to work a little bit more at it

3117
02:12:08,109 --> 02:12:12,670
but I've been lazy and photography ever

3118
02:12:09,880 --> 02:12:14,650
since leaving New York and you know I do

3119
02:12:12,670 --> 02:12:16,930
a bit here and there just for my own

3120
02:12:14,649 --> 02:12:19,809
pleasure and to keep gonna be so excited

3121
02:12:16,930 --> 02:12:21,610
I don't know yeah I'd like to think so

3122
02:12:19,810 --> 02:12:24,940
I'd like to think that I could take

3123
02:12:21,609 --> 02:12:26,979
stuff that I did and the style of

3124
02:12:24,939 --> 02:12:29,889
photography that I developed for myself

3125
02:12:26,979 --> 02:12:31,869
and I'm adapting to what we do here and

3126
02:12:29,890 --> 02:12:35,170
I've done that a few times in different

3127
02:12:31,869 --> 02:12:36,729
ways if I had work enough body of work

3128
02:12:35,170 --> 02:12:38,409
to put together to say like you know

3129
02:12:36,729 --> 02:12:42,579
here's some interesting spins on

3130
02:12:38,409 --> 02:12:44,500
cannabis photography then I had maybe a

3131
02:12:42,579 --> 02:12:46,809
dozen pieces to show or something I

3132
02:12:44,500 --> 02:12:48,789
might you know but it's way down the

3133
02:12:46,810 --> 02:12:53,140
list of priorities there's so much to do

3134
02:12:48,789 --> 02:12:55,449
all the time now listen so I think that

3135
02:12:53,140 --> 02:12:57,039
just about wraps yeah I love two things

3136
