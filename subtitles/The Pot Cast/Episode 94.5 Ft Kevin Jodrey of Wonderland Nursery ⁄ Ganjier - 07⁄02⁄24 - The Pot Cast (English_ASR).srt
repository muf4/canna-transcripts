132

breeding

133
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,159
growing

134
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:00,560
history his recent trip to Pakistan and

135
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:03,840
so much more so without further

136
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,280
delay let's get into it you know you

137
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:08,439
just spoke about how different latitudes

138
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:10,879
produce sort of different effects based

139
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:12,478
on the original land races and I think a

140
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:14,680
lot of people listening are waiting for

141
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,120
us to delve into it obviously if

142
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,959
anyone's been paying attention to your

143
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,399
Instagram you've had what looks like a

144
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:23,198
really epic recent trip over to Pakistan

145
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:24,679
I'd love to talk a bit about this what

146
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,038
what stimulated this how did all the

147
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,079
ball get

148
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:31,839
rolling oh man that was an epic

149
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:34,240
adventure I I I can't say enough about

150
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:37,000
the Pakistan the team I was with and the

151
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:41,879
people of Pakistan they were just lovely

152
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,720
so so friendly um what started it was

153
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:46,038
there was a group on you know yeah we're

154
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:49,720
all online but I had I had done some

155
00:05:46,038 --> 00:05:51,000
work with um the Indian Land race group

156
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,840
where they had reached out to me and

157
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,038
said hey we're trying to do some

158
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:57,719
promotion to get people to be more aware

159
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:59,159
of genetic preservation and that even

160
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,800
though you know when you take the genes

161
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,759
from one nation in small population and

162
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,240
move them you're not really doing an

163
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,160
official preservation but the idea that

164
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,400
some of the genes stay alive and get

165
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,560
shared and and hopefully bring back some

166
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:15,839
value to the farmer was what they

167
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,759
desired and so I I say hey I'm down that

168
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:20,560
sounds like a great project I said I'll

169
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:23,199
I'll participate and what I did is I I

170
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,959
took some of the genes and I created a

171
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,639
population but I cleaned them up a

172
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:28,638
little bit and got the intersex traits

173
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,560
out because I knew that most people were

174
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,560
going to grow them indoors

175
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,439
and I gave them out at conferences all

176
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,360
over the world right I shared them

177
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:41,800
everywhere and so what it did is it and

178
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,000
all I asked was for people to give

179
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,160
credit to the farmers in the region of

180
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,199
gazy

181
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:51,199
Afghanistan so this way what we're doing

182
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,800
is we're showing the this relevancy of

183
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,598
others that at the end of the day all

184
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,319
small cultivators are connected around

185
00:06:54,598 --> 00:06:58,918
the world by virtue of our

186
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,000
craft and so that it was successful

187
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:03,038
where it brought a of attention to that

188
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,800
that project and it was something I was

189
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:07,038
really into and so it it caught the it

190
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,319
caught the eye of you know two groups

191
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:11,199
land race

192
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,080
genetics and let's be friends Pakistan

193
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,639
so let's let's be friend Pakistan is a

194
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:18,240
tourism group and land race genetics is

195
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:20,240
a genetics collection group and so they

196
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,639
reach out to me and said hey you know um

197
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,079
we just want to be your friend online

198
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:25,280
and just chat with you once in a while

199
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:27,038
so I said sure and so we become friends

200
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:30,038
and we chat once in a while over the

201
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:31,959
years and they say we have this idea

202
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:33,519
that we've been working on and we want

203
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:36,279
to know if you'd be interested in coming

204
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:39,478
out to Pakistan and experiencing our

205
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:41,439
country and traveling the silk route and

206
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:43,598
doing a collection with land race

207
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:46,279
genetics and if it's something that's

208
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:48,360
positive for you to let the public know

209
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:50,318
that this was a good place and that our

210
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,720
people are good kind

211
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,560
people and it it sounds so simple you

212
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,520
know and it's just that Pakistan had

213
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,759
such a horrific reputation I mean I got

214
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:02,478
a text when I was ready to fly out about

215
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,158
chopping my head off and I mean the

216
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:06,279
people people believe that we were going

217
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:08,360
to go there and be murdered and and I

218
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:10,119
didn't believe that at all I had been

219
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,639
man I had a fantasy of going to Pakistan

220
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,360
since I was a kid I always wanted to see

221
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,280
these regions and I was just bummed that

222
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,960
I couldn't because of the wars in

223
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:21,679
Afghanistan and so when I got invited

224
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:23,279
out by these two groups I'd spent enough

225
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,360
time talking to them online I knew they

226
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,799
didn't want to cut off my head what they

227
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,720
wanted was they wanted to they they're

228
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,080
they're young they're 30s and 40s you

229
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,200
know I'm almost 60 what they wanted was

230
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,080
they wanted to be able to bring

231
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:39,719
attention in a positive

232
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:42,320
way and it was such a I want to say like

233
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,720
lack of a better word noble Endeavor

234
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,440
that I was like man I'm down I'm

235
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:51,120
supported and so I fly out to Pakistan

236
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:57,320
and I'm with uh green walrus Danny

237
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:59,480
and uh his team and I'm with a a a two

238
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,839
dudes from from England one of them

239
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,039
that's a breeder and another one that's

240
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:03,959
working with an operation in Australia

241
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:07,480
from

242
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:09,479
relaf so Neil from relief was with us

243
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,759
and so we're called the Internationals

244
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:15,000
and there was one other cat too uh Imran

245
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:17,120
from uh Canada who is a a premium

246
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,759
extractor and he was interested as hell

247
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,440
too because he's a really talented like

248
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:23,480
street dancer and so every cool place

249
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,160
he's been on the earth he goes and

250
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,800
dances with the people and does some

251
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:30,159
cool [ __ ] and Pakistan was live because

252
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:32,078
the backgrounds were Wicked and he would

253
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:34,958
throw on some on some music and just

254
00:09:32,078 --> 00:09:37,239
tear it up like this kid can move so it

255
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:39,479
was really uh this interesting trip that

256
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,120
they had gathered some of us knew each

257
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,720
other some of us didn't but it was just

258
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:47,240
people that let's be friends Pakistan

259
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,959
and land race genetics had connected to

260
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:52,039
you know over the last year or

261
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:53,919
two and realized that hey you you you

262
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:55,480
all make a pretty good diverse group we

263
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,240
think that if you all travel together

264
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,839
with us it would be really a good

265
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,680
Adventure so they put this idea together

266
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:05,640
to travel the ancient silk route the

267
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:07,120
route that connected the world really

268
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:09,159
and we were going to travel the silk

269
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,679
route and then go explore the Cannabis

270
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:14,039
regions do some

271
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:16,679
collecting and enjoy you know the time

272
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:19,159
together and it was the single most

273
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:21,239
insane trip I've ever been on in my life

274
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:23,360
because when you're traveling the silk

275
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,879
route you are literally traveling the

276
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,560
Korum Highway which is like the

277
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:30,958
deadliest Road in the world and I mean

278
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:33,559
you got landslides going down it it's so

279
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:35,799
rugged it it let me understand like the

280
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:38,239
first time I've had the concept of

281
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:39,879
verticality where you know you're at

282
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,879
like I think the highest we went when we

283
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:44,559
went over past was like

284
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:48,000
14,000 but the mountains around it were

285
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:50,879
14,000 feet higher than that so like you

286
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,278
have this up and down that your neck

287
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:55,240
gets tired from trying to look at the

288
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:58,838
base and to the top of something because

289
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:00,680
it's beyond comprehension and it's the

290
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,480
there's four ranges that come together

291
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:05,638
but the kurur the Himalayas and the

292
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,800
Hindu Kush all Collide there and through

293
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:10,120
those glaciers that feed at 7,000

294
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:12,639
glaciers up through Nepal and Pakistan

295
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,600
it creates the indis river and the indis

296
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:17,200
river is feeding you know onethird the

297
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,440
Earth's population with fresh water so

298
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,079
it's a river that's twice as big as the

299
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,040
Nile and it's one of the birth places of

300
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:27,159
humankind and so this if this these

301
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:29,439
areas to me were just like mythical

302
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:31,480
because I had studied them as a kid and

303
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,920
I'm in love with herbs so I'm fascinated

304
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:36,200
by the regions that really developed all

305
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:39,199
the varieties that we use so much in

306
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:42,040
North America so the ability to go and

307
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,440
and visit this place was just surreal

308
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:46,480
and the teams were awesome the the Les

309
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,560
be friends Pakistan put a trip on that

310
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,480
couldn't have been any more

311
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:50,359
comprehensive it was like every day you

312
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,120
were

313
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,759
247 experiencing Pakistan by the time

314
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,399
you left you're almost a

315
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:59,519
native and for me to go and get to do

316
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:00,919
some collection work with the land race

317
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,399
crew was awesome because they'd spent

318
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:06,000
the last seven years practicing

319
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:07,958
collecting and so they knew the regions

320
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,278
and they knew the profiles and they knew

321
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:13,518
what profiles were coming from what type

322
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:15,838
of gardens what type of companion plants

323
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:19,480
like they had a really

324
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:22,279
intuitive technically developed view of

325
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,440
the job so it made it awesome for me

326
00:12:22,278 --> 00:12:25,720
because you know hanging out with a

327
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,480
bunch of weed freaks is never bad and

328
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,759
hunting herb in the mountains with

329
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,600
people that are able to help you

330
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:34,360
understand with the patterns that they

331
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,360
see and so you're just there to

332
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,320
participate with them I wasn't there to

333
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,000
teach them anything I was there just to

334
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:44,680
work with them as a friend so it was

335
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:48,198
just totally cool it was it was like

336
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:49,638
total camaraderie and when we arrived

337
00:12:48,198 --> 00:12:52,278
the group said hey we know you guys

338
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:54,720
smoke a lot so we got you uh six quarter

339
00:12:52,278 --> 00:12:59,519
pounds of indoor grown in Pakistan which

340
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:01,240
was fire and 500 grams half a kilo hash

341
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,078
so we had and there was probably like

342
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,399
seven kinds of hash but it made up a

343
00:13:03,078 --> 00:13:07,559
total of 500 grams all kill a hash from

344
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:08,879
Tia so you know it's going to be a good

345
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:11,119
time when you show up and there a pound

346
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:14,679
and a half of herb and and half a keia

347
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,879
hash to smoke and so we basically smoked

348
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:19,759
our way through

349
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:22,320
the the trails and explored the

350
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:25,720
mountains and the people of Pakistan and

351
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,800
got to check out some stun in cannabis

352
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,440
varieties with patterns and profiles

353
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:33,399
that I really can't describe because I

354
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:35,560
don't have the ability to describe them

355
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:39,120
it just blew my mind it was it was so

356
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:41,559
interesting to find the true

357
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,639
outliers wow that's that's absolutely

358
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:45,919
incredible I'm sure everyone's you know

359
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:47,959
very jealous what a what a warm welcome

360
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:50,439
you know a pound and a half and half

361
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:52,359
kilo of hash beautiful beautiful man

362
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,199
knows how to welcome people I guess the

363
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,079
first question I'd love to ask is um you

364
00:13:54,198 --> 00:13:57,919
know what what were some of the standout

365
00:13:56,078 --> 00:14:00,359
sort of profiles or plants you came

366
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:02,319
across on that Journey

367
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,639
you know there there's the the one that

368
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,519
resonated more than any

369
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:10,560
was I want to say it was the only way

370
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:13,519
you could describe it would be some form

371
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:17,000
of like lacquer thinner combined with

372
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,959
every ingredient in an exotic Spice Shop

373
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,120
and then swirl that [ __ ] together and

374
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:25,239
then turn the volume up to 10 where this

375
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:27,799
thing screamed the smell that emanated

376
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:31,278
off that plant just ripped through a

377
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:34,679
field when when when I didn't find that

378
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:38,439
one Jamie found it and so he finds it

379
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:39,958
and he yells whoa and and he shakes it

380
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:44,199
and I can hear him you know shaking

381
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:46,599
something and the odor led us to it and

382
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:49,039
I mean you're to feel the weed and it

383
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:51,839
was so volatile that just him moving it

384
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:55,480
pulsed it through the entire

385
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:57,320
crop just incredible there was a another

386
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,680
profile I I really loved but I was I

387
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,360
would say it's like a classic Kush

388
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:06,599
and that we would say what is classic

389
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:08,879
Kush that dirty earthy tobacco cigar box

390
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,839
but now take all that [ __ ] and clean it

391
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:14,078
up clean it up and refine each one of

392
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,279
those flavors so that they're clear and

393
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:19,000
crisp and defined and then weave them

394
00:15:16,278 --> 00:15:20,759
all together so that you're just having

395
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,440
this this this

396
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:26,278
explosion in your nose of of those

397
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,600
things you you think you're in some type

398
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:33,679
of habiter like a clothing store where

399
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:36,120
there's fine fine epicurian tobacco and

400
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:40,039
the the the smell of the wood and the

401
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:42,879
the fabric and the material just leather

402
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:46,559
unbelievable I just loved it there was

403
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:48,759
plants that were so wet with essential

404
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:52,119
oil that when you rubbed against them it

405
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:53,720
wet your arm and I had to look up and I

406
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:57,360
laughed too because I did it multiple

407
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:59,120
times I go oh it must have rained and it

408
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,919
because there was they were literally

409
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,240
wet they were just dumping liquid and

410
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,838
then you found plants that were the

411
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:09,079
polar opposite where they bone dry but

412
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:13,199
they had the most granular grainy gritty

413
00:16:09,078 --> 00:16:14,838
ryzen heads just and so what we did is

414
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:17,039
we basically looked for everything that

415
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:18,839
had good morphology where the plant had

416
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:20,198
a decent frame on it and that was

417
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:23,240
interesting too because the mineral

418
00:16:20,198 --> 00:16:26,599
levels are so high from the glacier

419
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:28,600
that that the plants are just absolutely

420
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,480
leathered when when you try to rip a

421
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,199
branch off I mean it almost cut your

422
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,920
hands trying to pull the the bark

423
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:35,599
through your fingers it was it was you

424
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:37,599
had to tear them off and putting your

425
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,399
feet on the ground you look at a lot of

426
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,000
plants today you can peel them off with

427
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:45,078
your hands this [ __ ] was cemented and

428
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,240
when you cut it with a knife it was so

429
00:16:45,078 --> 00:16:49,359
lignified it wasn't like a cannabis

430
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:52,560
stalk it was almost like a semi

431
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,360
hardwood just so minerally dense the

432
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:56,039
food was like that too super high

433
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:59,159
mineral levels in the

434
00:16:56,039 --> 00:17:01,599
food so you just notice some very

435
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:03,000
differences than what we're used to but

436
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,199
what what we did is we just looked for

437
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,038
outliers that caught our eye and so you

438
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:09,839
would just go and go through hundreds of

439
00:17:08,038 --> 00:17:11,400
plants just going plant to plant to

440
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:14,318
plant and there was what seven of us

441
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,880
eight of us together looking and so we

442
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:17,838
would look through you know a shitload

443
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,160
of plants and anybody who found

444
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:21,318
something they thought was an outlier

445
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:24,798
would yell we'd come over and look at it

446
00:17:21,318 --> 00:17:28,038
I had a journal we would then identify

447
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:31,918
is it is it something unique yes then we

448
00:17:28,038 --> 00:17:34,079
write why was it unique Cod it and then

449
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:37,120
then bag it and double tag it so that we

450
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:39,399
had the plant to sift later and every

451
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:41,279
time we found something similar we would

452
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,880
go to the journal and say okay this is

453
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:45,678
something similar do we think this plant

454
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,799
is better or worse than the one we

455
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,440
collected and if it was better then we

456
00:17:47,798 --> 00:17:52,038
would collect it and put it into the

457
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,360
journal so at the end of the day it gave

458
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:55,558
us like 60 plants that we had collected

459
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:56,879
out of you know eight different

460
00:17:55,558 --> 00:18:00,720
collection

461
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:03,600
sites and then that that allowed us now

462
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,759
to be able to to break those into

463
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:07,599
categories where I was able to say okay

464
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:09,640
these are these are our Earth categories

465
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:11,519
these are the ones that have um some of

466
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,679
these fruit profiles these are the ones

467
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:15,558
that are colored in this direction these

468
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,120
are these are all purple almost black

469
00:18:15,558 --> 00:18:20,158
these are these are a matrix so it let

470
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:21,639
me start to create kind of divisions of

471
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:23,320
what we were looking at and why we were

472
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,640
grabbing it and how to kind of explain

473
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:26,918
it to the

474
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,360
public and then what we did is we took

475
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:32,280
that that truckload of plants plants and

476
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:34,199
trash bags fill the truck and then as

477
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:36,399
soon as we got to the hotel at night we

478
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:39,558
would break the plants down and start to

479
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:42,519
separate the buds from the bodies of the

480
00:18:39,558 --> 00:18:44,480
plant and then because it's so dry there

481
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:46,279
we would leave them out at night and

482
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,519
they would slowly dry then in the

483
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:51,000
morning we would seal everything up and

484
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:52,639
then move to the next site and as we did

485
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,798
but every night we would open every one

486
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,880
of the bags either on the roof of the

487
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:59,200
building or on the on the porches and

488
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,760
everything was organized and we would

489
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:05,240
work as a team constantly allowing the

490
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:06,599
plants to dry enough to deed so that at

491
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:09,720
the end of the at the end of the trip

492
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:12,480
what we had was a case of product versus

493
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:15,480
a pickup truck of product then once we

494
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,240
got back to lore we're able to go

495
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,480
through and do a final sift and

496
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,759
cleansing and get rid of all the Chafe

497
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:24,798
seed get rid of all the undeveloped and

498
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:27,879
there should be a picture on my Ig of a

499
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:29,839
tabletop filled with bags of seeds and

500
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,280
each one of those reflect the ones we

501
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:34,000
kept and the only one we really got rid

502
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:36,678
of was we selected it but when we broke

503
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,440
into it we realized it was a bug Factory

504
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:40,679
where that that we didn't see any real

505
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,759
pest problems on any plant I mean it was

506
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,280
incredible resistance but one plant had

507
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:46,640
every if there was a bug in Pakistan it

508
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:49,119
was on that plant and so we laughed and

509
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,000
said well however nice this smell this

510
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:53,199
is exactly the last plant one wants to

511
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,359
bring into their grow world because it's

512
00:19:53,200 --> 00:20:00,120
a it's it's a trap and so having trap

513
00:19:56,359 --> 00:20:02,399
plants is great but um also not great

514
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:04,359
wow that that's awesome to hear the the

515
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,038
process behind it all and how you were

516
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:08,000
able to get so many cool different

517
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,919
samples one of our fans submitted

518
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,440
questions was if you had to pick just

519
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,320
one of the lines that you were able to

520
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,400
secure which one are you most excited to

521
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:17,798
dig

522
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:21,159
through oh [ __ ] that first one I talked

523
00:20:17,798 --> 00:20:23,759
about I want to say it's uh

524
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:26,400
4D so each one of the each one of the

525
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:29,879
sites was was numbered with a you know a

526
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,679
number and then each selection was given

527
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,799
so we had eight sites so we had one

528
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,440
through eight and then each each

529
00:20:33,798 --> 00:20:39,960
location had a variable amount of

530
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:41,919
selections made some one two some 10

531
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,840
just depend on it was really all quality

532
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,360
based but that first one that first one

533
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:47,798
was so

534
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:52,158
noxious and

535
00:20:47,798 --> 00:20:54,639
ferocious and and crazy that I'm like I

536
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:57,360
want to go there first and I second I

537
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:00,080
would go into those cushies that I chose

538
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:05,279
because I really love

539
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:08,798
that tobacco coffee chocolate you know

540
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:10,759
that old world type profile you know the

541
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:14,119
the like a true Bubba cush even like

542
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:16,038
gorilla glues a similar that chy flavor

543
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:18,158
um done right you know to me that's just

544
00:21:16,038 --> 00:21:20,200
an epic profile and so those are the

545
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,960
ones I'd go into second but that that

546
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:26,159
first one and the beauty of it too was

547
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,840
that it was an absolute dumper and

548
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,919
dumper means that that it had an

549
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:32,639
incredible collection of seed that were

550
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:35,559
fully ripe on the plant which some of

551
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,799
the plants did not and so if I don't

552
00:21:35,558 --> 00:21:40,119
see seed that's developed that lets me

553
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:43,639
know that the plant's going to have a

554
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:46,959
longer flowering period and that doesn't

555
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:49,480
work well for most people definitely not

556
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,240
outside and so the way the pakistanis

557
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,720
work it is they don't they don't sift

558
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:56,359
females what they do is they sift

559
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:58,120
males so it's their male selection that

560
00:21:56,359 --> 00:22:00,759
they work with they don't they don't do

561
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:02,959
like a a true open population they do a

562
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:05,798
selected pollination and they choose the

563
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,038
males both on purple and green so you

564
00:22:05,798 --> 00:22:09,319
get both

565
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:11,599
colors purple is more for frost

566
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:13,839
resistance from their opinion that it's

567
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:15,278
a little bit more resistant to issues

568
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:17,720
but they think the green has a more

569
00:22:15,278 --> 00:22:19,919
interesting chemotype but they make sure

570
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,960
that there's both males in the field all

571
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,640
the time and then they choose the ones

572
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:27,919
that have the best Vigor you know best

573
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:30,440
uh display of uh flower formation best

574
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:33,720
odor just the qualities that someone

575
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:35,278
would seek in a in a pollinating mail

576
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,480
and they have a diversity of them but

577
00:22:35,278 --> 00:22:39,839
they Rogue out most of them and so you

578
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:42,240
can you can kind of see the consistency

579
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:44,639
in pollination because they've cull out

580
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,839
all the males early they didn't want

581
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,919
present so that way it lets you at least

582
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:50,480
be able to compare the plants to each

583
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:51,919
other if it's a true open pollination

584
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,159
it's a nightmare you don't know if the

585
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,038
plant was it the male that triggered

586
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,679
quick and pollinated or was the female

587
00:22:56,038 --> 00:23:01,679
early what happened but if it's all the

588
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:03,440
same males and then the females are

589
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,080
different we can say okay this one has a

590
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,440
reasonable finish time and so the one

591
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:10,000
that I lik the most was the seeds were

592
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,919
phenomenal so what we saw too was

593
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,240
incredible diversity in seed size from

594
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:18,159
you know huge like you know pinky tip to

595
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,120
microscopic and when you looked at at it

596
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:23,480
under a loop they were completely

597
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:25,319
developed complete perfect but just R

598
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,480
yeah and it's the same deal because you

599
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:29,038
got to remember that for the pakistanis

600
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,360
and and afghanis

601
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:34,079
cannabis was first a food source before

602
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:37,558
it was a drug and it still is so they

603
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:39,918
used the seed to survive the winners and

604
00:23:37,558 --> 00:23:41,918
they roast it with wheat and that way

605
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,038
they're getting all the fats and the

606
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:47,159
omegas and it gives them great health

607
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:50,440
they use the byproduct as a tea and then

608
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:53,000
they also bang out some hash for hash

609
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:55,720
places like Tia which are which is the

610
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,240
primary hash region of the country their

611
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:00,440
you know primary function is Hash all

612
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,400
the other products second and third

613
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,960
whereas most of Pakistan seed primary so

614
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,720
and and they don't breed for big seeds

615
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:10,159
either because what they want is

616
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:12,038
diversity so they're they're intelligent

617
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:14,559
in a way that only someone who's been

618
00:24:12,038 --> 00:24:15,720
touching a plant for 18800 years 1500

619
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:18,278
years can

620
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,720
be that's beautiful definitely some

621
00:24:18,278 --> 00:24:21,798
wisdom in a lot of the different

622
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,880
practices you just uh mentioned them

623
00:24:21,798 --> 00:24:26,079
doing there I'd love to ask you know on

624
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:29,200
the other end of the spectrum did you

625
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:30,960
see any population contam mintion while

626
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,440
over there any European or American

627
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,120
genetics and there's a quick followup

628
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,840
what was sort of the farmers perspective

629
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:40,079
were they aware of like American and

630
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:42,918
sort of more Western genetics at

631
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:44,439
all yeah they they are because the one

632
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:46,320
thing I noticed in the world no matter

633
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:49,320
what elevation altitude location

634
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:51,798
everybody's got a cell phone and so you

635
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:55,200
know the whole world is on IG and so

636
00:24:51,798 --> 00:24:57,759
they're fully aware but they they

637
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,360
they're kind of protected in a way that

638
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:02,839
different than Morocco Lebanon where

639
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:05,240
tourism is is still you know pretty

640
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:07,879
prevalent to a degree Pakistan has been

641
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,679
on a you know 20-year Hiatus where

642
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,200
people really haven't been there since

643
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,759
911 so I mean I only saw one white

644
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,360
person the entire time I was there and

645
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:18,038
that was a German tourist and German

646
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:20,278
tourists are notorious for going where

647
00:25:18,038 --> 00:25:21,519
no one will go and so you know if

648
00:25:20,278 --> 00:25:22,919
there's if there's if there's a single

649
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:24,519
white person anywhere up in the side of

650
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:26,159
a mountain I would say it's probably a

651
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:28,960
German tourist because they they

652
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:31,278
absolutely ferocious on

653
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,798
exploring but that's it we were the only

654
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:35,480
white people we saw and so when I spoke

655
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:37,038
to all the different farmers and all the

656
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,679
different groups you know the questions

657
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:43,278
I was asking were you know do you hold

658
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:46,000
your lines individually and they said no

659
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:49,159
we all share we all share the lines we

660
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,679
choose uh best stock if we have great

661
00:25:49,159 --> 00:25:54,760
crops we share the seeds with others and

662
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:56,798
they didn't have any infiltration from

663
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:59,599
any American or Dutch genes because

664
00:25:56,798 --> 00:26:02,319
nobody had been over there

665
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:06,278
and it was a it was awesome to see that

666
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:08,678
that it was still this protected

667
00:26:06,278 --> 00:26:11,200
population and yes they are curious

668
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:13,480
about the the the in you know about the

669
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,399
the the new genes but where you see

670
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:18,319
those develop they're not in the outdoor

671
00:26:15,398 --> 00:26:20,678
fields that is in the new indoor

672
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:23,519
industry of Pakistan and so Pakistan and

673
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:27,798
the upper middle class uh high class

674
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:31,720
Financial level people um the kids of

675
00:26:27,798 --> 00:26:34,558
that World they want Western type [ __ ]

676
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:35,960
and so they want to smoke gelato they

677
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:38,398
want indoor

678
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,960
runs and so when we got there and they

679
00:26:38,398 --> 00:26:41,398
broke out this weed I looked at it and

680
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,880
it was dank and I just said this is some

681
00:26:41,398 --> 00:26:45,038
really good grass and I said this [ __ ]

682
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,440
is not outdoor and they were like no

683
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:48,480
it's indoor and I'm like how'd you ship

684
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,720
it in and they said we didn't one of our

685
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,038
friends uh grew it they imported all

686
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,038
their grow equipment from another

687
00:26:52,038 --> 00:26:58,000
country and they have an indoor sparked

688
00:26:54,038 --> 00:26:59,519
up at their house or at a location and

689
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,278
they producing this good indoor and I

690
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:03,398
was cracking up because you know it was

691
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:05,278
like lemon sorbet and you know [ __ ] that

692
00:27:03,398 --> 00:27:07,719
you see in the California Market but in

693
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:10,880
Pakistan and done correctly it was

694
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:15,038
really well done like Well Done well-

695
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:17,960
grown weed so the indoor is what the the

696
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:21,119
the trendy want they don't want outdoor

697
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:23,720
and so you only see the jeans coming in

698
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:26,199
on the indoor end and I think that you

699
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,919
know as time went on I I I it was

700
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:31,880
awesome having Imran there because Imran

701
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:33,919
a really talented extractor too so it

702
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,919
was neat to see him and the the the

703
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:38,559
native extractors hanging out you know

704
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,880
talking shop because they they work off

705
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:42,879
of a dry sift

706
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,640
static but you know when we're talking

707
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,480
they working off a dryft static that

708
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:50,038
means that s that we were rolling with

709
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:54,720
he's got a 4 acre patch himself and so

710
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:57,119
he's hand sifting four acres of cannons

711
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,960
wow so like you know and and and his

712
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:00,839
first memory is like I asked him I said

713
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,200
you know what what what was it like

714
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:03,759
being a kid you know like in the world

715
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,278
of cannabis here and he goes oh man my

716
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:07,038
first memories of helping my dad when I

717
00:28:06,278 --> 00:28:10,079
was

718
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:11,558
three and now I'm in my late 30s so I

719
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:13,798
mean I spent my whole life basically

720
00:28:11,558 --> 00:28:15,678
making hash with my family and now I'm

721
00:28:13,798 --> 00:28:18,839
the the senior hash

722
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:21,440
maker and they just had a familiarity

723
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:23,038
and comfort with the product that was

724
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:26,159
refreshing because what we've done is

725
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:29,879
we've become so obsessed with this

726
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:31,919
Perfection that it to me it's bougie

727
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:34,600
where you know every detail has to be

728
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,679
just right or it can't cross your lips

729
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:39,000
and you know and majority smoked in

730
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:41,278
Pakistan is being smoked in

731
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,880
tobacco wrapped around a cigarette or

732
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:44,440
inside a cigarette and people will like

733
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,919
oh God they need an education and a

734
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,679
lesson I'm like no that's that's how

735
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:50,880
they consume it it's their world and

736
00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:53,519
it's not right or wrong it's just our

737
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:56,240
perspective but I would love to have had

738
00:28:53,519 --> 00:29:01,599
you know someone like s come back to the

739
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:04,519
US and go to a hash operation and watch

740
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:06,558
them make cash in this in this new world

741
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:10,038
and then have all those hash makers go

742
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:13,119
back to Pakistan and work dryft Tech

743
00:29:10,038 --> 00:29:16,679
with them because they're having to do

744
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:19,278
it with far less resources and so the

745
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:21,120
the art is greater than the science

746
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:25,038
where in our world the science is

747
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:27,479
becoming greater than the art

748
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:29,480
and you have to meld both of them for

749
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:32,079
incredible

750
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:35,079
they they a great scientist is an artist

751
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:37,038
and a great artist is a scientist it

752
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:38,720
it's just that where the focus lie but

753
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:42,079
you can't separate the two of them

754
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:45,038
completely art by itself has no end and

755
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:46,678
Science by itself has no Direction so

756
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:49,679
when you could put them together you

757
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:51,559
form like some incredible stuff that's

758
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,480
that's Da Vinci Da Vinci was Art and

759
00:29:51,558 --> 00:29:55,200
Science

760
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,640
merged so to me you know when you when

761
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,278
you look at it from that perspective

762
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,519
it's always it's always a a neat way to

763
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:03,480
look at things because you don't get

764
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:05,558
comparative with like our product's

765
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:07,278
better our product their product was

766
00:30:05,558 --> 00:30:09,918
incredible because they could do dry

767
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:11,440
sift that was shelf stable that was

768
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:15,679
absolutely

769
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:18,480
aromatic and Rich full flavors they off

770
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:21,038
gas it in the cold for months before

771
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,000
they make the hash so they get rid of

772
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:25,599
the profiles that we love most In

773
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,960
America which is gas they don't like it

774
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:29,918
because they think that it gives you a

775
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:33,240
hangover the next day and make Su grogi

776
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:35,440
so they off gas the gas and it Reveals

777
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,759
All these subtle fruits and florals that

778
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,880
I hadn't experienced in dry sift hash it

779
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:41,319
was really

780
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,080
interesting but it it fits their world

781
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:44,439
they don't want to be too [ __ ] up

782
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:47,960
because you're walking on the side of a

783
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:49,798
mountain yeah fair point until you're

784
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:52,600
until you're in Pakistan you realize

785
00:30:49,798 --> 00:30:54,480
you're not on a lot of flat ground some

786
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:56,359
of that [ __ ] was I mean we were climbing

787
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,038
up these things I was like oh you got to

788
00:30:56,359 --> 00:31:00,439
be kidding me and then these kids come

789
00:30:58,038 --> 00:31:03,000
running by us like goats and it made me

790
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:06,080
feel like I was 90 instead of 60 because

791
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,798
the kids are laughing just skipping down

792
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:09,319
and it just helps you understand well

793
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:11,038
what they want is they want the benefits

794
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:12,839
of the Cannabis they consume but they

795
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:15,440
want to be able to control it in a way

796
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:17,918
that fits their reality and it was

797
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,320
beautiful to see because man you have

798
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:22,320
you know you got 500 grams a Kil aash to

799
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:24,918
smoke and then every village we went we

800
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:27,158
got hook up with somebody that hash

801
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:28,880
Friends of the team would meet us at

802
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:32,519
certain locations and they would show up

803
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:34,240
with hash we got to hang out with a dude

804
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:38,038
that was a minor he owned a mineral

805
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:40,319
company and he had just got back from

806
00:31:38,038 --> 00:31:43,000
Morocco and so he brought a brick of

807
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:45,158
Moroccan hash with him that he just hand

808
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,119
carried over so we're grinding up

809
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:49,000
Moroccan hash and filling joints and

810
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:51,439
we're wrapping them with snakes of trra

811
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,638
valy Pakistan hash it was like a hash

812
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,320
morgage boy I I mean I smoked a lot of

813
00:31:53,638 --> 00:31:57,479
hash in my life but I don't know if I

814
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:59,879
was ever consciously trying to smoke

815
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,798
myself through you know 500 grams over a

816
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:05,679
3 we period because that's a lot of

817
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:07,879
smoke undeniably that's a lot of smoke

818
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,480
that's that's incredibly impressive and

819
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:12,200
and you know a beautiful

820
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:15,679
Story the next question I wanted to ask

821
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:17,919
you was what sort of plants do you think

822
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:20,000
would cross well with some of the seeds

823
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:22,038
you got on the Pakistani trip you know

824
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,319
like do you think like just as a general

825
00:32:22,038 --> 00:32:25,960
thing like OG cross to some of the

826
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:27,200
plants might be a cool combination or

827
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,038
does anything jump to mind in that

828
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,960
respect

829
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:32,919
you know it's interesting I did I I

830
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,079
started messing around with the Afghan

831
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:37,080
work that I got from gazy and they're

832
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:39,038
they're they're not similar Gene pools

833
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:41,558
but similar

834
00:32:39,038 --> 00:32:43,679
regions and I started messing around

835
00:32:41,558 --> 00:32:45,638
with the males that I was pulling out

836
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:48,360
and I laid them into everything I had

837
00:32:45,638 --> 00:32:50,519
just so I could see the influence on it

838
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:54,558
and some of them lined up better than

839
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:57,038
others it was funny but the the the

840
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:58,480
disgusting sulfur that I was working

841
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:01,519
with

842
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,558
they didn't bring that same heat to the

843
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,399
ogs and I went through a bunch of

844
00:33:03,558 --> 00:33:07,879
different plants but the Cherry Pie took

845
00:33:05,398 --> 00:33:10,439
the took the profile

846
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:13,360
incredibly so it was kind of shocking

847
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:16,798
because I didn't expect

848
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:19,678
that sulfur to be minimized by the gas

849
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:21,558
of the ogs and the sour and the chems

850
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:23,798
and I mean I I went through a plethora

851
00:33:21,558 --> 00:33:25,759
of them but it was the Cherry Pie that

852
00:33:23,798 --> 00:33:27,519
turned out to be the most disgusting

853
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:29,638
powerful rosin i've smoked in the last

854
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:31,960
couple years I mean it was almost scary

855
00:33:29,638 --> 00:33:34,038
high like you know

856
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,759
sometimes it's funny but sometimes the

857
00:33:34,038 --> 00:33:38,359
shit's just uncomfortable where you just

858
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:42,480
like whoa you want to come down because

859
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:44,839
you are just fired up

860
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:48,120
so I think that's truthfully that's

861
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:50,638
where I would start I would take

862
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:55,599
that that plant and I would go into the

863
00:33:50,638 --> 00:33:58,038
Cherry Pie and I would also look for the

864
00:33:55,599 --> 00:34:01,599
same male that I chose in that to go

865
00:33:58,038 --> 00:34:03,960
into the select red Leb Puck because if

866
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:04,879
I could add more complexity to that it'd

867
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,319
be

868
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:09,320
unbelievable and so and both of those

869
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:10,960
are similar like red lab Puck I mean I'm

870
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,960
fascinated by it because it has a

871
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,320
profile that everyone in my house had to

872
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,199
listen to me to talk about this [ __ ] for

873
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,838
a year but when they got to smoke it

874
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:20,759
they were like whoa I got you I can see

875
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:23,440
why you're so obsessed with it

876
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:27,679
and it has a really similar like cherry

877
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:29,838
pie type bite cherry pie is mouthy it it

878
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:33,039
cherry pie Done Right is incredible and

879
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:36,119
it makes a superior hash the flavor

880
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:37,960
profile is just ridiculous and I just

881
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:41,440
happened I get the old original cut and

882
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:44,079
so the cut that I have Jackson he has an

883
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,800
S1 of it he found a seed in a bag that

884
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,440
he uses in all of his work that's all

885
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:51,679
his Cherry work that's louder than the

886
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:54,320
Cherry Pie mother but I like the base

887
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:56,599
cherry pie it it's it's just such a

888
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,559
perfect plant for where I live and my

889
00:34:56,599 --> 00:35:01,320
family loves to smoke and I just love

890
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:04,239
the flavor and for whatever reason it

891
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:06,480
takes male pollen and does some

892
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:09,239
interesting [ __ ] with it I can see why

893
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,760
it's woven into so many other plants I

894
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:14,159
can see why cherry pie is you know

895
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,839
that's your you're

896
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:18,639
into billions and billions and billions

897
00:35:16,838 --> 00:35:20,320
of dollars of herb is sold every year

898
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:23,440
that have cherry pie in its

899
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:25,440
lineage so I would go there first and

900
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,079
and and mostly because I'm not looking

901
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,039
like if I wanted to do something cool I

902
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:32,519
could go into that's polar opposite and

903
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:35,519
say okay I'm on the 34 latitude and I'm

904
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:37,358
in a I'm in a heavy chemical let me go

905
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:39,559
down to like the you know the zero

906
00:35:37,358 --> 00:35:41,639
latitude let me go into heavy floral

907
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:43,960
which would put me into like an African

908
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:46,279
or it's a shame Australia doesn't have

909
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:48,720
any true land race because your your

910
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:51,920
latitudes in the zeros too but um that

911
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:53,719
sent me into Africa that sent me into uh

912
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:57,000
if I go up a little bit higher like 13

913
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:59,239
I'm in the the the bottom of Mexico that

914
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,880
puts us into like Thailand any of those

915
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:02,679
things would cross really well which is

916
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,280
really the original hybrids that took

917
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:07,399
over North America was they were taking

918
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,040
things that were distinctly unrelated

919
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:12,280
and putting them together and doing big

920
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:13,800
population work to find the parents so

921
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:16,680
you know there's nothing original about

922
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:18,480
that it's you you and and that's not a a

923
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:19,919
derogatory comment you don't need to

924
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,039
reinvent the wheel every time you wake

925
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,838
up in the morning sometimes it's nice to

926
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:24,920
say okay they took that and that and put

927
00:36:23,838 --> 00:36:28,318
it together and came out with some

928
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:30,440
incredible [ __ ] maybe I do that but what

929
00:36:28,318 --> 00:36:32,400
I wanted to see more than that was I

930
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,480
wanted to see it in a chassis that was

931
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,960
workable for my area so that I was

932
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:39,039
already bringing

933
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:41,679
the the the chances of success into a

934
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:43,559
tighter realm of possible and if I was

935
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:45,679
to want to mess around with something at

936
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:48,400
today I would take that Oreo cut that's

937
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:50,118
basically bulletproof moldproof grows

938
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:53,079
like a weed I mean couldn't be a better

939
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:55,200
chassis as a plant and throw that

940
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:56,839
profile on it but you know I'd have to

941
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:59,159
go through enough of them to find it but

942
00:36:56,838 --> 00:37:01,078
if you could put two together being A+

943
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:02,239
just like the Cherry Pie only only

944
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:04,560
problem with the Cherry Pie is it's got

945
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:05,759
a little bit of mold prone it doesn't

946
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:08,239
like the moisture at the end of the

947
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,440
cycle it's a it's a per perss don't like

948
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:11,919
moisture at the end of the cycle either

949
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:14,720
so if I had to say there was one thing I

950
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,079
didn't like about the plan is that it uh

951
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:18,519
and I'm glad it finishes early because

952
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:20,200
if it went late you wouldn't have it

953
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:22,358
yeah what a comprehensive answer I love

954
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:25,598
it that cherry pie hybrid sounds

955
00:37:22,358 --> 00:37:27,159
incredible and I myself big massive fan

956
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:29,280
of the Cherry Pie I think it's one of

957
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:31,199
the best strains out there so that's

958
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,720
awesome to hear that it lined up like

959
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:35,679
that and as an extension of the last

960
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:37,239
question you know I wanted to ask you

961
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:39,519
when when when we talk about land race

962
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:42,118
genetics in general everyone generally

963
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:44,039
speaking except like afghanis and ties

964
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:46,559
like there's some real fire in there but

965
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:48,759
I wanted to ask you what are some of the

966
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:50,039
other land race or Old World genetics

967
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,240
that you think are really under

968
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:53,838
represented that might have something to

969
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:55,799
offer and the reason why I bring this up

970
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:57,960
is cu I noticed you'd put a post up

971
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,839
about doing a Cambodian after too and it

972
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:02,199
sort of got my brain juices

973
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:05,159
stimulated that's a killer one too you

974
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:07,799
you know was was was cool was like what

975
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:09,358
made it good for me was that growing up

976
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,440
as a kid I got to see a lot of herb

977
00:38:09,358 --> 00:38:14,239
coming in from around the world and then

978
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,960
when I left the Rhode Island and went in

979
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:18,358
the military I lived in Hawaii in the

980
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:20,880
mid 80s and Hawaii was just a hot bed of

981
00:38:18,358 --> 00:38:24,078
the nastiest weed and then we were

982
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:25,760
raiding all kinds of boats out at Sea so

983
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:29,519
I got to see all the herb coming in from

984
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:31,720
Asia too but all all like original Jean

985
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:34,400
stock so it it just left this incredible

986
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:37,239
print in my mind of profiles and impacts

987
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:41,920
and it's my it's my

988
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:43,479
foundation and so I I spent years after

989
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,159
that you know chasing different

990
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,519
directions and so when I started hanging

991
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:50,519
out with the Mexican cats I'm like hey

992
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:52,079
bring me seeds from the grows you guys

993
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:53,880
are doing in Mexico because I was moving

994
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,519
the weed let me get some of the good

995
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:57,680
seed you're screwing with and then I

996
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:59,559
would grow them indoor so that would be

997
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:01,399
able to experience what it was like to

998
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:03,679
grow these profiles and then as time

999
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,639
goes on I get to travel the world and

1000
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:08,358
look at

1001
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:10,078
stuff and what what really helped me

1002
00:39:08,358 --> 00:39:13,440
most more than anything recently was I

1003
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:15,519
got to go to Jamaica and I went out

1004
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,720
there with the the the piff crew which

1005
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:19,559
was uh Joe the hard way and white boy

1006
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:22,598
Kev out in New York they're like the

1007
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:24,400
original piff Hayes guys and so we were

1008
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:26,119
we were going to do this project in in

1009
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,880
Massachusetts with the group Community

1010
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:30,440
Gardens and I came up with the idea that

1011
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,119
we ought to go to Jamaica to go take a

1012
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,559
look at a project that's going on out

1013
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:35,480
there which was this preservation

1014
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:39,119
project of this guy's lifetime of

1015
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:41,719
collecting land race jeans and since it

1016
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:44,000
was in Jamaica you get to see like a

1017
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:45,519
true representation of it in an

1018
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,519
equatorial

1019
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:51,639
climate and where he is in Spanish Town

1020
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:53,159
is the driest part of the Caribbean so

1021
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:55,639
it gives you a really interesting

1022
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:57,759
ability to do fuel like varieties in

1023
00:39:55,639 --> 00:39:59,960
addition so I got to see some crazy

1024
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,599
hybrids from jeans I had provided him

1025
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:05,480
that he got to weave in with some of his

1026
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:07,160
work so me Kev and Joe fly out to Scott

1027
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:10,159
family farms in

1028
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:12,519
Jamaica and we spend the next week out

1029
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:14,399
there really looking at the the breeding

1030
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:16,519
projects and looking at the varieties

1031
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:19,358
and it was just epic because it let me

1032
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:21,480
take a look at the Colombian collections

1033
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:25,159
it let me take a look at the Mexican

1034
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:27,358
collections the the green apple um aapo

1035
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:29,598
Golds where like two puffs into it it

1036
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:33,239
literally lit up like a green sour apple

1037
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:36,079
candy in your mouth the zakataka purples

1038
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:37,919
that are just Ultra perfumey and pungent

1039
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:41,119
and I had really never played the zakat

1040
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:43,760
takus and I hadn't had aapos that had

1041
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:45,559
fruit flavors either really so it was

1042
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:48,480
like directions I hadn't

1043
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:51,119
explored we got into the he had the the

1044
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:53,800
mullby madness which is really a

1045
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:56,039
tie and so some of the tie lines were

1046
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:58,318
epic he had a beautiful collection of

1047
00:40:56,039 --> 00:41:01,719
Lous work and Kim Cambodian work that he

1048
00:40:58,318 --> 00:41:03,119
acquired while he was in Cambodian LA

1049
00:41:01,719 --> 00:41:05,399
and I had already gone through a

1050
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:08,280
population of his Cambodian three line

1051
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:09,838
crossed into a C5 and actually I have

1052
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,119
some hanging in my garage right now it

1053
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:11,880
just came down a little while ago

1054
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:13,960
because it could make it through the

1055
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,519
rain and so I have probably a couple

1056
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:17,480
pounds of that that I'm gonna trim up

1057
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:19,639
and then have some really killer C5

1058
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:22,559
Hayes Cambodian 3 for the rest of the

1059
00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:25,000
season oh yeah it's nasty man I I was

1060
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:27,039
able to break a little Branch off maybe

1061
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,440
like two weeks early so that I could

1062
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:31,239
just dry it and have it to smoke so I

1063
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,920
could just like let me because I grew it

1064
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:36,519
before but I just let me let me let me

1065
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:39,200
puff on this [ __ ] and man it was such a

1066
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:41,480
searing clear clean High just beautiful

1067
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:44,439
if you like a good beautiful like

1068
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:47,240
electric High that's not racy or edgy

1069
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:50,079
but just total Clarity and energy in a

1070
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:53,479
in a controlled way that stuff is money

1071
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:55,240
I really liked the Lae hybrids too they

1072
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:57,960
brought some really interesting lemon

1073
00:41:55,239 --> 00:42:00,279
profiles and the high was ripping

1074
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:02,519
um I I messed around with some zamal

1075
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:05,720
when I was younger but they were always

1076
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:07,559
hybrids and they they were kind of

1077
00:42:05,719 --> 00:42:09,559
always hybridized with things that took

1078
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:12,838
the zamal edge

1079
00:42:09,559 --> 00:42:14,599
off and I got to mess around with some

1080
00:42:12,838 --> 00:42:16,078
real zamal that he had that was same

1081
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:17,960
thing we call him carrot weed when I was

1082
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:20,760
young so had that carrot flavor but holy

1083
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:22,400
[ __ ] that that high was cracking he was

1084
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:25,040
able to

1085
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:27,480
take some of the I want to say he took

1086
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:29,480
like some of the LA or some of the Cambo

1087
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:31,199
and then went into a black lime Reserve

1088
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:34,079
so I had some of the original black lime

1089
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:35,960
Reserve seeds put away in the original

1090
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:39,000
box and I sent them to him you know a

1091
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:40,800
year or so to back to play with and I

1092
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,519
got to see some of that woven in so you

1093
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:45,079
started to see some of the fuel and the

1094
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:47,838
limes brought in with some of the

1095
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:49,839
Tropicals he had a a bunch of different

1096
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:52,078
Congo work that he had done so the red

1097
00:42:49,838 --> 00:42:53,679
Congos and so you got to experience some

1098
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:58,079
of that bitey

1099
00:42:53,679 --> 00:43:00,799
sharp conal work he had done um a

1100
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:03,039
collection called skunk by scratch where

1101
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,640
he went to the three different locations

1102
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:06,920
where skunk is supposed to come from

1103
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:08,639
which was

1104
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:12,000
Afghanistan

1105
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:13,960
Mexico and Colombia and in those regions

1106
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,199
brought back the genes from those

1107
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:18,720
regions and he recreated his own skunk

1108
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:20,639
one but from his own source collection

1109
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:23,159
and that was really interesting too

1110
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:24,759
because what he had gathered was choice

1111
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:26,480
and you got to see some different edges

1112
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:30,079
to the profile because it wasn't in your

1113
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:32,400
typical skunk Jean Pool just from same

1114
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:33,800
regions so at the end of the day man

1115
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,318
what you got to do is you got to go

1116
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:37,920
through as much herb as you can find and

1117
00:43:36,318 --> 00:43:40,480
kind of find what you like and what

1118
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:43,318
works for you and you know and for me

1119
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:46,639
what I always try to find is is things

1120
00:43:43,318 --> 00:43:48,358
that that I'll do a couple runs indoor

1121
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:50,279
personally for Smoke on [ __ ] that

1122
00:43:48,358 --> 00:43:53,679
doesn't like being outside like my La

1123
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:57,400
cush if we have a wet fall it doesn't

1124
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:59,159
like it so if I'm in a drier hotter clim

1125
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:01,440
it kills it or the year happens to be

1126
00:43:59,159 --> 00:44:03,399
coincidentally D than normal but

1127
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,000
otherwise I run it indoor I run it bio

1128
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:08,119
indoor and I I I get that product that I

1129
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,519
want but from that method but everything

1130
00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:13,640
else I sift for myself for personal use

1131
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:17,440
is is sifted for my yard I sifted for my

1132
00:44:13,639 --> 00:44:19,039
my personal growth and that's why I know

1133
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,679
some of the things that are sorted

1134
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:22,960
that's why I like the Mexican work

1135
00:44:20,679 --> 00:44:25,679
better and I think that the Mexican

1136
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:27,119
lines are completely un uncredited I

1137
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:29,159
think that I think the Mexicans in

1138
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:30,599
General get [ __ ] they it's almost like

1139
00:44:29,159 --> 00:44:32,838
they they didn't contribute to the

1140
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:34,880
industry and really I mean they were

1141
00:44:32,838 --> 00:44:36,440
absolutely flood in America for years

1142
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:41,039
and the quality of the products coming

1143
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:44,679
out mishan and ohaw and the zakat takus

1144
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:46,639
and aapos and just stunning stunning

1145
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:48,118
work and it works in our environment and

1146
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:49,838
so I think in a perfect world you know

1147
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:51,960
you'd see a lot more of the Mexican work

1148
00:44:49,838 --> 00:44:53,799
being moved into the system for

1149
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:57,159
California

1150
00:44:53,800 --> 00:45:00,359
cultivation and you'd see you know the

1151
00:44:57,159 --> 00:45:04,358
the the Colombians the stuff coming out

1152
00:45:00,358 --> 00:45:06,480
of zamal uh the ties being grown in

1153
00:45:04,358 --> 00:45:07,880
glass houses down in like Central and

1154
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,480
Southern California where they could

1155
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:11,079
have that bomb your environment because

1156
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,079
our cold gets too cold and the plants

1157
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:14,839
don't like it so they don't like the

1158
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:18,400
cold they can handle they can handle the

1159
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:21,279
moisture they can't handle the cold

1160
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,880
so I think that you know is is you you

1161
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,720
define where you want to grow and then

1162
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:27,440
you go chase those Gene pools that work

1163
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:30,199
for you in that regard

1164
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:32,400
wow what an awesome answer you uh you

1165
00:45:30,199 --> 00:45:34,000
you read my mind and touched on the the

1166
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,000
Jamaican trip I was going to ask you

1167
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,000
about because I noticed you were as you

1168
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,119
mentioned the Scott family farms AKA

1169
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,920
reefa man what a what a blast from the

1170
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:46,480
past to to see him pop up down there

1171
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,358
what's what's the end goal of the the

1172
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,280
project he's doing there is it to to be

1173
00:45:48,358 --> 00:45:51,799
able to offer some seed stock or is he

1174
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:55,440
growing

1175
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:58,039
herb no he was he was down there you

1176
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,920
know Charles in the same situation

1177
00:45:58,039 --> 00:46:01,119
everybody's in man you're you're you're

1178
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,039
working in cannabis for your whole

1179
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:05,760
career and you get involved in any large

1180
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:07,920
operation it turns into a freak Show and

1181
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,640
I think that um he had some bad

1182
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,358
circumstances and he settled there and

1183
00:46:09,639 --> 00:46:13,759
what he was trying to do was use this

1184
00:46:11,358 --> 00:46:16,078
incredible location that Spanish Town

1185
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:19,040
location was phenomenal you it's funny

1186
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:20,760
Kingston is like the that's the irony of

1187
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:22,558
the world Kingston is considered like a

1188
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:25,480
really rough area and Spanish Town is

1189
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:27,680
considered the roughest area of Kingston

1190
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:30,480
and it was still was safer and cleaner

1191
00:46:27,679 --> 00:46:31,838
than San Francisco so everybody always

1192
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,760
laugh I'm like I'm from California you

1193
00:46:31,838 --> 00:46:35,519
know I don't think you understand

1194
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:36,319
California's a mess um but the climate

1195
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:39,239
was

1196
00:46:36,318 --> 00:46:40,719
ideal and it allowed him to be able to

1197
00:46:39,239 --> 00:46:42,558
work a tremendous amount of work and

1198
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:45,558
what he was trying to do is basically

1199
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:49,400
you know do his

1200
00:46:45,559 --> 00:46:50,839
2023 release and start to hand over the

1201
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:53,119
business to his

1202
00:46:50,838 --> 00:46:54,719
kids and he and I knew each other I've

1203
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:56,599
never met Charles in person till that

1204
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:58,799
day I showed up we just knew each other

1205
00:46:56,599 --> 00:47:01,400
on line because we're both in the genan

1206
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,599
game and we had chatted a bunch of times

1207
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:06,720
and when I was talking to the team at

1208
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:08,280
Community Gardens Stephen Doug and we

1209
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:10,358
were talking about working together on a

1210
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:12,400
project I said hey if we got the haze

1211
00:47:10,358 --> 00:47:15,279
guys with us it would be incredible to

1212
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:17,079
just jump to Jamaica and go spend a week

1213
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:19,119
with Charles and go look at all the

1214
00:47:17,079 --> 00:47:21,318
foundations of the things that really

1215
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:22,960
created the plant that they worked with

1216
00:47:21,318 --> 00:47:26,318
solely for 20

1217
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:28,880
years and it would and it's for me I

1218
00:47:26,318 --> 00:47:31,480
like I love working with other people

1219
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:33,440
and getting to see their experiences and

1220
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:34,800
understand how they view a thing and so

1221
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,318
I said hey I don't and I didn't know

1222
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:39,359
them either we were all we all just met

1223
00:47:36,318 --> 00:47:41,400
on a zoom for a business conference call

1224
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:43,598
but I I was talking to Charles I knew

1225
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:46,079
the project was going on I'm on the the

1226
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:47,920
computer screen with the two lamarina

1227
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:49,920
boys and I'm like whoa wait a minute I

1228
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:53,000
know this is going to sound crazy but

1229
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:55,240
the three of us should go to Jamaica and

1230
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,239
go look at the products and get

1231
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:59,479
ourselves

1232
00:47:57,239 --> 00:48:01,919
educated on the diversity of all these

1233
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:04,599
lines at the same time next to each

1234
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,280
other that was the thing is that I've

1235
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:08,160
seen these plants over the course of my

1236
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:10,960
life never in the same room at the same

1237
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:12,679
time all growing side by side it was

1238
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,639
like what you what I think made me

1239
00:48:12,679 --> 00:48:17,279
understand OG well is that I probably

1240
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:19,879
had 15 different ogs and I used to run

1241
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:21,599
them all side by side so there was no

1242
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:24,400
question they were not the same but

1243
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:27,160
everyone was an OG and it allowed me to

1244
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:29,318
say why is this OG better than this one

1245
00:48:27,159 --> 00:48:31,480
or or why is this one sold for more

1246
00:48:29,318 --> 00:48:33,880
money than this one or why is this one

1247
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:36,838
more popular with this group why is this

1248
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:38,519
one so successful here because I had

1249
00:48:36,838 --> 00:48:40,078
them all and I ran them all next to each

1250
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:42,318
other when you're running them

1251
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:43,559
independently you only see that thing

1252
00:48:42,318 --> 00:48:45,039
but when you put them all in the same

1253
00:48:43,559 --> 00:48:47,160
room at the same

1254
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:49,599
time and you're segregating the

1255
00:48:47,159 --> 00:48:51,759
population so you can pay attention and

1256
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:54,480
then you're recording it you can really

1257
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:57,160
make some pretty

1258
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:59,639
good opinions

1259
00:48:57,159 --> 00:49:01,078
and so to go see all this plant material

1260
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:04,598
that he had collected his whole life

1261
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:06,680
from around the world and get to hang

1262
00:49:04,599 --> 00:49:08,798
with them and listen to him tell you why

1263
00:49:06,679 --> 00:49:11,000
he had collected it why he had worked it

1264
00:49:08,798 --> 00:49:12,119
and where he got to this point it let

1265
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,000
all of us

1266
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:18,440
see a part of the industry that we're

1267
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:20,519
not involved in and also for him to see

1268
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:23,679
parts of the industry he's not involved

1269
00:49:20,519 --> 00:49:25,960
in and it allowed for the California and

1270
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:27,480
the New York group to you know I mean

1271
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:30,119
I'm from New England I'm a RH Islander

1272
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:32,079
but I spent you know [ __ ] 30 35 years in

1273
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:35,200
California so basically California is

1274
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:38,200
where I've spent majority of my life

1275
00:49:35,199 --> 00:49:40,039
that's where I know the industry best so

1276
00:49:38,199 --> 00:49:41,639
that background in California lets me

1277
00:49:40,039 --> 00:49:42,798
talk to New York and New York since

1278
00:49:41,639 --> 00:49:44,279
they've been there their whole lives

1279
00:49:42,798 --> 00:49:46,440
they could say the same thing and we can

1280
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:48,160
really start to understand what are the

1281
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:52,440
differences and the similarities in

1282
00:49:48,159 --> 00:49:54,838
consumptive patterns desires cultivation

1283
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:56,798
like all the little details that just

1284
00:49:54,838 --> 00:49:59,199
you need to understand so that you're

1285
00:49:56,798 --> 00:50:02,400
able to Pivot intelligently when you

1286
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:04,480
need to there you go over the years you

1287
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:07,400
know a lot of people do find reeferman

1288
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:09,798
to be a bit of a polarizing guy and some

1289
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:12,318
people have said that oh he never [ __ ]

1290
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:14,000
my seeds things like that I'm I'm sure

1291
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:15,440
you heard from some people they might

1292
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,079
not have been stoked about your recent

1293
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,798
trip what would you say to someone who

1294
00:50:17,079 --> 00:50:20,000
was critical of you know the trip to

1295
00:50:18,798 --> 00:50:23,280
visit the

1296
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:27,159
farm you know

1297
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:29,160
the I I only knew Charles online

1298
00:50:27,159 --> 00:50:30,639
and he and I met online and neither one

1299
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:33,558
of us actually knew who the other one

1300
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:35,519
was like he I didn't realize I was

1301
00:50:33,559 --> 00:50:38,880
talking to reefa man he didn't realize

1302
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:40,759
that who I was and so we we meet through

1303
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:43,240
a a friend talking about jeans and when

1304
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:45,119
we realized who each other was It was

1305
00:50:43,239 --> 00:50:47,959
kind of fun because it allowed him to

1306
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:50,160
have somebody that uh was a weed freak

1307
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:54,119
that he could kind of share his weed

1308
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:56,480
freak [ __ ] with so I get to enjoy him as

1309
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:58,519
a as a as a person in that regard and

1310
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:01,760
then I start to find out you know all

1311
00:50:58,519 --> 00:51:03,838
this backstory of um you know I'm say

1312
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,160
want to say like white supremacy and so

1313
00:51:03,838 --> 00:51:07,558
I was like holy [ __ ] man you got a

1314
00:51:05,159 --> 00:51:09,639
wicked backstory

1315
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:13,040
but the whole time I'm speaking to him

1316
00:51:09,639 --> 00:51:14,838
online everything was good and never

1317
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:18,000
once did I get any kind of feel that he

1318
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:19,920
was uh that kind of dude and when I when

1319
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,639
I see the problems with business I

1320
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,200
realize that people have issues and the

1321
00:51:21,639 --> 00:51:24,639
issue with cannabis is that the whole

1322
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:26,199
industry is so [ __ ] up that I don't

1323
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:29,039
see a single company that doesn't have

1324
00:51:26,199 --> 00:51:31,239
about 50 different I hate you because

1325
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:33,199
something unhappy so I didn't really

1326
00:51:31,239 --> 00:51:35,358
know how to take it and so when we went

1327
00:51:33,199 --> 00:51:37,960
out there and hung

1328
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:39,798
out he explained he goes hey I was from

1329
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:44,159
like a white supremist background I was

1330
00:51:39,798 --> 00:51:45,519
raised rightwing as a kid and he goes I

1331
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:48,118
you know I got into Buddhism I'm trying

1332
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:51,079
to be a better guy and what made me

1333
00:51:48,119 --> 00:51:54,400
believe it was that I spent that week

1334
00:51:51,079 --> 00:51:56,599
with his family right his kids and his

1335
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,400
two daughters were the two nicest girls

1336
00:51:56,599 --> 00:52:00,720
he could have been around I mean like

1337
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,960
balanced he got three daughters but the

1338
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:06,279
two of them I met two of them and they

1339
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:10,039
couldn't have been any nicer and and U

1340
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:12,680
genuine and one of them had a a Jamaican

1341
00:52:10,039 --> 00:52:14,318
boyfriend so if if living in the house

1342
00:52:12,679 --> 00:52:15,558
so if you're a white supremist you're

1343
00:52:14,318 --> 00:52:17,199
you're definitely not allowing your

1344
00:52:15,559 --> 00:52:20,839
daughter to have a a Jamaican living in

1345
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:24,000
your home and the way they all got

1346
00:52:20,838 --> 00:52:26,318
along was really pretty beautiful and I

1347
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,480
just realized that you know as nutty as

1348
00:52:26,318 --> 00:52:31,119
you background may be and as crazy as

1349
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:33,960
life may be you can't have two daughters

1350
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:35,838
that nice that are still sticking with

1351
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:39,599
you for

1352
00:52:35,838 --> 00:52:41,279
years if you're if you're that [ __ ] up

1353
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:43,079
and so it just let me see a piece of

1354
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:47,359
them that was solid and that's the piece

1355
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:49,400
I focused on because there's there's you

1356
00:52:47,358 --> 00:52:50,960
know Decades of people saying great

1357
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:53,000
things about Charles and then there's

1358
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:55,798
decades once I started digging in I said

1359
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:58,798
holy [ __ ] you polarize people incredibly

1360
00:52:55,798 --> 00:53:01,440
but the end of the day it's it's a a

1361
00:52:58,798 --> 00:53:03,280
tossup between I love you and I hate you

1362
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,200
so the only thing I can do in that kind

1363
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:08,040
of circumstance and I try to do in

1364
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:10,719
general is just what are we there for

1365
00:53:08,039 --> 00:53:12,480
we're there to be explore your crop

1366
00:53:10,719 --> 00:53:15,279
you're being gracious enough to let us

1367
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:17,838
explore it and in the

1368
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:19,519
process I'll be able to talk about the

1369
00:53:17,838 --> 00:53:21,798
trip and get some attention onto the

1370
00:53:19,519 --> 00:53:24,119
lamarina boys so their story gets

1371
00:53:21,798 --> 00:53:27,920
covered and the story about them

1372
00:53:24,119 --> 00:53:30,160
exploring the the the the the the work

1373
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:34,480
and it brings attention to

1374
00:53:30,159 --> 00:53:36,960
community and it seemed like a win-win

1375
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:38,798
for all and I would say that some of the

1376
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,559
blowback on it was like you know do you

1377
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:43,480
know who he is he [ __ ] me on some

1378
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:45,319
seeds or he has a past history but you

1379
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:47,039
know I'd say probably 80% of the

1380
00:53:45,318 --> 00:53:49,838
comments were really pretty positive

1381
00:53:47,039 --> 00:53:52,440
maybe even 85 out of a 100 and in

1382
00:53:49,838 --> 00:53:54,239
general Chet had a good run but you're

1383
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:56,119
in cannabis long enough and you try to

1384
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:58,039
go legal the minute you get into legal

1385
00:53:56,119 --> 00:54:00,680
cannabis abis you lose control over what

1386
00:53:58,039 --> 00:54:03,119
you're doing and people are so erratic

1387
00:54:00,679 --> 00:54:05,118
in legal cannabis that holy [ __ ] if your

1388
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:08,480
name's connected to it man you better be

1389
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:12,240
careful so Charles was nice to us while

1390
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:14,798
we were there and he absolutely is a

1391
00:54:12,239 --> 00:54:16,519
weed freak beyond belief man he

1392
00:54:14,798 --> 00:54:19,159
absolutely loves breeding dope there's

1393
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:22,119
no question about that and his memory of

1394
00:54:19,159 --> 00:54:26,679
the work was phenomenal so it allowed us

1395
00:54:22,119 --> 00:54:28,599
to go toward the past with them

1396
00:54:26,679 --> 00:54:30,358
and so I don't have any bad memories of

1397
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:32,440
the trip and I don't have a bad vibe

1398
00:54:30,358 --> 00:54:34,719
from him you know we haven't spoken in a

1399
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:36,480
minute he was having some health issues

1400
00:54:34,719 --> 00:54:38,000
and so once people start to struggle and

1401
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,119
stuff I just give you some

1402
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,199
space and he was he was having some

1403
00:54:40,119 --> 00:54:45,000
health issues of you know just personal

1404
00:54:42,199 --> 00:54:46,558
[ __ ] but all in all man Charles was

1405
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:50,679
gracious and his daughters were really

1406
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:52,480
friendly and the trip was good it was

1407
00:54:50,679 --> 00:54:54,519
just a really positive trip you know and

1408
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:56,719
so I same thing with Pakistan everyone's

1409
00:54:54,519 --> 00:54:59,159
like well what about the Afghan refugee

1410
00:54:56,719 --> 00:55:00,838
what about the women and I'm like okay I

1411
00:54:59,159 --> 00:55:02,598

1412
00:55:00,838 --> 00:55:04,679

about our violence I saidan what am I

1414
00:55:04,679 --> 00:55:06,960
supposed to do tell everybody else how

1415
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:10,359
to live when we can't get our own [ __ ]

1416
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:14,199
straight so like how am I supposed

1417
00:55:10,358 --> 00:55:15,400
to fix these problems and people like

1418
00:55:14,199 --> 00:55:16,879
well you know you're not addressing it

1419
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:18,599
I'm like how am I supposed to address it

1420
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:20,079
I'm being brought in to look at jeans I

1421
00:55:18,599 --> 00:55:21,359
got brought into the Middle East to look

1422
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:22,400
at a project everyone's like but what

1423
00:55:21,358 --> 00:55:24,000
did you do when you're there for the

1424
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:26,440
peace and I'm like what the [ __ ] would

1425
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,318
you like me to do that that's not my

1426
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:29,960
expertise you know how I do peace I I

1427
00:55:28,318 --> 00:55:31,038
try not to cause anybody any problems

1428
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,838
that I don't hit you in the head with a

1429
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:36,599
[ __ ] Hammer when I'm angry at

1430
00:55:32,838 --> 00:55:39,440
you so there's there's only so much you

1431
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:41,400
can do right and the the main thing is

1432
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:43,039
you try to be as decent as you can and

1433
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:45,680
if people are totally out of [ __ ]

1434
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:47,160
control then you can't be around them so

1435
00:55:45,679 --> 00:55:49,358
like there's projects that I have to

1436
00:55:47,159 --> 00:55:52,239
turn down because I'm like

1437
00:55:49,358 --> 00:55:55,078
yo you you you burned too many people

1438
00:55:52,239 --> 00:55:57,000
and I know it so I can't work with you

1439
00:55:55,079 --> 00:55:58,720

fire I can't play with you but in this

1444
00:56:06,519 --> 00:56:10,599
case you know I wasn't doing business

1445
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:12,838
with Charles we were really wanting to

1446
00:56:10,599 --> 00:56:14,680
explore these Gene worlds that he was

1447
00:56:12,838 --> 00:56:17,199
digging into so that we were able to

1448
00:56:14,679 --> 00:56:19,879
come back into the New England area and

1449
00:56:17,199 --> 00:56:23,318
bring that flavor with us courtesy of

1450
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:25,440
the Larina boys because they're mythical

1451
00:56:23,318 --> 00:56:28,000
New York figures in the haze in the haze

1452
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:30,119
crowd yeah it's great great to hear your

1453
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,039
answer there you know I definitely can

1454
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:34,480
resonate with love me hate me got to

1455
00:56:32,039 --> 00:56:36,480
pick one and choosing love seems like

1456
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,920
better option to me so I can certainly

1457
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:39,480
appreciate that and it's good to hear

1458
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:42,000
you're able to you know give a bit of

1459
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:44,519
props to the lamarina boys so you know

1460
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:47,079
some positive can come out of it I

1461
00:56:44,519 --> 00:56:49,440
wanted to to Pivot for a moment and ask

1462
00:56:47,079 --> 00:56:50,960
you about something different which was

1463
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:53,880
I wanted to talk about autos for a

1464
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:55,760
second because uh when we when we had

1465
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:56,920
Sean from flying line research on the

1466
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:58,720
show a little a little while back you

1467
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:00,480
dropped a comment talking about how you

1468
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:02,118
know Sean had given you some seeds when

1469
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:04,318
you saw him at one of the conventions

1470
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:05,599
recently I was wondering what's your

1471
00:57:04,318 --> 00:57:06,838
thoughts on Autos you know do you think

1472
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:08,960
they're going to play a role in the

1473
00:57:06,838 --> 00:57:10,038
future what's your experiences being

1474
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:12,480
growing them

1475
00:57:10,039 --> 00:57:14,599
out Autos are definitely going to play a

1476
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:16,358
role in the future because they they

1477
00:57:14,599 --> 00:57:19,519
allow they allow you a couple things it

1478
00:57:16,358 --> 00:57:21,558
seems like um Autos are tougher the the

1479
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:24,798
issue with Autos is that they're

1480
00:57:21,559 --> 00:57:27,240
sensitive root system so if your soil

1481
00:57:24,798 --> 00:57:29,960
temperature isn't at at par they they

1482
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:31,919
halt so you have to have warm enough

1483
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:33,838
soil which is you know so most people

1484
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,920
aren't measuring their soil temp right

1485
00:57:33,838 --> 00:57:37,558
so they're not putting a thermometer

1486
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:40,400
into the soil of the of the garden

1487
00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:42,200
saying what is my Surface Temp and if

1488
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:45,079
that's not right you can't

1489
00:57:42,199 --> 00:57:48,399
plant and if you transplant and you

1490
00:57:45,079 --> 00:57:51,280
shock them you screw it up too but if

1491
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:53,880
you see an auto put in correctly oh it's

1492
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:56,599
an incredible plant because the the the

1493
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:59,039
Vigor genes have been basically stroked

1494
00:57:56,599 --> 00:58:02,160
so what they have is this explosive

1495
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:04,839
growth profile in a very rapid period

1496
00:58:02,159 --> 00:58:07,440
and they'll fill the world with the the

1497
00:58:04,838 --> 00:58:08,519
products you need for like lower qual at

1498
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,039
some point I'm sure they're going to

1499
00:58:08,519 --> 00:58:13,719
nail an auto that can compete with

1500
00:58:10,039 --> 00:58:15,920
anything smoke wise but to me Autos are

1501
00:58:13,719 --> 00:58:17,598
the things you use to fill your your

1502
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:19,280
edible markets anything that you're

1503
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:22,079
going to use as a concentrate that

1504
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:25,079
doesn't require epicurian traits I would

1505
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:27,160
get it from my autos and I know that if

1506
00:58:25,079 --> 00:58:29,839
you're doing fields of Autos correctly

1507
00:58:27,159 --> 00:58:31,679
they're very cost effective and it

1508
00:58:29,838 --> 00:58:33,798
allows you to get your good b-grade

1509
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:36,759
products to the market at a good fair

1510
00:58:33,798 --> 00:58:38,440
price so remember most people are buying

1511
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:40,880
everybody wants a Ferrari most people

1512
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:42,760
are buying a Toyota or Honda right and

1513
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:46,519
there's no shame in that I mean they

1514
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:48,400
make great cars it's just that your

1515
00:58:46,519 --> 00:58:49,920
budget dictates it I have this View and

1516
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,119
people you know they get angry about it

1517
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:55,519
but it's there's only two customers to

1518
00:58:52,119 --> 00:58:57,240
me two I don't nothing else matters

1519
00:58:55,519 --> 00:58:58,559
except this one thing if it's if it's a

1520
00:58:57,239 --> 00:59:01,598
customer if it's someone if it's a

1521
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:03,680
patient million different variations

1522
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:06,280
customer that they're coming to buy

1523
00:59:03,679 --> 00:59:08,919
something that's the definition right

1524
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:11,200
there's only two that exist those that

1525
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:12,680
buy what they want and those that buy

1526
00:59:11,199 --> 00:59:15,159
what they can

1527
00:59:12,679 --> 00:59:17,038
afford so those that buy what they want

1528
00:59:15,159 --> 00:59:19,159
the conversation is radically different

1529
00:59:17,039 --> 00:59:21,119
than those that buy what they can afford

1530
00:59:19,159 --> 00:59:24,480
and I make sure that I try to service

1531
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:26,280
both of them but 85 90% of the effort is

1532
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:28,240
going to go towards those that body what

1533
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:29,039
they can afford because that's 80 to 90%

1534
00:59:28,239 --> 00:59:31,919
of the

1535
00:59:29,039 --> 00:59:34,640
population the other 15 10 to 15% is

1536
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:37,400
they buy what they want that's your

1537
00:59:34,639 --> 00:59:39,480
epicurian upper scale group and so

1538
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:40,880
everybody wants to serve them only

1539
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:43,119
because they believe that's where all

1540
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:44,720
the success in life is but the problem

1541
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:47,240
is they're not always buying a lot of

1542
00:59:44,719 --> 00:59:49,358
weed cocaine champagne [ __ ] like that

1543
00:59:47,239 --> 00:59:51,159
they're on but when it comes to Herb

1544
00:59:49,358 --> 00:59:53,679
they're not herb is a bluecollar drug

1545
00:59:51,159 --> 00:59:56,318
more than anything

1546
00:59:53,679 --> 00:59:58,199
and when you when you talk about about

1547
00:59:56,318 --> 00:59:59,838
this stuff you have to make sure to me

1548
00:59:58,199 --> 01:00:02,239
you always have to have that customer in

1549
00:59:59,838 --> 01:00:05,000
mind that at the end of the day what we

1550
01:00:02,239 --> 01:00:06,798
want what who cares what what matters is

1551
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,318
what does the customer want the customer

1552
01:00:06,798 --> 01:00:12,079
would like to have cheaper pot and if

1553
01:00:09,318 --> 01:00:14,798
they could grow it using technology that

1554
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:16,880
allows them to get it that's excellent

1555
01:00:14,798 --> 01:00:19,639
because at the end of the day that's a

1556
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:22,838
fair market if if we're talking a market

1557
01:00:19,639 --> 01:00:26,199
economy the the things that are required

1558
01:00:22,838 --> 01:00:28,519
are you can enter and exit it will and

1559
01:00:26,199 --> 01:00:30,960
you're there to serve your own best

1560
01:00:28,519 --> 01:00:32,960
interest so as soon as we start to put

1561
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:34,880
limits on that by saying oh no no that's

1562
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:36,679
not fair to us the small farmer we need

1563
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:38,200
to create this special situation where

1564
01:00:36,679 --> 01:00:40,759
they don't get to do

1565
01:00:38,199 --> 01:00:43,759
that that's not a that's not a fair

1566
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:45,599
market and so you're asking for

1567
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:47,119
concessions and considerations there's

1568
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:49,519
no difference than if I said I wanted to

1569
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:53,519
be a monopoly because that's also not a

1570
01:00:49,519 --> 01:00:55,559
fair market so to me what we have to

1571
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:57,280
address is where does the majority of

1572
01:00:55,559 --> 01:01:01,119
people get weed they're going to get it

1573
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:03,119
from easy to grow commercial sources and

1574
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:05,680
where does that leave the small operator

1575
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:08,079
to work on epicurian Lane but what I

1576
01:01:05,679 --> 01:01:10,078
know from the you know the auto work is

1577
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:12,400
that it's only a couple genes that

1578
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:13,200
control it and so you're going to able

1579
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:15,599
you're going to be able to see

1580
01:01:13,199 --> 01:01:18,519
incredible profiles being brought out

1581
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:20,480
and they even have ways to create

1582
01:01:18,519 --> 01:01:23,318
semi-autos where they're just

1583
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:24,760
accelerated in their flowering cycle and

1584
01:01:23,318 --> 01:01:26,880
there's something to do with the Vigor

1585
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:28,720
Gene that seems to dra along with it and

1586
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:30,039
I'm not a geneticist so sometimes when I

1587
01:01:28,719 --> 01:01:31,239
talk about this I get geneticists

1588
01:01:30,039 --> 01:01:33,400
jumping up and down screaming at me

1589
01:01:31,239 --> 01:01:35,318
online but I'm not a geneticist I just

1590
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:38,519
work with the geneticist I just help

1591
01:01:35,318 --> 01:01:40,038
them choose the traits that sell I help

1592
01:01:38,519 --> 01:01:42,199
them say these are the things I want as

1593
01:01:40,039 --> 01:01:44,760
a grower and I never want

1594
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:46,038
that and then they're able to say okay

1595
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:48,960
then I ask them so what do we do and

1596
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:51,839
they go oh what we have is U multiple

1597
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:53,760
Gene interactions that make this happen

1598
01:01:51,838 --> 01:01:56,199
and if we're able to trigger these

1599
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:57,760
things and and and and place them within

1600
01:01:56,199 --> 01:02:02,078
other plants then what we have is an

1601
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:04,440
ability to make any plant do this and so

1602
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:06,920
what I know is that our future will be

1603
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:08,639
extremely technologically advanced in

1604
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:12,159
how we grow

1605
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:14,358
cannabis and I just know that it's

1606
01:02:12,159 --> 01:02:15,798
inevitability that there there there is

1607
01:02:14,358 --> 01:02:17,400
that it will happen and it's it's when

1608
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:20,119
it takes place you know through the

1609
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:22,760
entire state of Nebraska it's when you

1610
01:02:20,119 --> 01:02:23,519
are cultivating you know 10,000 Hector

1611
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:25,559
in

1612
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:28,920
Australia it's when you're doing you

1613
01:02:25,559 --> 01:02:30,960
know six million acre in in Colombia

1614
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:32,639
because you're providing 40% of the

1615
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:34,079
Earth with its extract which is what is

1616
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:36,038
going to

1617
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:37,480
happen that's that's where it's all

1618
01:02:36,039 --> 01:02:38,480
going to take place and that's how it's

1619
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:40,719
going to

1620
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:42,760
happen but it's it's it's just the

1621
01:02:40,719 --> 01:02:45,239
inevitability you what happens right now

1622
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:47,760
is everybody's lumped in the same group

1623
01:02:45,239 --> 01:02:50,879
it's just pot you have to have

1624
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:53,720
commercial or you can't have craft their

1625
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:56,278
comparative terms their opposite sides

1626
01:02:53,719 --> 01:02:57,959
of the same piece of paper so so without

1627
01:02:56,278 --> 01:03:00,639
one you can't have the other you can't

1628
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:04,159
have one side of paper because paper has

1629
01:03:00,639 --> 01:03:05,798
two sides so we have to have commercial

1630
01:03:04,159 --> 01:03:08,118
in order for people to say you know what

1631
01:03:05,798 --> 01:03:09,798
I want craft and for people who smoke

1632
01:03:08,119 --> 01:03:11,400
craft they're like hey I love smoking

1633
01:03:09,798 --> 01:03:12,559
craft but I got to go to a party and I'm

1634
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:14,838
G to go smoke with a bunch of people

1635
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:17,200
that don't appreciate it let me just go

1636
01:03:14,838 --> 01:03:19,038
let me go back grab some Auto pre-rolls

1637
01:03:17,199 --> 01:03:20,838
because it's the same with liquor after

1638
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:23,359
the first two drinks the best thing you

1639
01:03:20,838 --> 01:03:25,119
can do is drink drink cheap boo because

1640
01:03:23,358 --> 01:03:27,278
you're not going to know the difference

1641
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:29,519
so you drinking $200 whiskey and now you

1642
01:03:27,278 --> 01:03:31,880
drinking $20

1643
01:03:29,519 --> 01:03:33,199
whiskey yeah no hugely you know I was

1644
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:35,240
thinking about that the other night

1645
01:03:33,199 --> 01:03:37,558
myself just with uh some wine I was

1646
01:03:35,239 --> 01:03:39,038
going to take with me you know you're

1647
01:03:37,559 --> 01:03:41,000
100% right soon enough there'll be

1648
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:42,240
fields of gelato 41 autos and you you'll

1649
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,199
barely be able to tell the difference

1650
01:03:42,239 --> 01:03:45,078
and you know could be a good thing for a

1651
01:03:44,199 --> 01:03:47,199
lot of

1652
01:03:45,079 --> 01:03:50,599
reasons I just wanted to quickly loop

1653
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:53,318
back you'd mentioned some um uh zamal

1654
01:03:50,599 --> 01:03:55,039
strains a little earlier in the answer I

1655
01:03:53,318 --> 01:03:57,239
saw on your Instagram you posted some

1656
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:58,599
photos of some Reunion Island Seeds did

1657
01:03:57,239 --> 01:04:01,358
you end up growing those out was there

1658
01:03:58,599 --> 01:04:03,640
anything cool in there no I didn't I

1659
01:04:01,358 --> 01:04:06,598
just stashed them because uh those were

1660
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:10,000
from like 24 week open

1661
01:04:06,599 --> 01:04:12,519
populations and I just I I received them

1662
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,920
and then I just banked them because I

1663
01:04:12,519 --> 01:04:16,880
was just do I really like I went through

1664
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:20,400
this phase where I I went on this Haze

1665
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:23,559
phase Right Where I Was Haze obsessed

1666
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:27,079
and you know I spent a lot of time and a

1667
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:30,039
lot of space digging through deep cycle

1668
01:04:27,079 --> 01:04:32,559
populations and you really really have

1669
01:04:30,039 --> 01:04:34,920
to want to do that [ __ ] I mean you it's

1670
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:37,880
it's not casual like you really you

1671
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:40,680
can't [ __ ] up at all you you're

1672
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:43,640
basically you're you're dealing with it

1673
01:04:40,679 --> 01:04:45,239
they they they don't like any nutrition

1674
01:04:43,639 --> 01:04:47,719
so they they work off of the bare

1675
01:04:45,239 --> 01:04:49,759
minimum and if you if you mess up at all

1676
01:04:47,719 --> 01:04:52,919
you'll curl these things

1677
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:55,359
up and if you're not able to like really

1678
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:57,440
bring the light down heavily over time

1679
01:04:55,358 --> 01:05:00,358
and maintain the intensity they don't

1680
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:03,720
finish so it's really hard to control a

1681
01:05:00,358 --> 01:05:05,119
plant that wants to be 20 foot indoor so

1682
01:05:03,719 --> 01:05:06,480
you're chopping it back and I mean try

1683
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:08,798
do this with a building right so I mean

1684
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:11,358
I went on this I did I dove I went into

1685
01:05:08,798 --> 01:05:13,318
it and I was looking for the for the

1686
01:05:11,358 --> 01:05:15,239
Holy Grail of the hazes because I'd

1687
01:05:13,318 --> 01:05:17,759
smoked so much Colombian growing up that

1688
01:05:15,239 --> 01:05:19,439
I was like I know Colombian and I was

1689
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,839
looking for all these and and really you

1690
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:23,358
know that that's the thing is is hay

1691
01:05:20,838 --> 01:05:26,358
Thai or hay Colombian depends who you

1692
01:05:23,358 --> 01:05:29,440
talk to but no matter what

1693
01:05:26,358 --> 01:05:30,480
they require an incredible amount of

1694
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:32,880
effort

1695
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:36,000
indoor if they haven't been like a

1696
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:37,838
worked population and what you find is

1697
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,119
that a lot of the stuff that we consume

1698
01:05:37,838 --> 01:05:43,239
coming from the you know the seed

1699
01:05:40,119 --> 01:05:44,760
banks the parental selection is poor and

1700
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:46,318
so you're having to go through you know

1701
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:48,160
I went through we're talking like you

1702
01:05:46,318 --> 01:05:51,278
know year and a half of digging through

1703
01:05:48,159 --> 01:05:52,519
populations which is 140 days so I can

1704
01:05:51,278 --> 01:05:55,838
get you know

1705
01:05:52,519 --> 01:05:57,920
basically two two and a quarter run runs

1706
01:05:55,838 --> 01:05:59,000
in so in a two-year period you get five

1707
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:03,000
runs

1708
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:06,318
in brutal right so five versus 12 is a

1709
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:08,679
radically different uh amount but I had

1710
01:06:06,318 --> 01:06:10,358
my home garage sparked up and I and it

1711
01:06:08,679 --> 01:06:12,318
was tall so I was able to do it all in

1712
01:06:10,358 --> 01:06:13,960
the garage and work it but I went

1713
01:06:12,318 --> 01:06:15,558
through population after population I

1714
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:18,079
wasn't really that impressed with a lot

1715
01:06:15,559 --> 01:06:20,160
of it because what it let me understand

1716
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:22,240
was the parental selection had been done

1717
01:06:20,159 --> 01:06:23,679
poorly and when I was talking to Charles

1718
01:06:22,239 --> 01:06:25,598
me and him were rapping about it and he

1719
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:27,239
said the same thing that when he did his

1720
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:30,079
initial selection he

1721
01:06:27,239 --> 01:06:31,838
said it had got so spread out that he

1722
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:34,599
had to go through almost at the time he

1723
01:06:31,838 --> 01:06:36,318
had you know huge resources spatially he

1724
01:06:34,599 --> 01:06:38,160
said he had to go through over 700 to

1725
01:06:36,318 --> 01:06:39,599
find the parental stock that he wanted

1726
01:06:38,159 --> 01:06:42,798
and then what it did is allowed him to

1727
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:44,720
get selection down to like 10 to 15 so

1728
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:47,880
now you could go through 10 to 15 seeds

1729
01:06:44,719 --> 01:06:50,118
and find something that was epic but for

1730
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:52,200
me I noticed the same thing I had amass

1731
01:06:50,119 --> 01:06:53,599
this collection of these equatorial from

1732
01:06:52,199 --> 01:06:57,239
all these different companies and I went

1733
01:06:53,599 --> 01:07:00,079
on this crusade to find the fire and

1734
01:06:57,239 --> 01:07:03,558
what I found was okay and okay doesn't

1735
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:05,440
justify 140 days and so the thing with

1736
01:07:03,559 --> 01:07:06,760
the zamal was it was a great gift from

1737
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:10,760
someone who went to

1738
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:12,720
zamal and I wish I had got those seeds

1739
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:15,359
before I went on that Colombian or that

1740
01:07:12,719 --> 01:07:17,598
tie dig because I would be

1741
01:07:15,358 --> 01:07:19,639
braver but once you realize it's going

1742
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:22,838
to be you know 24 weeks you're looking

1743
01:07:19,639 --> 01:07:24,960
at you know 160 days of

1744
01:07:22,838 --> 01:07:27,159
flowering and even if you bring it down

1745
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:29,199
to like you know know 1014 you're still

1746
01:07:27,159 --> 01:07:34,440
in the

1747
01:07:29,199 --> 01:07:37,318
120s you really and what am I

1748
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:39,679
getting and so sometimes you know I just

1749
01:07:37,318 --> 01:07:41,159
like I as I get older I said okay how

1750
01:07:39,679 --> 01:07:43,759
about we don't hunt them here how about

1751
01:07:41,159 --> 01:07:45,278
we hunt those in Colombia how about we

1752
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:47,680
go hunt these

1753
01:07:45,278 --> 01:07:49,559
varieties in their land of origin where

1754
01:07:47,679 --> 01:07:52,000
they just grow and then we select the

1755
01:07:49,559 --> 01:07:54,240
phenotype from that population versus

1756
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:57,519
let me do it in Doran California

1757
01:07:54,239 --> 01:08:00,959
because it was just it's just

1758
01:07:57,519 --> 01:08:03,079
impractical 90 days is reasonable 90

1759
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:05,559
days is good you know

1760
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:08,400
like and a lot of plants really that we

1761
01:08:05,559 --> 01:08:11,839
pick at nine should really go into that

1762
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:13,160
that 11 12 week period but 90s good if

1763
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:15,480
you can get something to finish in the

1764
01:08:13,159 --> 01:08:18,880
90 range that's Stellar that's

1765
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:20,640
reasonable but once we get past that

1766
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:23,319
there's got to be some exceptional

1767
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:25,039
reason why not just because it's

1768
01:08:23,319 --> 01:08:26,400
different different different's

1769
01:08:25,039 --> 01:08:28,039
different but exceptional that's

1770
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:29,639
something where like it's wor you just

1771
01:08:28,039 --> 01:08:30,319
straight up know it's worth your time to

1772
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:32,798
do

1773
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:35,319
it most certainly and while we're on the

1774
01:08:32,798 --> 01:08:37,880
topic of exceptional I'm sure you've had

1775
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:40,798
a plethora of memorable weed come across

1776
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:42,960
the desk at the nursery over the years

1777
01:08:40,798 --> 01:08:45,759
can you recall one or two that jumped to

1778
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:49,000
mind is extremely unique or

1779
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:51,039
memorable over the last 20 years what we

1780
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,640
did is we destroyed the gene population

1781
01:08:51,039 --> 01:08:54,679
and we just basically went you know we

1782
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:57,199
went right into per then we go right

1783
01:08:54,679 --> 01:09:00,679
into Kush then we went right into cookie

1784
01:08:57,198 --> 01:09:02,158
then we went right into candy gas and

1785
01:09:00,679 --> 01:09:03,838
they were all interesting in their own

1786
01:09:02,158 --> 01:09:06,278
regard but

1787
01:09:03,838 --> 01:09:09,519
like they they didn't stand out what

1788
01:09:06,279 --> 01:09:11,719
stood out was like a a Mexican that I

1789
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:15,120
grew that was identical to smoking a

1790
01:09:11,719 --> 01:09:18,079
Newport cigarette where if you if you

1791
01:09:15,119 --> 01:09:19,479
mess around with Menthol it was menthol

1792
01:09:18,079 --> 01:09:23,960
cigarette it was

1793
01:09:19,479 --> 01:09:26,718
insane I had I had some seeds that I got

1794
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:28,239
from an old dude in in soam when I got

1795
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:31,480
here like in the

1796
01:09:28,238 --> 01:09:34,000
90s and there was and I man I missed

1797
01:09:31,479 --> 01:09:36,919
that plant but one of them

1798
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:39,479
was when it when it burned in the joint

1799
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:42,759
it burned so oily it looked like you had

1800
01:09:39,479 --> 01:09:45,198
lit a tire up and when you smoked it it

1801
01:09:42,759 --> 01:09:47,238
was so devastatingly strong it knocked

1802
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:50,000
me out and put me on the couch and I

1803
01:09:47,238 --> 01:09:51,919
woke up and my my my girlfriend was

1804
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,319
wiping my face with the wet rag because

1805
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:54,560
she thought I was Ill or something she

1806
01:09:53,319 --> 01:09:57,800
goes oh you're moaning and you're

1807
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:59,760
shaking I'm ing your face I was crack I

1808
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:03,360
said no I'm just really high like this

1809
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:05,119
stuff was Next Level power and so that

1810
01:10:03,359 --> 01:10:06,880
like it just stood out because nothing

1811
01:10:05,119 --> 01:10:10,119
had that type of nail you to the- wall

1812
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:12,719
potency just to a degree that was

1813
01:10:10,119 --> 01:10:15,519
frightening the rosin that I made off of

1814
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:17,319
that Afghan cherry pie was absolutely

1815
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:20,239
unique I took it to a breeders meeting

1816
01:10:17,319 --> 01:10:22,880
with a lot of really well-known people

1817
01:10:20,238 --> 01:10:24,879
and turn them yellow I mean they they

1818
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:26,719
were just shaken from the potency of it

1819
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:29,279
and the flavor was excellent it had that

1820
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:32,158
really disgusting cheese likee aroma so

1821
01:10:29,279 --> 01:10:34,000
high in methyl butc acid and heavy heavy

1822
01:10:32,158 --> 01:10:36,839
sulfur so the mouth was really

1823
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:40,640
interesting but the potency was

1824
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:43,360
crippling um I had a skunk that kind of

1825
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:44,159
reminded me of a sour diesel in the way

1826
01:10:43,359 --> 01:10:47,198
it

1827
01:10:44,158 --> 01:10:50,000
stacked but it was the most noxious piss

1828
01:10:47,198 --> 01:10:54,238
skunk in the world and I got it from a

1829
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:56,279
friend of mine Brian and his buddy his

1830
01:10:54,238 --> 01:10:58,238
his buddy's dad was the head of the drug

1831
01:10:56,279 --> 01:11:00,920
task force in the

1832
01:10:58,238 --> 01:11:02,959
triangle and the dad brought home a

1833
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:04,760
plant to the son and said out of all the

1834
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:07,359
years we've been raiding weed this is

1835
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:10,560
the best weed I've ever seen and I stole

1836
01:11:07,359 --> 01:11:12,359
a plant for you and gave it to his son

1837
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:14,760
and then the son shares it with Brian

1838
01:11:12,359 --> 01:11:17,079
and then Brian shares it with me and

1839
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:19,400
that [ __ ] was Supernatural and it that's

1840
01:11:17,079 --> 01:11:22,000
the one plant that I lost in a raid that

1841
01:11:19,399 --> 01:11:23,759
I of all plants I've ever lost in raids

1842
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,600
or boss or any of that [ __ ] that's the

1843
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:30,440
one I miss the most because

1844
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:34,400
it was so exceptional in the mouth the

1845
01:11:30,439 --> 01:11:36,198
nose the weight the resistance every

1846
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:39,559
single part of the plant looked like a

1847
01:11:36,198 --> 01:11:42,198
marble but connected in a tightly dense

1848
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:43,840
cluster so you almost had no leaves on

1849
01:11:42,198 --> 01:11:46,198
it whatsoever and when you broke it

1850
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:49,480
apart each piece got beautiful Sun so

1851
01:11:46,198 --> 01:11:52,359
the coloration was consistent throughout

1852
01:11:49,479 --> 01:11:54,039
and it it had an odor that was so loud

1853
01:11:52,359 --> 01:11:55,639
that when I opened up the car door at

1854
01:11:54,039 --> 01:11:58,119
the football game I was at the Oakland

1855
01:11:55,639 --> 01:12:00,679
Raiders the door opened up the smell

1856
01:11:58,119 --> 01:12:03,198
blew out it blew through the parking lot

1857
01:12:00,679 --> 01:12:06,199
hundreds of yards two cops turned their

1858
01:12:03,198 --> 01:12:08,678
heads and ran at the car and arrested me

1859
01:12:06,198 --> 01:12:10,039
and I mean they were like out of view

1860
01:12:08,679 --> 01:12:12,158
when I opened the door I mean I'm

1861
01:12:10,039 --> 01:12:14,119
talking like hund like football field

1862
01:12:12,158 --> 01:12:15,879
away that there was nothing that was

1863
01:12:14,119 --> 01:12:19,000
more volatile than that

1864
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:22,279
[ __ ] so you know and the the one that I

1865
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:26,039
saw in in Pakistan was exceptional I

1866
01:12:22,279 --> 01:12:27,479
think the the zakat takus uh work that

1867
01:12:26,039 --> 01:12:30,279
Charles had

1868
01:12:27,479 --> 01:12:32,879
in Jamaica was exceptional what an

1869
01:12:30,279 --> 01:12:35,000
incredible odor like just absolutely

1870
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:36,960
pungent stunning

1871
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:40,800
unique so I think that you know when

1872
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:40,800
you're talking about really exceptional

1873
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:45,840
standouts

1874
01:12:42,679 --> 01:12:47,560
they they don't fit into any category of

1875
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:49,520
today and I don't mean like categories

1876
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:51,159
of perception that I I lay them out as

1877
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:53,520
but they

1878
01:12:51,158 --> 01:12:55,799
don't they're

1879
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:57,600
they're they're just not present we're

1880
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:59,159
not working with those extreme ends of

1881
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:01,360
the gene pool right now we're working

1882
01:12:59,158 --> 01:13:04,839
with really more consistent

1883
01:13:01,359 --> 01:13:06,920
populations safe and distribution

1884
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:09,000
doesn't like Risk so distribution

1885
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:10,920
doesn't favor plants that are outliers

1886
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:14,679
they want things that this is what the

1887
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:17,239
market wants and so it it it discourages

1888
01:13:14,679 --> 01:13:18,679
in Ingenuity and discovers Innovation

1889
01:13:17,238 --> 01:13:22,079
and it

1890
01:13:18,679 --> 01:13:26,158
inhibits your your creativity so you

1891
01:13:22,079 --> 01:13:27,920
don't explore the weird edges and

1892
01:13:26,158 --> 01:13:30,198
uh what else is some sexy [ __ ] I I

1893
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:33,399
really like the the Pam Anderson work

1894
01:13:30,198 --> 01:13:35,198
from Tyler family trees some of his pam

1895
01:13:33,399 --> 01:13:37,359
pam Anderson is this this line that he

1896
01:13:35,198 --> 01:13:39,839
picked up in La you know decades ago and

1897
01:13:37,359 --> 01:13:42,559
he named it after Pam Anderson the the

1898
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:44,520
actress but that stuff is some sweat and

1899
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:47,199
Deuce and cheese everything's like a

1900
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:49,560
dirty sock and a funky bag of cheese but

1901
01:13:47,198 --> 01:13:52,678
it puts a mouth on it that's just

1902
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:55,679
absolutely stupendous with a ripping

1903
01:13:52,679 --> 01:13:57,119
high so I love all the the the the Pam

1904
01:13:55,679 --> 01:14:00,000
work that he's done and he shared it

1905
01:13:57,119 --> 01:14:01,599
with Nick risden risden um opened up

1906
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,639
those

1907
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:05,560
populations and put into a bunch of

1908
01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:07,159
stuff so to me that's pretty

1909
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:10,000
unique

1910
01:14:07,158 --> 01:14:13,079
um what else is really really unique

1911
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:15,039
that just stands out that doesn't taste

1912
01:14:13,079 --> 01:14:17,840
like anything

1913
01:14:15,039 --> 01:14:20,920
else there was a cheese out of uh

1914
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:23,000
Michigan um I'm trying I don't remember

1915
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:25,480
the Paisley Farms did it but it was a

1916
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:28,039
rosin I can't remember who bred it but

1917
01:14:25,479 --> 01:14:29,799
it was so indistinguishable from like um

1918
01:14:28,039 --> 01:14:31,319
parmesan cheese that I I had my girl

1919
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:33,039
close her eyes and I held the parmesan

1920
01:14:31,319 --> 01:14:34,639
cheese up and the rosin and I went back

1921
01:14:33,039 --> 01:14:36,319
and forth and she couldn't tell the

1922
01:14:34,639 --> 01:14:39,039
difference

1923
01:14:36,319 --> 01:14:41,479
wow yeah like I mean it was that level

1924
01:14:39,039 --> 01:14:46,439
so I mean that really stood

1925
01:14:41,479 --> 01:14:46,439
out what really caught me recently too

1926
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:50,960
um [ __ ] that's really all the weird

1927
01:14:49,158 --> 01:14:53,399
standouts you know like you always

1928
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:56,119
remember the first time you smoke OG you

1929
01:14:53,399 --> 01:14:57,839
know I I I love La pure Kush that cut I

1930
01:14:56,119 --> 01:14:58,599
have I think that that can stand next to

1931
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:01,800
any

1932
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:04,199
herb like period it's got such a mouth

1933
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:05,920
on it such a it's such a a complete

1934
01:15:04,198 --> 01:15:08,719
flavor all the way to the

1935
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:11,079
roach and there's no everybody I shared

1936
01:15:08,719 --> 01:15:13,239
the plant with like the crew I roll with

1937
01:15:11,079 --> 01:15:15,840
everyone that got a got a cut of it like

1938
01:15:13,238 --> 01:15:17,238
that's their go-to smoke because no

1939
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:19,480
matter what they're going to get that

1940
01:15:17,238 --> 01:15:21,399
effect they want from it and so I still

1941
01:15:19,479 --> 01:15:23,238
get little text messages and messages

1942
01:15:21,399 --> 01:15:24,960
saying man I love you bro for giving me

1943
01:15:23,238 --> 01:15:27,359
that plant I gave it to him [ __ ] for

1944
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:29,279
evero they just let I'm laughing I'm

1945
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:32,359
like oh you high as [ __ ] right

1946
01:15:29,279 --> 01:15:34,279
now and so you know like it's stuff like

1947
01:15:32,359 --> 01:15:36,279
that that there's just these little

1948
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:38,198
things that just differentiate it from

1949
01:15:36,279 --> 01:15:40,319
the norm and it doesn't have to be a lot

1950
01:15:38,198 --> 01:15:42,638
it just has to be a point or two

1951
01:15:40,319 --> 01:15:44,920
different but different enough to where

1952
01:15:42,639 --> 01:15:47,920
it just sticks in your

1953
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:49,399
mind yeah 100% I I could definitely

1954
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:52,440
relate there certain ones that just

1955
01:15:49,399 --> 01:15:54,479
leave such a lasting memory for you we

1956
01:15:52,439 --> 01:15:55,919
normally ask this question sort of at

1957
01:15:54,479 --> 01:15:57,198
the start of the episode but we're going

1958
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:59,199
to switch it up today we're going to ask

1959
01:15:57,198 --> 01:16:00,719
it basically at the end what was your

1960
01:15:59,198 --> 01:16:02,599
first experience with

1961
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:05,600
cannabis oh

1962
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:07,920
[ __ ] that's a good one my my

1963
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:09,800
neighborhood was a crime zone right and

1964
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:12,560
my my one of my buddies dad was a

1965
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:14,360
crooked cop and so he was always robbing

1966
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:16,039
all the people he was arresting and so

1967
01:16:14,359 --> 01:16:18,119
when you went to his house and you went

1968
01:16:16,039 --> 01:16:20,079
into his dad's room when he was at work

1969
01:16:18,119 --> 01:16:22,559
there was all kinds of stolen goods on

1970
01:16:20,079 --> 01:16:25,359
his bureau and guns and knives and [ __ ]

1971
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:27,920
he was collecting from people and drugs

1972
01:16:25,359 --> 01:16:30,238
and so my buddy Kenny had access to to

1973
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:32,480
the herb the old man was jacking from

1974
01:16:30,238 --> 01:16:35,359
people and so this would have been

1975
01:16:32,479 --> 01:16:39,079
between the summer of uh sixth grade and

1976
01:16:35,359 --> 01:16:40,880
seventh grade so I was 12 and so I'm

1977
01:16:39,079 --> 01:16:42,119
seeing some of my older friends that

1978
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:44,239
tell me man I've been smoking weed I'm

1979
01:16:42,119 --> 01:16:45,679
like oh I want to try some weed and so

1980
01:16:44,238 --> 01:16:47,959
Kenny's like man I'm gonna go to my

1981
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:50,199
dad's room and score some weed so he

1982
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:52,560
scores some weed and he scores a pipe

1983
01:16:50,198 --> 01:16:54,638
too one of these big old like Sherlocks

1984
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:56,560
but all made out of metal Parts all like

1985
01:16:54,639 --> 01:16:58,039
you Plumbing fixtures and [ __ ] right the

1986
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:59,199
old school pipes from the 70s because

1987
01:16:58,039 --> 01:17:02,158
this would have been

1988
01:16:59,198 --> 01:17:05,519
78 and we went up on the roof of my

1989
01:17:02,158 --> 01:17:08,000
house and we were chilling and we light

1990
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:09,960
it up and as I'm puffing it a seed

1991
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:12,679
explodes and takes off in the air just

1992
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:14,198
as this cop car drives by my home and we

1993
01:17:12,679 --> 01:17:15,840
were all sitting there laughing like did

1994
01:17:14,198 --> 01:17:19,079
he see it did he see it but no no he's

1995
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:20,159
gonna see a a a a seed pop but you were

1996
01:17:19,079 --> 01:17:22,198
so

1997
01:17:20,158 --> 01:17:24,960
self-conscious that you were smoking

1998
01:17:22,198 --> 01:17:27,000
weed and that there was police nearby

1999
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:29,399
and I got a little bit of a buzz from it

2000
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:31,920
but the next maybe a day or two later he

2001
01:17:29,399 --> 01:17:34,279
came by again and this time we took my

2002
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:37,319
garage I had a big garage and we hung a

2003
01:17:34,279 --> 01:17:38,880
strobe light up on the ceiling of it and

2004
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:40,399
we all got our bicycles in there and

2005
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:42,880
turn the lights off and turn the strobes

2006
01:17:40,399 --> 01:17:44,960
on and we smoked and we were doing kind

2007
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:46,679
of like cage of death riding you know

2008
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:48,880
zooming by each other and I'll never

2009
01:17:46,679 --> 01:17:51,679
forget that [ __ ] because that's when I

2010
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:54,199
was high and so I was just like

2011
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:57,000
whoa and it it just kind of went from

2012
01:17:54,198 --> 01:17:58,799
there there was so much herb around

2013
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:01,960
because all the people that I was around

2014
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:03,639
were all involved in crime so there was

2015
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:06,960
never a shortage of

2016
01:18:03,639 --> 01:18:08,319
grass and soon you know you get into the

2017
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:09,679
game a little bit and you start meeting

2018
01:18:08,319 --> 01:18:10,799
the people that are trafficking it and

2019
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:12,239
they're helping you kind of get an

2020
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:13,520
education on what you're looking at

2021
01:18:12,238 --> 01:18:14,919
where they're like not just selling you

2022
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:16,560
weed they're like you're getting to

2023
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:18,199
touch the bail and they're helping you

2024
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:20,039
understand yeah this Colombia is pretty

2025
01:18:18,198 --> 01:18:22,158
good but we usually get something in

2026
01:18:20,039 --> 01:18:23,399
later in the season that's better and

2027
01:18:22,158 --> 01:18:25,439
I'm like no way and they're like yeah

2028
01:18:23,399 --> 01:18:27,319
when that comes in I'll buy your house

2029
01:18:25,439 --> 01:18:29,678
and grab you so make sure you stash some

2030
01:18:27,319 --> 01:18:31,880
money so that when it comes time you can

2031
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:34,480
score the really good weed and so these

2032
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:36,880
dealers would help me understand batch

2033
01:18:34,479 --> 01:18:39,279
quality and when really good [ __ ] popped

2034
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:40,840
out they would combine and grab me and

2035
01:18:39,279 --> 01:18:43,000
then I'd get to see what like they

2036
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:45,960
considered premium Thai or premium

2037
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:48,560
Colombian or premium Lebanese hash or

2038
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:50,840
premium iraan hash or premium Afghani

2039
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:52,360
hash and I just got this killer

2040
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:54,800
education and that was all you know

2041
01:18:52,359 --> 01:18:58,198
prior to 83 83 is when I caught my first

2042
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:59,960
you know case so from 78 to 83 that

2043
01:18:58,198 --> 01:19:02,079
5year period was this incredible

2044
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:03,880
education so from 12 to you know

2045
01:19:02,079 --> 01:19:07,119
basically like 12 to

2046
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:11,119
17 I was I was getting a a fantastic

2047
01:19:07,119 --> 01:19:12,880
education in the diversity herb and

2048
01:19:11,119 --> 01:19:13,920
still getting really high too you know

2049
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:16,159
when you're a kid then man you're just

2050
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:16,158
getting

2051
01:19:16,238 --> 01:19:22,479
lit oh my God so jealous that sounds

2052
01:19:19,279 --> 01:19:24,800
like an awesome introductory into a

2053
01:19:22,479 --> 01:19:26,479
lifelong passion how did it sort of

2054
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:29,600
evolved from there to say when you had

2055
01:19:26,479 --> 01:19:33,559
your first grow um I I started growing

2056
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:35,000
in 80 so we started smoking 78 we get

2057
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:36,920
into a little bit I have a neighbor I

2058
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,679
was a brown thumb so that's why I always

2059
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:40,239
tell people that you can you can you can

2060
01:19:38,679 --> 01:19:41,840
learn to be a good cultivator when you

2061
01:19:40,238 --> 01:19:44,759
learn to listen to the

2062
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:46,520
plants and I didn't have a background in

2063
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:49,320
in listening to the plants and my friend

2064
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:51,800
was just more intuitive so my buddy

2065
01:19:49,319 --> 01:19:53,840
bounce uh took on the growing end of it

2066
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:56,159
and I had a location in my grandmother's

2067
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:58,000
yard that we could grow in and they

2068
01:19:56,158 --> 01:19:59,679
didn't know it but in the backyard there

2069
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,238
was there was a spot where no one knew

2070
01:19:59,679 --> 01:20:03,000
that I and I could hide plants and so we

2071
01:20:01,238 --> 01:20:04,718
used to stash the plants there and grow

2072
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,800
them in my grandmother's

2073
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:08,560
yard and it was just awesome because

2074
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:11,960
everything I touched I was killing but I

2075
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:14,239
could help Gary and Gary was uh gentle

2076
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:16,679
with the plants and so I started to

2077
01:20:14,238 --> 01:20:18,839
develop a a micro skill and I said well

2078
01:20:16,679 --> 01:20:21,920
[ __ ] I might as well spark up big and so

2079
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:24,960
I filled the whole yard o of my my real

2080
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:26,920
house in 83 and got caught by the cops

2081
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:31,719
and got dragged out of high school in

2082
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:35,560
handcuffs and so I don't grow again

2083
01:20:31,719 --> 01:20:37,439
until 89 when I get out of the military

2084
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:39,760
and so the day I get out of the service

2085
01:20:37,439 --> 01:20:41,198
in in the in uniform using the

2086
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:43,480
government vehicle I picked up all my

2087
01:20:41,198 --> 01:20:45,919
grow lights in Berkeley and sparked up

2088
01:20:43,479 --> 01:20:47,439
in 89 I lived in Oakland but the grow

2089
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:50,760
star was in Berkeley Berkeley and

2090
01:20:47,439 --> 01:20:52,559
Gardens and I sparked up and I never

2091
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:55,520
stopped so you know the first

2092
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:58,120
cultivation you know was 80 uh three

2093
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:59,120
years of growing and then two years of

2094
01:20:58,119 --> 01:21:02,599
not

2095
01:20:59,119 --> 01:21:04,800
growing and then into the military where

2096
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:05,960
I was around weed constantly and smoked

2097
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,360
and we were [ __ ] I was in the Coast

2098
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:08,480
Guard we were raiding drugs everywhere

2099
01:21:07,359 --> 01:21:11,119
so I was looking at as much herb as

2100
01:21:08,479 --> 01:21:13,319
anybody on planet Earth and living in

2101
01:21:11,119 --> 01:21:14,559
Hawaii exposed me and you know it's

2102
01:21:13,319 --> 01:21:15,679
funny you go in the service trying to be

2103
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:17,080
you know like I'm gonna be good I'm not

2104
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:18,600
gonna get in trouble soon as I get to

2105
01:21:17,079 --> 01:21:20,119
the island I hook up with cats that are

2106
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:21,560
smoking fire and next thing I know I'm

2107
01:21:20,119 --> 01:21:24,158
smoking with them and I'm like holy [ __ ]

2108
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:26,320
I can't stop and I was loving it because

2109
01:21:24,158 --> 01:21:29,599
the Hawai was just phenomenal and then I

2110
01:21:26,319 --> 01:21:31,799
moved to San Francisco in you know in in

2111
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:34,400
the late 80s and I'm in the Bay Area and

2112
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:35,960
it's a it's a schoras board of weed too

2113
01:21:34,399 --> 01:21:39,719
and so like no matter where I go I'm

2114
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:41,399
swimming in weed and there was a story

2115
01:21:39,719 --> 01:21:44,000
that really prompted me to go back into

2116
01:21:41,399 --> 01:21:46,279
it professionally but bottom line was it

2117
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:49,760
just was always around me and I just

2118
01:21:46,279 --> 01:21:52,719
seemed to feel comfortable with it

2119
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:54,800
and I wanted I wanted to explore that

2120
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:58,000
world

2121
01:21:54,800 --> 01:22:00,199
I was just so curious I just felt so

2122
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:02,158
uneducated and I just knew that herb was

2123
01:22:00,198 --> 01:22:04,079
so massive and big and I knew I only

2124
01:22:02,158 --> 01:22:06,039
knew so little and I was like man if I

2125
01:22:04,079 --> 01:22:08,359
could just apply myself maybe one day

2126
01:22:06,039 --> 01:22:10,479
you know I'll understand this complex

2127
01:22:08,359 --> 01:22:12,279
thing it was a hidden

2128
01:22:10,479 --> 01:22:14,759
secret you know what I mean like there

2129
01:22:12,279 --> 01:22:16,639
was no real info then like it was it was

2130
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:18,159
you know the underground now it's it's

2131
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:20,039
radically different and I think it's

2132
01:22:18,158 --> 01:22:21,479
better in that regard because regular

2133
01:22:20,039 --> 01:22:24,198
people shouldn't have to go through that

2134
01:22:21,479 --> 01:22:25,839
many Hoops to get an education in in

2135
01:22:24,198 --> 01:22:28,519
Canabis use and

2136
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:29,239
cultivation but it was almost cultish at

2137
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:31,320
that

2138
01:22:29,238 --> 01:22:33,119
point like you know you were you were

2139
01:22:31,319 --> 01:22:34,880
cautious it was criminal you wasn't no

2140
01:22:33,119 --> 01:22:36,639
Outlaw [ __ ] you were when you at to

2141
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:38,920
Criminal Court when I got dragged out of

2142
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:41,800
high school in handcuffs I didn't go to

2143
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:43,600
to Outlaw Court I went to Criminal Court

2144
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:46,079
you know what I

2145
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:47,719
mean certainly certainly and and a lot

2146
01:22:46,079 --> 01:22:49,679
of Prior guests have commented on that

2147
01:22:47,719 --> 01:22:52,279
you know it really hard to find info and

2148
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:53,920
people very tight-knit about who they

2149
01:22:52,279 --> 01:22:55,679
disclose that they're a grower to and

2150
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:58,880
sharing information even the next level

2151
01:22:55,679 --> 01:23:01,039
of trust up I guess I'm curious though

2152
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:02,719
um you know I'm sure you grew for some

2153
01:23:01,039 --> 01:23:05,399
time and then eventually you decided to

2154
01:23:02,719 --> 01:23:07,920
start Wonderland Nursery where where did

2155
01:23:05,399 --> 01:23:10,799
the idea first come from to start

2156
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:13,639
that well I was already doing Nursery

2157
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:16,880
work for years before I did Wonderland I

2158
01:23:13,639 --> 01:23:19,000
I Wonderland uh is after I worked at

2159
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:20,159
humble patient resource center and

2160
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,800
before I worked at humble patient

2161
01:23:20,158 --> 01:23:24,158
Resource Center I was doing commercial

2162
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:26,159
Nursery work for the community meaning

2163
01:23:24,158 --> 01:23:29,679
that like large scale Growers were

2164
01:23:26,158 --> 01:23:32,359
accessing jeans what what I had done is

2165
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:36,480
I had I I was a good operation

2166
01:23:32,359 --> 01:23:38,319
Builder and years earlier I had so many

2167
01:23:36,479 --> 01:23:40,759
operations running myself that I was

2168
01:23:38,319 --> 01:23:42,039
able to do using the I had to go to

2169
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:44,039
Adult Ed to learn how to use a

2170
01:23:42,039 --> 01:23:48,158
spreadsheet this was in the the you know

2171
01:23:44,039 --> 01:23:50,359
mid90s kind of thing and I was able to

2172
01:23:48,158 --> 01:23:52,519
kind of crack the code on yield I was

2173
01:23:50,359 --> 01:23:55,119
able to figure out the variables that

2174
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:56,520
you had tojust to make the plant produce

2175
01:23:55,119 --> 01:23:59,238
like what do you like it's really modern

2176
01:23:56,520 --> 01:24:00,800
day crop steering but I it was it was

2177
01:23:59,238 --> 01:24:02,638
even more profound because you were

2178
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:05,320
having to actually steer an

2179
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:07,279
operation so there's no data there's

2180
01:24:05,319 --> 01:24:09,359
nobody to copy and follow and the

2181
01:24:07,279 --> 01:24:11,599
standards were a pound of

2182
01:24:09,359 --> 01:24:14,679
light and so I said I just think that

2183
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:16,760
that's just so under producing so I

2184
01:24:14,679 --> 01:24:18,760
started to really figure out what it was

2185
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:21,480
that allows you to get higher yields and

2186
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:23,159
maintain quality and when I cracked it I

2187
01:24:21,479 --> 01:24:25,599
went from pound of light into two and

2188
01:24:23,158 --> 01:24:28,039
then I went up to almost like you 214

2189
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:30,199
213s but two and a half all the time so

2190
01:24:28,039 --> 01:24:31,600
off the 2000s I was getting five pounds

2191
01:24:30,198 --> 01:24:35,879
that's in the

2192
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:39,600
90s so it instantly made me attractive

2193
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:41,039
to work with for other cultivators that

2194
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:43,639
wanted to do things because they were

2195
01:24:41,039 --> 01:24:45,198
like whoa off of a single table you you

2196
01:24:43,639 --> 01:24:46,800
know two tables you're pulling 10 pounds

2197
01:24:45,198 --> 01:24:49,198
so four lights is coming out to like you

2198
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:50,840
know 40 Grand they're like how the [ __ ]

2199
01:24:49,198 --> 01:24:54,519
are you doing like you're making 40,000

2200
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:56,719
out of a bedroom that's insane and so I

2201
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:59,159
said' well I pay me to build you a room

2202
01:24:56,719 --> 01:25:03,279
so I would build him a room but in order

2203
01:24:59,158 --> 01:25:06,519
for the room to work I had to put in my

2204
01:25:03,279 --> 01:25:09,880
system and my genes so that I could

2205
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:12,199
repeat the process for you and what I

2206
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:14,880
started finding was that people didn't

2207
01:25:12,198 --> 01:25:16,839
like to do cloning or do mothers because

2208
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:19,239
it was too problematic it was a lot

2209
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:21,039
easier just to run a cycle and so after

2210
01:25:19,238 --> 01:25:22,638
I built the operation they said hey you

2211
01:25:21,039 --> 01:25:25,960
know would you provide the clones and

2212
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:27,840
I'm like sure so I started doing clonal

2213
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:30,239
work and the next thing you know I mean

2214
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:34,119
I'm just pumping clones out like

2215
01:25:30,238 --> 01:25:35,718
crazy so I was doing way more clonal

2216
01:25:34,118 --> 01:25:37,519
production than I ever was Cannabis

2217
01:25:35,719 --> 01:25:40,840
production at that that stage of my

2218
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:43,719
career you know into the 2000s because I

2219
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:45,840
was just skilled at it and I and I was

2220
01:25:43,719 --> 01:25:49,239
willing to take the risk on the plant

2221
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:53,039
counts and I was able to generate you

2222
01:25:49,238 --> 01:25:54,879
know an ungodly sum of money from doing

2223
01:25:53,039 --> 01:25:56,719
plant material and the people you deal

2224
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:57,920
with are different than buyers you're

2225
01:25:56,719 --> 01:26:01,079
only dealing with

2226
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:03,039
Growers so and they're they're they're

2227
01:26:01,079 --> 01:26:05,559
coming in to buy the product they need

2228
01:26:03,039 --> 01:26:07,560
to make their money so where you insert

2229
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:08,320
yourself into the supply chain changes

2230
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:11,600
the

2231
01:26:08,319 --> 01:26:12,840
relationship so when I got into the the

2232
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:15,079
operation in

2233
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:18,760
Arcada when I took over cultivation

2234
01:26:15,079 --> 01:26:20,118
director of that operation I said hey um

2235
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:21,719
I let all the people know that were my

2236
01:26:20,118 --> 01:26:25,000
prior clients that if you went and got a

2237
01:26:21,719 --> 01:26:26,920
215 you could drive down to Arcade

2238
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:28,238
and legally buy plants from me and

2239
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:30,359
return with them with the script and

2240
01:26:28,238 --> 01:26:33,399
they would be protected up to a certain

2241
01:26:30,359 --> 01:26:35,880
number and it it it

2242
01:26:33,399 --> 01:26:37,960
exploded that company I mean it

2243
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:40,480
absolutely financially changed the

2244
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:42,800
direction of that business

2245
01:26:40,479 --> 01:26:45,479
forever and the owner and I ended up

2246
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:48,480
having conflict over Direction and it's

2247
01:26:45,479 --> 01:26:51,039
a bummer too because I was happy there

2248
01:26:48,479 --> 01:26:53,079
but some people just want to stay in one

2249
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:57,000
situation their entire

2250
01:26:53,079 --> 01:27:00,198
existence and and to me what I know is

2251
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:01,960
that time can't be held still that no

2252
01:27:00,198 --> 01:27:05,079
matter what you're doing you can't hold

2253
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:08,000
it this way forever you have to adjust

2254
01:27:05,079 --> 01:27:10,158
and change with the changes around you

2255
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,238
or eventually you become a dinosaur and

2256
01:27:10,158 --> 01:27:14,158
you're you become

2257
01:27:11,238 --> 01:27:17,519
extinct and so she and I had different

2258
01:27:14,158 --> 01:27:20,238
views and I I left the company and I lit

2259
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:21,600
up Wonderland and and Wonderland was

2260
01:27:20,238 --> 01:27:23,359
funny because everyone was like there's

2261
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:25,159
no way you're going to be able to do

2262
01:27:23,359 --> 01:27:27,319
this there's no one who's ever done a

2263
01:27:25,158 --> 01:27:30,039
year round Nursery at scale it's never

2264
01:27:27,319 --> 01:27:32,840
been done before but I knew that if I

2265
01:27:30,039 --> 01:27:35,519
mined the whole state of California it

2266
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:38,000
certainly could be done and so I light

2267
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:40,639
this place up and we go after the

2268
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:42,238
population of California where I'm I'm

2269
01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:44,880
whooping through neighborhoods all over

2270
01:27:42,238 --> 01:27:46,519
Southern Cal Central Cal Northern Cal

2271
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:49,279
Eastern Cal I didn't care if it was in

2272
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:51,679
California I'm coming at it and it

2273
01:27:49,279 --> 01:27:54,599
allowed us to be able to just absolutely

2274
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:56,960
step up really quickly

2275
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:59,920
and what we were trying to do was put

2276
01:27:56,960 --> 01:28:02,158
really really good genes into the system

2277
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:03,158
and good genes mean genes that when you

2278
01:28:02,158 --> 01:28:06,559
grew them

2279
01:28:03,158 --> 01:28:09,000
out you could sell the

2280
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:11,080
product but at the same time what we had

2281
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:12,560
issues with was we would we were also

2282
01:28:11,079 --> 01:28:15,238
same thing as I understood that the

2283
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:17,360
world was changing and I said listen we

2284
01:28:15,238 --> 01:28:19,559
didn't use any toxic [ __ ] at at at the

2285
01:28:17,359 --> 01:28:20,759
hprc and I said I don't want to use any

2286
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:22,000
toxic [ __ ] here so we're going to have

2287
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:24,639
to start learning really how to do

2288
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:26,399
organic pest control how like because

2289
01:28:24,639 --> 01:28:29,039
the future I knew was not going to allow

2290
01:28:26,399 --> 01:28:31,118
you to use pesticides and and fungicides

2291
01:28:29,039 --> 01:28:33,479
that are aren't allowed for human

2292
01:28:31,118 --> 01:28:35,799
consumption so as I'm doing my homework

2293
01:28:33,479 --> 01:28:37,799
on potential problems we will face down

2294
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:39,560
the road and I had done all this

2295
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:42,639
research [ __ ] decades ago I'm like we

2296
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:44,639
got a problem with the tools we use and

2297
01:28:42,639 --> 01:28:46,920
so it was a learning process too and

2298
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:48,520
that's why when I see people like

2299
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:51,079
someone gets some [ __ ] for doing

2300
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:52,400
something wrong I'm like you know if

2301
01:28:51,079 --> 01:28:54,158
you're first you're going to make

2302
01:28:52,399 --> 01:28:55,559
mistakes

2303
01:28:54,158 --> 01:28:57,799
and at the end of the day are youed

2304
01:28:55,560 --> 01:29:00,080
still here if you're still here you had

2305
01:28:57,800 --> 01:29:02,360
to have figured out what you did wrong

2306
01:29:00,079 --> 01:29:04,279
and so Wonderland for me it it allowed

2307
01:29:02,359 --> 01:29:07,039
me to

2308
01:29:04,279 --> 01:29:09,198
understand biological Pest Control in a

2309
01:29:07,039 --> 01:29:11,279
way that is critical for today's world

2310
01:29:09,198 --> 01:29:13,039
so it it lets me work with my own crops

2311
01:29:11,279 --> 01:29:14,759
at the farm in a radically different

2312
01:29:13,039 --> 01:29:17,639
manner so I'm grateful for the

2313
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:20,560
experiences and I love the fact that we

2314
01:29:17,639 --> 01:29:22,760
took so much incredible material I had

2315
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:26,280
collected over decades and just

2316
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:29,600
basically flooded the system with it so

2317
01:29:26,279 --> 01:29:30,679
that these genes made people's lives

2318
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:33,440
better

2319
01:29:30,679 --> 01:29:36,480
financially and it funded all the

2320
01:29:33,439 --> 01:29:39,079
charity programs we were able to do at

2321
01:29:36,479 --> 01:29:41,279
Wonderland so it was this it was a

2322
01:29:39,079 --> 01:29:43,800
really magic moment where in life it's

2323
01:29:41,279 --> 01:29:47,279
rare that you get to do philanthropical

2324
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:49,079
work at the same time you're doing work

2325
01:29:47,279 --> 01:29:50,639
and medical Canabis kind of was that

2326
01:29:49,079 --> 01:29:52,079
where I got to be part of medical

2327
01:29:50,639 --> 01:29:53,800
cannabis where the people who were ill

2328
01:29:52,079 --> 01:29:56,760
and having problems we just covered your

2329
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:59,119
[ __ ] for free and people who are making

2330
01:29:56,760 --> 01:30:01,000
money we were making money with you so

2331
01:29:59,118 --> 01:30:03,118
I'm making sure that the markets that

2332
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:05,479
you're approaching I'm giving you the

2333
01:30:03,118 --> 01:30:07,439
right plants for those markets see I

2334
01:30:05,479 --> 01:30:09,158
would do all the market research I would

2335
01:30:07,439 --> 01:30:10,559
figure out what was hot in every major

2336
01:30:09,158 --> 01:30:12,879
city across the

2337
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:15,679
USU and then when then I would acquire

2338
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:18,118
the plants that needed to fill those

2339
01:30:15,679 --> 01:30:20,199
holes so when you came into me and you

2340
01:30:18,118 --> 01:30:22,158
told me hey I moved weed to Atlanta I

2341
01:30:20,198 --> 01:30:24,439
would know what was hot in Atlanta and

2342
01:30:22,158 --> 01:30:25,920
that's what I would set you up with so

2343
01:30:24,439 --> 01:30:27,519
what it did is it allowed you to

2344
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:30,199
instantly be able to hit your target

2345
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:31,679
markets at speed and instantly you

2346
01:30:30,198 --> 01:30:33,839
recovering your money and coming back

2347
01:30:31,679 --> 01:30:35,880
quicker and it allowed me to be able to

2348
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:38,000
work with all these farmers and develop

2349
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:40,079
so the more they bought the bigger I got

2350
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,079
the better I did my homework the more

2351
01:30:40,079 --> 01:30:43,760
money they

2352
01:30:41,079 --> 01:30:45,559
made and so Wonderland was really almost

2353
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:48,679
like a Brain Trust more than it was a

2354
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:51,199
nursery it was people didn't really come

2355
01:30:48,679 --> 01:30:54,719
in to buy clones they came in to ask me

2356
01:30:51,198 --> 01:30:56,879
what should I do and then I would sell

2357
01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:59,719
them the Clone that would fit the

2358
01:30:56,880 --> 01:31:02,118
need so it it it made it this really

2359
01:30:59,719 --> 01:31:04,600
interesting proactive

2360
01:31:02,118 --> 01:31:06,559
relationship and I also did stuff that

2361
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:08,440
other people wouldn't do where I I I

2362
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:09,840
lived in Oakland for years and so most

2363
01:31:08,439 --> 01:31:12,079
of my partners that I rolled with

2364
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:13,679
weren't white and so I didn't have an

2365
01:31:12,079 --> 01:31:15,600
issue of going down to Oakland and

2366
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:16,960
dealing with people that weren't white

2367
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:19,159
all my partners that I rot with up in

2368
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:21,158
Humble were basically Samo and tonging

2369
01:31:19,158 --> 01:31:23,920
so for me being around people that were

2370
01:31:21,158 --> 01:31:25,719
poly was fine I had done work with

2371
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:28,279
Mexicans for years right so I was able

2372
01:31:25,719 --> 01:31:30,158
to go work with the Mexicans and when

2373
01:31:28,279 --> 01:31:31,519
the bulgarians and the ukrainians and

2374
01:31:30,158 --> 01:31:34,359
all the Russian groups started coming

2375
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:36,400
into the area I understood what they

2376
01:31:34,359 --> 01:31:40,479
were seeking which was quality product

2377
01:31:36,399 --> 01:31:43,719
that would work and I approached them so

2378
01:31:40,479 --> 01:31:45,919
instead of just kind of focusing only on

2379
01:31:43,719 --> 01:31:48,399
the the typical cannabis cultivator I

2380
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:51,199
went after the ones that I had spent my

2381
01:31:48,399 --> 01:31:53,118
life around people that have to

2382
01:31:51,198 --> 01:31:54,839
cultivate because that's where the

2383
01:31:53,118 --> 01:31:58,158
money's coming from

2384
01:31:54,840 --> 01:32:01,159
and what I would do is I would create my

2385
01:31:58,158 --> 01:32:04,198
menus in different languages Mong you

2386
01:32:01,158 --> 01:32:08,679
know like liosan um

2387
01:32:04,198 --> 01:32:10,319
Spanish um and U Ukrainian and I would

2388
01:32:08,679 --> 01:32:13,679
have them translated and then I would

2389
01:32:10,319 --> 01:32:15,479
have I I would have my partner um Kemo

2390
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:17,520
he would go to all I would identify

2391
01:32:15,479 --> 01:32:19,599
where all the supermarkets and ethnic

2392
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:21,960
food stores in each one of the areas

2393
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:24,079
were and I would have them go there and

2394
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:26,399
talk to those people and say hey is said

2395
01:32:24,079 --> 01:32:28,479
okay if we put this up in your store and

2396
01:32:26,399 --> 01:32:31,519
so what I did is I went after the target

2397
01:32:28,479 --> 01:32:33,959
populations where they lived around

2398
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:36,360
California and I gave them the menus in

2399
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:40,079
their own language and I put it in

2400
01:32:36,359 --> 01:32:42,279
places where they would see it and it it

2401
01:32:40,079 --> 01:32:45,600
just allowed me to get a reach that was

2402
01:32:42,279 --> 01:32:48,639
just Wicked and when the the Cannabis

2403
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:50,520
industry turned upside down I got really

2404
01:32:48,639 --> 01:32:52,840
fortunate because when they started

2405
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:54,400
changing all the zoning they changed the

2406
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:57,520
zoning of my oper

2407
01:32:54,399 --> 01:33:00,399
a so Wonderland no longer had an ability

2408
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:01,960
to cultivate at that location but some

2409
01:33:00,399 --> 01:33:04,399
uh people said hey we would love to have

2410
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:06,880
you come over and work with us and be

2411
01:33:04,399 --> 01:33:09,238
partners on an operation here and so

2412
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:11,400
that's how I got into the One Log and

2413
01:33:09,238 --> 01:33:14,118
then cookies approached us to do the

2414
01:33:11,399 --> 01:33:15,799
nursery and then step by step we ended

2415
01:33:14,118 --> 01:33:18,238
up becoming their entire you know

2416
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:21,400
research and development facility for

2417
01:33:18,238 --> 01:33:23,479
that entity so all the work I did in

2418
01:33:21,399 --> 01:33:25,638
Wonderland it just put me into a

2419
01:33:23,479 --> 01:33:27,919
position where people realized that you

2420
01:33:25,639 --> 01:33:29,760
were seeing something others weren't

2421
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:32,359
because you were moving plants at a pace

2422
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:33,079
no one was with with really no staff to

2423
01:33:32,359 --> 01:33:35,559
do

2424
01:33:33,079 --> 01:33:37,719
sales it was just that I was doing all

2425
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:39,760
this work on my own because I understood

2426
01:33:37,719 --> 01:33:42,719
that if I just I just learned this as a

2427
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:45,880
kid if I make you money we should make

2428
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:47,439
money together if I'm if I'm filling

2429
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:49,639
your pockets with

2430
01:33:47,439 --> 01:33:52,439
cash it's rare that you don't come back

2431
01:33:49,639 --> 01:33:54,239
and deal with me yeah business is

2432
01:33:52,439 --> 01:33:56,279
business

2433
01:33:54,238 --> 01:33:58,000
yeah powerful stuff and what a what a

2434
01:33:56,279 --> 01:33:59,639
really unique and organic sort of

2435
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:01,158
progression you just described there to

2436
01:33:59,639 --> 01:34:03,199
ultimately have the the various

2437
01:34:01,158 --> 01:34:05,719
facilities you Opera in today that's

2438
01:34:03,198 --> 01:34:07,638
really inspiring the development I've

2439
01:34:05,719 --> 01:34:09,279
got uh I've got a few of our patreon

2440
01:34:07,639 --> 01:34:11,920
fans submitted questions before we get

2441
01:34:09,279 --> 01:34:14,359
into the final five questions first one

2442
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:16,920
I just going to quickly run by you um

2443
01:34:14,359 --> 01:34:19,319
our first listener says uh can you ask

2444
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:22,079
Kev has he done any work with any CBD

2445
01:34:19,319 --> 01:34:24,039
CBG or any of the alternative varieties

2446
01:34:22,079 --> 01:34:25,679
and if so what does he find to be the

2447
01:34:24,039 --> 01:34:28,039
most

2448
01:34:25,679 --> 01:34:31,239
medicinal man that's a good question we

2449
01:34:28,039 --> 01:34:32,679
did we were it's funny but like some of

2450
01:34:31,238 --> 01:34:34,638
the first CBD work ever done in the

2451
01:34:32,679 --> 01:34:37,118
United States came out of my original

2452
01:34:34,639 --> 01:34:39,679
shop and I didn't do the breeding of the

2453
01:34:37,118 --> 01:34:41,519
development on it I just was I was the

2454
01:34:39,679 --> 01:34:43,440
one who who listened to the person talk

2455
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:45,239
about what was potentially possible and

2456
01:34:43,439 --> 01:34:48,039
said okay I'll dedicate floor space and

2457
01:34:45,238 --> 01:34:50,599
people to the op and that's where ACDC

2458
01:34:48,039 --> 01:34:53,840
came out so

2459
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:55,840
ACDC and it was from Courtney there was

2460
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:58,119
Wade louder who did Harley Quinn and

2461
01:34:55,840 --> 01:35:01,119
then there was Ringo who did Ringo's

2462
01:34:58,118 --> 01:35:02,519
gift and that was all simultaneously at

2463
01:35:01,118 --> 01:35:04,079
the same time that would have been like

2464
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:08,320
around you know

2465
01:35:04,079 --> 01:35:10,559
208 209 and so all that work resulted in

2466
01:35:08,319 --> 01:35:12,920
this massive development of CBD and what

2467
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:15,520
I had done was I open sourced it I

2468
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:18,480
started flooding the market with all

2469
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:21,280
these CBD Cuts because what we realized

2470
01:35:18,479 --> 01:35:23,279
was non psychoactive cannabis would

2471
01:35:21,279 --> 01:35:24,479
transform the public perception of

2472
01:35:23,279 --> 01:35:26,479
cannabis

2473
01:35:24,479 --> 01:35:28,678
because if you're no longer feeling pain

2474
01:35:26,479 --> 01:35:31,519
from your arthritis in your hands from a

2475
01:35:28,679 --> 01:35:32,960
rub cream then maybe you'll have some

2476
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:35,040
compassion for someone who needs to

2477
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:38,279
smoke cannabis because they're

2478
01:35:35,039 --> 01:35:42,118
depressed and so my theory was if we

2479
01:35:38,279 --> 01:35:44,599
shared the genes in this way it would

2480
01:35:42,118 --> 01:35:47,399
absolutely infiltrate the public and it

2481
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:49,320
did so like I was known for years for

2482
01:35:47,399 --> 01:35:51,399
just releasing [ __ ] millions of dollars

2483
01:35:49,319 --> 01:35:53,118
of free clones I did it for free so I

2484
01:35:51,399 --> 01:35:55,238
mean we release hundreds and hundreds of

2485
01:35:53,118 --> 01:35:59,719
thousands of plants to groups all over

2486
01:35:55,238 --> 01:36:02,439
the world of CBD genes and what I think

2487
01:35:59,719 --> 01:36:04,840
is that if you're if you're working with

2488
01:36:02,439 --> 01:36:07,879
CBD I think some of the the mix ratios

2489
01:36:04,840 --> 01:36:09,760
like one to ones two to ones are ideal

2490
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:11,400
because when we it depends on the

2491
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:14,239
individual but say you're say you're a

2492
01:36:11,399 --> 01:36:18,319
normal cannabis consumer if you have

2493
01:36:14,238 --> 01:36:20,158
some CBD woven in it it balances out the

2494
01:36:18,319 --> 01:36:21,960
high so like when you really look at

2495
01:36:20,158 --> 01:36:25,599
land raise populations they're not all

2496
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:27,359
pure THC definitely mixed cannabinoids

2497
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:29,800
because they're not steering towards a

2498
01:36:27,359 --> 01:36:31,880
singular singular molecule and because

2499
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:35,520
of it what you have is a better

2500
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:37,079
Synergy and so I think that the the best

2501
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:39,960
thing you could do is you know go into

2502
01:36:37,079 --> 01:36:42,880
some of these modern hemp varieties and

2503
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:47,679
use them as a platform to bring in more

2504
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:50,079
THC so you can get to a 122 13 15

2505
01:36:47,679 --> 01:36:52,239
something in that range and what you'll

2506
01:36:50,079 --> 01:36:53,960
have is you'll have the best effects of

2507
01:36:52,238 --> 01:36:56,559
both

2508
01:36:53,960 --> 01:36:57,960
and on a lot of these other canabo

2509
01:36:56,560 --> 01:37:00,520
that's a tough one because really I

2510
01:36:57,960 --> 01:37:04,158
don't I don't I don't try to chase

2511
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:06,480
canabo dour because really that's a a

2512
01:37:04,158 --> 01:37:08,799
molecular basket hunt that means you

2513
01:37:06,479 --> 01:37:10,678
have to be really using labs to do so

2514
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:12,079
much of the driving and the work towards

2515
01:37:10,679 --> 01:37:16,000
it and it's

2516
01:37:12,079 --> 01:37:18,039
expensive and that's not me I mean like

2517
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:20,600
I I can work with you on a project to do

2518
01:37:18,039 --> 01:37:22,639
it by helping you choose plants but what

2519
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:25,800
I want is I want cannabis that I like to

2520
01:37:22,639 --> 01:37:27,719
consume for the reasons I do and so when

2521
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:29,840
I'm chasing

2522
01:37:27,719 --> 01:37:31,840
something I have to kind of have a

2523
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:35,719
desire to touch it and play with

2524
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:38,840
it and so THC molecule is one I really

2525
01:37:35,719 --> 01:37:41,599
seem to like and I like it woven in with

2526
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:43,520
some CBD but I I don't I didn't go after

2527
01:37:41,599 --> 01:37:46,239
the cbc's the

2528
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:49,239
cbgs um I have a plant that's got some

2529
01:37:46,238 --> 01:37:52,198
thcp in it at at you know detectable

2530
01:37:49,238 --> 01:37:53,839
levels which is very rare and I'm

2531
01:37:52,198 --> 01:37:55,319
fascinated by that I don't know there's

2532
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:59,400
enough there to be able to actually

2533
01:37:55,319 --> 01:38:01,519
steer towards the direction but thcp is

2534
01:37:59,399 --> 01:38:04,598
a a molecule

2535
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:07,520
that is like 30 times stronger than

2536
01:38:04,599 --> 01:38:10,960
THC and so it it to me it's one of the

2537
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:13,239
things that affect longevity of high and

2538
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:16,079
U just the overall how much you need in

2539
01:38:13,238 --> 01:38:17,919
titration to get high I'm pretty

2540
01:38:16,079 --> 01:38:20,279
fascinated by that I think some of the

2541
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:22,399
the thcv work that's being done right

2542
01:38:20,279 --> 01:38:24,000
now is fascinating and I got to consume

2543
01:38:22,399 --> 01:38:26,719
some thcv

2544
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:29,679
herb grown by a brand

2545
01:38:26,719 --> 01:38:34,439
called pure beauty out of LA and so it's

2546
01:38:29,679 --> 01:38:36,800
a woman-owned living soil indoor op and

2547
01:38:34,439 --> 01:38:38,359
I've never met any of the team but I

2548
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:41,599
they sent me some of the products so

2549
01:38:38,359 --> 01:38:43,799
that I could uh do an essay on it and I

2550
01:38:41,599 --> 01:38:46,239
was astounded man they just straight

2551
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:48,639
crushed it so the pure beauty girls are

2552
01:38:46,238 --> 01:38:52,000
throwing down some straight heat and

2553
01:38:48,639 --> 01:38:54,319
that thcv was fascinating because you

2554
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:57,118
got this unbelievably effective

2555
01:38:54,319 --> 01:39:00,198
uplifting high and when you came down

2556
01:38:57,118 --> 01:39:01,880
you didn't crash and it had a really

2557
01:39:00,198 --> 01:39:04,960
interesting side effect where you

2558
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:07,560
weren't hungry afterwards you didn't go

2559
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:08,920
through the Munch cycle but like you it

2560
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:11,920
wasn't that you weren't hungry you could

2561
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:14,118
eat dinner but you didn't eat dinner

2562
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:16,679
twice you know where to me if I'm

2563
01:39:14,118 --> 01:39:18,519
smoking BHO I have to be careful because

2564
01:39:16,679 --> 01:39:20,639
I'm gonna not just eat the pizza on my

2565
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:24,560
plate but I'm gonna eat the pizza in the

2566
01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:26,760
Box thcv didn't do that so I think the

2567
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:28,639
mix I think the the novel can abono are

2568
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:31,119
fascinating but I think for the average

2569
01:39:28,639 --> 01:39:33,679
individual a one to one a two to one is

2570
01:39:31,118 --> 01:39:36,279
just something wonderful to

2571
01:39:33,679 --> 01:39:37,920
have yeah I've certainly found a oneto

2572
01:39:36,279 --> 01:39:39,840
one is sort of that sweet spot for

2573
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:42,039
myself so I can hugely relate to what

2574
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:44,319
you just said there we got another good

2575
01:39:42,039 --> 01:39:47,039
one from one of the listeners who says I

2576
01:39:44,319 --> 01:39:49,319
saw that photo of the huge ball of the

2577
01:39:47,039 --> 01:39:51,880
Roberts Creek Congo hash on his

2578
01:39:49,319 --> 01:39:54,238
Instagram I'd love to hear any hash

2579
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:56,319
making tips for making hash from like

2580
01:39:54,238 --> 01:40:00,839
low yielding but special

2581
01:39:56,319 --> 01:40:04,559
plants you know the the the process of

2582
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:06,560
hash is is is pretty well laid out what

2583
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:09,560
you what you have to do when you work

2584
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:13,560
with plants that just don't produce is

2585
01:40:09,560 --> 01:40:15,199
recognize that so you you it's not for

2586
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:17,119
commercial purposes when I made that

2587
01:40:15,198 --> 01:40:18,719
ball at at Roberts Creek Congo hash I

2588
01:40:17,118 --> 01:40:20,198
laughed and I said I guarantee there's

2589
01:40:18,719 --> 01:40:22,560
no bigger ball of this [ __ ] in the

2590
01:40:20,198 --> 01:40:24,759
country at this point right now because

2591
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:27,639
nobody would wait waste that much weed

2592
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:30,440
to make that much hash but I I got some

2593
01:40:27,639 --> 01:40:32,679
right here I still got a piece of a

2594
01:40:30,439 --> 01:40:34,279
left I still I still have a piece of it

2595
01:40:32,679 --> 01:40:36,399
left right there yeah a little little

2596
01:40:34,279 --> 01:40:38,319
tiny nugget that's yeah yeah two years

2597
01:40:36,399 --> 01:40:42,000
old now I was smoking it the other night

2598
01:40:38,319 --> 01:40:43,960
I got destroyed um you just have to be

2599
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:46,399
able to like make those decisions and

2600
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:48,198
the the the situation is it's really

2601
01:40:46,399 --> 01:40:51,039
difficult if you're doing it indoor and

2602
01:40:48,198 --> 01:40:52,879
you're paying electricity on that [ __ ]

2603
01:40:51,039 --> 01:40:55,000
so for me you know it's different that I

2604
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:56,800
I could do the Roberts Creek outside and

2605
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:58,679
I could get a plant that could throw me

2606
01:40:56,800 --> 01:41:01,320
three pounds so that I could basically

2607
01:40:58,679 --> 01:41:02,880
get a golf ball of hash off of it

2608
01:41:01,319 --> 01:41:06,279
because you know you talking yields that

2609
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:09,520
are just non-existent in the wash and I

2610
01:41:06,279 --> 01:41:12,399
knew that when I went into it but I just

2611
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:15,400
wanted to try it I wanted to say hey

2612
01:41:12,399 --> 01:41:17,679
what happens when you don't care about

2613
01:41:15,399 --> 01:41:21,000
return what you care about is the

2614
01:41:17,679 --> 01:41:24,560
quality of the return and the Roberts

2615
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:26,198
Creek Congo hash was excellent and

2616
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:27,440
I still love smoking I only got that

2617
01:41:26,198 --> 01:41:30,799
little piece left you know I probably

2618
01:41:27,439 --> 01:41:33,719
got like what maybe two three grams left

2619
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:33,719
but man it was

2620
01:41:34,039 --> 01:41:39,719
just grabbed you and and it and it

2621
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:41,840
didn't lift it it when it was fresh the

2622
01:41:39,719 --> 01:41:44,760
high was way more like

2623
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:47,800
heady as it started to mature and and

2624
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:49,800
really polymerize the effect became way

2625
01:41:47,800 --> 01:41:52,719
more pronounced and profound where you

2626
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:55,560
felt it in your body too so two-year-old

2627
01:41:52,719 --> 01:41:57,158
Congo has is still unbelievable and it's

2628
01:41:55,560 --> 01:41:59,800
two years it was two years ago that I

2629
01:41:57,158 --> 01:42:01,279
did that easy so I think you just have

2630
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:02,679
to be able to make it you know work for

2631
01:42:01,279 --> 01:42:04,279
you and don't be afraid you know if you

2632
01:42:02,679 --> 01:42:07,199
have an outdoor patch next year same

2633
01:42:04,279 --> 01:42:09,759
thing I want to do I want I got I got

2634
01:42:07,198 --> 01:42:14,000
one of my one of my red Leb plants is is

2635
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:16,199
low yielding but the the profile is so

2636
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:19,719
attractive and I know that it'll break

2637
01:42:16,198 --> 01:42:22,238
off well that it'll be worth me doing my

2638
01:42:19,719 --> 01:42:25,399
whole medical Garden of just that to

2639
01:42:22,238 --> 01:42:27,879
wash and then grow my six plants for my

2640
01:42:25,399 --> 01:42:29,039
flower so I just think that at the end

2641
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:31,159
of the day if you're not looking at

2642
01:42:29,039 --> 01:42:33,439
commercial constraints and you're a

2643
01:42:31,158 --> 01:42:36,319
consumer who gives a

2644
01:42:33,439 --> 01:42:38,638
[ __ ] totally got to follow the passion

2645
01:42:36,319 --> 01:42:41,039
and the quality I love that a question

2646
01:42:38,639 --> 01:42:43,000
we end up asking most guests on the show

2647
01:42:41,039 --> 01:42:44,479
if you had to take a guess what do you

2648
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:46,439
think is the genetics behind the

2649
01:42:44,479 --> 01:42:49,638
legendary chem dog

2650
01:42:46,439 --> 01:42:53,238
91 oh that's a good question you know

2651
01:42:49,639 --> 01:42:56,920
the the the chem lines I remember I was

2652
01:42:53,238 --> 01:42:59,238
out there in ponia I was out there in in

2653
01:42:56,920 --> 01:43:01,118
Crested bu area of Colorado where all

2654
01:42:59,238 --> 01:43:04,759
that comes from initially I was there

2655
01:43:01,118 --> 01:43:08,238
around 92

2656
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:09,639
93 and my partner was out there and and

2657
01:43:08,238 --> 01:43:11,118
it was funny because he was like heav he

2658
01:43:09,639 --> 01:43:12,800
goes I smoked some weed here that that

2659
01:43:11,118 --> 01:43:15,238
destroyed any other pot I ever smoked in

2660
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:17,880
my entire life he said this area is the

2661
01:43:15,238 --> 01:43:21,439
hot bed of Colorado for Killa

2662
01:43:17,880 --> 01:43:24,039
weed and there was um I just talked to

2663
01:43:21,439 --> 01:43:26,039
somebody that it was they were trying to

2664
01:43:24,039 --> 01:43:28,840
chase down what was the parental stock

2665
01:43:26,039 --> 01:43:30,599
of it and at the end of the day we just

2666
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:32,880
know basically where it came from we

2667
01:43:30,599 --> 01:43:35,360
know it came out of the that area but I

2668
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:37,679
do not know the lineage you know we

2669
01:43:35,359 --> 01:43:40,079
could say it's it's got to be a hybrid

2670
01:43:37,679 --> 01:43:42,599
so it has to have some form of of

2671
01:43:40,079 --> 01:43:44,439
something Broad Leaf and something

2672
01:43:42,599 --> 01:43:46,119
narrow because of the growth

2673
01:43:44,439 --> 01:43:48,719
characteristics right so like on a

2674
01:43:46,118 --> 01:43:52,079
morphological level you can see traits

2675
01:43:48,719 --> 01:43:54,079
that are explosive in growth on the 91

2676
01:43:52,079 --> 01:43:55,760
which only really apply to plants that

2677
01:43:54,079 --> 01:43:57,679
have to outgrow everything around it in

2678
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:59,520
the surrounding vegetation but it has a

2679
01:43:57,679 --> 01:44:02,760
profile that is

2680
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:05,800
distinctly Afghani

2681
01:44:02,760 --> 01:44:08,280
Pakistan yeah I'm not sure we'll ever

2682
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:09,920
really know the the true Origins maybe

2683
01:44:08,279 --> 01:44:12,399
genetic testing will get a little more

2684
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:15,399
info at some point but might just need

2685
01:44:12,399 --> 01:44:16,638
to accept that we'll never fully know I

2686
01:44:15,399 --> 01:44:18,279
have another good one from one of the

2687
01:44:16,639 --> 01:44:22,599
listeners who said I got a pack of seeds

2688
01:44:18,279 --> 01:44:24,198
from the 2020 Durand Line of the GNE

2689
01:44:22,599 --> 01:44:26,360
what sort of Expressions did you get

2690
01:44:24,198 --> 01:44:27,598
from your hunt what can they um hope to

2691
01:44:26,359 --> 01:44:32,359
find

2692
01:44:27,599 --> 01:44:35,840
themselves I found two really distinct

2693
01:44:32,359 --> 01:44:37,279
profiles both male and female and it was

2694
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:38,880
kind of neat because it it made it

2695
01:44:37,279 --> 01:44:41,000
pretty easy to make your choices but

2696
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:43,359
what I found was you know green and

2697
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:47,039
purple and purple was more open

2698
01:44:43,359 --> 01:44:49,000
branching kind of umbrella shaped

2699
01:44:47,039 --> 01:44:52,679
pomegranate nut

2700
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:56,679
paste floral sweet and then the green

2701
01:44:52,679 --> 01:45:00,359
was more more pole like chunky with just

2702
01:44:56,679 --> 01:45:02,399
a a ferociously noxious

2703
01:45:00,359 --> 01:45:04,238
sulfur and so when I did all my

2704
01:45:02,399 --> 01:45:06,598
hybridization work I went with the

2705
01:45:04,238 --> 01:45:08,919
sulfur because everybody was going fruit

2706
01:45:06,599 --> 01:45:10,440
and sweet and I was kind of sick of it

2707
01:45:08,920 --> 01:45:13,520
and what I wanted was some you know

2708
01:45:10,439 --> 01:45:16,439
really funky nasty deep penetrating

2709
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:18,960
odors Aromas and highs and that's where

2710
01:45:16,439 --> 01:45:21,039
when I did that that project I took the

2711
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:22,359
mail I chose that I made those plants

2712
01:45:21,039 --> 01:45:24,960
with or one of them there was multiple

2713
01:45:22,359 --> 01:45:26,920
males in that in that release but the

2714
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:28,639
one that I kept for myself that's the

2715
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:31,118
one that I went into all the fuels and

2716
01:45:28,639 --> 01:45:34,599
the Cherry Pie and pulled out that

2717
01:45:31,118 --> 01:45:37,000
cherry pie plant that was absolutely A+

2718
01:45:34,599 --> 01:45:39,360
and I had my son's friend come by and

2719
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:42,479
fresh freeze it and then process it and

2720
01:45:39,359 --> 01:45:43,839
then rosin it for me so that I'd have

2721
01:45:42,479 --> 01:45:45,759
because I don't do Ros it I don't press

2722
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:47,279
it and so I I wanted someone that could

2723
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:49,360
go through the process and give me a

2724
01:45:47,279 --> 01:45:52,519
dabbable product that I could take to

2725
01:45:49,359 --> 01:45:54,759
this event so that this is the product I

2726
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:56,800
wanted to show people that was possible

2727
01:45:54,760 --> 01:45:59,199
when we take some of these lines and it

2728
01:45:56,800 --> 01:46:01,760
was so attractive that the lead breeder

2729
01:45:59,198 --> 01:46:03,118
a raw Adam got excited by it and I ended

2730
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:04,679
up giving him some seeds so that he

2731
01:46:03,118 --> 01:46:07,079
could go play with it and they they did

2732
01:46:04,679 --> 01:46:09,039
a huge uh selection of it this year to

2733
01:46:07,079 --> 01:46:11,198
see how it worked out for them at their

2734
01:46:09,039 --> 01:46:12,800
operation because he had never smelled a

2735
01:46:11,198 --> 01:46:13,678
profile like that in person it was just

2736
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:15,719
super

2737
01:46:13,679 --> 01:46:17,920
attractive and at the end of the day all

2738
01:46:15,719 --> 01:46:21,239
I really wanted to have people do was be

2739
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:24,158
able to say hey this reflects uh seed

2740
01:46:21,238 --> 01:46:27,118
stock from gny

2741
01:46:24,158 --> 01:46:29,279
and it was uh you know Indian Land race

2742
01:46:27,118 --> 01:46:31,118
that put it out so all I did was clean

2743
01:46:29,279 --> 01:46:33,479
up the population to get rid of the

2744
01:46:31,118 --> 01:46:35,719
intersects for on an indoor sip so I ran

2745
01:46:33,479 --> 01:46:37,039
it outdoor took the ones from the out

2746
01:46:35,719 --> 01:46:38,639
put them in the ones that went

2747
01:46:37,039 --> 01:46:42,359
intersects I called and that's what we

2748
01:46:38,639 --> 01:46:45,960
used as the population to make that

2749
01:46:42,359 --> 01:46:48,598
F2 and you have two directions really it

2750
01:46:45,960 --> 01:46:50,079
broke up really really clearly and and I

2751
01:46:48,599 --> 01:46:51,440
would love to go back and I think I will

2752
01:46:50,079 --> 01:46:53,519
when I get a chance I'll go back and

2753
01:46:51,439 --> 01:46:56,158
I'll do the purple pomegranate with the

2754
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:58,840
nut paste because that was super exotic

2755
01:46:56,158 --> 01:47:00,000
too it's just that I was bored with all

2756
01:46:58,840 --> 01:47:01,560
you know you got to go back I probably

2757
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:05,039
did that like through three four years

2758
01:47:01,560 --> 01:47:07,159
ago right and I was just bored with all

2759
01:47:05,039 --> 01:47:09,760
the candy gas [ __ ] and so I said look I

2760
01:47:07,158 --> 01:47:11,439
want some I want some really deep Funk

2761
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:12,880
and then I went and deep funked it for a

2762
01:47:11,439 --> 01:47:14,759
while and like maybe I wouldn't mind

2763
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:17,800
going back into some of the florals and

2764
01:47:14,760 --> 01:47:20,199
fruits but not from the typical Jean

2765
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:21,760
pools so go play and if they do a

2766
01:47:20,198 --> 01:47:23,359
preservation make sure you put the males

2767
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:25,560
and the females together to get the

2768
01:47:23,359 --> 01:47:29,238
assortment you want to be able to keep a

2769
01:47:25,560 --> 01:47:31,280
good cluster of the genes pure and then

2770
01:47:29,238 --> 01:47:33,759
choose males that you can play with to

2771
01:47:31,279 --> 01:47:35,599
find out their impact on the females you

2772
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:37,480
want to use so you're able to do

2773
01:47:35,599 --> 01:47:39,400
hybridization bring the qualities

2774
01:47:37,479 --> 01:47:42,039
forward the qualities that got brought

2775
01:47:39,399 --> 01:47:44,839
forward too I noticed was

2776
01:47:42,039 --> 01:47:47,519
incredible um change in water

2777
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:49,840
consumption the plants decreased water

2778
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:51,320
consumption dramatically which was one

2779
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:52,639
of the reasons really why I wanted to

2780
01:47:51,319 --> 01:47:53,599
mess around with some of that work

2781
01:47:52,639 --> 01:47:55,480
because because we were in the middle of

2782
01:47:53,599 --> 01:47:58,159
this horrific drought in California and

2783
01:47:55,479 --> 01:48:00,919
I was like man if I could just put some

2784
01:47:58,158 --> 01:48:02,719
better water efficiency on some of these

2785
01:48:00,920 --> 01:48:04,319
plants it would just be a lot easier for

2786
01:48:02,719 --> 01:48:07,198
us so we're not having to go through so

2787
01:48:04,319 --> 01:48:08,920
much water and in the trials I just

2788
01:48:07,198 --> 01:48:10,839
noticed that all of those hybrids I did

2789
01:48:08,920 --> 01:48:15,639
all watered at you

2790
01:48:10,840 --> 01:48:17,880
know I would say twice as you know T

2791
01:48:15,639 --> 01:48:21,599
like you know double the infrequency but

2792
01:48:17,880 --> 01:48:23,520
probably like 0 6 so extremely water

2793
01:48:21,599 --> 01:48:25,079
effective

2794
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:26,360
that's awesome to hear some really cool

2795
01:48:25,079 --> 01:48:27,559
observations there and you know

2796
01:48:26,359 --> 01:48:30,479
hopefully our listener can find some

2797
01:48:27,560 --> 01:48:32,320
cool stuff in there I've got one last

2798
01:48:30,479 --> 01:48:33,759
fan submitted one before our final five

2799
01:48:32,319 --> 01:48:35,759
it's a cool one one we've never asked

2800
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:38,280
Our Guest before I'm I'm Keen to see

2801
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:40,280
what you think on it the question is

2802
01:48:38,279 --> 01:48:42,920
what's the hardest part about being

2803
01:48:40,279 --> 01:48:44,599
cannabis famous do you get stopped a lot

2804
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:47,920
do you find people respect your time

2805
01:48:44,599 --> 01:48:49,400
generally speaking I do I do I get I do

2806
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:53,118
get stopped a lot and it's weird because

2807
01:48:49,399 --> 01:48:55,519
I never expected to be you know famous a

2808
01:48:53,118 --> 01:48:58,920
thing and it wasn't really the desire as

2809
01:48:55,520 --> 01:49:03,119
much as I was Desiring to be recognized

2810
01:48:58,920 --> 01:49:07,199
for the work I had done and I ended up

2811
01:49:03,118 --> 01:49:09,158
just becoming featured on media enough

2812
01:49:07,198 --> 01:49:12,799
times that all of a sudden you kind of

2813
01:49:09,158 --> 01:49:14,759
become comfortable with it and you you

2814
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:17,679
because you're not Desiring that

2815
01:49:14,760 --> 01:49:18,960
position you understand that they're the

2816
01:49:17,679 --> 01:49:20,679
people that are listen are not really

2817
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:22,239
there to listen to me as much as they're

2818
01:49:20,679 --> 01:49:23,520
listen to what's coming out of my mouth

2819
01:49:22,238 --> 01:49:27,519
in terms of of

2820
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:29,760
information so what what I know is that

2821
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:31,440
I try to provide information to the

2822
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:34,119
public that has

2823
01:49:31,439 --> 01:49:37,039
value and I try to be

2824
01:49:34,118 --> 01:49:39,639
approachable and the hard part is that

2825
01:49:37,039 --> 01:49:39,639
in real

2826
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:45,239
life it's hard to you know be able to

2827
01:49:42,399 --> 01:49:46,679
give that much time to that many people

2828
01:49:45,238 --> 01:49:48,638
and so what you have to do is you got to

2829
01:49:46,679 --> 01:49:49,719
kind of create like parameters where

2830
01:49:48,639 --> 01:49:51,239
people reach out to you and they're

2831
01:49:49,719 --> 01:49:52,319
reaching out to you seven times a day

2832
01:49:51,238 --> 01:49:55,319
and you're like look I don't talk to my

2833
01:49:52,319 --> 01:49:57,559
own kid this often um could you just

2834
01:49:55,319 --> 01:49:59,039
maybe not hit me up every 15 minutes and

2835
01:49:57,560 --> 01:50:01,800
we'll we'll probably be able to have a

2836
01:49:59,039 --> 01:50:05,118
better long-term friendship so what I do

2837
01:50:01,800 --> 01:50:08,159
is I I try to create some separation of

2838
01:50:05,118 --> 01:50:11,559
barriers but not remove you from the

2839
01:50:08,158 --> 01:50:14,598
picture and if you approach me and you

2840
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:16,239
polite man I'm always down to sit down

2841
01:50:14,599 --> 01:50:18,360
if you want if you want to lay out your

2842
01:50:16,238 --> 01:50:20,598
whole business plan to me and I have to

2843
01:50:18,359 --> 01:50:22,039
go spend six hours of like trying to

2844
01:50:20,599 --> 01:50:23,159
sort through your [ __ ] I'm like that's

2845
01:50:22,039 --> 01:50:25,319
business

2846
01:50:23,158 --> 01:50:27,198
but if you're asking me a question and

2847
01:50:25,319 --> 01:50:29,759
you just want to bounce an idea for

2848
01:50:27,198 --> 01:50:31,960
somebody and you're able to like be

2849
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:33,920
polite in the way you approach me it's

2850
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:36,800
rare that I won't sit down and try to

2851
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:39,840
take the time because at the end of the

2852
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:42,159
day my desire in real life was to do

2853
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:44,039
well and to see people around me do well

2854
01:50:42,158 --> 01:50:47,719
I I wasn't trying to do well

2855
01:50:44,039 --> 01:50:49,238
alone and I just think that when you

2856
01:50:47,719 --> 01:50:52,359
behave that way you end up having a

2857
01:50:49,238 --> 01:50:54,279
better life period Your Life is Richer

2858
01:50:52,359 --> 01:50:57,880
because you're around people trying to

2859
01:50:54,279 --> 01:50:59,719
do positive [ __ ] and just because you're

2860
01:50:57,880 --> 01:51:01,760
being nice doesn't mean you're stupid or

2861
01:50:59,719 --> 01:51:03,760
you're a sucker because you know the

2862
01:51:01,760 --> 01:51:05,800
difference and so for me it's it's about

2863
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:07,560
the approach where you don't have to

2864
01:51:05,800 --> 01:51:09,560
give me I call it a verbal [ __ ] I

2865
01:51:07,560 --> 01:51:13,000
don't need a verbal [ __ ] I just need

2866
01:51:09,560 --> 01:51:16,199
you to to treat me like anybody else you

2867
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:18,158
meet and just be polite and and approach

2868
01:51:16,198 --> 01:51:20,719
me in a way that's

2869
01:51:18,158 --> 01:51:24,158
approachable and if you can do that then

2870
01:51:20,719 --> 01:51:25,920
we can begin a conversation

2871
01:51:24,158 --> 01:51:27,839
and so for me that's why I make myself

2872
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:30,118
so available at all the conferences I

2873
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:32,880
attend all the different events I go to

2874
01:51:30,118 --> 01:51:35,198
because what I know is that I get to see

2875
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:38,560
so much of the Cannabis

2876
01:51:35,198 --> 01:51:41,598
world that if I can provide little

2877
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:43,480
tidbits of info to people that are

2878
01:51:41,599 --> 01:51:44,800
trying to figure something out and find

2879
01:51:43,479 --> 01:51:48,759
a world for

2880
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:51,719
them it maybe it changes how they

2881
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:55,560
approach people in their future maybe if

2882
01:51:51,719 --> 01:51:57,520
we behave this way then you'll behave

2883
01:51:55,560 --> 01:51:59,239
this way you know it's like the same

2884
01:51:57,520 --> 01:52:00,920
thing with me giving the jeans out I

2885
01:51:59,238 --> 01:52:02,158
helped all these people that it was

2886
01:52:00,920 --> 01:52:03,520
funny because when I was doing it

2887
01:52:02,158 --> 01:52:05,638
everybody was like you're a heretic

2888
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:06,920
you're helping out nobody's but I'm like

2889
01:52:05,639 --> 01:52:09,639
yeah but they're nobody to you but

2890
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:12,118
they're decent people to me they don't

2891
01:52:09,639 --> 01:52:14,760
have to have any value to me I I'm not

2892
01:52:12,118 --> 01:52:17,279
seeing as that they're just good people

2893
01:52:14,760 --> 01:52:19,360
and if I give them this cut and they

2894
01:52:17,279 --> 01:52:22,279
they use their own skills and effort to

2895
01:52:19,359 --> 01:52:24,158
take it further and it it really well

2896
01:52:22,279 --> 01:52:27,399
could change their life it'll change it

2897
01:52:24,158 --> 01:52:29,799
financially for sure and so what happens

2898
01:52:27,399 --> 01:52:31,920
is I didn't realize that I was

2899
01:52:29,800 --> 01:52:34,760
developing a future of

2900
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:36,199
people and you go 15 years into the

2901
01:52:34,760 --> 01:52:37,360
future and you got people hitting you up

2902
01:52:36,198 --> 01:52:39,678
and they were like hey you know when I

2903
01:52:37,359 --> 01:52:41,479
was 16 17 you helped me you change my

2904
01:52:39,679 --> 01:52:43,840
life I'm in my mid-30s and I'm running a

2905
01:52:41,479 --> 01:52:45,279
monstrous operation in another country

2906
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:47,560
and I just wanted to reach out to you to

2907
01:52:45,279 --> 01:52:50,039
let you know that if it wasn't for you I

2908
01:52:47,560 --> 01:52:51,719
wouldn't be here and I never got to

2909
01:52:50,039 --> 01:52:53,960
thank you but now that you know I could

2910
01:52:51,719 --> 01:52:55,880
find you public I can say thank you for

2911
01:52:53,960 --> 01:52:58,039
being good to me when no one else was

2912
01:52:55,880 --> 01:53:01,560
and it's it's emotional

2913
01:52:58,039 --> 01:53:03,560
because you you're not thinking about it

2914
01:53:01,560 --> 01:53:06,239
like that you're just trying to be

2915
01:53:03,560 --> 01:53:08,719
decent it it was like the Louis the 13th

2916
01:53:06,238 --> 01:53:10,879
cut right I get the Louis the 13th cut

2917
01:53:08,719 --> 01:53:14,198
because some old lady had a bad time and

2918
01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:16,960
I helped her out and and she knows what

2919
01:53:14,198 --> 01:53:18,559
I do and she and she she uh comes to my

2920
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:21,118
office and she brings the phone and says

2921
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:24,119
here my family wants to talk to you and

2922
01:53:21,118 --> 01:53:26,238
it was her Armenian in-laws that own the

2923
01:53:24,118 --> 01:53:27,519
the Louis the 13th cut down there in LA

2924
01:53:26,238 --> 01:53:29,759
that were making all the money on it

2925
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:32,040
that cut was hotter than a firecracker

2926
01:53:29,760 --> 01:53:34,719
and they drove all the way from LA to

2927
01:53:32,039 --> 01:53:37,519
Humble to bring me five

2928
01:53:34,719 --> 01:53:39,599
clones to say here these are the most

2929
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:41,520
valuable OG clones and the connection

2930
01:53:39,599 --> 01:53:44,760
right now like this is the number one

2931
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:46,400
cut in the game here's five cuts for you

2932
01:53:44,760 --> 01:53:48,719
for helping our our

2933
01:53:46,399 --> 01:53:50,238
mother-in-law and I had no idea that

2934
01:53:48,719 --> 01:53:53,560
mother-in-law was connected to these

2935
01:53:50,238 --> 01:53:55,319
these Hustlers from LA but it was just a

2936
01:53:53,560 --> 01:53:58,000
good deed for an old lady that needed

2937
01:53:55,319 --> 01:53:59,840
some help and so I think that you know

2938
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:01,359
for me in my and it's almost like an

2939
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:03,480
innocent world but like I came from a

2940
01:54:01,359 --> 01:54:07,839
different background man it was

2941
01:54:03,479 --> 01:54:09,839
rough a a nicer life is never bad and so

2942
01:54:07,840 --> 01:54:12,360
when you when you when you decent to

2943
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:13,520
people it allows you a radically

2944
01:54:12,359 --> 01:54:16,439
different

2945
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:19,639
existence and being well known in

2946
01:54:16,439 --> 01:54:21,319
something is never bad as long as when

2947
01:54:19,639 --> 01:54:23,039
people meet you you're the same person

2948
01:54:21,319 --> 01:54:25,279
that they they

2949
01:54:23,039 --> 01:54:26,880
and so for some people it's not good

2950
01:54:25,279 --> 01:54:30,559
because they're like well you smart ass

2951
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:33,118
in real life and on the net but for most

2952
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:34,719
it's good because I'm pretty predictable

2953
01:54:33,118 --> 01:54:37,679
and at the end of the day what I want to

2954
01:54:34,719 --> 01:54:38,439
see is I want to see cultivators around

2955
01:54:37,679 --> 01:54:42,000
the

2956
01:54:38,439 --> 01:54:45,279
world in in a in a in a cohesive

2957
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:47,399
collaborative cluster that lets us help

2958
01:54:45,279 --> 01:54:50,359
shape the future that we'll all have to

2959
01:54:47,399 --> 01:54:52,439
deal with when we're old and like I I've

2960
01:54:50,359 --> 01:54:55,439
been saying for decades I'm just the

2961
01:54:52,439 --> 01:54:58,118
tiny Link in a chain that's G on forever

2962
01:54:55,439 --> 01:55:00,638
and I just want to be a good link and so

2963
01:54:58,118 --> 01:55:03,158
if you want to link up with me you can

2964
01:55:00,639 --> 01:55:07,199
and if you don't you can let go it's all

2965
01:55:03,158 --> 01:55:09,039
good but being being exposed is a gift

2966
01:55:07,198 --> 01:55:10,799
because it allows you to really be able

2967
01:55:09,039 --> 01:55:12,000
to do some incredible things you can't

2968
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:14,719
do if you're

2969
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:16,078
not yeah that's an awesome take I really

2970
01:55:14,719 --> 01:55:18,039
like that and it sounds like you you

2971
01:55:16,078 --> 01:55:19,920
know make yourself available to people

2972
01:55:18,039 --> 01:55:22,519
which is really generous of you with you

2973
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:26,319
know your time I'm sure it's limited on

2974
01:55:22,520 --> 01:55:28,920
to our final five quickfire questions

2975
01:55:26,319 --> 01:55:31,599
the first one I want to ask okay what is

2976
01:55:28,920 --> 01:55:33,118
the single most memorable experience

2977
01:55:31,599 --> 01:55:35,679
you've had with cannabis so this doesn't

2978
01:55:33,118 --> 01:55:38,000
have to be like the strongest nug or the

2979
01:55:35,679 --> 01:55:40,679
most insane dab just whatever is the

2980
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:42,760
most memorable for whatever reason I got

2981
01:55:40,679 --> 01:55:44,639
it man I got I got the story I smoked

2982
01:55:42,760 --> 01:55:47,079
some weed from pipe I was working out in

2983
01:55:44,639 --> 01:55:49,359
Micronesia I smoked some weed and I got

2984
01:55:47,078 --> 01:55:51,719
so high that I couldn't navigate the

2985
01:55:49,359 --> 01:55:53,559
offramp on the freeway and so I just

2986
01:55:51,719 --> 01:55:55,239
drove around on the island for hours

2987
01:55:53,560 --> 01:55:57,360
until I came down because every time I

2988
01:55:55,238 --> 01:55:59,439
got to the onramp it was too technically

2989
01:55:57,359 --> 01:56:01,000
difficult for me to navigate and so I

2990
01:55:59,439 --> 01:56:02,439
just did another loop around the island

2991
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:05,599
and I was just praying that I didn't run

2992
01:56:02,439 --> 01:56:07,719
out of gas because there was no way that

2993
01:56:05,599 --> 01:56:09,560
I could navigate this offramp until I

2994
01:56:07,719 --> 01:56:12,039
came

2995
01:56:09,560 --> 01:56:14,360
down that is brilliant I really like

2996
01:56:12,039 --> 01:56:16,439
that that's one of the best ones I think

2997
01:56:14,359 --> 01:56:18,359
um so on the other end of the spectrum

2998
01:56:16,439 --> 01:56:20,479
what's a strain where everyone around

2999
01:56:18,359 --> 01:56:21,639
you really hyped about it everyone's

3000
01:56:20,479 --> 01:56:23,678
telling you it's going to be the best

3001
01:56:21,639 --> 01:56:26,719
thing ever you finally try yourself and

3002
01:56:23,679 --> 01:56:27,719
you're sort of like H is this it oh [ __ ]

3003
01:56:26,719 --> 01:56:29,639
that would have been purple punch

3004
01:56:27,719 --> 01:56:31,920
recently when purple punch first came

3005
01:56:29,639 --> 01:56:34,118
out everybody was hyping the living hell

3006
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:36,199
out of it and then we smoked it and we

3007
01:56:34,118 --> 01:56:39,198
were like

3008
01:56:36,198 --> 01:56:41,158
huh

3009
01:56:39,198 --> 01:56:42,879
what I think that was the most hype

3010
01:56:41,158 --> 01:56:47,598
strain I've seen in a minute that just

3011
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:48,560
really gorgeous top 10 visual who won

3012
01:56:47,599 --> 01:56:51,400
the

3013
01:56:48,560 --> 01:56:53,159
flavor totally that's that's one of the

3014
01:56:51,399 --> 01:56:55,719
top contenders with we do here on the

3015
01:56:53,158 --> 01:56:57,519
show you know so there you go next one

3016
01:56:55,719 --> 01:56:59,560
is I'm going to drop you off on a desert

3017
01:56:57,520 --> 01:57:02,639
island you got infinite resources and

3018
01:56:59,560 --> 01:57:04,719
you can take three strains or packs of

3019
01:57:02,639 --> 01:57:07,560
seeds with you what three things are you

3020
01:57:04,719 --> 01:57:10,078
going to take oh damn I'd have to take

3021
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:12,239
I'd have to take uh three packs of seeds

3022
01:57:10,078 --> 01:57:14,519
because if I'm on a desert island I

3023
01:57:12,238 --> 01:57:17,118
probably don't have a nursery and so I

3024
01:57:14,520 --> 01:57:20,199
would I would want to work with um

3025
01:57:17,118 --> 01:57:23,279
something in that lap PK range because I

3026
01:57:20,198 --> 01:57:25,799
I I need that type of profile

3027
01:57:23,279 --> 01:57:27,559
I would love to have something that was

3028
01:57:25,800 --> 01:57:31,199
in

3029
01:57:27,560 --> 01:57:34,239
the the the Mexican groups like that

3030
01:57:31,198 --> 01:57:37,158
zakat takus or the aapo just because the

3031
01:57:34,238 --> 01:57:40,439
high is um just so interesting and the

3032
01:57:37,158 --> 01:57:41,479
flavor is so rich and I love uh like a

3033
01:57:40,439 --> 01:57:44,598
killer

3034
01:57:41,479 --> 01:57:46,919
tie I love that that super cerebral high

3035
01:57:44,599 --> 01:57:49,000
and that that really back in the day man

3036
01:57:46,920 --> 01:57:51,679
taies change flavor but like for me all

3037
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:53,719
the tie we consumed you know in the 80s

3038
01:57:51,679 --> 01:57:55,679
when people chocolate tie I it's color

3039
01:57:53,719 --> 01:57:58,039
or not but like the flavor was sure

3040
01:57:55,679 --> 01:58:01,960
chocolatey I mean it was amazing and the

3041
01:57:58,039 --> 01:58:03,880
high was absolutely riveting so I would

3042
01:58:01,960 --> 01:58:06,239
do that I'd go like a a good Mexican

3043
01:58:03,880 --> 01:58:07,639
collection something out of Asia Thai

3044
01:58:06,238 --> 01:58:10,559
Flavor I think Thai flavors are better

3045
01:58:07,639 --> 01:58:12,960
than La I think the cambodians the

3046
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:16,280
Vietnamese are a little stronger but I

3047
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:19,679
think the ti is more balanced and then

3048
01:58:16,279 --> 01:58:23,559
the the a self lpk but I want a self I

3049
01:58:19,679 --> 01:58:25,279
would need to have m female populations

3050
01:58:23,560 --> 01:58:27,719
all three so that I could play with it

3051
01:58:25,279 --> 01:58:29,639
for a while so I didn't feel like um if

3052
01:58:27,719 --> 01:58:32,319
anything happened I'd be

3053
01:58:29,639 --> 01:58:34,880
screwed I like that really balanced it's

3054
01:58:32,319 --> 01:58:37,599
a good little spread there so similar

3055
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:39,960
but different question I'm forcing you

3056
01:58:37,599 --> 01:58:43,319
to start a seed company tomorrow and you

3057
01:58:39,960 --> 01:58:46,599
can only start it with one pack of seeds

3058
01:58:43,319 --> 01:58:46,599
what pack of seeds would you

3059
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:54,199
use oo that's a good

3060
01:58:50,560 --> 01:58:56,840
question for me myself or for the public

3061
01:58:54,198 --> 01:58:59,759
for yourself and for the public like as

3062
01:58:56,840 --> 01:59:02,400
in you can give two answers one for each

3063
01:58:59,760 --> 01:59:04,320
yeah I guess if I I mean because I'm so

3064
01:59:02,399 --> 01:59:06,078
obsessed with that red Leb puck right

3065
01:59:04,319 --> 01:59:07,639
now it have to be that because that's

3066
01:59:06,078 --> 01:59:09,399
what I did is I took those seeds and I

3067
01:59:07,639 --> 01:59:13,359
chased it down and I'm throwing out you

3068
01:59:09,399 --> 01:59:16,799
know lines for public sale so that would

3069
01:59:13,359 --> 01:59:22,158
be for me for the general

3070
01:59:16,800 --> 01:59:24,400
public I would say gas is returning

3071
01:59:22,158 --> 01:59:27,198
so you know you're seeing like the the

3072
01:59:24,399 --> 01:59:29,839
hunger come back and I would go

3073
01:59:27,198 --> 01:59:32,799
into something from like like I would

3074
01:59:29,840 --> 01:59:36,800
say you know Gabe Ruth's work is pretty

3075
01:59:32,800 --> 01:59:39,840
good Josh from um regen has got some

3076
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:43,000
good work risen's got some good

3077
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:44,840
work Tyler family trees's got some good

3078
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:46,880
good fuel work where he does some dog

3079
01:59:44,840 --> 01:59:48,960
walker sfvs that are just

3080
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:50,560
ferocious I'd say if you went into any

3081
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:52,520
of those groups right there you know

3082
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:54,000
there's always Jean is Jean always got

3083
01:59:52,520 --> 01:59:55,520
some really killer [ __ ] but there's some

3084
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:59,439
guys that have some really nice work

3085
01:59:55,520 --> 02:00:01,040
that AR is known and I think their their

3086
01:59:59,439 --> 02:00:02,359
uh direction is good and because it's

3087
02:00:01,039 --> 02:00:04,319
Fuel and these guys have been doing a

3088
02:00:02,359 --> 02:00:06,559
lot of fuel-based work for a while I

3089
02:00:04,319 --> 02:00:09,198
think there stuff's really

3090
02:00:06,560 --> 02:00:11,560
interesting yeah great answer you know

3091
02:00:09,198 --> 02:00:13,158
Jean stuff is incredible and all those

3092
02:00:11,560 --> 02:00:15,119
dudes you mentioned I'm I'm familiar

3093
02:00:13,158 --> 02:00:17,319
with them you know shout out to Josh and

3094
02:00:15,118 --> 02:00:19,920
um you know all the stuff there is

3095
02:00:17,319 --> 02:00:22,519
awesome so that's cool to hear final

3096
02:00:19,920 --> 02:00:24,639
question for this one is I've got a time

3097
02:00:22,520 --> 02:00:26,599
machine for you you can go back anywhere

3098
02:00:24,639 --> 02:00:28,359
any point in time presumably to collect

3099
02:00:26,599 --> 02:00:30,199
some genetics could be seeds could be

3100
02:00:28,359 --> 02:00:32,719
cuting could be whatever where are you

3101
02:00:30,198 --> 02:00:37,238
gonna go and what are you g to

3102
02:00:32,719 --> 02:00:40,239
get wow that's a good question

3103
02:00:37,238 --> 02:00:41,718
I I think I would go all the way and

3104
02:00:40,238 --> 02:00:44,359
it's funny because it would it would be

3105
02:00:41,719 --> 02:00:46,960
the least commercially

3106
02:00:44,359 --> 02:00:48,759
valuable because until you see feral

3107
02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:50,800
populations you just realize there's

3108
02:00:48,760 --> 02:00:54,719
very little on them but I would like to

3109
02:00:50,800 --> 02:00:56,599
go back to where we map cannabis merge

3110
02:00:54,719 --> 02:00:58,560
with humans which would be Nepal like

3111
02:00:56,599 --> 02:01:02,159
you know Plains of the

3112
02:00:58,560 --> 02:01:05,239
Himalayas um you know 14,000 years ago I

3113
02:01:02,158 --> 02:01:08,359
would I would like to see the plants

3114
02:01:05,238 --> 02:01:11,319
from then I would like to see the plant

3115
02:01:08,359 --> 02:01:13,719
that really drove people's Obsession to

3116
02:01:11,319 --> 02:01:15,118
move it so heavily on the silk route and

3117
02:01:13,719 --> 02:01:17,118
down into these

3118
02:01:15,118 --> 02:01:18,960
regions that's what I'd like to

3119
02:01:17,118 --> 02:01:20,920
experience what what what is it in its

3120
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:25,439
unadulterated

3121
02:01:20,920 --> 02:01:27,520
form the true P1 right there yeah I want

3122
02:01:25,439 --> 02:01:29,279
to know what and I mean we we know that

3123
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:31,719
cannabis is a million years old but we

3124
02:01:29,279 --> 02:01:34,399
can only go back 14,000 with any kind of

3125
02:01:31,719 --> 02:01:36,639
recorded history but that'd be enough if

3126
02:01:34,399 --> 02:01:39,399
I could go back 14,000 years and and

3127
02:01:36,639 --> 02:01:41,599
experience the planes of Mongolia and

3128
02:01:39,399 --> 02:01:44,879
get to see how they use the plant and

3129
02:01:41,599 --> 02:01:47,039
eat the seeds and drink the tea and and

3130
02:01:44,880 --> 02:01:49,440
then throw bales of it in the fire in

3131
02:01:47,039 --> 02:01:50,279
the cave and have rituals and [ __ ]

3132
02:01:49,439 --> 02:01:51,319
because you know that's what they were

3133
02:01:50,279 --> 02:01:53,439
doing they weren't smoking that [ __ ]

3134
02:01:51,319 --> 02:01:57,039
they were using it as firewood but they

3135
02:01:53,439 --> 02:01:59,238
would get ripped so that's what I love

3136
02:01:57,039 --> 02:02:01,039
to experience I think because otherwise

3137
02:01:59,238 --> 02:02:02,238
I'm really been happy I've been able to

3138
02:02:01,039 --> 02:02:06,800
touch and

3139
02:02:02,238 --> 02:02:08,399
smoke and see and experience so much

3140
02:02:06,800 --> 02:02:11,480
that it would it would just be awesome

3141
02:02:08,399 --> 02:02:13,879
to go back and and and see our

3142
02:02:11,479 --> 02:02:16,319
Roots that's what Pakistan did for me it

3143
02:02:13,880 --> 02:02:17,760
was this was beautiful I mean I it was

3144
02:02:16,319 --> 02:02:20,078
it was different than any other place

3145
02:02:17,760 --> 02:02:22,960
I'd been to because the people had been

3146
02:02:20,078 --> 02:02:24,799
in the valley you know for 15 100 years

3147
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:29,000
each family was like we've always been

3148
02:02:24,800 --> 02:02:31,119
here you know 15 centuries herb has been

3149
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:33,000
here before us this is what we've always

3150
02:02:31,118 --> 02:02:36,399
done we've always eaten it we've always

3151
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:38,719
drank it we've always smoked it and it

3152
02:02:36,399 --> 02:02:41,920
it just lets you understand the holistic

3153
02:02:38,719 --> 02:02:44,118
complete relationship with a plant that

3154
02:02:41,920 --> 02:02:45,960
I only really knew in skewed form it

3155
02:02:44,118 --> 02:02:47,880
wasn't until I got into medical cannabis

3156
02:02:45,960 --> 02:02:50,279
that I really started to understand

3157
02:02:47,880 --> 02:02:52,440
medical applications then we we get into

3158
02:02:50,279 --> 02:02:55,238
the discovery of CBD

3159
02:02:52,439 --> 02:02:57,799
and you get to really see how many

3160
02:02:55,238 --> 02:02:59,598
applications and then I I get into doing

3161
02:02:57,800 --> 02:03:02,119
all the green juice work so you start to

3162
02:02:59,599 --> 02:03:04,960
see it in its acid form unconverted and

3163
02:03:02,118 --> 02:03:07,399
you're like my gosh if we had mixed

3164
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:09,279
canabo we would have these impacts if we

3165
02:03:07,399 --> 02:03:12,799
had acid form we would have these

3166
02:03:09,279 --> 02:03:15,920
impacts and so my my career just

3167
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:18,079
kept turning the the facet it kept

3168
02:03:15,920 --> 02:03:21,880
turning the stone so I get to see more

3169
02:03:18,078 --> 02:03:23,559
and more facets and I got to see so much

3170
02:03:21,880 --> 02:03:26,800
that I'm just grateful that I got to see

3171
02:03:23,560 --> 02:03:30,599
it it's just been this NeverEnding

3172
02:03:26,800 --> 02:03:33,199
turning of a stone that's Unlimited in

3173
02:03:30,599 --> 02:03:35,319
depth no matter how far I go the deeper

3174
02:03:33,198 --> 02:03:38,559
I dive the clo the farther from the

3175
02:03:35,319 --> 02:03:40,840
bottom I find myself that's beautiful

3176
02:03:38,560 --> 02:03:44,559
you know a student of Life by the sounds

3177

3178
02:03:44,559 --> 02:03:48,719
