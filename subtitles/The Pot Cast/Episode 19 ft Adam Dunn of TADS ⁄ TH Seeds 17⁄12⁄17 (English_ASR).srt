oh that's a good one actually um so

46
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,719
let's see i

47
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:44,159
got to try to piece together the actual

48
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:48,640
years

49
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,640
i was in fourth grade

50
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:53,039
in california i used to go to a school

51
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,960
called wonderland elementary like

52
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,320
famous wonderland murders all happening

53
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,718
around there uh

54
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:59,599
very rich area my mom was going out with

55
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:01,599
uh

56
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:03,199
robert downey senior actually at the

57
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:06,399
time right so

58
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,080
uh his sister robert downey jr sister is

59
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,719
named alison and she was like

60
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,640
basically my babysitter at the time and

61
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:13,199
she was a terrible babysitter and she

62
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:15,919
had no

63
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:17,598
no feel for it and her thing was to just

64
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:18,799
she thought it'd be fun to get me really

65
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:21,839
blazed

66
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,879
and you know i kind of i grew up around

67
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,878
weed a lot so i

68
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:26,079
wasn't like unfamiliar but at the same

69
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:29,679
time i kind of never

70
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,319
ventured into that world and uh

71
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,400
so she basically was smoking a joint and

72
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:37,039
kind of like passing it to me

73
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,879
and i remember not thinking anything

74
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:42,560
happened at all like i was just like

75
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:44,079
yeah nothing happened right and

76
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,598
but then like about three or four days

77
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,840
later

78
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:49,199
when we were talking about it i always

79
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,560
told her i said yeah i didn't feel

80
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:52,079
anything it didn't it was she's like

81
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,120
what did you think and i was like

82
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,599
i don't know i didn't really feel

83
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,519
anything and she was like you didn't if

84
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:58,479
you saw yourself i remember telling her

85
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,560
telling me

86
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:01,679
like how high i was you know because i

87
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,000
was like

88
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,719
super hyperactive and running around

89
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,639
crazy

90
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,318
on it but not crazy crazy obviously but

91
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:09,919
like so it is kind of interesting

92
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:11,359
because now as an adult

93
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:12,799
you know a lot of people get really like

94
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,519
mellowed out when they smoke but i've

95
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,840
always

96
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,519
had that thing where i kind of got more

97
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,920
hyped up from it in a sense you know so

98
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,280
i

99
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:21,039
kind of felt like it was in my chemistry

100
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,039
or something but yeah so it was so it

101
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:25,199
was basically robert downey jr sister

102
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:26,079
which makes it kind of ironic these days

103
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,280
because

104
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,879
you know if you want to go on sort of

105
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,080
drug royalty right yeah wow what an epic

106
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,399
story

107
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,000
yeah so uh yeah it was a so it was kind

108
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,840
of a wacky one and then you know later

109
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,519
on like when i was about 13 i really

110
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,200
uh it was funny between when i was 13 i

111
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,360
quit smoking weed

112
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:49,359
for about two years because i was

113
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,840
totally into the military i thought i

114
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,760
was gonna

115
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,799
go into like i was in civil air patrol

116
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:53,598
and i was planning on going in the

117
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,239
military so

118
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:57,280
between 11 and 13 i kind of like had a

119
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,200
little

120
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,640
like a sash there basically for a few

121
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,079
years because then after i smoked with

122
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:03,279
her i kind of would smoke every

123
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,439
you know she'd give me hits here and

124
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,120
there and then i started to kind of

125
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:08,959
get her get into it a little bit but

126
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,719
then i i kind of had a twist at around

127
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,759
13. i was like nope that's it i'm

128
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:13,359
quitting

129
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:14,798
like i went through a quitting field by

130
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,400
the time i was 13 i was already quitting

131
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,840
it was kind of funny

132
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,839
and then i and then i started up again

133
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,638
when i was about 15 so there was like a

134
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,319
two year

135
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,000
two year period there where i didn't

136
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:25,680
smoke

137
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,959
yeah okay so there's a few questions

138
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,439
that i'd love to ask i mean the first

139
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:28,799
one

140
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,560
you kind of touched on it do you think

141
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,000
there is any truth behind

142
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,519
that whole idea of like people not

143
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,639
getting high on their first time like do

144
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:36,639
you think it's just a case of not

145
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,720
knowing how to inhale properly or

146
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,400
not i think it's just not recognizing is

147
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,919
the key i mean i think that's the

148
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:43,758
you know because what i always tell

149
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:45,039
people is you know when they like

150
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,160
especially people who've never smoked

151
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,040
weed before and they have this sort of

152
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,720
pre-disposition to it like they're like

153
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,280
a preconception where they're like oh

154
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,800
it's

155
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:53,839
you know it's going to make you lazy or

156
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,478
it's going to make you hungry it's going

157
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:58,638
to make you this

158
00:04:54,478 --> 00:05:01,199
that and then if you uh

159
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,600
don't know what to expect actually

160
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,759
cannabis is very mild as we know

161
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,759
you know what i mean it's mild and yet

162
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,439
intense and powerful in its own way too

163
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,080
but the first couple times you do it

164
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,279
so it's you're expecting fireworks you

165
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,478
know it's not like an acid trip or

166
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:17,599
something like that where

167
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:19,038
you know okay if you don't you know if

168
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,400
somebody takes acid and they say i

169
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:21,680
didn't feel anything

170
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:22,879
then they have a completely different

171
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,720
chemistry let's say you know what i mean

172
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:25,439
but with weed because it's such a subtle

173
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,199
thing

174
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:28,399
you're kind of like ah you know maybe

175
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,000
you just didn't notice it and then the

176
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:30,959
second or third time you do it you

177
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
really

178
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:35,680
tune in on it it seems like you know and

179
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,120
and a lot of times i think it's your

180
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,959
what people see

181
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,399
in you and what you like you know how it

182
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:41,599
is when you think no one knows you're

183
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:43,120
high kind of thing

184
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,879
and then the minute somebody sees your

185
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,000
eyes are really red oh what are you high

186
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:48,800
and then that kind of like

187
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,519
triggers it where now you feel high

188
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,400
because someone

189
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,680
noticed that your eye so i think that's

190
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:55,198
probably the reason

191
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,199
yeah interesting i think i think there

192
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,439
could be some good truth in that one

193
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,038
if we just fast forward a moment to when

194
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:04,079
you first started growing

195
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:07,599
what was the situation like there

196
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:11,439
so um well basically when i lived in uh

197
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,520
rhode island when i was about uh 16

198
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:14,879
i had i bought a phototron actually so

199
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:17,599
i'm one of those guys

200
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:18,240
and i bought two phototrons out of high

201
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,039
times

202
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,120
and i was living with my mom i was

203
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:25,599
living with my mom at the time and

204
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,319
single mom we had a house in jamestown

205
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,720
rhode island

206
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,319
and i basically built a little room in

207
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,680
my basement and i remember like

208
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,000
kind of like built this room in the

209
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,079
corner and

210
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
i had zero carpentry skills at the time

211
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:39,599
so i kind of just slapped up some really

212
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,600
makeshift little thing and then i put

213
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,800
these two phototrons in there

214
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:47,360
and followed the instructions and

215
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,960
realized that it was way too small for

216
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,720
what i was trying to do like i put six

217
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:53,598
plants in that tiny little thing

218
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,599
and then cut them out and i remember i

219
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:56,879
had some hawaiian seeds at my mom from

220
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:58,639
some weed that my mom's

221
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:01,038
and her friends were smoking at the time

222
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:04,478
i had some like thai seeds

223
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:07,120
and i had some

224
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:08,240
some other random something mexican or

225
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,598
something and it was just like

226
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,199
so there's some of them are just

227
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:12,319
ridiculous they took up they grew so

228
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,439
fast

229
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,280
and i remember they were if you're not

230
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:19,680
familiar with the phototron that the

231
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:22,399
medium that they use is sphagnum moss

232
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,000
so it's very wet and there's no drainage

233
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:26,159
at the bottom of those units

234
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,720
so literally when you turn on like six

235
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,160
fluorescent lights in a little tiny box

236
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,560
and then you put a bunch of water at the

237
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,800
bottom it it ends up

238
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,560
turning into like a vapor trap and so

239
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,000
the whole thing was just dripping down

240
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,639
the sides and

241
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,680
and so i remember uh this is kind of

242
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,840
funny too

243
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,800
i woke up in the morning with my mom

244
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:48,239
waking me up

245
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,680
and she's like adam adam your plants are

246
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,400
on fire right and i was like

247
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,240
in a half asleep and i was like huh like

248
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:55,839
just like what plants on fire and then

249
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,519
it was like it hit me like oh my god my

250
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:58,239
plants are on fire and i ran out of the

251
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,680
house

252
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,560
and ran downstairs and they were just

253
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,759
like a melted blob of plastic

254
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,598
because they uh the dripping of the

255
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,879
water going down the sides and ended up

256
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:11,759
into the bottom of the where the sockets

257
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,240
basically were

258
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,598
and shorted them out and ended up like

259
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,800
literally almost burning you know could

260
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:18,159
have burned my whole place down

261
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,079
so i was like my first attempt to

262
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:24,160
growing was a complete and utter failure

263
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:24,959
and the phototron still to this day i

264
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,960
mean they've sold

265
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:30,478
so many of those units and it's like

266
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:31,758
i i was probably one of their first

267
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:33,439
victims you know what i mean like i was

268
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,440
like i was that that that kid who

269
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,839
ordered this thing online or not anyone

270
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,560
online

271
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,719
ordered it in the magazine and uh you

272
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:43,119
know when i got the box i was like

273
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,320
can't be the unit this box is way too

274
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,560
small you know what i mean

275
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,640
it was like i guess i guess it is and

276
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:51,838
then i put it all together and it was

277
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:53,600
smaller than i thought and it was less

278
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,279
robust than i thought you know but in

279
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,200
the end uh

280
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:58,559
it did get my fever sort of going and

281
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,800
the cool part was i put that little

282
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:03,039
i put that little room together and then

283
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:04,399
i realized uh

284
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:06,480
that that was the way to grow i put a

285
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,159
light in the room and actually grow

286
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,519
in the whole room you know and so that

287
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:12,639
was kind of like the

288
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:15,200
the beginning of the fever for me

289
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:17,919
okay i think that was in 1980 that was

290
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,480
in 1985.

291
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:22,399
oh wow it's kind of interesting the

292
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,000
whole phototron thing it's almost like

293
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,399
people look back on it with almost like

294
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,519
this uh positive reminiscent view where

295
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,759
they're kind of like oh yeah the

296
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,839
phototron i got done by that too

297
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:33,600
right well that guy julian d demarco the

298
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,519
guy who owned that company

299
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,120
he i talked to him many times because

300
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,159
when i first ordered that phototron i

301
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,720
think i was probably

302
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:42,240
wave maybe two or three because i i mean

303
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,120
i'm sure it's been a few years out but

304
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,399
it hadn't

305
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,560
it was still the original hand drawing

306
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,480
of it it was like there was no photos

307
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:52,159
and it was like the way that the photo

308
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,320
of it looked it looked like

309
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:55,919
like so much more action was going on

310
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,760
and then when you actually got it

311
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:59,278
and you turned it on you're like wait a

312
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,240
minute there's no air moving through

313
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:01,919
this thing and

314
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,278
there were so many things that needed to

315
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:04,319
be addressed you know what i mean but at

316
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:07,439
the end

317
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,560
it the one thing i can say is that it

318
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,480
did at least

319
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:11,838
get me excited you know what i mean i

320
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,440
think the only thing he taught me was

321
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,959
probably internodes because that was his

322
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,079
whole thing his whole thing was about

323
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:20,479
internodes like literally he was

324
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:21,599
focused so much on that like internal

325
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,519
length and then

326
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,278
how many internodes and and it was like

327
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,959
okay but there's more to a plant than

328
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:28,639
internet

329
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:30,239
and uh yeah it was a it was an

330
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:32,000
interesting time uh

331
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,000
also that the two phototrons that i had

332
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,679
one was mine one was my friends

333
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,519
and i think i'm not sure which one

334
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:39,599
actually melted but it basically they

335
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:42,959
melted together into a big blob

336
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,879
and so we ended up uh

337
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,159
getting two more replacements and we

338
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:47,278
didn't want them i told them i just want

339
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:48,399
my money back

340
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:49,759
but he ended up sending me two

341
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,679
replacements which i ended up training

342
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:53,200
for a snowboard at the time

343
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:54,719
so it was like one of those like you

344
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,079
know those classic moments i don't know

345
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,040
whatever happened to those other units

346
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:00,000
so

347
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:01,759
yeah cool so one of the most asked

348
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,360
questions i've received to you know

349
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,039
shoot your way is essentially

350
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,800
what's the backstory on the bubble gum

351
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,719
how did you get it you know in this

352
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:11,278
context how do we go from that first

353
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,120
grow to you having the bubble gum

354
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:15,600
okay so uh when i lived in amsterdam in

355
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,959
89

356
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:22,320
90 um i had a friend

357
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:24,559
uh who came through

358
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,160
uh and basically i was working at the

359
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,479
hash museum at the time i just started

360
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:29,360
working at passionism in 1990 i guess it

361
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,240
was

362
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,680
and so i'm standing there one day and

363
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,480
this guy walks in

364
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:37,439
and i grew up a little bit in rhode

365
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,560
island when i was that's where the

366
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,760
photon thing went down when my

367
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:40,639
grandmother was it's kind of where my

368
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:43,120
grandmother's from

369
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:43,838
so i from new york originally but then

370
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,839
later on

371
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,040
when i was living with my grandmother i

372
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,480
i kind of

373
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,639
got a lot of friends around there and i

374
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,680
kind of forced my mom to to move there

375
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,399
at that time

376
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:56,000
and uh so i was very familiar with that

377
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,839
rhode island accent and that rhode

378
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,759
island sort of mentality

379
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,200
and this guy walks in and he's like i'm

380
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:02,319
like where are you from and he's like

381
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,079
i'm from rhode island

382
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,680
you know and i'm like oh right i'm from

383
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:07,199
rhode island too and something about

384
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:10,638
rhode island which is like

385
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,639
it was it was like a i don't know

386
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,000
i always think of it as a place to get

387
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,440
in trouble you know what i mean like

388
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,559
it's just because i grew up there so it

389
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,040
was like it was always like that was

390
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:19,838
like

391
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:20,639
the worst place to to for weed like i

392
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,079
always had this

393
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,240
and so i was like oh you're from rhode

394
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:25,439
island and i kind of just

395
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,120
i don't know it was weird like i felt

396
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,399
like i had to protect him from getting

397
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,039
in trouble or something and i was like

398
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,000
yeah

399
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,199
he's like what are you doing here he's

400
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,639
like yeah he came here to learn how to

401
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,360
grow weed and i'm like oh wow that's

402
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,879
cool i

403
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,600
gotta i'm just trying to put together a

404
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,559
grow and he was a contractor from rhode

405
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,720
island so

406
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:42,399
he's really good with building and and

407
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,680
we basically took this apartment

408
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,078
he came over to my apartment i let him

409
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:48,319
stay there with me and

410
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:49,519
we built this grow room together and i

411
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,120
just designed it

412
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,799
and basically all i had to do was make

413
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,000
coffee and he would build it for me like

414
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:55,278
i'd literally he would he was one of

415
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,320
those guys who was

416
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:59,679
kind of uh like difficult to work with

417
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,879
because he wouldn't let you do anything

418
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:02,319
you know like he'd be like all right

419
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:03,360
give me that except for like maybe hand

420
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,959
me a tool or

421
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,959
do this or do that but for the most part

422
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:08,399
it was like i remember i would leave i

423
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,919
just like leave him with a bunch of

424
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,639
materials in the room and i'd go and

425
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:13,679
make coffees and come back and he'd be

426
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,839
like

427
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:17,199
lifting up a thing by by himself and you

428
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,880
know just kind of one of those dudes

429
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,839
all around kind of construction kind of

430
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:20,399
guys but he didn't really know much

431
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,920
about

432
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:26,958
growing wheat so he brought

433
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:28,719
seeds from rhode island with him and it

434
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,838
was actually called chewing gum

435
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,560
it wasn't called bubble gum it was

436
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,720
called chewing gum and it was because

437
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:36,719
so he was getting these c he basically

438
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,278
he was getting weed off of a guy

439
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,839
who was from illinois and the guy and

440
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:41,120
the fun

441
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,680
the funny part about that whole story

442
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,959
was over the years like i had always

443
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,439
thought he said indiana

444
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,000
right so i was so i put the word out

445
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,839
like

446
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,198
that i got these from indiana from a guy

447
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,880
from indiana

448
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:54,479
and then later when this whole indiana

449
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:56,480
bubblegum thing came out

450
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,240
it's a little bit of a so for me it's a

451
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,199
little bit of a mystery because

452
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,360
i know i met guys from indiana who had a

453
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:06,078
variety called bubble gum

454
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,759
when i called it bubble gum it was only

455
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:09,359
we changed the name from chewing gum to

456
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:11,600
bubble gum because we didn't

457
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,879
think like it just didn't have a good

458
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,000
sound to it it's like chewing gum is

459
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:14,480
something that ends up in the bottom of

460
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,440
your

461
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,159
shoe bubble gum is this is what you put

462
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,399
in your mouth

463
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:21,198
you know what i mean so like chewing gum

464
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,399
is just kind of

465
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:24,159
because the reason he called it chewing

466
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,120
gum was the fact that he would he had a

467
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:26,639
bar

468
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,480
called the church house in providence

469
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,720
and he would stick a bud

470
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,079
underneath the bar and literally just

471
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,278
see what people's reactions would be

472
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:34,159
because he'd be standing there and then

473
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:35,679
people come and go

474
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:37,198
what's up dude you smell that and he'd

475
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:38,159
be like no i don't know what you're

476
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:39,519
talking about

477
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:40,799
and then he'd kind of feel him out you

478
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,839
know what i mean if he thought they were

479
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:44,639
cool he would

480
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,800
hook him up and it was just literally

481
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:50,320
like his little trick that he played

482
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:51,439
and when i so he had 135 seeds that he

483
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,120
had collected over

484
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,040
a couple year period and basically this

485
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,120
guy that was selling him the weed

486
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:59,039
occasionally he would have seeds so you

487
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,198
either gotta

488
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:02,639
i think it's either a herme or something

489
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:04,799
but basically the guy was also

490
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,320
super like protective of those seeds

491
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:08,078
like if you got one he'd give you 10

492
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,760
bucks back on the next like if you

493
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:11,278
brought him like five seeds from your

494
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:12,639
bud you'd give your 50 bucks off your

495
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:14,000
next ounce you know i mean he was that

496
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,959
protected he's like just bring him back

497
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,360
i need them all

498
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:18,000
and so my friend was like no victor was

499
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,600
like

500
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,120
nah i never gave him anything back i

501
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,278
always kept him so

502
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,799
he came over brought those seeds and him

503
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:26,799
and i basically we didn't grow those

504
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,399
seeds for a good year like we

505
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:30,479
we were growing everything else like i

506
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,399
worked for scentsy at the time so i was

507
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,000
bringing home seeds from scentsy and i

508
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,360
was trying clones and i figured i'm in

509
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,159
amsterdam this is the land of plenty

510
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,240
what can i what could

511
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:40,480
you know can't bring sand to the beach

512
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,839
right so

513
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,920
so then i uh after a year when

514
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,600
like at one point victor was working on

515
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,559
another room and he was for somebody

516
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,800
else and he

517
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:54,638
uh was biting down on a pvc on like a

518
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:56,479
irrigation line like he's trying to pull

519
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,240
one out with his teeth basically

520
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,759
and he broke a tooth and he didn't we

521
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,198
have no insurance because

522
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,120
we're americans living in holland and

523
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:04,319
he's victor's about 10 years older than

524
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,278
me so i guess at the time he was

525
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,320
probably about

526
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:11,600
40 and or maybe a little younger 30s

527
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,440
late 30s or whatever and uh so he

528
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,920
basically had no health insurance

529
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,600
and but he was like but he did back home

530
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:19,120
so he flew back home

531
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,040
to take care of his teeth and while he

532
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:25,120
was gone i'd sprouted

533
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:27,039
a bunch of seeds so i sprouted

534
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,120
the most of them i think in the

535
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:31,439
beginning we had 135 seeds and i

536
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,799
i selected out of about it was around 60

537
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,720
65 in the beginning

538
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:36,958
i went through and i had narrowed those

539
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,079
65 down to seven

540
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:43,119
and the seven were classified by

541
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:46,239
size um so basically a

542
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:50,078
being the smallest and uh

543
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:53,198
so a b c d e f g up to g let's say

544
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:54,319
and um i also had a male selected at the

545
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:58,159
time too

546
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,759
and only on my second round so i took

547
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:01,120
that i did it i crossed

548
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,000
i did some inbreeding on that first

549
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,679
generation so i made some seed

550
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,798
uh but unfortunately then my room got

551
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,720
broken into

552
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:15,199
um all my mother plants got killed

553
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,798
uh and stole and my clones got stolen my

554
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,318
clones got stolen my plant my other

555
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:20,798
plants got killed

556
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:22,240
and they literally took the door and

557
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:25,199
pulled it right off the hinges like

558
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,880
they lifted the door off the hinges and

559
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,480
uh

560
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,880
just so my door was just standing there

561
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,880
next to my place nothing in my house was

562
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,240
gone or met like taken just literally

563
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,400
like they went in

564
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,839
went straight to my room they took my

565
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,960
light bulbs it was really weird took my

566
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:42,079
light bulbs

567
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,400
and took my [ __ ] ph

568
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:45,199
meter so i was like my ph meter my light

569
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,440
bulbs

570
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,279
my clones and my mother plants and my

571
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,320
mother plants were cut

572
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:54,000
and the clones were gone and so and the

573
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:55,359
clone and the mother plants were cut and

574
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,079
taken like they put them in a bag and

575
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:58,479
took them

576
00:17:56,079 --> 00:18:00,240
so crazy part was at the end of all of

577
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,880
that i went through everything and i

578
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,798
found

579
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:07,919
so the uh the

580
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:10,240
c so uh the middle right

581
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,360
in the middle the number three or c

582
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,160
depending on how you

583
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:16,000
remember i classified them but uh the

584
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,759
middle so it was like not the smallest

585
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,200
plant not the biggest plant

586
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:20,319
somewhere in between so in a way they

587
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,200
kind of like at least out of all the

588
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:23,439
things they did because

589
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,279
actually this the biggest plant wasn't

590
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,120
as potent as the

591
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:29,359
smallest like it literally was like the

592
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:32,000
smaller ones seemed to be more potent

593
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:33,519
um and so i narrowed it down to just

594
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,558
that one plant and then i got really

595
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:35,918
paranoid

596
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:37,918
as you would be if somebody just stole

597
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:41,038
all your [ __ ] and all your work

598
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:43,600
and so then i took the the

599
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:45,038
that bubble gum and i gave a clone of

600
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:45,918
that so basically i re-vegged the plant

601
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:48,240
because it was like

602
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,679
the lowest branch it was not cut and it

603
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,599
was cut but it was just like

604
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,600
there was still a little nub left so

605
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:57,359
then i re-veg that plant

606
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:57,918
uh gave a cut to tony from soccer mother

607
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:00,319
seeds

608
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,679
and i gave a cut to simon from serious

609
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:03,918
seeds because we all worked together at

610
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,880
the time that's at scentsy

611
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,640
and so if you look at the so if you look

612
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,000
back in the kind of history of all these

613
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:15,038
these people the bubble berry from tony

614
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,640
was the direct first round from what i

615
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:17,359
gave him that bubble gum and then if you

616
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,280
look at

617
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:20,959
simon from serious seeds he has which

618
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:21,839
are kind of like to me was a little bit

619
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,440
of a

620
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:25,359
this was a little bit of a confusion for

621
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,640
everybody was that and then simon

622
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:31,119
continued selling bubble gum seeds but

623
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,038
his were sativa dominant and mine were

624
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:35,839
more indica dominant and there's a

625
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:36,640
there's been a few like back to back

626
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:38,079
grows that

627
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,520
people have done like there's a german

628
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:41,038
magazine i think they did one one time

629
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:44,480
and you can really see

630
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:47,279
pretty obviously that we're we have some

631
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,880
shared genetics in there but definitely

632
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:50,480
different directions you know

633
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,480
so like one goes in one direction one

634
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,960
goes in the direction um

635
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,839
but but that whole thing was like a

636
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,160
complete

637
00:19:55,839 --> 00:20:00,240
kind of it was like the introduction to

638
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,759
me to the whole industry and it really

639
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,960
showed me like how

640
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:04,720
when you have something because i

641
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,440
basically what the problem i had was i

642
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,960
wasn't

643
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,640
sharing it with anybody because i was a

644
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,759
little bit nervous about that in the

645
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,559
very beginning because i worked for

646
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:12,960
scentsy

647
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:15,359
and i saw how things can go wrong you

648
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,279
know in the in the cannabis world

649
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:18,479
and so when i figured out i had

650
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,519
something that was special because

651
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,599
everybody was like

652
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:23,038
this bubblegum man this is this is

653
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:24,399
different you know and really to me it

654
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:25,359
wasn't that different it was actually

655
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,038
like

656
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:28,399
real good american weed because it had

657
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:31,599
that real thick

658
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,360
deep kind of uh deep

659
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:34,719
lingering afghan kind of quality

660
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:36,240
compared to

661
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,159
a lot of the fruity stuff that they had

662
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,079
in europe in holland

663
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,440
and so to me it was just like yeah this

664
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:43,439
just smells like america you know i mean

665
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,080
i'm just smelling good old american weed

666
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,960
strong and then uh but it was so unique

667
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:49,359
to the dutch

668
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,319
market and then that's kind of obviously

669
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:52,719
where

670
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:53,519
uh you know turned people against me in

671
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,279
the sense of

672
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:56,720
breaking into my place and really showed

673
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:58,240
me like the

674
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,759
the lengths that people will go through

675
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,558
if they can't have it you know and

676
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,679
that's

677
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:03,599
that's kind of what a lot of the

678
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,960
genetics are nowadays is if people can't

679
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:06,798
have it

680
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,720
they'll you know they'll they'll figure

681
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:11,359
out a way

682
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,480
so i think you kind of alluded to it do

683
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:15,199
you think that

684
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,279
that whole break-in was more of like a

685
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,279
very specifically targeted thing as

686
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:22,240
opposed to like a general break-in

687
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:23,759
oh 100 100 it was like you know and

688
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,839
that's the thing is like i was

689
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:26,879
one of the things i've probably over the

690
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:28,879
years that because

691
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,000
out of all the breeders i think i'm one

692
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,200
of the more open books

693
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,279
because i've always had a shop you know

694
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,960
at a retail store

695
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:36,240
at that time i didn't i'd have one but i

696
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,919
was working at a retail store so here i

697
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,798
am working at sensei seeds

698
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,000
you know everybody knows kind of who i

699
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:44,960
am

700
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,480
and at that point in time you know the

701
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,000
thing is that amsterdam has a real

702
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,360
underbelly to it which you don't realize

703
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,319
when you first get there a lot of times

704
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:51,519
people get there and they're like wow

705
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:53,918
this place is beautiful

706
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:54,879
and so quaint and nice and it's like

707
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,720
yeah

708
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:02,159
it's also run by you know gangsters and

709
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,839
people who really are pretty deep in

710
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,000
and you know when when there's a huge

711
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:07,038
market of illegal drugs being sold

712
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,200
then there's always going to be that

713
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:10,879
side going on you know so

714
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,480
and cannabis whether you know people

715
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,360
think it's legal or not is it's

716
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,480
not when you're talking about wholesale

717
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:17,678
and when you're talking about how you

718
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,720
know people

719
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:22,720
uh view it when it comes to like

720
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,759
importing large amounts of hash or weed

721
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,798
or anything so

722
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:27,679
you're definitely dealing with some

723
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:30,720
unsavory characters at that point

724
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:33,200
yeah okay abroad so i'm

725
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,038
sorry so i'm 100 so i'm 100 sure it was

726
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,080
based on the fact that i didn't

727
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:39,599
allow cuts to go out because people were

728
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:42,158
people were asking me you know there was

729
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:44,240
like i'll give you 5 000 for a cut

730
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,440
like no once people offered me that much

731
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,079
money i knew there was a reason you know

732
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,840
i mean it's like

733
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:49,199
no i don't think i want to give this out

734
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:50,720
you know and so

735
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,080
it didn't didn't like i said it didn't

736
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,120
take long you know it took maybe six

737
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:56,480
months before

738
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:57,759
that happened and then what happened for

739
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,519
me which was a bit of a problem is i

740
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:02,558
thought i was going to be smart and not

741
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:04,079
sell seeds and or give out cuts

742
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:05,519
obviously and then that was the way i

743
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:08,798
was going to figure out who

744
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:11,119
stole my stuff but in the meantime simon

745
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:11,759
sold seeds and tony sold bubble berry

746
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:14,079
and

747
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:15,839
you know people started to put on almost

748
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:17,199
any menu you went into in amsterdam

749
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:18,798
somebody would have bubble gum on the

750
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,679
menu and i'd go and check it out and be

751
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:21,519
like that is not

752
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,798
that's not it you know what i mean so it

753
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:24,798
was one of those first

754
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:26,158
indicators of how the name game gets

755
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:27,679
flipped and

756
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,799
if you got something that's popular it's

757
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:33,120
going to get either stolen and or just

758
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:34,079
renamed to your or you know the work

759
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:35,759
that you've done

760
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,359
so and i also find it ironic that the

761
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:38,960
whole indiana bubblegum thing because

762
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:42,240
what was funny was over the years

763
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,840
so in the beginning for over 20 years i

764
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,880
basically said

765
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:49,918
that i that came from indiana then only

766
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,600
like five years ago my my friend who

767
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,278
actually gave me those seeds

768
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:55,439
told me he's like no it wasn't indiana

769
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:57,759
it was illinois and i'm like oh

770
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,440
illinois so i don't know if by me

771
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:02,079
putting up so then when i put out

772
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,120
the so now what's funny is that people

773
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:04,639
will

774
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:06,959
kind of always want to work around you

775
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,559
you know what i mean so when people

776
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,720
talk to me about bubble gum they go oh

777
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:12,960
no no no i got the original

778
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,759
i got the indiana bubble gum and i'm

779
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,440
like

780
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:16,798
okay well that's got nothing to do with

781
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,080
mine actually because when i

782
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:19,839
i've grown the indiana bubblegum and

783
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:21,199
it's very it's a good yielder and

784
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:24,240
everything but it's definitely a

785
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:27,679
completely different animal you know

786
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,919
yeah okay interesting and so a broad

787
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:31,440
characterization we've heard recently in

788
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,520
my opinion is that

789
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,720
the scene kind of started in america in

790
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:36,558
the earliest days

791
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,159
moved to amsterdam during the period in

792
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,678
which we're kind of discussing and then

793
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,200
shifted back to america

794
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,200
would you broadly agree with that and i

795
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,200
mean if so you kind of appear to have

796
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,319
followed the trend as it moved

797
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,558
you know was that something you

798
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:50,480
definitely did um

799
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:53,440
not at all and and that's what's been i

800
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,360
mean yeah this last time yes but not the

801
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,960
obviously i had nothing i had nothing to

802
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:58,639
do with the first wave but definitely

803
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,319
and i can't say i had anything to do

804
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,080
with the second wave but i

805
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:03,519
saw the second wave coming and i

806
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:05,759
basically timed it

807
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:08,400
this one perfect and i felt like for the

808
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:09,759
first time in my life i've actually

809
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,720
ahead of the game you know what i mean

810
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:15,599
but yeah when in i 100 agree

811
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,000
with that idea and the thing is that it

812
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:18,558
wasn't

813
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,200
it wasn't there was no real scene to

814
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:21,599
speak of

815
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,480
except for the underground scene and you

816
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:24,558
know like

817
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,400
people on tour with the dead or whatever

818
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:27,918
they're there in cali there was a scene

819
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,360
because there was

820
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:31,440
you know harvest parties and stuff like

821
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:33,199
that and the first

822
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,200
the cannabis cup was inspired by the

823
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,319
harvest parties in california

824
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,159
so so yes in that sense the when you

825
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:41,119
think of the industry and when you think

826
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,799
of the

827
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:44,319
the cannabis scene i always i always

828
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:46,960
compare it to

829
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:48,720
even though i'm hardly a surfer but i'm

830
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,558
like i always say like i'm i'm literally

831
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,000
like how a surfer is so dedicated

832
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:53,119
they'll fly all around the world just to

833
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,798
catch waves

834
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:57,038
i'm kind of in the same way on a

835
00:25:54,798 --> 00:25:58,400
cannabis wave on a long-term

836
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:01,119
sort of sash you know what i mean like

837
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,960
my idea was like amsterdam was the big

838
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:04,479
waves of the 90s you know what i mean

839
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,120
and now it's like a

840
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,000
puddle compared to america you know

841
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:11,038
america's got

842
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,319
literally gargantuan waves now you know

843
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:15,519
because in the beginning

844
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:16,960
like when i first moved to amsterdam uh

845
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:19,200
you know thing about theirs is a lot of

846
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,960
small gardens maybe 10 lighters

847
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,400
you know are you are you're considered

848
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,200
decent sized gardens

849
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,200
and those are 10 600 watt lights most

850
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,440
people are like four to six lights and

851
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,960
little tiny apartments with very low

852
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:35,278
amperage um and then you

853
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,679
but there was big gardens there that

854
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:39,440
never very hard to do in america

855
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:42,159
and now it's completely reversed you

856
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,000
know like like in holland

857
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,440
you won't find any greenhouses anymore

858
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,839
hardly because most of those are all

859
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,600
being

860
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:49,038
you know checked and it's kind of like

861
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:50,240
now how we're in a totally different

862
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:53,200
world too where

863
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,798
you can google earth anything and count

864
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,319
the plants in people's backyards you

865
00:26:54,798 --> 00:26:58,400
know what i mean like

866
00:26:56,319 --> 00:27:00,158
but the idea of growing gorilla growing

867
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:03,120
is pretty pretty

868
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,400
pretty lost to this day you know i think

869
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:05,599
this is the last year california is

870
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,240
going to be able to get away with what

871
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:09,278
they've been

872
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,880
doing for the last 50 years you know

873
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:12,640
yeah by that you mean having you know a

874
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,159
few extra numbers

875
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,759
well yeah what they're doing now is

876
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,559
they're like uh yesterday on the show i

877
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:19,200
had um

878
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:19,759
kevin jodrey from wonderland nursery and

879
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,720
he was

880
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:24,158
explaining to me how they basically have

881
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,079
been using

882
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,278
uh you know like real-time google earth

883
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:29,439
which is what the police have

884
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:31,599
compared to what we have which is last

885
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,440
year's google earth

886
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:34,959
and they basically have been doing two

887
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,759
week interval

888
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,440
checks so they look at a place they take

889
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:40,000
a photo of everything they basically

890
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,080
scan

891
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,038
everywhere so they scan all the all the

892
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:44,879
farms

893
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:47,200
and then they look at a two week

894
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,360
interval and they can see how much

895
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,399
biomass is basically being grown on each

896
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:51,439
place you know what i mean because they

897
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:53,599
can sit there

898
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,440
they can set the uh the photos to like

899
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:56,639
look just at the foliage that's there

900
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,080
and they can basically see

901
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,759
like sit there and they can count

902
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:00,720
numbers and they can also just because

903
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:04,558
they know

904
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,120
that there's uh almost 9 000 farms

905
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:07,678
illegal

906
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:09,278
like illegal farms in cal in norcal that

907
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,200
are registered

908
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:13,038
with their address you know because at a

909
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,558
certain moment in time

910
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:16,720
everybody goes under the radar you know

911
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:18,240
and they they don't bust you right out

912
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,600
of the gate they wait until it's the

913
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,440
perfect opportunity

914
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:23,519
and so this whole year what they did now

915
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,880
is they just sent out letters i think he

916
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:26,480
said 10 days ago

917
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,559
it basically went like cease and desist

918
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,360
letters so everybody's getting these

919
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:31,440
letters

920
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:33,278
and have to make major decisions so

921
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,200
there's going to be a lot of farms

922
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:36,640
shut down this year and a lot of people

923
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,919
are going to realize that

924
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,360
you can no longer do the you know 2 000

925
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,399
pounds in your backyard it's just not

926
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:44,158
happening

927
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:46,000
so so yeah it's going to be a big shake

928
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,919
up in the cannabis world just because of

929
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,038
mostly because of legalization you know

930
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:52,880
that's just the way it is okay

931
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:54,240
and so if we just jump back to the dutch

932
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,720
scene for a moment quickly

933
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,519
yeah a sentiment i've heard a fair bit

934
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,839
is that

935
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:01,519
even beyond say some of the legal

936
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:03,519
changes which may have you know been a

937
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:05,440
bit of a catalyst for you to leave

938
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:07,359
some people express the idea that

939
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,600
there's almost a bit of a

940
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:10,798
a need for a change in the community

941
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:13,119
because i've heard a lot of people

942
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:14,319
express that it's a bit stagnant over

943
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:15,918
there regardless

944
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:18,079
would you agree with that and i guess

945
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:21,120
the flip side of that idea is that

946
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:24,240
that's not the case in the usa it's the

947
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:25,119
well the thing is that when i when i

948
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,120
lived in holland

949
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:29,038
what i realized was you know our

950
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:31,199
customer base was

951
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:33,119
americans coming to holland to

952
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,038
experience freedom you know that was our

953
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:36,959
that was our literal customer base we

954
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:38,558
did not sell seeds to

955
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,278
dutch people i did not i sold a few

956
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:43,200
seeds to english a few seeds to french a

957
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:46,079
few seeds two italians but no dutch

958
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,038
no hard like zero packs to dutch people

959
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:49,839
and

960
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:51,038
and so the scene there was always

961
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:52,879
foreigners

962
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:54,960
who were coming over here who coming

963
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,320
over to there to to experience freedom

964
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,440
and now

965
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:00,079
america's in that in that zone and the

966
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,600
thing is

967
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:03,759
it's going state by state you know what

968
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:05,519
i mean so what's happening here is like

969
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:06,879
already states like colorado that have

970
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:10,720
been doing this you know

971
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:13,840
started in 2009 legalized in 2012

972
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,200
have now got all that under their belt

973
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:16,879
it's gotten to the point where now

974
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,159
people here have the same exact

975
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,440
sentiment as they do

976
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,760
with what you're saying about in holland

977
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,159
wherever yeah it's kind of dead in the

978
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:24,480
scene

979
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:26,559
it's still here they're still and and

980
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,319
everything has improved as far as like

981
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:30,000
the shops that were just a little hole

982
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:31,359
in the wall i have now

983
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,119
upgraded and the same thing happened in

984
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:34,719
amsterdam like if you go there now

985
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:36,398
the shops are nicer than they've ever

986
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,600
been you know because that's been always

987
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:39,199
a big complaint about holland is like

988
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:41,359
you get there and you're like oh man

989
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,960
this place is so small and inconvenient

990
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:43,759
and there's no air conditioning in the

991
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,200
summer and it's

992
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,879
cold you know there's like there's all

993
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,440
those little things and everybody's so

994
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,880
like back in america we would have this

995
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,440
and now they have a chance to do all

996
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,120
this

997
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,480
and they're not even they're a lot of

998
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:54,959
times dropping the ball even on that

999
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,558
like

1000
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,000
the biggest problem with colorado is

1001
00:30:56,558 --> 00:31:00,240
they don't have a social scene

1002
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,519
you know figured out properly and if you

1003
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,359
look at

1004
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,359
other places that haven't got the rules

1005
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:06,798
yet they have a better social scene

1006
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:08,879
because there's no rules so it's really

1007
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:12,319
like

1008
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:15,519
legalization kind of destroys

1009
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:17,119
that that

1010
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:18,720
sort of exciting side you know and

1011
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:19,759
that's what happened in holland earlier

1012
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,600
because

1013
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:23,679
pollen's never been legal it's always

1014
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:25,199
been tolerated but only the only people

1015
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:28,159
that were really interested in it

1016
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,480
was the uh was the foreigners it was

1017
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,278
like

1018
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,240
the dutch are not involved in their own

1019
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:33,919
scene so like

1020
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,679
that's that's the reason why it's so

1021
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:38,159
dead over there is that

1022
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:40,080
they're not they're not really into it

1023
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,240
you know it's really weird like

1024
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:43,918
as far as they've had this golden goose

1025
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,399
in their hand the whole time and then

1026
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,960
they just

1027
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:48,079
kind of forgot about it and didn't

1028
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,798
didn't uh

1029
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:52,960
didn't act on it properly and now here

1030
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:55,119
is kind of similar but it's more of a

1031
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,558
legal framework where the more legal it

1032
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:58,558
gets and the more

1033
00:31:56,558 --> 00:32:00,639
stiff and difficult you know the problem

1034
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:01,678
with colorado is we're not allowed to

1035
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,240
have

1036
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:06,000
any kind of activities that are cannabis

1037
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,319
related like you can't have an event

1038
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,440
and say come to this cannabis event

1039
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:11,278
because the minute you do that you're

1040
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,360
under the scrutiny of

1041
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:14,960
the the man and then the problem is you

1042
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:15,519
can't get any sponsors that have any

1043
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,440
legal

1044
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,720
things going on because they'll lose

1045
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,320
they'll lose out because they'll say

1046
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,798
they'll come to them and say

1047
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:24,558
oh you can't sponsor this event you're a

1048
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:26,398
registered dispensary you know it's like

1049
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:26,960
really so dispensary can't read can't

1050
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:28,798
like

1051
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,079
sponsor a cannabis event that makes no

1052
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:33,278
sense you know what i mean

1053
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:34,480
and and that's kind of uh that's a bit i

1054
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:36,159
think that's a bit of the problem it's

1055
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:39,120
just kind of

1056
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,919
we're coming out of the underground

1057
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:41,199
market where

1058
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,600
you know the first time you go to a

1059
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,200
party and it's all cool and relaxed

1060
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:48,000
it's because there's no rules probably

1061
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,080
you know and that's that's the

1062
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
thing that kind of kills it and so like

1063
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:53,119
with all that being said was that part

1064
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,240
of the motivation

1065
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:58,639
for you to start the adi um

1066
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,759
yeah you know that the whole idea of uh

1067
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:03,600
of doing my own

1068
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:05,759
event like that was was based on the

1069
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:07,439
the type of listeners that we had on the

1070
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:08,798
show and the sort of the core people

1071
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,000
that were involved

1072
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:12,798
were a lot of breeders and and so i kind

1073
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,880
of

1074
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:16,960
what i wanted to do was not create

1075
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:20,480
another event that was

1076
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,919
based on a million categories and trying

1077
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,919
to make it so that we're

1078
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:25,840
you know everybody wins it's like more

1079
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:27,919
like no you know what kind of going back

1080
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:31,278
to that old mentality of

1081
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,480
of how you go we know say you go to a

1082
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:33,839
party and you got good weed in your

1083
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,599
pocket

1084
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:37,278
you're gonna you're gonna show it to

1085
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:40,000
anybody and everybody

1086
00:33:37,278 --> 00:33:41,519
and smoke everybody out just to prove

1087
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,038
that you've got the best weed right then

1088
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,960
that's kind of like stoner

1089
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:46,480
101 right that's the first thing you

1090
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,919
learned like okay

1091
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,360
i'm going to be the guy who has the best

1092
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,720
wheat now the minute someone else has

1093
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:52,158
better weed than you

1094
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,720
you sort of slip that weed back in your

1095
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:57,200
pocket quietly and usually skulk away

1096
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,798
skulk away and go home you know what i

1097
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,240
mean like literally i've got

1098
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:01,278
situations where i didn't have good weed

1099
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,558
on me and i didn't even want to go to a

1100
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:03,359
party i'm like you know what i can't it

1101
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:06,240
can't be me

1102
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:07,519
i can't go hey so in a way like stoners

1103
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,398
and i always tell her it's like if you

1104
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,760
want to know who this

1105
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:12,078
big stoner and the group's going to be

1106
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,520
it's going to be the kid who loved

1107
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:15,599
show and tell you know what i mean like

1108
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:17,119
when he went to school oh it's

1109
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,119
show-and-tell day i'm going to

1110
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:21,440
bring that medal from my dad from the

1111
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:23,358
war and tell the whole story or whatever

1112
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,280
it's that kid because he always wants to

1113
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:27,358
have the cool thing and be the more

1114
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,800
you know the the coolest thing in the

1115
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:30,480
room or something and i think that's

1116
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,079
kind of where

1117
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,519
the most simple way of putting it but i

1118
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:34,879
think that's kind of like a classic

1119
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:36,960
stoner

1120
00:34:34,878 --> 00:34:38,639
the way you figure out who they are

1121
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,559
perfect so i mean if we just take a bit

1122
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,800
of a step back from the adi

1123
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:45,039
what initially inspired you to start the

1124
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:48,000
adam dunn show

1125
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:49,838
um well actually that came out of uh

1126
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,039
when i first came to colorado

1127
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:56,320
uh 2009 2010

1128
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:57,599
uh john doe radio who's tim martin

1129
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,838
he was he's been doing the show for a

1130
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:01,680
few years and he basically

1131
00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:03,039
i didn't you know i was never much of a

1132
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:04,559
podcaster i didn't even understand what

1133
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:05,279
podcasts were back in the day i was kind

1134
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:07,358
of like well

1135
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,560
podcast like whatever people listen to

1136
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:10,400
those you know i wasn't ever

1137
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:12,000
i wasn't even focusing on it but uh he

1138
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,400
invited me on a show

1139
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,800
and i came on the show and it was like

1140
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,960
you know one of his best shows as far as

1141
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,400
here i was just talking away and you

1142
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,679
know i didn't realize that people

1143
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,838
forgot that people might be interested

1144
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:25,838
in that you know and uh

1145
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:27,838
so i ended up going back on his show

1146
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:31,759
three four five times

1147
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:33,759
and uh there was a moment when his show

1148
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,920
kind of peaked out because he had his

1149
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,680
own little issues going on

1150
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,440
mostly with alcohol and stuff and he was

1151
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:41,759
like getting drunk on the show

1152
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,800
and getting all pissy with his with his

1153
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,000
people and like

1154
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,839
complaining about his his uh his the

1155
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,679
sponsors on his own show you know i was

1156
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:53,599
like you can't do that right

1157
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:56,480
so basically i was realizing that he

1158
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:57,599
like he actually got taken off the air

1159
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,000
on the air like

1160
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:01,680
like live on the air getting taken out

1161
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,239
by the police

1162
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:05,118
because he had broken into the studio

1163
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:06,719
and got all

1164
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,240
drunk and locked himself in there you

1165
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:10,719
know so it's one of those crazy stories

1166
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:12,000
so basically i saw this like like and i

1167
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:13,358
was kind of bummed because i'd liked

1168
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,119
going on a show

1169
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:16,400
and then i told them like hey you know

1170
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,160
what i'll do a

1171
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,519
wednesday show because that was his slot

1172
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:21,279
it was a wednesday slot and i was like

1173
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:22,480
i'll take over your wednesday slot and

1174
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,839
just do something

1175
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,960
so i did a show called cd wednesdays and

1176
00:36:25,838 --> 00:36:29,119
uh

1177
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,880
i figured my original concept was like

1178
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:34,160
well you know i can just pull out my

1179
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,599
my phone and just call my random breeder

1180
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:36,879
friends and we can just rap you know

1181
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:39,119
what i mean because then it's like

1182
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,320
it's you know straight to the source was

1183
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,640
the idea

1184
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,920
and uh so i did a few of those shows and

1185
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:46,960
with

1186
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,159
zero format and just kind of was winging

1187
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:51,280
it

1188
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:54,078
had some people listening to it um

1189
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,440
and kind of realized that it's you know

1190
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,039
for me

1191
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,720
i always had a store and i was always

1192
00:36:57,039 --> 00:37:00,960
talking to people and i was always

1193
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:02,559
educating and trying to like help people

1194
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,480
out and so i kind of feel like this is

1195
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:07,039
an extension of that

1196
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,519
and uh so it felt real comfortable and

1197
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:08,960
really

1198
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:11,119
felt really easy so it's one of those

1199
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,358
things where i just kind of stuck with

1200
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:14,079
it

1201
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:15,440
and then at a certain point i realized

1202
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,119
that

1203
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,480
i may want to just throw my name on to

1204
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,079
it to help

1205
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,599
kind of people know what the show is

1206
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,039
about because it keeps it really open

1207
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,480
because one of the things

1208
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:26,159
like when i meet somebody they're always

1209
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,960
like so what do you do you know and i'm

1210
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:28,639
oh

1211
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,880
it's a hard answer it's a hard thing to

1212
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:32,559
answer because yes i breed and i make

1213
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,480
seeds but i also have a clothing company

1214
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:36,320
and i also have always had usually have

1215
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,639
a glass gallery and you know they have a

1216
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,480
lot going on so it's really hard to

1217
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:42,639
pinpoint it to one thing so that that's

1218
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,920
where the the concept of just calling it

1219
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:45,440
the item done show came in because i was

1220
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,880
like you know what this could go into

1221
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,039
any direction so let's

1222
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,400
let's just leave it at that you know

1223
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:51,759
it's been it's been really good it's

1224
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,119
been one of those things where it's it's

1225
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,000
good to have an outlet you know and it's

1226
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:56,880
also good to

1227
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,079
to uh stay sort of relevant that's one

1228
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,440
of the things i realized in this

1229
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,280
industry it's quick

1230
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,280
you can quickly become irrelevant if you

1231
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,640
have no if you're not really putting the

1232
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,680
energy into it

1233
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:08,879
and i always think you got to you know

1234
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:10,559
especially in a group situation

1235
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,440
someone's got to take the initiative and

1236
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:12,960
i feel like

1237
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,480
this is just another step and what's

1238
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,199
funny is i'm sure you've noticed it too

1239
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,880
where

1240
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:18,799
it's like being a dj a few years ago

1241
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,160
maybe 10 years ago if you were a dj it's

1242
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,480
sort of like

1243
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:23,920
okay you know now everybody's a dj or

1244
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,559
so-called dj but

1245
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,000
but like same thing with podcasts it's

1246
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:29,519
like right now i feel good that i

1247
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,119
actually did it when i did it because

1248
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:32,320
now it feels like everybody wants to do

1249
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:34,800
a podcast and

1250
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,519
you know i i i i'm definitely everybody

1251
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,200
should try

1252
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:42,320
but it is kind of hard to to

1253
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:44,399
keep it rolling if you try to stick to

1254
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,559
only one subject

1255
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,559
yeah i can definitely agree on that i

1256
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:50,159
think i also get asked a lot is

1257
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:51,679
people will message me and say oh yeah i

1258
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:52,879
want to start a podcast

1259
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:53,919
but they won't know what it's going to

1260
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,280
be about they'll be like what should it

1261
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,559
be about and it's like i don't know man

1262
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,920
it's got to be organic like you got to

1263
00:38:56,559 --> 00:39:00,159
do it about something that

1264
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,760
you're passionate know about you can't

1265
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:02,960
tell someone to do a podcast about

1266
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,480
because then otherwise you would have

1267
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,159
already done it right if that's if you

1268
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,039
have the if you have the greatest idea

1269
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:08,639
for a podcast

1270
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:09,838
but it's not what your subject that

1271
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:11,039
you're involved in it's going to be

1272
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:13,599
pretty hard to even

1273
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:15,759
manifest that one you know yeah so i

1274
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:18,000
mean you kind of touched on it but

1275
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,280
do you did you ever envision the adam

1276
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,679
dunn show to be

1277
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,200
like of a specific format or did you

1278
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:24,480
really honestly just think

1279
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:26,000
i just wanted to be free-flowing

1280
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,880
whatever comes from it comes from well

1281
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,639
you know

1282
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,240
well you can actually if you follow the

1283
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:31,358
if you follow it you see like you know

1284
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:33,919
one of the things that

1285
00:39:31,358 --> 00:39:34,480
that made the show sort of more popular

1286
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,480
and

1287
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,760
and it's a shame that it's not still

1288
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,000
rolling was that i had mitch

1289
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,280
had mitch jonas on board for a good year

1290
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,920
or so and

1291
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,480
your plus and he really helped me format

1292
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,559
it a little

1293
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,159
better in the sense of he brought a

1294
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:49,838
little more structure to it

1295
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:51,679
um it's one of the things that i've

1296
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:53,358
noticed is that

1297
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:55,279
like like for instance i mean we all

1298
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:56,880
listen now i listen to you know

1299
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,119
not a lot of podcasts but i listen to a

1300
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,920
few like everybody i listen to joe rogan

1301
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:04,318
and i think he's it's funny because i

1302
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:07,358
watched it in the beginning i could tell

1303
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:08,480
that he was very similar to me were kind

1304
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:10,480
of like

1305
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,240
a lot of he likes a lot of subjects he's

1306
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,800
a little all over the place

1307
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:16,559
he also you know he has this guy that

1308
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,079
helps him out and then he really is

1309
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:19,759
winging it half the time and that's kind

1310
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:21,359
of where i i always felt like i'm much

1311
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,640
better when i'm doing that than when i

1312
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:24,400
get a little bit too much structure in

1313
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:26,000
front of me so um

1314
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,440
but by having mitch on the show he kind

1315
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,760
of helped me a little bit we had like

1316
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,519
time slots and you know he had it all

1317
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:35,839
figured he mapped it out

1318
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:38,079
um but i feel like it's uh

1319
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:39,440
it's there's an evolution to it and i

1320
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:39,839
know there's going to be another wave

1321
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,280
because

1322
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:42,960
at a certain point i've had i've had a

1323
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,359
lot of people approach me about doing

1324
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,440
other

1325
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:46,960
stuff and i'm kind of like oh i don't

1326
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,720
know it's hard if i gonna work for

1327
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:51,599
somebody because i've never had that

1328
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:52,239
for the last 25 years or so i haven't

1329
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:54,720
i've always

1330
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:56,159
been the boss you know and so that's a

1331
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:57,759
really hard uh

1332
00:40:56,159 --> 00:40:59,199
like someone asked me to do with what

1333
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,400
they want me to do and i'm gonna i'm

1334
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:03,439
gonna always say no

1335
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:05,280
at this point because i uh i just don't

1336
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,838
know if i could do that

1337
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,440
totally out of my element creative

1338
00:41:07,838 --> 00:41:12,239
freedom right

1339
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:14,159
yeah you know and it it is like my

1340
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:15,679
favorite my favorite shows to put out

1341
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:17,358
are the ones that i don't

1342
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:18,960
i come out of there feeling like wow i

1343
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:20,799
didn't even know half the things

1344
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,318
like it's just i learned so much on my

1345
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,480
own show you know that's

1346
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:25,599
that's a pretty cool feeling there's

1347
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,440
times when i

1348
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:28,960
i'm like well if i learn something then

1349
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,159
i can only imagine that the people who

1350
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,960
listen to it must have been

1351
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:34,159
blown away even more because they're

1352
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,960
really not knowing the

1353
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:38,399
both sides of it yeah so i think a

1354
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,639
question i'd love to ask

1355
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,720
a lot of people were kind of wondering

1356
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:44,799
you know why did mitch take a step back

1357
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:46,078
i one thing i had heard was that he's

1358
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,519
actually not so

1359
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:49,280
heavily involved in the cannabis scene

1360
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:51,838
in general anymore is that

1361
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,119
true um no he works for dark horse

1362
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:54,559
genetics now so he's still in the

1363
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:57,519
cannabis world i think

1364
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:58,960
you know the difference is that uh mitch

1365
00:41:57,519 --> 00:42:00,239
was a straight edge guy

1366
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,400
back in the day you know he was

1367
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:04,000
literally the guy who would go

1368
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,599
not i'm not going to say he would go and

1369
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,800
beat people up but he was like literally

1370
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:08,880
part of the crew

1371
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,480
who would cruise around and be like

1372
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,160
hating on people who were taking drugs

1373
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:15,119
you know what i mean so he literally

1374
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:16,480
turned his thing around 180 when he got

1375
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,160
into weed

1376
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,000
whereas you know i've never been that

1377
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:22,318
guy i've always been a weed guy so

1378
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,480
there was a little less of a like long

1379
00:42:22,318 --> 00:42:25,759
term like i have to be a weed guy for

1380
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,760
the rest of my life and the thing is

1381
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,960
he actually quit smoking weed for a

1382
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,599
short time he didn't

1383
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:33,199
quit completely but he quit when he when

1384
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:34,240
he quit the show he quit smoking weed at

1385
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:36,078
that time he had a

1386
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:38,559
point in his life where he felt that he

1387
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:39,839
needed to uh

1388
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:41,358
center himself and take care of his

1389
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:42,000
family that's really what i mean and

1390
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:45,279
mitch's

1391
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,480
mitch's uh like it's like like like we

1392
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,800
were talking about earlier when it came

1393
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,400
to

1394
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,318
putting the show together and you know

1395
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:53,440
he had it all pre-planned and typed up

1396
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:56,480
and ready to go so when he sees

1397
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,920
that you know it's because for him

1398
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,599
not to say that it was about money at

1399
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,519
all but he really couldn't

1400
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:03,680
put the energy into driving down from

1401
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:06,079
boulder to be on the show

1402
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:07,358
to then not get paid enough and when we

1403
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:09,519
really struggled when it came to

1404
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:12,400
sponsors and keeping people on

1405
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:13,759
point and and paying their bills and you

1406
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,838
know i'm sure you've

1407
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,040
kind of seen that side of it all and

1408
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:18,880
it's one of the hardest i mean

1409
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:20,079
the thing about podcasting is it's very

1410
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,160
hard

1411
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:23,519
because you could sell out and go to

1412
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:24,799
sponsors that have nothing to do with

1413
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:26,800
you and make more money but

1414
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,240
we really only wanted to work with

1415
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,839
products that we like and you know

1416
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:31,279
things that we really could stand behind

1417
00:43:29,838 --> 00:43:33,199
because it's

1418
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,119
you know very easy when you use

1419
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:37,358
something and you like it to tell to be

1420
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:39,200
enthusiastic about it and then people

1421
00:43:37,358 --> 00:43:40,400
you know believe you obviously because

1422
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:41,838
you're like hey i've been you know

1423
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,000
been using this thing for two years it's

1424
00:43:41,838 --> 00:43:47,519
awesome and then compared to like

1425
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,838
oh yeah and if you want to get the

1426
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:50,960
mailchimp contact mail you know that's

1427
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:53,679
kind of where it's

1428
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,318
it it's uh it's hard as a podcast person

1429
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:55,838
so he

1430
00:43:54,318 --> 00:43:58,400
so i think with with mitch it's it's a

1431
00:43:55,838 --> 00:44:00,639
little bit of uh he's also very much

1432
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,519
uh moves on with his things and keeps

1433
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:04,000
rolling

1434
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:05,920
uh i'm i'm the kind of guy who really

1435
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,838
has a hard time letting go and giving up

1436
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,680
i'm terrible about it like sometimes

1437
00:44:07,838 --> 00:44:11,119
even when it's not productive i'll just

1438
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:12,318
keep rolling with something because i

1439
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:13,920
feel like

1440
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:15,039
nope i said i was going to do it i'm

1441
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,400
going to do it till the end you know

1442
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:18,239
what i mean

1443
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,920
so we just have different different

1444
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:21,279
personalities like that

1445
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,480
but you know we're still in contact

1446
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,920
everything's cool it's not like there's

1447
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,960
never there was never an issue it was

1448
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,838
always just a

1449
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,358
i think a change in his his uh direction

1450
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:31,519
but i've also told him i said listen if

1451
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:32,960
we ever get like a real deal

1452
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:34,559
you know that actually is somebody

1453
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,119
paying us to do what we're doing and not

1454
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:36,480
us

1455
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:38,640
having to figure it all out for

1456
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,880
ourselves then i'll i'd love to have him

1457
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:42,318
back and hopefully he will you know

1458
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,079
he was a great i mean that's the thing

1459
00:44:42,318 --> 00:44:46,239
is when mitch was with me i really

1460
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:48,000
like i could let him run the ship for a

1461
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:48,639
bit and i would just be able to throw in

1462
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,838
my

1463
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:53,759
two cents which would be always the

1464
00:44:51,838 --> 00:44:55,519
goofy or stupid side of everything so i

1465
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,720
didn't have to take myself too seriously

1466
00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:58,239
now all of a sudden i feel like

1467
00:44:56,719 --> 00:45:00,318
well i can't just be the goofy guy you

1468
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:03,039
know what i mean i gotta actually

1469
00:45:00,318 --> 00:45:04,480
buckle down every so often and try to

1470
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:04,800
get to the bottom of certain things you

1471
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,440
know

1472
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:09,200
with people with guests and stuff yeah

1473
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,039
you know i can i can totally relate to

1474
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:13,439
that sometimes i feel like

1475
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:15,039
i'm focusing um so hard on what people

1476
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,800
are saying so that i can maybe come up

1477
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:18,400
with a follow-up question

1478
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,839
that i'll often come back to the

1479
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,599
interview and just be like

1480
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:23,358
i don't remember them saying that like

1481
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:24,640
you know what i mean yes exactly now i

1482
00:45:23,358 --> 00:45:25,838
have that all the time where i

1483
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:27,920
sometimes i have it where i'm in the

1484
00:45:25,838 --> 00:45:29,119
middle and i'm thinking of the next

1485
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,960

1529

and are sticking by their guns you know

1530
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,880
what i mean and that's kind of what i

1531
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,240
like i like people that are

1532
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:06,160
have been doing something and they got

1533
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:09,279
they can relay to the listener

1534
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:10,159
stuff they can do that can not only save

1535
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,680
them a ton of money

1536
00:47:10,159 --> 00:47:17,440
but also make them healthier and and

1537
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:19,519
give them a give them a

1538
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,599
an avenue to be able to take care of

1539
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:23,280
themselves that's that's kind of my

1540
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:26,000
i feel like what i feel like the service

1541
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:29,680
of the show is to is to give people

1542
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,039
options outside of the

1543
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:33,039
i'm just going to sit here and hype up

1544
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:34,480
some brands for you because

1545
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:35,920
they paid me to do that you know that's

1546
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,318
kind of that's what a lot of the

1547
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,519
podcasts i've noticed have been you know

1548
00:47:38,318 --> 00:47:40,880
yeah when it comes to growing when it

1549
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:43,119
comes to growing because there's so much

1550
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:45,519
money to be made in in

1551
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:46,480
in products you know and so people are

1552
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:48,719
always looking for

1553
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,318
ways to promote their products and which

1554
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:51,199
is fine and i'm totally down with it but

1555
00:47:50,318 --> 00:47:52,719
it has to be for

1556
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:56,318
what i said earlier it has to be stuff

1557
00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:58,639
that i'm backing because i like it

1558
00:47:56,318 --> 00:48:00,000
yeah okay and so one question i thought

1559
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:01,039
that you'd be the perfect person to

1560
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,920
answer is

1561
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:05,679
who's someone who you think has maybe

1562
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,440
not due to their own fault but you know

1563
00:48:05,679 --> 00:48:08,960
just kind of flown under the radar over

1564
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,200
the years who you think should get some

1565
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:14,800
more credit maybe as a breeder or

1566
00:48:11,199 --> 00:48:14,799
any facet of the community i guess

1567
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:18,799
hmm good question um

1568
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:25,279
see over the years myself i don't know

1569
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:27,119
uh you know it's been one of those i

1570
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,800
think that

1571
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:31,519
one thing you notice in this industry is

1572
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:35,440
that uh

1573
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:37,199
people that that you know do it for

1574
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,880
do it for the long like do it for the

1575
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:42,399
long haul i gotta think about this

1576
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,400
question this is a tough one um

1577
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:46,639
i think a lot of people is the opposite

1578
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,000
i think a lot of people got way too much

1579
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:49,759
credit in this industry

1580
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
where you're like hey if you want to try

1581
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:55,040
some names

1582
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,400
no no i don't want i don't need i

1583
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:58,079
i don't need to i don't need to throw

1584
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,800
throw shaded anybody but

1585
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:01,760
uh the you know the the thing i've i

1586
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,200
mean one of the people

1587
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:05,599
i think that a lot of our people are

1588
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:08,159
forgetting um

1589
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:09,359
is ben drunker's my old boss which uh i

1590
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:12,719
mean he

1591
00:49:09,358 --> 00:49:15,279
he stuck his neck out when when it was

1592
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:16,480
like you know if you think about a guy

1593
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,640
like him who

1594
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:21,039
made it possible for so many people to

1595
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:23,118
to start their own businesses i mean

1596
00:49:21,039 --> 00:49:24,960
that's the one thing with ben if if

1597
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:26,640
you're not i mean he's literally like

1598
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,000
he's the dawn you know i mean he is

1599
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:29,598
truly

1600
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,760
the dawn now he's not that he's never

1601
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:33,599
been celebrated by people he has and

1602
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,359
a lot of times it's it's it's people

1603
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:36,720
trying to get something out of him but

1604
00:49:35,358 --> 00:49:38,558
but i really feel like that guy took

1605
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:39,439
more risks in this industry than almost

1606
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:41,280
anybody

1607
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,280
he was arrested like 30 times or

1608
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:46,960
something like that and you know he's

1609
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:48,240
he's had balls of steel he's taken

1610
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,240
you know one of the greatest stories i

1611
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:51,358
heard of him my greatest i use a lot of

1612
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:52,639
it but one of the stories i heard from

1613
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:53,759
him that was just shows you the kind of

1614
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:56,639
guy he was

1615
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:59,359
is there was a guy who um came to the to

1616
00:49:56,639 --> 00:50:00,239
the uh hash museum at one point and he

1617
00:49:59,358 --> 00:50:02,159
was a

1618
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:04,239
he was from uruguay and he was a friend

1619
00:50:02,159 --> 00:50:07,279
of another person who

1620
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:08,879
was like showing him around uh in europe

1621
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,240
and they had their wallets stolen or

1622
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,880
their bags or something like that and so

1623
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:16,399
his passport was stolen he had no money

1624
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:18,318
and uh he uh

1625
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,760
so i guess ben had given him ten

1626
00:50:18,318 --> 00:50:21,440
thousand guilders was about five

1627
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,960
thousand dollars at the time

1628
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,480
so that he could get him get home to

1629
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:26,240
uruguay because it was really expensive

1630
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,119
for tickets and take care of himself and

1631
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:29,358
everything

1632
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:30,480
and then that guy turned out to be the

1633
00:50:29,358 --> 00:50:32,078
president of uruguay

1634
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:33,519
the recent one the guy the really cool

1635
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:37,359
president they have

1636
00:50:33,519 --> 00:50:38,639
uh and you know just to show you they're

1637
00:50:37,358 --> 00:50:38,960
kind of like you know someone throws you

1638
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:40,318
ten

1639
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,318
000 bucks you're gonna remember them

1640
00:50:40,318 --> 00:50:44,318
forever you know and so

1641
00:50:42,318 --> 00:50:46,400
i'm sure ben has some extra special

1642
00:50:44,318 --> 00:50:47,920
credit down in uruguay now but just like

1643
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,400
he was just that kind of a guy you know

1644
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,519
what i mean

1645
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:53,200
and and uh over the years so many people

1646
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:54,400
including myself have like started

1647
00:50:53,199 --> 00:50:56,000
underneath him

1648
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,639
saw the light like wait a minute you can

1649
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,559
sell seeds and people will pay for them

1650
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:02,159
oh my gosh and it's something you love

1651
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:05,440
this is great so he kind of like

1652
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:06,639
showed everybody what to do and you know

1653
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:10,000
since he

1654
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:11,759
was the birth of serious seeds the birth

1655
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,039
of sacraments the birth of

1656
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:16,640
th seeds the birth of uh so many other

1657
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:17,440
ones after that too and like you know

1658
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:21,039
just

1659
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:22,720
if you and now of course uh

1660
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:24,159
you know he lives in malaysia he's got

1661
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:25,439
his own island so this guy's doing

1662
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:26,639
pretty good i don't think he has anybody

1663
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,920
has to worry about him not doing good

1664
00:51:26,639 --> 00:51:29,279
but he definitely

1665
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,119
i think is because we're getting to that

1666
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,599
point now where america is taking over

1667
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:34,160
uh people think of dutch genetics as

1668
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:36,160
being like

1669
00:51:34,159 --> 00:51:37,199
not inferior for some reason and i'm

1670
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:40,000
like ah

1671
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:40,399
you know they were the gatekeepers of

1672
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,679
all

1673
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:46,639
genetics for so long and they

1674
00:51:43,679 --> 00:51:48,000
did a huge service to the world because

1675
00:51:46,639 --> 00:51:49,358
if they didn't do that if they didn't

1676
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,519
step up to the plate

1677
00:51:49,358 --> 00:51:54,000
in the 80s we would have lost it all you

1678
00:51:51,519 --> 00:51:56,559
know what i mean because there's so much

1679
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,400
uh that got at least had a home in

1680
00:51:56,559 --> 00:52:00,400
amsterdam you know and then could get

1681
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,400
filtered out of there and get sent back

1682
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:05,680
to america so

1683
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:09,519
so i think he's he's probably the the

1684
00:52:05,679 --> 00:52:10,879
biggest influence influencer that

1685
00:52:09,519 --> 00:52:13,280
gets the least amount of credit these

1686
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:15,920
days you know

1687
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,400
and what would you say to people who

1688
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,720
claim

1689
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,680
that the uh downfall in quality from

1690
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:23,679
scentsy is

1691
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:26,719
kind of on his shoulders um

1692
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:27,838
no it's um i mean it i know exactly when

1693
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:29,598
it went downhill

1694
00:52:27,838 --> 00:52:32,799
because it was it happened right when i

1695
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:35,920
was there so basically in 1993

1696
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:38,480
uh right about the time when i moved

1697
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,039
to so 92 between 92 and 93 they they

1698
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,480
bought out

1699
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:46,239
um they bought uh neville's

1700
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:50,159
entire collection right so neville was

1701
00:52:46,239 --> 00:52:51,759
trapped and he had to get take he had to

1702
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:52,480
get smuggled out of back from he was in

1703
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:55,599
australia

1704
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:57,199
uh and so when they

1705
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:58,640
did that they basically bought his

1706
00:52:57,199 --> 00:53:00,960
entire collection so that

1707
00:52:58,639 --> 00:53:02,400
you know to finance him got him back to

1708
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:06,400
amsterdam

1709
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:09,680
and about a year after that

1710
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:10,160
maybe two years after that that's when

1711
00:53:09,679 --> 00:53:11,838
they

1712
00:53:10,159 --> 00:53:13,519
so marcel who was the main grower at the

1713
00:53:11,838 --> 00:53:14,159
time i don't know who's who's going for

1714
00:53:13,519 --> 00:53:15,519
for scentsy

1715
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:17,358
right now but there's a guy named marcel

1716
00:53:15,519 --> 00:53:17,920
and he was the main grower and this is

1717
00:53:17,358 --> 00:53:21,358
where

1718
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:24,400
the dutch lost the plot a long time ago

1719
00:53:21,358 --> 00:53:26,318
is that very few of them smoke pure weed

1720
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:28,559
they almost always come up with tobacco

1721
00:53:26,318 --> 00:53:29,759
and i figured that out when i first got

1722
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:30,960
there i was like wow and that

1723
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,640
seems like none of these dutch people

1724
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,920
really know anything about weed like

1725
00:53:32,639 --> 00:53:35,679
they all just kind of

1726
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:37,358
oh it smokes it's good you know what i

1727
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:38,960
mean and i was like

1728
00:53:37,358 --> 00:53:40,318
but don't you notice that this one has a

1729
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,800
much better flavor you know i was always

1730
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:43,519
like

1731
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,318
trying to figure out the nuances and

1732
00:53:43,519 --> 00:53:46,400
because i didn't put

1733
00:53:44,318 --> 00:53:47,920
tobacco in my weight and i realized

1734
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,400
quickly like wow i could you know i

1735
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,480
could

1736
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:52,000
you could rise that rise to the top of

1737
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,920
this industry really fast just

1738
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,199
just based on the fact that you're

1739
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,680
really into what you're doing you know

1740
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:58,558
what i mean

1741
00:53:55,679 --> 00:53:59,440
that you you understand the medium that

1742
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:02,640
you're in

1743
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,679
and so marcel who didn't smoke was the

1744
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:06,400
main grower

1745
00:54:03,679 --> 00:54:08,239
he took over all of neville's work and

1746
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:11,200
he had no clue what he was doing and he

1747
00:54:08,239 --> 00:54:11,759
did not follow the instructions properly

1748
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:13,598
and that

1749
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,040
things got haywire you know so then when

1750
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:16,480
neville had to come back in and clean it

1751
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:19,199
all up so that was kind of

1752
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:21,119
the original mistake and then i believe

1753
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:22,000
you know it's pretty hard to maintain a

1754
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:25,680
library

1755
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:28,480
for 30 plus years and not expect there

1756
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:30,318
to be some deviation from quality

1757
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,519
and then on top of that you take into

1758
00:54:30,318 --> 00:54:34,400
effect that

1759
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:35,039
you know i think the other problem that

1760
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:38,798
they had

1761
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:40,318
was dutch are very arrogant people they

1762
00:54:38,798 --> 00:54:42,318
can't help it it's just in their

1763
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:44,239
blood that's just the way they are you

1764
00:54:42,318 --> 00:54:45,279
know what i mean so they have a hard

1765
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:49,519
time

1766
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:51,119
uh taking a taking criticism and be

1767
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:52,719
believing that they're in the wrong in

1768
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:54,480
any way shape or form so when it comes

1769
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:55,598
to like breeding and stuff i believe

1770
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,039
that

1771
00:54:55,599 --> 00:55:00,480
they may not reach out enough you know

1772
00:54:57,039 --> 00:55:02,318
what i mean to to get people to

1773
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,838
keep them in line because they feel like

1774
00:55:02,318 --> 00:55:06,318
they know what they're doing

1775
00:55:03,838 --> 00:55:07,440
so yeah i think that arrogance is maybe

1776
00:55:06,318 --> 00:55:08,719
what came through a little bit and

1777
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,440
that's the thing in holland now they're

1778
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:11,838
desperate for

1779
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:13,200
for american genetics that are fresh you

1780
00:55:11,838 --> 00:55:15,679
know and everybody's looking for

1781
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:18,798
something new like if you go there now

1782
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:20,480
every shop owner is like oh adam adam

1783
00:55:18,798 --> 00:55:22,239
adam we want

1784
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:23,838
the best of the best can you get it you

1785
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:25,439
know i'm like no you know

1786
00:55:23,838 --> 00:55:27,358
like those days are over for like you

1787
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:29,200
guys can figure it out yourself

1788
00:55:27,358 --> 00:55:30,798
but i think that's just the way it is is

1789
00:55:29,199 --> 00:55:33,358
that people are

1790
00:55:30,798 --> 00:55:34,719
uh they always thought they had the best

1791
00:55:33,358 --> 00:55:36,639
weed there

1792
00:55:34,719 --> 00:55:38,159
and what i always noticed when i was

1793
00:55:36,639 --> 00:55:38,879
working like anybody who came into my

1794
00:55:38,159 --> 00:55:40,719
store

1795
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,079
i had the same discussion over and over

1796
00:55:40,719 --> 00:55:43,519
and over again like anybody from

1797
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:45,359
california

1798
00:55:43,519 --> 00:55:48,159
or from anywhere that was like cannabis

1799
00:55:45,358 --> 00:55:49,920
like had a good cannabis culture already

1800
00:55:48,159 --> 00:55:51,199
was like hey i came to amsterdam i

1801
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,880
haven't smoked any good weed you know

1802
00:55:51,199 --> 00:55:54,078
and i have to like bust out something

1803
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:56,000
and be like we'll try this

1804
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:57,039
oh okay well you're the only one you

1805
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,480
know or something like that and i'd be

1806
00:55:57,039 --> 00:56:00,239
like no no there's good weed here you

1807
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:02,480
just have to know where it is

1808
00:56:00,239 --> 00:56:03,838
and again very similar to what happens

1809
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:06,159
in america now

1810
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:08,078
and it will happen in in australia and

1811
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:09,039
it will happen anywhere that it becomes

1812
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:12,240
legal or

1813
00:56:09,039 --> 00:56:14,558
or fully accepted because

1814
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:15,759
whenever there's quantities the quality

1815
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:17,680
is going to go down you know

1816
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,720
just just and there's going to be so

1817
00:56:17,679 --> 00:56:20,239
much out there that you're going to have

1818
00:56:18,719 --> 00:56:23,279
to filter through

1819
00:56:20,239 --> 00:56:24,879
to get to the good weed my first shop

1820
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:27,519
was called cia

1821
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:28,240
and that stood for cannabis in amsterdam

1822
00:56:27,519 --> 00:56:31,920
and then

1823
00:56:28,239 --> 00:56:33,199
i broke up with my original partner and

1824
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:36,240
decided to change the name of the

1825
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:37,439
company at that point to kgb so we like

1826
00:56:36,239 --> 00:56:40,078
we're like all right we're not we're not

1827
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:41,760
cia anymore now we're kgb

1828
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:43,119
and uh that meant but that was an

1829
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:45,599
acronym for no good bud

1830
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:47,039
in amsterdam and you know it was

1831
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:47,920
obviously tongue-in-cheek because it was

1832
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:49,358
one of those things where what do you

1833
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,960
mean there's no good weed in amsterdam

1834
00:56:49,358 --> 00:56:54,000
it was like no no no we know

1835
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:55,519
good weed in amsterdam it's like oh okay

1836
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,119
and it's the same you know sort of the

1837
00:56:55,519 --> 00:56:58,480
same now in colorado people come here

1838
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:59,838
and they're like oh there's no good weed

1839
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:01,119
in here it's like there is good weed

1840
00:56:59,838 --> 00:57:02,880
here the problem is most of the stuff

1841
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:05,519
that's in the dispensaries

1842
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:07,519
has to go be touched seven or eight

1843
00:57:05,519 --> 00:57:09,199
times before it actually gets into you

1844
00:57:07,519 --> 00:57:12,559
you know what i mean so the handling is

1845
00:57:09,199 --> 00:57:14,159
what [ __ ] it all up and it always adds

1846
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:15,680
yeah wow so many things we could talk

1847
00:57:14,159 --> 00:57:17,039
about i think the one which piques my

1848
00:57:15,679 --> 00:57:18,719
interest the most

1849
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:20,318
can we go back to the early days at

1850
00:57:18,719 --> 00:57:22,318
greenhouse where you

1851
00:57:20,318 --> 00:57:23,920
are in and shanti were working together

1852
00:57:22,318 --> 00:57:26,000
what was that like you know what's your

1853
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:27,280
opinion of those guys as breeders per se

1854
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,318
like you know put aside the personal

1855
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,920
stuff you think they're pretty good

1856
00:57:28,318 --> 00:57:31,440
breeders

1857
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:33,920
i think shanti's a good breeder for sure

1858
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:35,679
i mean aryan aryan is a real

1859
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:37,838
aryan is the epitome of what i just said

1860
00:57:35,679 --> 00:57:39,519
which was the dutch are so arrogant that

1861
00:57:37,838 --> 00:57:40,239
they don't know what's there's out there

1862
00:57:39,519 --> 00:57:41,759
because they're

1863
00:57:40,239 --> 00:57:43,598
they're so convinced that what they have

1864
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:45,280
is the best and they're the best and so

1865
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:46,720
therefore they're the best you know and

1866
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:48,319
you're like okay

1867
00:57:46,719 --> 00:57:50,159
but uh you know he and he was kind of

1868
00:57:48,318 --> 00:57:52,558
more silver spoon kind of guy

1869
00:57:50,159 --> 00:57:53,199
didn't have it as difficult as i mean

1870
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:55,760
shanti was

1871
00:57:53,199 --> 00:57:57,118
was taking big risks and growing in in

1872
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:59,839
africa in places that were

1873
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:00,240
much more intense um totally respected

1874
00:57:59,838 --> 00:58:02,480
him

1875
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:04,558
when when we met and uh i didn't really

1876
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,798
do much work with them i kind of like i

1877
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:08,160
i

1878
00:58:04,798 --> 00:58:11,838
you know we were all in our own camps i

1879
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:15,039
i uh it's funny because my friend

1880
00:58:11,838 --> 00:58:16,239
ran aryan's uh clone operation for him

1881
00:58:15,039 --> 00:58:19,199
you know at one point

1882
00:58:16,239 --> 00:58:20,399
and uh you know i'd go by his house and

1883
00:58:19,199 --> 00:58:21,598
shake my head

1884
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,639
what are you doing working for this guy

1885
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:23,680
you know i mean you're like we're

1886
00:58:22,639 --> 00:58:24,879
working for the enemy now this doesn't

1887
00:58:23,679 --> 00:58:25,358
make any sense because we were all our

1888
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,200
own

1889
00:58:25,358 --> 00:58:29,440
in our own camps at that time but you

1890
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:31,199
know and and there's you know

1891
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,559
as much as people think we have bad

1892
00:58:31,199 --> 00:58:32,960
blood between breeders and stuff it's

1893
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:34,798
like

1894
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,480
for me it was a different thing we both

1895
00:58:34,798 --> 00:58:38,559
were shop owners we both had

1896
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:40,318
our seed companies and my little pet

1897
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:42,160
peeves with aryan were

1898
00:58:40,318 --> 00:58:44,000
more my biggest pet peeve with him was

1899
00:58:42,159 --> 00:58:46,000
was the fact that

1900
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,000
what i i i felt like we were getting

1901
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,079
kind of slapped in the face

1902
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,920
just because we were foreigners because

1903
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:53,519
we came there in 93

1904
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:54,880
well i started my first company i got

1905
00:58:53,519 --> 00:58:55,599
there in 89 but we first started the

1906
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:58,798
first company

1907
00:58:55,599 --> 00:59:03,680
in 93 and

1908
00:58:58,798 --> 00:59:05,119
about 94 i believe rn came into our shop

1909
00:59:03,679 --> 00:59:06,639
we already knew each other because i

1910
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:07,599
used to hang i knew him from sensing

1911
00:59:06,639 --> 00:59:08,879
stuff so it wasn't like we didn't know

1912
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:09,838
each other but he walked in with a group

1913
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,599
of people

1914
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:13,119
and they were like looking around and

1915
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:14,720
all anything that i had that was seed

1916
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:16,160
related they wanted it so they grabbed

1917
00:59:14,719 --> 00:59:18,798
all my catalogs from all the different

1918
00:59:16,159 --> 00:59:22,318
companies that i was repping and then

1919
00:59:18,798 --> 00:59:24,559
they on the way out said by the way

1920
00:59:22,318 --> 00:59:26,558
guys you can just forget about making

1921
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:29,119
seeds because i'm about to

1922
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:30,798
flood the market and make them not

1923
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:32,000
making so you'll never be able to keep

1924
00:59:30,798 --> 00:59:34,719
up you know what i mean and i was like

1925
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,719
okay and then he came out with his seed

1926
00:59:34,719 --> 00:59:39,199
company within maybe what like

1927
00:59:36,719 --> 00:59:41,118
three four months after that and the

1928
00:59:39,199 --> 00:59:43,519
right away i was like wait a minute

1929
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:44,480
why does it say since 1985 on the top of

1930
00:59:43,519 --> 00:59:47,119
this thing

1931
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:48,079
because we're in 1994 and this just

1932
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:49,838
started

1933
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:51,280
today you know i mean so this doesn't

1934
00:59:49,838 --> 00:59:53,679
even make sense

1935
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:55,200
and and then uh he literally said you

1936
00:59:53,679 --> 00:59:56,399
know i confronted him on it the first

1937
00:59:55,199 --> 00:59:58,879
time i could i was like hey what's up

1938
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:00,880
with this since 1985 stuff because

1939
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,920
i'm pretty sure you did not exist when i

1940
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:03,680
got here you know

1941
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:06,000
when i met you you did not even have a

1942
01:00:03,679 --> 01:00:07,679
shop at that time and so

1943
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,159
and his story to me was that well you

1944
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:12,399
know i was watering plants from my dad

1945
01:00:10,159 --> 01:00:14,159
in 1985 i had 2 000 plants i had to

1946
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:16,960
water every day

1947
01:00:14,159 --> 01:00:18,399
and i was like that is it should say the

1948
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:20,880
and this is the funny part is

1949
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:22,480
he always would bust shanti baba's balls

1950
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:26,160
and call him

1951
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:27,760
the water boy you know so i was like

1952
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:29,598
and so i was like hey wait a minute

1953
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:30,880
aren't you just a i should say water boy

1954
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:34,000
since 1985

1955
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:35,519
right and he got so pissed off yeah so

1956
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,880
that was like you know that was

1957
01:00:35,519 --> 01:00:38,880
that was my little pet peeve and it's

1958
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:40,480
nothing personal it's just i feel like

1959
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:42,000
you need to be honest about some things

1960
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:43,519
when it comes to like your starting date

1961
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,400
that's that's kind of basic right you

1962
01:00:43,519 --> 01:00:45,679
know it's like

1963
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,280
if you're you're going to tell people

1964
01:00:45,679 --> 01:00:48,558
that you're breeding since 85 but you're

1965
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,680
actually talking about watering plants

1966
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:51,040
since 85

1967
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:52,719
well that's like i could say i was

1968
01:00:51,039 --> 01:00:54,000
growing a phototron in 85 but i would

1969
01:00:52,719 --> 01:00:55,358
never you know i'm not going to include

1970
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,639
that into my

1971
01:00:55,358 --> 01:01:00,318
my data my starting point of thc's so

1972
01:00:58,639 --> 01:01:02,239
that was my little pet peeve with him

1973
01:01:00,318 --> 01:01:05,358
and then of course it was just the

1974
01:01:02,239 --> 01:01:06,959
the the idea that you know

1975
01:01:05,358 --> 01:01:08,480
like everybody says you know you buy

1976
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:10,159
cups well you don't really buy

1977
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:12,079
cups but you do buy cups it's a

1978
01:01:10,159 --> 01:01:14,480
different way of buying cups it's just

1979
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:15,359
when you if you rent if you rent the

1980
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:18,240
hall

1981
01:01:15,358 --> 01:01:20,078
that the cup is in and you supply the

1982
01:01:18,239 --> 01:01:20,879
hotel rooms for the people when you do

1983
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:22,000
all that well

1984
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,440
you're going to win a cup you know what

1985
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,119
i mean so that's kind of what his angle

1986
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:26,559
was it was just more of the

1987
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:28,400
the obvious way it wasn't there was

1988
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:30,559
never like a here's ten thousand dollars

1989
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:32,000
give me a cup it's pretty much

1990
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:34,400
let me buy you ten thousand dollars with

1991
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,000
the stuff and so i was always felt like

1992
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:38,480
kind of like a high school thing where

1993
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,079
you know stoners versus the jocks that

1994
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:42,719
was when i was a kid that was the way we

1995
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:44,720
we our mentality was and here we are in

1996
01:01:42,719 --> 01:01:46,639
the cannabis world and i'm still felt

1997
01:01:44,719 --> 01:01:49,598
like i was back into that

1998
01:01:46,639 --> 01:01:51,440
high school feeling and i was like wait

1999
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:53,280
a minute so now

2000
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:55,440
i'm back on that but shouldn't the

2001
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:57,519
stoners be in charge of the stoner thing

2002
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:58,159
but again we were kind of like back on

2003
01:01:57,519 --> 01:01:59,358
that

2004
01:01:58,159 --> 01:02:02,399
[Music]

2005
01:01:59,358 --> 01:02:04,400
classification or something yeah

2006
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:06,318
that's um that's an interesting one i

2007
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,680
think i think there might even be a

2008
01:02:06,318 --> 01:02:09,519
written article out there kind of

2009
01:02:07,679 --> 01:02:11,358
talking about what you mentioned and

2010
01:02:09,519 --> 01:02:13,519
the way aryan has obtained a few cups

2011
01:02:11,358 --> 01:02:16,318
over the years by interesting means

2012
01:02:13,519 --> 01:02:18,400
but something i did want to ask you is

2013
01:02:16,318 --> 01:02:18,880
sadly you know franco is no longer with

2014
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,880
us

2015
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:24,318
what do you think that means in regards

2016
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:26,798
to their output of new strains

2017
01:02:24,318 --> 01:02:27,599
well you know i mean the thing is they

2018
01:02:26,798 --> 01:02:29,358
they

2019
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:31,200
definitely lost a good guy because he

2020
01:02:29,358 --> 01:02:33,279
was he's what kind of

2021
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:34,960
grounded them with cannabis again

2022
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:37,200
because at least you had somebody who

2023
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:38,000
you know smoked a lot of weed smoked a

2024
01:02:37,199 --> 01:02:41,679
lot of hash

2025
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:43,679
had her very um was very into it and 100

2026
01:02:41,679 --> 01:02:44,960
kind of you know because that's what you

2027
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:47,919
i mean that's the thing about

2028
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:48,400
anything there's passion out of them

2029
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:50,480
yeah

2030
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:51,920
yeah for sure you know you know out of

2031
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:53,838
like out of the whole crew

2032
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:55,039
you know it's like he was definitely the

2033
01:02:53,838 --> 01:02:58,078
one that kind of connected

2034
01:02:55,039 --> 01:03:00,720
with people better and uh

2035
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:02,720
you know i really think it's it's a sad

2036
01:03:00,719 --> 01:03:04,798
it was sad because the

2037
01:03:02,719 --> 01:03:06,000
the timing of course is the thing about

2038
01:03:04,798 --> 01:03:07,920
you know it's never there's never a good

2039
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,599
time of course but it's also like

2040
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:12,318
just as this whole industry is about to

2041
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:14,480
explode you know uh

2042
01:03:12,318 --> 01:03:15,920
to lose somebody like to lose out on

2043
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:18,000
that it sucks because you don't get a

2044
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:21,599
lot of things i'm sure you wanted to see

2045
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:24,318
um but you know i think

2046
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:25,760
they'll they'll you know the thing about

2047
01:03:24,318 --> 01:03:27,119
them is that a lot of times there's not

2048
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:29,359
a lot there's was never enough

2049
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:32,000
vetting with a lot of their strains you

2050
01:03:29,358 --> 01:03:33,759
know there's a lot of times when

2051
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,480
something was hot i remember when train

2052
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:39,039
wreck was a good example where

2053
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:40,798
a guy brought train wreck to amsterdam

2054
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:42,559
he gave me a cut of it

2055
01:03:40,798 --> 01:03:44,318
and when he after he gave me a cut he

2056
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:46,720
said aryan i just offered him

2057
01:03:44,318 --> 01:03:48,798
like ten thousand gilders for the same

2058
01:03:46,719 --> 01:03:51,038
or euros for the same cut

2059
01:03:48,798 --> 01:03:52,159
and i was like do what you got to do man

2060
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:53,680
you know like

2061
01:03:52,159 --> 01:03:54,960
if you want to sell it to him go ahead

2062
01:03:53,679 --> 01:03:56,078
but it kind of sucks because i thought

2063
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:57,199
we had this deal like you were gonna

2064
01:03:56,079 --> 01:03:58,480
bring it to me and we're gonna work

2065
01:03:57,199 --> 01:04:02,000
together and we're going to

2066
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:02,000
make some something from it you know

2067
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:06,400
and so in the end i know he didn't give

2068
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:07,599
him the train wreck he gave him

2069
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:09,760
something else and quite

2070
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:12,318
called a train wreck you know and aryan

2071
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:15,440
ran with that ball so hard and

2072
01:04:12,318 --> 01:04:16,719
uh kind of put his own foot in his own

2073
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:18,480
mouth when it came to the whole thing

2074
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:20,159
because he

2075
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:21,838
everything he described about it didn't

2076
01:04:20,159 --> 01:04:24,480
make any sense you know what i mean

2077
01:04:21,838 --> 01:04:25,519
he was talking about fat leaves and

2078
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,880
sweet plants

2079
01:04:25,519 --> 01:04:29,358
and and just all these things that were

2080
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:31,760
like no that doesn't smell like train

2081
01:04:29,358 --> 01:04:34,400
wreck you know if you had said

2082
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:35,280
silvery colored leaves and thinner and

2083
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:38,559
short and

2084
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:40,000
fast and kind of a you know mentholated

2085
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:41,200
something smell then you would have been

2086
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,838
like yeah that's the train wreck you

2087
01:04:41,199 --> 01:04:43,838
know what i mean

2088
01:04:41,838 --> 01:04:45,358
so he kind of like there wasn't there

2089
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:47,759
was always this thing of like

2090
01:04:45,358 --> 01:04:49,038
if i just pay somebody a bunch of money

2091
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:50,480
they're going to give me the real deal

2092
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:52,240
and i'm never going to have to you know

2093
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:53,599
and i'll be and i'll be the guy you know

2094
01:04:52,239 --> 01:04:56,239
and i was always like

2095
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:58,318
it helps a lot if you're if you're

2096
01:04:56,239 --> 01:04:59,919
involved and you actually know what

2097
01:04:58,318 --> 01:05:01,358
train wreck was before you put it out

2098
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:02,960
there so in a way like he really kind of

2099
01:05:01,358 --> 01:05:05,440
like [ __ ] himself up there where

2100
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:06,960
even describing the seeds didn't make

2101
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:08,400
sense because if you bread with train

2102
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:10,159
wreck you realize it always produces

2103
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,599
small seeds just the way it is

2104
01:05:10,159 --> 01:05:13,279
it doesn't matter what you do like if

2105
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:14,559
you're i mean maybe if you crossed it

2106
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:16,160
with certain male you might get bigger

2107
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:17,839
seeds but what i've noticed is

2108
01:05:16,159 --> 01:05:19,759
always when i was making seeds of it it

2109
01:05:17,838 --> 01:05:22,239
always came out quite small and dark

2110
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:24,640
and so he was explaining them as these

2111
01:05:22,239 --> 01:05:25,919
gigantic and luscious seeds and so

2112
01:05:24,639 --> 01:05:27,199
as a breeder you're like wow that

2113
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:28,079
doesn't sound like drainage again you

2114
01:05:27,199 --> 01:05:30,000
know so there was

2115
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:32,640
i feel like that's that's you know

2116
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:36,000
something they can learn to maybe do to

2117
01:05:32,639 --> 01:05:37,279
improve their selection but it's a lot

2118
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,719
of the i mean a lot of companies are

2119
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:40,079
gonna a lot of companies just don't care

2120
01:05:38,719 --> 01:05:42,318
at a certain point though too because

2121
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:43,920
their numbers are just so high you know

2122
01:05:42,318 --> 01:05:45,759
so while we're on the topic of selection

2123
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:47,280
what are some of your preferred methods

2124
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:49,200
for selecting a good male you know do

2125
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:50,720
you have like a go-to

2126
01:05:49,199 --> 01:05:52,719
it like a lot of people say you know

2127
01:05:50,719 --> 01:05:54,318
they love the stem of good stem rubs a

2128
01:05:52,719 --> 01:05:56,480
really good indication to them what are

2129
01:05:54,318 --> 01:05:59,679
some of the things you use

2130
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:01,920
um i mean the the late flowering males

2131
01:05:59,679 --> 01:06:03,519
that have uh i mean obviously smells

2132
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,798
important that's your first thing first

2133
01:06:03,519 --> 01:06:05,199
thing would be smell that's how you kind

2134
01:06:04,798 --> 01:06:09,199
of like

2135
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:12,399
even decide to think about it after that

2136
01:06:09,199 --> 01:06:14,159
it's a lot of visual cues um

2137
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:15,440
later flowering ones are better that

2138
01:06:14,159 --> 01:06:18,318
they don't put

2139
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:19,440
they don't finish out too quick um the

2140
01:06:18,318 --> 01:06:23,038
uh

2141
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:27,599
trike development is also important um

2142
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:29,599
the uh the uh like bulletproofness

2143
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:31,599
you know and also what i look for is

2144
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:33,440
like a rubbery quality to them like

2145
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:35,039
sometimes you get like papery plants and

2146
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:36,559
sometimes you get rubbery plants that's

2147
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:40,079
kind of how i would judge them

2148
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:41,280
and the papery ones tend to produce more

2149
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:44,079
harsh and not such

2150
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:45,680
nice plants that burn kind of weird and

2151
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:48,000
the ones that are more rubbery

2152
01:06:45,679 --> 01:06:49,118
tend to be more like they burn slower

2153
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,960
and oilier and they

2154
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:52,559
have a vibe to them so usually go for

2155
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:55,440
like a male that has a

2156
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:56,720
kind of a rubbery quality to it um

2157
01:06:55,440 --> 01:07:00,000
resilient

2158
01:06:56,719 --> 01:07:04,558
uh late flowering

2159
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:06,000
trikes help usually and uh

2160
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:08,000
yeah you know what else is uh i mean i

2161
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:11,760
haven't done it too much i've

2162
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:13,199
but the uh you can some

2163
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:16,240
if you take if you do like collodial

2164
01:07:13,199 --> 01:07:20,000
silver treatment and kind of

2165
01:07:16,239 --> 01:07:21,679
try to flip them to get an idea of what

2166
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,599
they might be like as a female

2167
01:07:21,679 --> 01:07:25,038
um haven't done that a lot though that

2168
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:26,559
that's a more recent development which

2169
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:28,079
i've done in a few rounds

2170
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:30,160
just because it was like oh well [ __ ] i

2171
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:32,880
don't really do feminized

2172
01:07:30,159 --> 01:07:34,798
normally but it is a good way to test

2173
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:37,440
the uh

2174
01:07:34,798 --> 01:07:38,559
to test the sort of the ability of the

2175
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:40,960
plant to

2176
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:42,240
resist hermaphroditism in general you

2177
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:45,199
know so like if the plant

2178
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:46,879
is easily flipped where it just

2179
01:07:45,199 --> 01:07:48,879
instantly goes then it's almost like a

2180
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:50,720
bad sign you know it's like a

2181
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:53,358
that shows you that it doesn't take much

2182
01:07:50,719 --> 01:07:55,199
to to convert that plant into to make

2183
01:07:53,358 --> 01:07:56,960
that plant go herby on you

2184
01:07:55,199 --> 01:07:58,558
and that's as a male i mean that's the

2185
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:00,639
thing is with males it's really about

2186
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:02,240
numbers though too like a lot of people

2187
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:03,759
they bank too much on one particular

2188
01:08:02,239 --> 01:08:04,798
male and unless you know it has been

2189
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:09,200
tried and true

2190
01:08:04,798 --> 01:08:12,559
it's actually better to uh sort of

2191
01:08:09,199 --> 01:08:14,719
uh hit up hit up like

2192
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:16,400
one female with say three or four males

2193
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:19,920
maybe even five males

2194
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:20,479
and uh keep your numbers small on your

2195
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:23,039
original

2196
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:24,479
round and then go through all of those

2197
01:08:23,039 --> 01:08:26,640
because

2198
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:28,479
people think a lot of times especially

2199
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:29,920
when it comes to males too it's like

2200
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:31,678
you know they're really really focusing

2201
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:32,158
on the females and then they're like oh

2202
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:33,440
okay

2203
01:08:32,158 --> 01:08:34,879
but i got one male and then they're

2204
01:08:33,439 --> 01:08:36,158
going to use that on everything and it's

2205
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:37,920
like there's a lot to

2206
01:08:36,158 --> 01:08:39,198
it's 50 of the information you know i

2207
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:42,239
mean so if you're

2208
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:44,158
if you're not 100 sure that that male is

2209
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:47,198
a stable one you're kind of

2210
01:08:44,158 --> 01:08:48,639
shooting in the dark at that point yeah

2211
01:08:47,198 --> 01:08:50,158
okay that's actually a really

2212
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:52,798
interesting idea i haven't heard before

2213
01:08:50,158 --> 01:08:56,000
but it certainly makes a lot of sense

2214
01:08:52,798 --> 01:08:58,719
yeah well the thing is it's a lot like

2215
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,119
you know if you like i heard um i heard

2216
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:00,798
that

2217
01:08:59,119 --> 01:09:03,679
like the cookie fam is trying to find a

2218
01:09:00,798 --> 01:09:05,198
male and they've gone through like 1500

2219
01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:06,960
males to try to they're still not happy

2220
01:09:05,198 --> 01:09:08,000
with anything and that's kind of the way

2221
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:10,079
you have to be you know i mean you

2222
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:13,439
really have to be super duper

2223
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:14,798
uh skeptical when it comes to males

2224
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:16,559
and the problem is a lot of times people

2225
01:09:14,798 --> 01:09:18,319
like the key is to flower them out

2226
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:20,000
completely

2227
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:21,440
before you select them and that's really

2228
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,640
hard for a lot of people to do because

2229
01:09:21,439 --> 01:09:26,158
they usually are

2230
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:28,400
are trying to

2231
01:09:26,158 --> 01:09:29,759
use the original time that they flower

2232
01:09:28,399 --> 01:09:31,759
it like the very beginning of the

2233
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:34,079
flowering to use that in a breeding

2234
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:35,520
project and usually what i'll do is keep

2235
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:37,039
my mails completely separate have a

2236
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:38,960
whole room full of males

2237
01:09:37,039 --> 01:09:40,158
and let them go really till the end

2238
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:41,920
until they're like

2239
01:09:40,158 --> 01:09:43,039
withering almost and then you can kind

2240
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,920
of get to the point where you can really

2241
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:45,759
see the

2242
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:48,399
blood structure of them and then you can

2243
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:52,238
collect plenty of pollen to do

2244
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:53,920
a small run you know and then that way

2245
01:09:52,238 --> 01:09:55,678
the pollen that you're collecting is not

2246
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:58,719
the root because the problem is

2247
01:09:55,679 --> 01:10:02,000
in the very very first flowers to go off

2248
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:02,399
is not as is not the best pollen you

2249
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,439
know

2250
01:10:02,399 --> 01:10:06,399
that pollen is is usually not quite

2251
01:10:05,439 --> 01:10:09,359
matured enough

2252
01:10:06,399 --> 01:10:10,879
and it's kind of like a pre-flower thing

2253
01:10:09,359 --> 01:10:12,399
and so i usually wait until

2254
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:14,480
they're really like dumping dumping

2255
01:10:12,399 --> 01:10:15,920
dumping then i'll collect

2256
01:10:14,479 --> 01:10:18,079
a little bit of pollen from those and

2257
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:19,840
then use that on my first round

2258
01:10:18,079 --> 01:10:21,039
that's and then once i know though if

2259
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,520
it's a different story if i know that

2260
01:10:21,039 --> 01:10:23,840
like if

2261
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:25,679
it's a male that's tried and true i'll

2262
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:28,319
put the plant in the room

2263
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:29,920
to make seeds i don't brush those like

2264
01:10:28,319 --> 01:10:31,359
if i'm doing production i let the plants

2265
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:33,760
just do their thing

2266
01:10:31,359 --> 01:10:35,279
way better results than trying to do it

2267
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:36,320
by hand you know but if i'm gonna do a

2268
01:10:35,279 --> 01:10:38,319
test run like when i'm

2269
01:10:36,319 --> 01:10:39,840
trying to figure out a meal i'll do all

2270
01:10:38,319 --> 01:10:42,319
those by hand because it's

2271
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:43,520
it's stupid to try to make ten thousand

2272
01:10:42,319 --> 01:10:45,359
seeds just to

2273
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:47,440
figure out that they're not good you're

2274
01:10:45,359 --> 01:10:50,399
like well that's a big waste of energy

2275
01:10:47,439 --> 01:10:51,198
so that's kind of the idea from the way

2276
01:10:50,399 --> 01:10:54,559
we do

2277
01:10:51,198 --> 01:10:55,919
yeah okay and so i mean that's another

2278
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:57,520
interesting idea with the

2279
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:59,440
the immature pole and haven't heard that

2280
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:00,800
one either but one i want to kind of

2281
01:10:59,439 --> 01:11:02,799
look into myself

2282
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:04,239
the question i want to ask though when

2283
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:06,400
you do do your pollinations

2284
01:11:04,238 --> 01:11:08,559
do you put the male and the female in

2285
01:11:06,399 --> 01:11:09,599
the room together from day one or do you

2286
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:12,000
like to stagger

2287
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:13,600
no i stagger it usually um it depends

2288
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,279
though like if it's a

2289
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:17,120
normal like eight or nine weaker then

2290
01:11:15,279 --> 01:11:19,679
i'll stagger it by about a week

2291
01:11:17,119 --> 01:11:21,198
if it's um like a ten or twelve weaker

2292
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:24,399
then i'll stagger it by about

2293
01:11:21,198 --> 01:11:26,799
two and a half three weeks um and but

2294
01:11:24,399 --> 01:11:30,238
then you know what i'd usually do is

2295
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:31,760
uh like there's there's certain plants

2296
01:11:30,238 --> 01:11:33,039
so that i know that i just have to have

2297
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:34,800
done it a few times i'll be like you

2298
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:36,399
know what

2299
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:39,119
i almost do the opposite i'll have to

2300
01:11:36,399 --> 01:11:40,559
flower the male before because if i wait

2301
01:11:39,119 --> 01:11:43,359
two if i try to put them in the room the

2302
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:45,440
same time they'll end up uh

2303
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:46,639
coming in late pollinating late and then

2304
01:11:45,439 --> 01:11:48,000
you end up with a lot less

2305
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:50,239
mature you end up with like a whole

2306
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,560
bunch of those half the seeds of the

2307
01:11:50,238 --> 01:11:55,279
flat bottoms and white seeds

2308
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:56,400
and you know that's just driving that so

2309
01:11:55,279 --> 01:11:58,719
in a way i'd

2310
01:11:56,399 --> 01:12:00,000
i tell i'd rather be on early than late

2311
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:01,279
like i hate it when the

2312
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,960
when they get pollinated and they've

2313
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:04,000
already hit on like say four or five

2314
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:05,679
weeks

2315
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,119
there's just not enough time you need a

2316
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:09,520
good six

2317
01:12:07,119 --> 01:12:11,039
solid weeks to produce seeds you know

2318
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:12,560
what i mean that's how i feel like if

2319
01:12:11,039 --> 01:12:15,840
there's less than six weeks i feel like

2320
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:16,880
i'm undercooking them you know yeah for

2321
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:19,440
sure

2322
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:22,159
and so on the james bean interview he

2323
01:12:19,439 --> 01:12:25,119
referenced that you might be doing

2324
01:12:22,158 --> 01:12:25,679
a little project in the future whereby

2325
01:12:25,119 --> 01:12:27,679
you're

2326
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:29,199
releasing some pollen in combination

2327
01:12:27,679 --> 01:12:31,359
with a few different crosses is that

2328
01:12:29,198 --> 01:12:34,000
something that's still going to go ahead

2329
01:12:31,359 --> 01:12:34,479
it is but not as quickly as i thought

2330
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:38,479
actually

2331
01:12:34,479 --> 01:12:41,198
um that i had i had uh

2332
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:43,519
my one of my one of my projects get sort

2333
01:12:41,198 --> 01:12:47,279
of stifled in the middle of it uh

2334
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:49,280
i lost uh i lost a particular place

2335
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:50,399
just like we do to the man himself

2336
01:12:49,279 --> 01:12:50,960
because like a lot of my breeding

2337
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:52,319
projects

2338
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:53,520
all my breeding projects are underground

2339
01:12:52,319 --> 01:12:54,399
still you know what i mean because i

2340
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:57,520
don't

2341
01:12:54,399 --> 01:12:59,359
trust any i can't do it in a facility

2342
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:01,120
because of the protocols are so extreme

2343
01:12:59,359 --> 01:13:03,039
that it's just

2344
01:13:01,119 --> 01:13:04,559
how am i gonna get you know i can't even

2345
01:13:03,039 --> 01:13:05,920
work with my material because all of a

2346
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:07,520
sudden

2347
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:09,440
every little gram of the material

2348
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:10,000
whether it be seed or stem or whatever

2349
01:13:09,439 --> 01:13:12,879
is all

2350
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,600
being organized and classified so so i

2351
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:15,039
do everything

2352
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:18,320
still on the underground which puts me

2353
01:13:15,039 --> 01:13:20,399
at risk and unfortunately the

2354
01:13:18,319 --> 01:13:21,519
that particular project which is called

2355
01:13:20,399 --> 01:13:24,000
everybody loves bodhi

2356
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:25,360
and i i took some bodhi body had given

2357
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,359
me um

2358
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:28,719
a tester of something that he hadn't

2359
01:13:27,359 --> 01:13:31,359
released yet which was

2360
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:32,880
uh called jasmine cat piss it was a snow

2361
01:13:31,359 --> 01:13:36,799
lotus hybrid

2362
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:38,880
um and i got a really

2363
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:40,400
consistent batch like everything on it

2364
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:41,920
was just like the males and the females

2365
01:13:40,399 --> 01:13:45,519
looked almost identical

2366
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:46,640
um so i took two males i only had 12

2367
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:48,080
plants to begin with

2368
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:49,679
or 12 seeds to begin with and out of

2369
01:13:48,079 --> 01:13:50,800
those 12 seeds i got like nine plants i

2370
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:53,440
believe and then

2371
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:54,719
from those two good meals and then the

2372
01:13:53,439 --> 01:13:55,678
rest a couple males that were a little

2373
01:13:54,719 --> 01:13:59,760
bit

2374
01:13:55,679 --> 01:14:03,119
wonky but uh ended up with this one male

2375
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:04,400
short fat trikey for you know really

2376
01:14:03,119 --> 01:14:08,079
decent little plant

2377
01:14:04,399 --> 01:14:09,439
um and that male i managed to keep the

2378
01:14:08,079 --> 01:14:11,279
male i was lucky because even though i

2379
01:14:09,439 --> 01:14:14,079
lost the the place

2380
01:14:11,279 --> 01:14:14,719
uh because it's colorado they like they

2381
01:14:14,079 --> 01:14:18,000
let you

2382
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:19,600
they left 36 of the smallest

2383
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,560
clones basically they they took

2384
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:24,719
everything else so they uh

2385
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:26,480
but kind it's always funny because when

2386
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:27,760
you're like compared to what it used to

2387
01:14:26,479 --> 01:14:29,039
be back in the day they take everything

2388
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:30,320
right take all your lights take all your

2389
01:14:29,039 --> 01:14:32,079
plants take everything

2390
01:14:30,319 --> 01:14:34,000
this time it was like they took all your

2391
01:14:32,079 --> 01:14:36,079
plants but they said oh you have a you

2392
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,279
have a

2393
01:14:36,079 --> 01:14:39,600
you have a medical record you have a

2394
01:14:37,279 --> 01:14:40,960
medical card for 36 so we'll leave you

2395
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:42,320
with 36 but we're going to leave you

2396
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:45,359
with the smallest 36

2397
01:14:42,319 --> 01:14:47,840
and luckily one of those was the mail

2398
01:14:45,359 --> 01:14:48,719
that i was going to use for the pollen

2399
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:50,880
my mate

2400
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:52,399
but but there's not enough time for for

2401
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:54,480
this particular round so

2402
01:14:52,399 --> 01:14:56,158
um yes the idea on the everybody loves

2403
01:14:54,479 --> 01:14:59,839
bodhi project was

2404
01:14:56,158 --> 01:15:01,359
to do um a sort of open-ended breeding

2405
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:03,600
project and then that way

2406
01:15:01,359 --> 01:15:05,039
whoever i was going to do a short amount

2407
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:08,320
like i said maybe maybe

2408
01:15:05,039 --> 01:15:11,840
30 of these and then the idea would be

2409
01:15:08,319 --> 01:15:15,198
you have a bunch of f1s

2410
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:18,560
a a few less but a bunch of

2411
01:15:15,198 --> 01:15:21,678
f2s and a couple f3s

2412
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:23,920
and then the pollen that i used on the

2413
01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:27,039
original f1 crosses

2414
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:28,399
so that way you could take that project

2415
01:15:27,039 --> 01:15:29,119
and go backwards with it a little bit

2416
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:31,359
and go you know

2417
01:15:29,119 --> 01:15:33,599
the idea would be as breeders you buy it

2418
01:15:31,359 --> 01:15:35,759
you have all these seeds to go through

2419
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:37,360
and you have the original pollen off the

2420
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:38,000
male that i use so that you can always

2421
01:15:37,359 --> 01:15:40,880
go and use

2422
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,880
your own back roses

2423
01:15:41,039 --> 01:15:45,439
i thought it'd be fun because i wanted

2424
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:47,199
to because bodhi's

2425
01:15:45,439 --> 01:15:48,799
way of growing or way of breeding is a

2426
01:15:47,198 --> 01:15:50,079
little bit um i wouldn't say it's

2427
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:52,800
different but he definitely

2428
01:15:50,079 --> 01:15:54,238
kind of does that on his own he has this

2429
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:56,480
he does everything to f2

2430
01:15:54,238 --> 01:15:57,439
and then he leaves it at that and then

2431
01:15:56,479 --> 01:16:00,559
you as a

2432
01:15:57,439 --> 01:16:02,158
grower get

2433
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:03,280
kind of like you're to me it's sort of

2434
01:16:02,158 --> 01:16:04,639
like you're in the middle you know i

2435
01:16:03,279 --> 01:16:05,359
mean you're not quite there you need to

2436
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:10,560
go

2437
01:16:05,359 --> 01:16:14,079
like f1s are a little bit more explosive

2438
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:16,640
f2s are a little bit more uh

2439
01:16:14,079 --> 01:16:17,439
you start to get into like camps eight

2440
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:19,199
you know you have

2441
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:20,719
the two different you'll have more

2442
01:16:19,198 --> 01:16:22,399
phenotypical

2443
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:23,840
exp well you have less phenotypical

2444
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:25,119
expression as you would in the f1 but

2445
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:28,239
you'll have

2446
01:16:25,119 --> 01:16:29,279
groups you know that are more defined so

2447
01:16:28,238 --> 01:16:30,559
i kind of just thought

2448
01:16:29,279 --> 01:16:32,079
so it's kind of like a different way of

2449
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:33,440
looking at it and the idea was that

2450
01:16:32,079 --> 01:16:34,559
you'd have to buy the whole thing you

2451
01:16:33,439 --> 01:16:38,079
know i mean you buy

2452
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:40,000
so you you buy the uh a couple hundred

2453
01:16:38,079 --> 01:16:43,760
seeds at one given time so you have

2454
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:45,600
these projects that are then i wanted to

2455
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:46,640
i mostly wanted to do it to see what

2456
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,520
direction people would take them you

2457
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:50,320
know

2458
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:51,600
that way and then tell everybody these

2459
01:16:50,319 --> 01:16:53,039
are all you can use

2460
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:54,640
all this stuff do whatever you want with

2461
01:16:53,039 --> 01:16:57,920
it i'm not gonna

2462
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:59,440
not trying to isolate

2463
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:01,119
it and tell you anybody you can't use it

2464
01:16:59,439 --> 01:17:02,559
because also is from bodhi and then i

2465
01:17:01,119 --> 01:17:05,840
wanted to give 25

2466
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:06,640
of that to the charity of bodhi's choice

2467
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:09,840
which he

2468
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:10,960
chose a group from oaxaca uh there's a

2469
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:14,159
place down in oaxaca

2470
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:14,480
which uh he would hand deliver the the

2471
01:17:14,158 --> 01:17:15,599
check

2472
01:17:14,479 --> 01:17:18,559
so we're gonna do it but i'm probably

2473
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:18,560
gonna do it next year cause

2474
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,600
it's one of those things where you can't

2475
01:17:20,238 --> 01:17:22,079
can't release that kind of a project

2476
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:24,480
without

2477
01:17:22,079 --> 01:17:26,079
feeling like it's uh it's where it's

2478
01:17:24,479 --> 01:17:28,158
supposed to be

2479
01:17:26,079 --> 01:17:29,600
yeah and do you see this as being a

2480
01:17:28,158 --> 01:17:30,000
common thing in the future because we

2481
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:31,600
have seen

2482
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,198
a few little pollen releases here and

2483
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:36,400
there is this again

2484
01:17:33,198 --> 01:17:37,439
oh yeah on board the next wave well you

2485
01:17:36,399 --> 01:17:39,519
know i think it's definitely going to

2486
01:17:37,439 --> 01:17:42,639
happen because the reality is

2487
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:43,120
um that is that like when i do whenever

2488
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:45,039
i

2489
01:17:43,119 --> 01:17:46,158
have a question and answer thing at a

2490
01:17:45,039 --> 01:17:48,079
seminar or something that's

2491
01:17:46,158 --> 01:17:50,639
one of the main questions is selecting

2492
01:17:48,079 --> 01:17:52,479
males and

2493
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:55,600
because we've all shared all these

2494
01:17:52,479 --> 01:17:58,000
common female plants over the years

2495
01:17:55,600 --> 01:18:00,400
very very few breeders share males and

2496
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:02,319
if they do

2497
01:18:00,399 --> 01:18:03,439
it gets usually it's like so for

2498
01:18:02,319 --> 01:18:07,119
instance like a good example

2499
01:18:03,439 --> 01:18:08,719
is the g13 haze male that soma uses on a

2500
01:18:07,119 --> 01:18:11,760
lot of his crosses

2501
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:12,000
he gave that same male to dna who then

2502
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:13,679
used

2503
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,359
it in a bunch of their crosses who then

2504
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:17,199
gave it to paradise seeds he used it in

2505
01:18:15,359 --> 01:18:20,399
their crosses who gave it to

2506
01:18:17,198 --> 01:18:22,639
you know everybody like every uh

2507
01:18:20,399 --> 01:18:23,759
delta nine used that same male and a

2508
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:24,800
bunch of their crosses you know it's

2509
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:26,560
just like kind of like

2510
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:28,159
and so for me that was like completely

2511
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:30,159
off limits i was like i will never use

2512
01:18:28,158 --> 01:18:31,759
that nail because then we're all

2513
01:18:30,158 --> 01:18:33,519
you know we're all in the same boat

2514
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:34,960
whereas the females had no problem

2515
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:36,239
everybody can use the same female but as

2516
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,880
long as there's a different male in the

2517
01:18:36,238 --> 01:18:38,079
mix it

2518
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:40,159
kind of puts everybody in their own

2519
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:41,840
direction so i think that's been kind of

2520
01:18:40,158 --> 01:18:42,960
the main reason why everybody hasn't

2521
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,920
been doing it because they'll kind of

2522
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:47,920
want to keep their

2523
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:50,239
their thing unique but i also see that

2524
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:52,960
people are willing to pay because you

2525
01:18:50,238 --> 01:18:56,639
know half a gram of pollen is plenty

2526
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:58,158
you can do a lot of damage with that so

2527
01:18:56,640 --> 01:19:00,239
you know the market will dictate where

2528
01:18:58,158 --> 01:19:01,839
it goes and i just think there hasn't

2529
01:19:00,238 --> 01:19:04,079
been enough breeders out there to make

2530
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:05,600
it worth it but nowadays

2531
01:19:04,079 --> 01:19:08,158
since everybody's a breeder just like

2532
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:10,400
everybody was a dj you know it's like

2533
01:19:08,158 --> 01:19:11,679
everybody's a podcaster i just happen to

2534
01:19:10,399 --> 01:19:14,479
be all three right

2535
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:15,039
um but yeah it's like it's kind of the

2536
01:19:14,479 --> 01:19:17,359
uh

2537
01:19:15,039 --> 01:19:18,079
it is kind of uh inevitable that that's

2538
01:19:17,359 --> 01:19:19,839
going to become

2539
01:19:18,079 --> 01:19:22,319
another baseball i think you know who

2540
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:25,920
else is doing that was um dj

2541
01:19:22,319 --> 01:19:28,158
short son i think was doing a jd yeah

2542
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:30,000
yeah something i was interested in those

2543
01:19:28,158 --> 01:19:30,719
i've been thinking about this idea a lot

2544
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,439
and

2545
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:34,960
obviously not quite entirely related to

2546
01:19:33,439 --> 01:19:35,439
the pollen idea because probably a lot

2547
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:37,679
of

2548
01:19:35,439 --> 01:19:39,119
more new breeders so to speak aspiring

2549
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:39,760
breed is going to be people interested

2550
01:19:39,119 --> 01:19:41,920
in that

2551
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:42,880
as for like top end breeders already

2552
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:44,319
selling seeds

2553
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:45,920
they're probably less likely to be

2554
01:19:44,319 --> 01:19:47,840
buying that pollen but

2555
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:49,679
the question remains you know given you

2556
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:50,079
just highlighted how males from other

2557
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:52,560
people

2558
01:19:50,079 --> 01:19:54,559
do get used do you think it's it's a bit

2559
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:55,920
of a stretch to call yourself a breeder

2560
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:57,679
in that situation because

2561
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:59,520
i think fundamentally when you break it

2562
01:19:57,679 --> 01:20:01,119
down being a breeder means there's some

2563
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:02,960
form of selection involved

2564
01:20:01,119 --> 01:20:04,640
so if you were just to use a male from

2565
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:06,399
someone else you didn't select it

2566
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:08,560
and then like a clone only like where's

2567
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:10,879
the selection taking place

2568
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:12,320
yeah no i mean again that you're a

2569
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:13,760
replicator at that point that's what i

2570
01:20:12,319 --> 01:20:15,119
used to that that was my other little

2571
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:16,560
joke i used to do with aria and i was

2572
01:20:15,119 --> 01:20:18,238
like ariane you're not a breeder you're

2573
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,960
a replicator you know because that's all

2574
01:20:18,238 --> 01:20:20,718
you're doing is

2575
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:22,719
replicating other work that other people

2576
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:24,399
have done um but i kind of feel like

2577
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:26,399
that is uh

2578
01:20:24,399 --> 01:20:28,399
yeah that's a different class because it

2579
01:20:26,399 --> 01:20:30,638
again it's it's like the um

2580
01:20:28,399 --> 01:20:32,079
it's like the meme where i forgot

2581
01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:32,560
exactly how it goes but it was like you

2582
01:20:32,079 --> 01:20:34,158
know

2583
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:35,679
i need two like the guy that was under

2584
01:20:34,158 --> 01:20:37,599
the car and the game and he's like i

2585
01:20:35,679 --> 01:20:39,760
need i need two packs of this and

2586
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:40,960
like whatever and stickers and and i've

2587
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:42,159
done less you know i've made a seed

2588
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:43,279
company out of less that's kind of where

2589
01:20:42,158 --> 01:20:44,238
we're at where

2590
01:20:43,279 --> 01:20:46,800
you know and that's one of the things

2591
01:20:44,238 --> 01:20:48,319
where you notice you see people's gears

2592
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:50,320
turning when they're when the first time

2593
01:20:48,319 --> 01:20:51,920
they're understanding like

2594
01:20:50,319 --> 01:20:53,519
that people are paying money for these

2595
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:54,639
beans and

2596
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:56,320
oh well if they're paying that much

2597
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:57,520
money then i should do this you know and

2598
01:20:56,319 --> 01:20:58,799
that that's definitely not the

2599
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:01,440
inspiration that you need

2600
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:02,159
the inspiration should be you know you

2601
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:04,638
you want to

2602
01:21:02,158 --> 01:21:05,359
uh you love the plant enough that you

2603
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:08,400
can

2604
01:21:05,359 --> 01:21:10,799
yeah take the energy to to

2605
01:21:08,399 --> 01:21:12,238
waste a bunch of time and and to get to

2606
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:13,600
a point and that's that's

2607
01:21:12,238 --> 01:21:15,039
it's never on the first round you know

2608
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:16,480
what i mean that's like that's one of

2609
01:21:15,039 --> 01:21:17,840
the reasons also why this whole everyone

2610
01:21:16,479 --> 01:21:20,959
loves bodhi project i'm like

2611
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:23,360
okay i'm not i'm not as content

2612
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:24,560
yet with where i'm at you know i want to

2613
01:21:23,359 --> 01:21:26,238
take it to the next level what i am

2614
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:28,639
going to do though is

2615
01:21:26,238 --> 01:21:30,319
a line called sagemaster select which is

2616
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:33,920
the the bigger picture

2617
01:21:30,319 --> 01:21:37,039
um i'll have my first round of uh

2618
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:38,079
of things coming on the uh at the

2619
01:21:37,039 --> 01:21:40,880
emerald cup

2620
01:21:38,079 --> 01:21:42,000
so i'll have six crosses i'll have six

2621
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:44,960
crosses i have a male

2622
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:46,000
uh sage male that that we selected here

2623
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:48,639
from

2624
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:49,920
uh that's like a green onion it's got

2625
01:21:48,639 --> 01:21:52,800
like a green onion

2626
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:54,158
flavor to it uh that imparts on

2627
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:56,960
everything which is really nice

2628
01:21:54,158 --> 01:21:58,719
and it's kind of a it's kind of like

2629
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:02,319
somewhere between garlic bud

2630
01:21:58,719 --> 01:22:04,158
and onion flavor which uh is a little

2631
01:22:02,319 --> 01:22:06,559
a little bit different than the original

2632
01:22:04,158 --> 01:22:10,960
sage which has more of a sandalwood vibe

2633
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:14,800
but it's amazingly vigorous

2634
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:16,000
uh and i've just did six crosses well

2635
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:17,279
i've done a bunch but i did a bunch more

2636
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,319
but i got six that have selected out

2637
01:22:17,279 --> 01:22:20,238
that i'm gonna or

2638
01:22:18,319 --> 01:22:21,840
on that i'm gonna bring into uh the

2639
01:22:20,238 --> 01:22:24,718
hammer cup this year

2640
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:26,560
yeah awesome so one question that we got

2641
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:28,560
sent in a lot was and one i kind of

2642
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:32,000
looked into was interested in myself

2643
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:34,080
on the thc site it says um that you guys

2644
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:36,399
have won a few cups with the underdog

2645
01:22:34,079 --> 01:22:38,399
kush how does that one differ from

2646
01:22:36,399 --> 01:22:40,879
lumpers underdog is it is it different

2647
01:22:38,399 --> 01:22:41,599
it's different it's different yeah um

2648
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:43,920
yeah

2649
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:45,600
john and i had that we we as a moment in

2650
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:47,279
time a classic where you know we

2651
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:48,880
we didn't know each other but i kept

2652
01:22:47,279 --> 01:22:50,079
hearing from people like yeah lump was

2653
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:51,520
mad because

2654
01:22:50,079 --> 01:22:53,760
you know the underdog thing and i was

2655
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:57,280
like oh okay that was actually

2656
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:59,199
uh because i i had okay here

2657
01:22:57,279 --> 01:23:01,198
it's it's a weird it's a it's a it's a

2658
01:22:59,198 --> 01:23:02,479
it's a weird one too so basically i got

2659
01:23:01,198 --> 01:23:07,198
underdog from uh

2660
01:23:02,479 --> 01:23:10,238
from jj and aj about nine years ago

2661
01:23:07,198 --> 01:23:14,399
and i got it with i got guava cam

2662
01:23:10,238 --> 01:23:17,439
underdog corey haim cut

2663
01:23:14,399 --> 01:23:19,439
and so it's two different star dogs this

2664
01:23:17,439 --> 01:23:24,638
the regular star dog and the cory game

2665
01:23:19,439 --> 01:23:29,359
cut and lumpa

2666
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:32,960
i think lumpus is like a sour kush

2667
01:23:29,359 --> 01:23:37,119
cross more and it

2668
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:38,960
so he and he named his underdog cush

2669
01:23:37,119 --> 01:23:40,880
and then the problem was that okay so

2670
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:45,039
ours was just the underdog

2671
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:47,600
and then my partner doug in amsterdam he

2672
01:23:45,039 --> 01:23:49,519
he basically put kush behind anything

2673
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:52,560
that had og in it or kush

2674
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:53,520
because the customer base in holland

2675
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:55,280
like they just all

2676
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:57,360
that was the hype word of the year you

2677
01:23:55,279 --> 01:23:58,079
know gosh if it doesn't have cush we

2678
01:23:57,359 --> 01:24:00,639
don't want it

2679
01:23:58,079 --> 01:24:02,399
so because when he called it underdog

2680
01:24:00,639 --> 01:24:05,600
people didn't get it you know uh

2681
01:24:02,399 --> 01:24:07,920
yeah so it was really like a named

2682
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:09,760
put on it to for selling points more

2683
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:12,079
than and not just because

2684
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:14,840
it had cush in it but it just was or it

2685
01:24:12,079 --> 01:24:17,679
didn't even have cushion it was

2686
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:20,400
underdog which that's and that's the

2687
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:22,880
funny part about the whole

2688
01:24:20,399 --> 01:24:24,000
when i first got kush and i first got

2689
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:27,359
sour which was in

2690
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:29,198
about 99 uh i brought him back from

2691
01:24:27,359 --> 01:24:30,399
from from the states and i brought it to

2692
01:24:29,198 --> 01:24:33,198
amsterdam

2693
01:24:30,399 --> 01:24:34,879
and when i got there i had wrapped them

2694
01:24:33,198 --> 01:24:35,359
i'd put them into groups and i'd wrapped

2695
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:38,880
them with

2696
01:24:35,359 --> 01:24:42,238
uh one of those uh garbage bag

2697
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:44,480
things you know little zip ties and uh

2698
01:24:42,238 --> 01:24:45,599
i'd wrapped them into two groups and

2699
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:46,638
then i wrote on them

2700
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:48,400
and just didn't know how you know how

2701
01:24:46,639 --> 01:24:50,079
small that area is i'm like wrote with a

2702
01:24:48,399 --> 01:24:53,599
permanent marker like

2703
01:24:50,079 --> 01:24:54,880
og on one and then sd on the other one

2704
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:56,560
and when i got there i couldn't [ __ ]

2705
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:57,199
read them quickly i could not read i was

2706
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:58,639
like oh what

2707
01:24:57,198 --> 01:25:00,638
oh i don't know which ones are which but

2708
01:24:58,639 --> 01:25:01,840
i'll figure it out then i grew them out

2709
01:25:00,639 --> 01:25:04,000
and

2710
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:05,520
they're damn close you know what i mean

2711
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,719
when you don't really know what's going

2712
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:09,199
on like you have no idea

2713
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:11,279
had zero and the funny part was that our

2714
01:25:09,198 --> 01:25:12,000
uh that soma had completely [ __ ] up my

2715
01:25:11,279 --> 01:25:14,079
head when it came

2716
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:16,079
to the to the diesels because he had

2717
01:25:14,079 --> 01:25:19,679
came up with his diesel which was

2718
01:25:16,079 --> 01:25:22,479
purple and grapefruit smelling and just

2719
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:23,279
had nothing to do with sour diesel and

2720
01:25:22,479 --> 01:25:25,279
so

2721
01:25:23,279 --> 01:25:26,559
i'd only heard about sour diesel even

2722
01:25:25,279 --> 01:25:28,079
though my friends who were the ones who

2723
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:30,560
were growing it back in

2724
01:25:28,079 --> 01:25:31,359
the states that i met when i was in

2725
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:32,400
amsterdam

2726
01:25:31,359 --> 01:25:34,158
they never brought it with them they

2727
01:25:32,399 --> 01:25:36,638
were always scared to fly into amsterdam

2728
01:25:34,158 --> 01:25:39,679
with weed you know

2729
01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:41,279
and so until 99

2730
01:25:39,679 --> 01:25:43,679
until i actually went and got the cuts i

2731
01:25:41,279 --> 01:25:46,000
didn't ever try it so

2732
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:47,039
i flew back i got the cuts flew back

2733
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,359
grew him out

2734
01:25:47,039 --> 01:25:51,359
and it took me like a good two runs

2735
01:25:49,359 --> 01:25:52,399
before i was 100 convinced like this is

2736
01:25:51,359 --> 01:25:55,039
sour diesel

2737
01:25:52,399 --> 01:25:56,479
that is the kush um now i can see the

2738
01:25:55,039 --> 01:25:57,840
difference obviously and now it's like

2739
01:25:56,479 --> 01:25:59,359
totally like i

2740
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:01,360
now i see when other people don't see

2741
01:25:59,359 --> 01:26:04,000
the difference but

2742
01:26:01,359 --> 01:26:05,519
um the whole underdog story got a little

2743
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:09,840
bit confusing too because

2744
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:09,840
there was um

2745
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:16,319
uh you know there was like that version

2746
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:19,679
that he had he put out and then

2747
01:26:16,319 --> 01:26:20,719
i guess those guys lost like aj and jj

2748
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:24,480
and everybody lost

2749
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:27,198
that original one and so

2750
01:26:24,479 --> 01:26:28,479
when i put out then when i finally got

2751
01:26:27,198 --> 01:26:30,799
jj

2752
01:26:28,479 --> 01:26:32,479
to look at the underdog that i had he

2753
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:33,840
claimed it was the corey haim cut so now

2754
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:36,559
it got really confusing i was like wait

2755
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:39,760
a minute i had the korean cut and i had

2756
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:40,239
this star dog and i had the guava so i'm

2757
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:41,840
like

2758
01:26:40,238 --> 01:26:44,319
god so it got a little confusing so i

2759
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:45,679
was one of those yeah i think that

2760
01:26:44,319 --> 01:26:47,599
to this i mean i know that they're

2761
01:26:45,679 --> 01:26:48,960
totally different plants but people will

2762
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:51,679
be confused

2763
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:54,480
for eons to come i will never get that

2764
01:26:51,679 --> 01:26:55,920
will never get totally separated on me

2765
01:26:54,479 --> 01:26:58,000
just because i've been losing the

2766
01:26:55,920 --> 01:27:00,880
original underdog and then

2767
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:03,119
lumpa having his version of underdog and

2768
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:03,119
then

2769
01:27:03,359 --> 01:27:06,799
th seeds europe which i kind of have to

2770
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:08,960
separate because

2771
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:10,320
i'm not involved directly with what

2772
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:13,279
they're doing i'll send them

2773
01:27:10,319 --> 01:27:14,880
i will send them stuff and uh they can

2774
01:27:13,279 --> 01:27:16,000
work with it every so often but i'm not

2775
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:17,440
like

2776
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:19,359
on the inner workings of a lot of the

2777
01:27:17,439 --> 01:27:21,759
things and like for instance that

2778
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:23,839
underdog is the same

2779
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:25,280
cut that i left them with so i know what

2780
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:28,319
i left them with

2781
01:27:25,279 --> 01:27:30,158
and yeah but to this day

2782
01:27:28,319 --> 01:27:32,559
yeah now it's just hard for me to know

2783
01:27:30,158 --> 01:27:34,479
because until i can get them to

2784
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:36,400
get me that back over to here and be

2785
01:27:34,479 --> 01:27:39,119
able to show that to aj or

2786
01:27:36,399 --> 01:27:39,839
jj and aj and have them confirm whether

2787
01:27:39,119 --> 01:27:42,238
or not

2788
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:45,600
it is or it isn't but you know i think

2789
01:27:42,238 --> 01:27:45,599
also there's a little bit of the

2790
01:27:45,679 --> 01:27:49,440
hoping i don't have it you know i mean a

2791
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:50,960
little bit a little bit like i hope he

2792
01:27:49,439 --> 01:27:52,719
doesn't really have it still

2793
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:54,079
whatever it is the thing we have was

2794
01:27:52,719 --> 01:27:55,039
really really good and that's why he

2795
01:27:54,079 --> 01:27:57,840
keeps winning

2796
01:27:55,039 --> 01:27:58,238
out in europe and stuff also yeah so i

2797
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:00,239
mean

2798
01:27:58,238 --> 01:28:01,519
there's certainly been some whispers

2799
01:28:00,238 --> 01:28:03,759
that the

2800
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:04,960
clone which goes around as the you know

2801
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:06,960
original sour

2802
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:09,279
is maybe not the original what's your

2803
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:11,439
thoughts on this one

2804
01:28:09,279 --> 01:28:12,880
um well you know interestingly enough

2805
01:28:11,439 --> 01:28:14,000
next week i'll be hanging out with the

2806
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:16,239
bro

2807
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:18,479
and i'm trying to get the bro to come on

2808
01:28:16,238 --> 01:28:19,599
my show and the bro is really like the

2809
01:28:18,479 --> 01:28:22,238
key to the whole

2810
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:23,520
sour story because he was one of the

2811
01:28:22,238 --> 01:28:25,198
financers of the

2812
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:27,120
of the whole project back in the day

2813
01:28:25,198 --> 01:28:30,158
because it was literally

2814
01:28:27,119 --> 01:28:31,840
um you know a bunch of guys who are kids

2815
01:28:30,158 --> 01:28:34,158
really when you think about it

2816
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:35,840
um and then my friend who is the bro who

2817
01:28:34,158 --> 01:28:39,119
is kind of like guiding them you know

2818
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:40,800
and helping them uh with this with that

2819
01:28:39,119 --> 01:28:43,679
project and

2820
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:44,079
basically by paying overpriced amounts

2821
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:46,399
to them

2822
01:28:44,079 --> 01:28:47,198
at all times just to keep it in-house

2823
01:28:46,399 --> 01:28:50,319
you know

2824
01:28:47,198 --> 01:28:51,279
um they still have the cut of off the

2825
01:28:50,319 --> 01:28:54,799
original

2826
01:28:51,279 --> 01:28:56,960
which they're getting analyzed now so

2827
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:59,760
that we'll have a baseline

2828
01:28:56,960 --> 01:29:01,679
the cut that i have came from from hal

2829
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:04,159
who's the guy that worked for them

2830
01:29:01,679 --> 01:29:07,440
or what kind of he's the guy who popped

2831
01:29:04,158 --> 01:29:10,638
the bean the original bean

2832
01:29:07,439 --> 01:29:12,479
and when it comes to the sours like for

2833
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:13,119
instance that aj's put out i think is

2834
01:29:12,479 --> 01:29:16,319
different

2835
01:29:13,119 --> 01:29:19,679
you know um it's

2836
01:29:16,319 --> 01:29:23,198
it might be an f1 but it's definitely

2837
01:29:19,679 --> 01:29:25,679
not exactly the same um

2838
01:29:23,198 --> 01:29:27,519
yeah i think for the most part most

2839
01:29:25,679 --> 01:29:28,880
people haven't seen it lately you know

2840
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:30,960
if they haven't been if they weren't in

2841
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:36,159
new york in the 90s

2842
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:39,359
uh to the you know late 90s to the 2000s

2843
01:29:36,158 --> 01:29:41,039
early 2000s then they probably

2844
01:29:39,359 --> 01:29:43,920
have seen a version which is not the

2845
01:29:41,039 --> 01:29:46,158
original i'm more than convinced

2846
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:47,920
yeah that's a sentiment i've heard

2847
01:29:46,158 --> 01:29:49,359
expressed commonly

2848
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:50,800
a question yeah do you want to run but

2849
01:29:49,359 --> 01:29:52,479
it's also hard but it's also hard

2850
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:54,159
because of the fact that the sour was

2851
01:29:52,479 --> 01:29:54,959
never a stable plant to begin with you

2852
01:29:54,158 --> 01:29:57,198
know

2853
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:58,639
stability was never it's its highlight

2854
01:29:57,198 --> 01:30:00,719
it was never its focus

2855
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:02,000
so like the fact that it would throw

2856
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:04,560
nanners

2857
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:06,000
and uh be very hard to breed with and

2858
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:08,880
get a lot of

2859
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:10,079
kind of i had a bunch of batches that

2860
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:12,079
were seeds that were

2861
01:30:10,079 --> 01:30:14,319
you know very low germ rates things like

2862
01:30:12,079 --> 01:30:16,399
that

2863
01:30:14,319 --> 01:30:18,960
so i don't think sour's ever been one of

2864
01:30:16,399 --> 01:30:18,960
the the most

2865
01:30:19,039 --> 01:30:22,560
stable cornerstone plans to work with

2866
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:24,880
and it you know

2867
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:26,800
it came as a mistake so it's part of the

2868
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:29,679
deal you know whenever you're

2869
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:30,239
uh working with material that came from

2870
01:30:29,679 --> 01:30:33,199
from

2871
01:30:30,238 --> 01:30:34,000
mis from a great mystery in the sky then

2872
01:30:33,198 --> 01:30:35,678
you know there's

2873
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,960
it's hard to decide whether or not

2874
01:30:35,679 --> 01:30:38,239
that's going to be the longest or not

2875
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:40,480
even decide it's hard to

2876
01:30:38,238 --> 01:30:42,799
to rely on that as being a super stable

2877
01:30:40,479 --> 01:30:45,039
thing long term

2878
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:46,159
yeah so i'll go to questions and i think

2879
01:30:45,039 --> 01:30:46,960
there's a little fantasy i think there's

2880
01:30:46,158 --> 01:30:48,399
a little fantasy

2881
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:50,239
too when it comes to sour diesel though

2882
01:30:48,399 --> 01:30:53,119
as far as like when you're

2883
01:30:50,238 --> 01:30:54,799
17 years old and you're at a concert in

2884
01:30:53,119 --> 01:30:55,840
new york and you're super blazed and you

2885
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:57,600
smoke something in this

2886
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:58,960
best thing you've ever smoked and now

2887
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:01,679
you're in your 40s

2888
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:02,880
and you smoked a ton of wheat in between

2889
01:31:01,679 --> 01:31:06,000
that

2890
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:07,279
you may take you may in your mind have a

2891
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,880
little bit more

2892
01:31:07,279 --> 01:31:10,719
uh you may think of that as being a

2893
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:12,719
little bit more of a

2894
01:31:10,719 --> 01:31:14,800
amazing thing than it really was or

2895
01:31:12,719 --> 01:31:18,399
different than it really was you know

2896
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:18,960
yeah fully so a question i do want to

2897
01:31:18,399 --> 01:31:21,039
run by

2898
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:23,679
in relation to one of the industry

2899
01:31:21,039 --> 01:31:27,439
heavyweights that you made the mk ultra

2900
01:31:23,679 --> 01:31:29,760
so when i first heard that catatonic

2901
01:31:27,439 --> 01:31:31,039
was you know had mk ultra in it i was a

2902
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:32,560
little bit surprised because

2903
01:31:31,039 --> 01:31:34,319
when you look at the overall cross it

2904
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:35,360
just doesn't really seem to jump out on

2905
01:31:34,319 --> 01:31:37,039
paper

2906
01:31:35,359 --> 01:31:38,799
i don't know if you've seen it but since

2907
01:31:37,039 --> 01:31:39,119
then the guys who may have come out and

2908
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:40,960
said

2909
01:31:39,119 --> 01:31:42,719
like oh no we got the genetics wrong

2910
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:44,560
it's actually these other things

2911
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:46,800
did you did you kind of suspect that

2912
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:49,440
from the start or were you kind of yeah

2913
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:50,400
i was a little yeah no i mean part of me

2914
01:31:49,439 --> 01:31:52,000
was like great

2915
01:31:50,399 --> 01:31:53,679
this is awesome i can't believe it but

2916
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:56,719
then a part of me was like well i

2917
01:31:53,679 --> 01:31:59,119
just don't see how yeah no 100 agree on

2918
01:31:56,719 --> 01:32:00,560
that because i

2919
01:31:59,119 --> 01:32:02,880
the thing is when it first came out okay

2920
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:06,080
so resin seeds which was um

2921
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:09,679
the the

2922
01:32:06,079 --> 01:32:11,439
son-in-law of soma alex and alex is like

2923
01:32:09,679 --> 01:32:13,840
notorious for

2924
01:32:11,439 --> 01:32:15,039
for flipping names and doing crazy stuff

2925
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:17,119
like that so i wasn't

2926
01:32:15,039 --> 01:32:18,880
so i already was a little little

2927
01:32:17,119 --> 01:32:20,399
concerned when he first told me that

2928
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:21,520
that's what they used because also i

2929
01:32:20,399 --> 01:32:23,920
felt like he

2930
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:25,600
uh he knew that if he said it was

2931
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:28,880
something of mine

2932
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:32,239
that it would be uh

2933
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:34,159
well if like he could he could say that

2934
01:32:32,238 --> 01:32:35,919
would make me excited for instance which

2935
01:32:34,158 --> 01:32:36,559
i was at the beginning i was like wow we

2936
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:38,880
actually

2937
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:40,400
had meetings with bayer you know over it

2938
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:41,039
and stuff it was like one of those like

2939
01:32:40,399 --> 01:32:42,638
we're gonna

2940
01:32:41,039 --> 01:32:44,800
like all of a sudden it was like wow

2941
01:32:42,639 --> 01:32:47,760
this could be the next big thing right

2942
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:48,400
um but part of me knew like out of the

2943
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:49,760
gate that

2944
01:32:48,399 --> 01:32:51,599
it was like having a kid you know i mean

2945
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:53,440
it's like when you have a if you have a

2946
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:55,679
kid and it's not your kid

2947
01:32:53,439 --> 01:32:57,439
part of you will accept that as your kid

2948
01:32:55,679 --> 01:32:59,279
just because

2949
01:32:57,439 --> 01:33:00,799
you get into it you go into that drive

2950
01:32:59,279 --> 01:33:02,559
you know what i mean your body oh that's

2951
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:04,320
it this is my kid

2952
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:05,360
you're gonna deny it in your mind if you

2953
01:33:04,319 --> 01:33:07,039
accept it you know what i mean if you

2954
01:33:05,359 --> 01:33:07,359
don't want a kid you may never accept it

2955
01:33:07,039 --> 01:33:09,679
but

2956
01:33:07,359 --> 01:33:11,119
it's sort of the same idea where this is

2957
01:33:09,679 --> 01:33:13,440
you know somebody tells you that your

2958
01:33:11,119 --> 01:33:15,119
plant produced something that is now

2959
01:33:13,439 --> 01:33:16,879
being considered by bayer

2960
01:33:15,119 --> 01:33:18,639
pharmaceuticals because of the fact that

2961
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:20,159
they're looking for the next big cbd

2962
01:33:18,639 --> 01:33:22,159
project or something you're like whoa

2963
01:33:20,158 --> 01:33:24,399
this is major news

2964
01:33:22,158 --> 01:33:26,638
but it also when we when we went to that

2965
01:33:24,399 --> 01:33:28,559
meeting i totally was like i would never

2966
01:33:26,639 --> 01:33:30,000
work for pink i would never ever want to

2967
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:31,440
work with any kind of large

2968
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:33,039
pharmaceutical corporation this is

2969
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:34,319
horrible you know so

2970
01:33:33,039 --> 01:33:36,639
kind of part of me is happy that it's

2971
01:33:34,319 --> 01:33:39,599
not involved just because

2972
01:33:36,639 --> 01:33:40,960
it's not yeah i wouldn't say i wouldn't

2973
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:44,719
say i'm happy that but

2974
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:46,960
it is kind of like people whoever

2975
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:47,760
whatever genetics it's responsible for

2976
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:49,679
need to be

2977
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:51,360
clearly you know get the get the

2978
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:52,480
reputation for it because it is

2979
01:33:51,359 --> 01:33:53,679
going to send a lot of people on the

2980
01:33:52,479 --> 01:33:54,879
wrong direction if they're going to buy

2981
01:33:53,679 --> 01:33:57,119
mk ultra seeds

2982
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:58,480
hoping to find the next catatonic mother

2983
01:33:57,119 --> 01:34:00,319
plant you know what i mean

2984
01:33:58,479 --> 01:34:01,759
they're going to be probably mistaken

2985
01:34:00,319 --> 01:34:03,198
you know

2986
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:06,239
so i mean while we're on the topic of

2987
01:34:03,198 --> 01:34:08,238
cbd plants and kind of breeding programs

2988
01:34:06,238 --> 01:34:09,279
if you if you were to do some cbd you

2989
01:34:08,238 --> 01:34:11,678
know offerings

2990
01:34:09,279 --> 01:34:12,800
what would they be in regards to the cbd

2991
01:34:11,679 --> 01:34:15,440
to thc

2992
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:17,360
chemotype because a lot of people think

2993
01:34:15,439 --> 01:34:21,198
that that's kind of where the real

2994
01:34:17,359 --> 01:34:24,479
magic lies you know in that ratio yeah

2995
01:34:21,198 --> 01:34:26,399
i mean really like so in nature

2996
01:34:24,479 --> 01:34:28,238
if you leak so if you have a field of

2997
01:34:26,399 --> 01:34:29,920
ten thousand or a hundred thousand

2998
01:34:28,238 --> 01:34:31,678
plants and you let them just cross breed

2999
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:32,880
and open pollinate

3000
01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:34,960
if you had say for instance you had a

3001
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:36,960
lot of high cbd plants in that in that

3002
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:39,279
field and you had a lot of high thc

3003
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:41,118
plants in that field and you let them go

3004
01:34:39,279 --> 01:34:44,319
a couple years in a row and they

3005
01:34:41,118 --> 01:34:45,039
continuously cross bred open pollination

3006
01:34:44,319 --> 01:34:47,679
like that

3007
01:34:45,039 --> 01:34:49,679
you will naturally end up with a pretty

3008
01:34:47,679 --> 01:34:52,079
much a one-to-one ratio

3009
01:34:49,679 --> 01:34:54,199
and i kind of feel like that is the the

3010
01:34:52,079 --> 01:34:56,559
most

3011
01:34:54,198 --> 01:34:58,158
homeostasic sort of part of the like

3012
01:34:56,560 --> 01:35:01,360
that is literally the balance right

3013
01:34:58,158 --> 01:35:03,920
there the perfect balance um and

3014
01:35:01,359 --> 01:35:04,399
everything else is adjustments on that

3015
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:08,079
scale

3016
01:35:04,399 --> 01:35:10,000
so some patients might need a two to one

3017
01:35:08,079 --> 01:35:12,559
or they might need a ten to one you know

3018
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:13,840
maybe but usually

3019
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:16,560
most of the magic happens in a

3020
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:18,400
one-to-one and that's just

3021
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:20,000
that just seems like it should be that

3022
01:35:18,399 --> 01:35:21,519
way anyway because of the fact that

3023
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,479
you're like okay well that makes sense

3024
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:26,159
because

3025
01:35:22,479 --> 01:35:27,678
uh we're talking about

3026
01:35:26,158 --> 01:35:29,599
entourage effect and the fact that they

3027
01:35:27,679 --> 01:35:30,960
need it's like

3028
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:34,000
very hard when it comes to like what

3029
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:36,079
percentage do they need so like if you

3030
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:38,880
and it's very rare too very few

3031
01:35:36,079 --> 01:35:38,880
conditions are

3032
01:35:39,198 --> 01:35:42,399
super negatively affected by having an

3033
01:35:41,198 --> 01:35:44,479
equal ratio

3034
01:35:42,399 --> 01:35:45,679
sometimes not working as effectively but

3035
01:35:44,479 --> 01:35:48,718
for the most part it's

3036
01:35:45,679 --> 01:35:49,279
almost most people are thinking cbd is

3037
01:35:48,719 --> 01:35:52,480
like this

3038
01:35:49,279 --> 01:35:54,559
cure-all and they're both equally

3039
01:35:52,479 --> 01:35:56,238
they're both thc and cbd both equally

3040
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:58,560
are effective

3041
01:35:56,238 --> 01:35:59,759
thc being more effective than most it's

3042
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:01,440
funny too because in the beginning

3043
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:04,400
everybody thought thc was the

3044
01:36:01,439 --> 01:36:05,759
godsend sort of miracle thing and then

3045
01:36:04,399 --> 01:36:07,039
then all of a sudden cbd is and now

3046
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:09,199
teach he's bad

3047
01:36:07,039 --> 01:36:10,560
and you're like no it's all pretty good

3048
01:36:09,198 --> 01:36:12,399
and then on top of that you get the

3049
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:14,560
combo where it's like

3050
01:36:12,399 --> 01:36:15,519
when when they're both there is when it

3051
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:18,320
all works you know

3052
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:19,520
so yeah i'm pretty sure one to one is

3053
01:36:18,319 --> 01:36:21,840
your magic that's like harlequin's a

3054
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:23,840
great one-to-one plant

3055
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:25,440
um and that one is like if you make

3056
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:27,039
anything with that plant

3057
01:36:25,439 --> 01:36:29,599
and you give it to a patient it almost

3058
01:36:27,039 --> 01:36:32,800
always works

3059
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:33,119
yeah okay and so what are your opinions

3060
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:35,520
on

3061
01:36:33,118 --> 01:36:38,399
phylos and the way it's kind of

3062
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:40,719
interacting or should i say

3063
01:36:38,399 --> 01:36:42,559
altering the way kind of certain

3064
01:36:40,719 --> 01:36:44,239
interactions or crosses are going down

3065
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:46,880
between breeders like for example

3066
01:36:44,238 --> 01:36:48,959
maybe you would do a certain cross in

3067
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:49,359
your mind but then the fire loss reveals

3068
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:50,639
that

3069
01:36:49,359 --> 01:36:52,079
you know one of the parents isn't really

3070
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:53,520
what you thought it was maybe it's no

3071
01:36:52,079 --> 01:36:54,880
longer an ideal cross you know

3072
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:56,480
how do you think all that plays into the

3073
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:57,840
scene net positive i've heard some

3074
01:36:56,479 --> 01:37:00,079
people who are a little bit against the

3075
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:03,520
whole phylus thing

3076
01:37:00,079 --> 01:37:04,079
yeah i mean i'm 100 positive on the fact

3077
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:05,360
that it's

3078
01:37:04,079 --> 01:37:07,039
just good that we can have this

3079
01:37:05,359 --> 01:37:07,599
knowledge i think you just can't take

3080
01:37:07,039 --> 01:37:10,960
anything

3081
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:12,159
you you also gotta look beyond

3082
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:13,679
the numbers and that's where i get

3083
01:37:12,158 --> 01:37:15,198
scared when people are breeders and

3084
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:17,279
they're like

3085
01:37:15,198 --> 01:37:18,839
totally only working off my loss it's

3086
01:37:17,279 --> 01:37:21,679
like okay but

3087
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:23,520
uh take into effect that

3088
01:37:21,679 --> 01:37:24,880
you know sour diesel was a mistake kush

3089
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:26,320
was a mistake they were all mistakes you

3090
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:26,719
know what i mean and they were all never

3091
01:37:26,319 --> 01:37:29,519
bred

3092
01:37:26,719 --> 01:37:30,000
on purpose for anything and whether or

3093
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:32,400
not they

3094
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:34,399
the numbers would have made sense is you

3095
01:37:32,399 --> 01:37:37,439
know that's

3096
01:37:34,399 --> 01:37:40,000
like who knows but uh

3097
01:37:37,439 --> 01:37:41,599
yeah i think you gotta like be happy

3098
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,639
that we actually can create i mean i do

3099
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:43,520
like the fact that they created the

3100
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:45,039
galaxy

3101
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:46,639
there's a few things in there that i'm a

3102
01:37:45,039 --> 01:37:48,000
little bit like hmm okay well that

3103
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:48,400
doesn't seem to make any sense but it

3104
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,319
also

3105
01:37:48,399 --> 01:37:52,238
opens up a lot of things where you're

3106
01:37:50,319 --> 01:37:52,880
like well yeah we knew that all along

3107
01:37:52,238 --> 01:37:55,198
and now

3108
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:56,480
at least this is making this so we know

3109
01:37:55,198 --> 01:37:59,919
that's for sure

3110
01:37:56,479 --> 01:38:00,799
um my problem with philos i guess i

3111
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:02,079
would say i have a problem because i've

3112
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:02,320
been on the show a bunch of times i love

3113
01:38:02,079 --> 01:38:04,719
them

3114
01:38:02,319 --> 01:38:06,158
you know but the what i can see is a

3115
01:38:04,719 --> 01:38:08,239
problem with people is

3116
01:38:06,158 --> 01:38:10,479
is the intention everybody's a bit

3117
01:38:08,238 --> 01:38:12,799
nervous about which is like okay

3118
01:38:10,479 --> 01:38:14,158
so what are you going to do with all

3119
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:15,440
this info and that's kind of where it's

3120
01:38:14,158 --> 01:38:17,279
a little

3121
01:38:15,439 --> 01:38:18,559
we're in a weird zone now because we've

3122
01:38:17,279 --> 01:38:22,719
been so anti

3123
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:24,320
um writing things down as growers and

3124
01:38:22,719 --> 01:38:25,600
breeders you know it has been like yeah

3125
01:38:24,319 --> 01:38:26,158
just keep it all in my head you know

3126
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:28,239
because

3127
01:38:26,158 --> 01:38:29,759
you don't really need to have something

3128
01:38:28,238 --> 01:38:30,559
written down that says you were growing

3129
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:32,639
in that

3130
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:34,400
facility five years ago you know or

3131
01:38:32,639 --> 01:38:35,760
something like that but

3132
01:38:34,399 --> 01:38:37,279
so we've always been a little bit more

3133
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:37,840
underground keep it in your head kind of

3134
01:38:37,279 --> 01:38:39,198
thing

3135
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:41,920
and now everybody's like information

3136
01:38:39,198 --> 01:38:43,359
junkies and i feel like you can you can

3137
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:43,840
overload it to the point where you don't

3138
01:38:43,359 --> 01:38:45,599
have

3139
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:47,440
that information irrelevant at a certain

3140
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:49,039
point because you're like

3141
01:38:47,439 --> 01:38:50,960
it doesn't matter if it still tastes

3142
01:38:49,039 --> 01:38:52,319
like [ __ ] right so it's like if you take

3143
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:53,760
these two plants put them together and

3144
01:38:52,319 --> 01:38:55,759
get the perfect

3145
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:57,440
balance of all the cannabinoids that you

3146
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:59,760
were looking for but

3147
01:38:57,439 --> 01:39:00,559
it tastes like ass right then what's the

3148
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:03,920
point

3149
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:04,800
so i think it's a good thing tools are

3150
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:07,840
great

3151
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:09,520
just use them wisely you know and

3152
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:12,400
would you kind of express the same

3153
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:13,119
sentiment for labs and then all you know

3154
01:39:12,399 --> 01:39:15,039
like the

3155
01:39:13,118 --> 01:39:17,839
it's not so new anymore but being able

3156
01:39:15,039 --> 01:39:19,039
to test the sex of seedlings and whatnot

3157
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:20,880
is that the type of thing you would look

3158
01:39:19,039 --> 01:39:22,719
into as a breeder or are you still more

3159
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:23,440
so just like you know i know much more

3160
01:39:22,719 --> 01:39:25,118
hands-on

3161
01:39:23,439 --> 01:39:26,719
i'm still much more hands-on and i'll

3162
01:39:25,118 --> 01:39:30,158
use test results

3163
01:39:26,719 --> 01:39:31,679
more or less if i feel like uh

3164
01:39:30,158 --> 01:39:34,399
i need to confirm something more than

3165
01:39:31,679 --> 01:39:35,840
anything and nowadays i mean it's it's

3166
01:39:34,399 --> 01:39:38,000
if you have access like if you can have

3167
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:40,800
a

3168
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:42,560
gc in your in your facility and be able

3169
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:44,000
to hand off samples to somebody who

3170
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:45,679
that's what they do all day and they

3171
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:48,000
love to do it because

3172
01:39:45,679 --> 01:39:49,840
the lord knows i don't but if you can do

3173
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:51,439
that and and

3174
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:53,679
give somebody else the opportunity to

3175
01:39:51,439 --> 01:39:55,439
help you sort of move forward

3176
01:39:53,679 --> 01:39:58,079
yeah that's i think it's a good thing

3177
01:39:55,439 --> 01:40:00,879
but um

3178
01:39:58,079 --> 01:40:00,880
when it comes to

3179
01:40:01,118 --> 01:40:04,238
like like you know i have guys who they

3180
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:05,440
run through all their stuff they'll do a

3181
01:40:04,238 --> 01:40:06,638
thousand plants and they'll just look

3182
01:40:05,439 --> 01:40:08,879
for the one or two

3183
01:40:06,639 --> 01:40:09,840
percent that have super high terp out of

3184
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:12,560
the gate

3185
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:14,159
and then focus on that and if you're if

3186
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:15,199
you need to do that yeah like if you if

3187
01:40:14,158 --> 01:40:17,039
you're

3188
01:40:15,198 --> 01:40:20,479
trying to go through some large numbers

3189
01:40:17,039 --> 01:40:21,679
but also kind of feel like

3190
01:40:20,479 --> 01:40:22,959
you know can't like the whole never

3191
01:40:21,679 --> 01:40:24,480
judge a book by its cover and if you

3192
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:25,840
have seeds

3193
01:40:24,479 --> 01:40:28,559
and you go through them all there will

3194
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:30,319
be some strains that just produce

3195
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:31,760
ugly ass seeds that look like [ __ ] you

3196
01:40:30,319 --> 01:40:34,880
know what i mean and

3197
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:36,400
if you went on all visuals then you then

3198
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:38,319
you'd also lose out and i think when

3199
01:40:36,399 --> 01:40:41,439
you're doing the testing

3200
01:40:38,319 --> 01:40:43,599
you know if you're if you're

3201
01:40:41,439 --> 01:40:45,359
able to hone in and save yourself a lot

3202
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:48,400
of time that is worth it

3203
01:40:45,359 --> 01:40:49,039
but if if it's if you're not if you're

3204
01:40:48,399 --> 01:40:50,399
if it's not

3205
01:40:49,039 --> 01:40:52,158
if it's not that critical and you i

3206
01:40:50,399 --> 01:40:53,198
think it's still better to kind of go

3207
01:40:52,158 --> 01:40:56,399
through everything by hand

3208
01:40:53,198 --> 01:40:59,198
and give everything a chance

3209
01:40:56,399 --> 01:41:00,559
yeah of course so i think you might be

3210
01:40:59,198 --> 01:41:01,519
missing out you might be missing out you

3211
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:03,280
know

3212
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:05,199
yeah yeah that's and that's that's a

3213
01:41:03,279 --> 01:41:06,399
sentiment i've heard expressed by a few

3214
01:41:05,198 --> 01:41:07,839
people who i

3215
01:41:06,399 --> 01:41:09,599
you know regard their opinion quite

3216
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:10,960
highly and one of the most memorable

3217
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:11,920
quotes i heard was that

3218
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:13,679
you know like we're not we're not

3219
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:15,199
dealing with tomatoes it's not like it's

3220
01:41:13,679 --> 01:41:17,039
so uniform you can just

3221
01:41:15,198 --> 01:41:18,879
weed out the runts as soon as they

3222
01:41:17,039 --> 01:41:20,800
appear because a lot of the times the

3223
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:23,199
runs are the best ones

3224
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:24,960
yeah yeah yeah exactly and that's like

3225
01:41:23,198 --> 01:41:28,399
literally like sage is a good example

3226
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:30,158
uh uh that was selected off of the

3227
01:41:28,399 --> 01:41:32,799
well i have to start my car up because

3228
01:41:30,158 --> 01:41:36,158
yeah running out of power on the phone

3229
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:37,679
um but like sage was the the selected

3230
01:41:36,158 --> 01:41:41,118
the original sage that we

3231
01:41:37,679 --> 01:41:43,679
selected uh my friend mojave

3232
01:41:41,118 --> 01:41:44,559
uh had it was just like the smallest

3233
01:41:43,679 --> 01:41:47,359
plant in the room

3234
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:49,280
it was like kind of in the worst spot

3235
01:41:47,359 --> 01:41:51,118
but it had the most amazing smell

3236
01:41:49,279 --> 01:41:53,198
and he really like focused on that like

3237
01:41:51,118 --> 01:41:54,479
okay well i'm going to run this one

3238
01:41:53,198 --> 01:41:56,000
second round and when he did it the

3239
01:41:54,479 --> 01:41:57,839
second round it you know it was in a

3240
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:59,439
better position and veggies a little bit

3241
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:01,920
better and it wasn't like

3242
01:41:59,439 --> 01:42:03,359
it never was like a was never about it

3243
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:04,960
being like the biggest plan it was very

3244
01:42:03,359 --> 01:42:05,759
vigorous but it wasn't necessarily the

3245
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:07,760
biggest

3246
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:09,119
and then uh you know turned out to be

3247
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:11,440
the winner out of the whole thing and if

3248
01:42:09,118 --> 01:42:13,198
you'd gone by

3249
01:42:11,439 --> 01:42:14,479
the fact that it was the runt of the

3250
01:42:13,198 --> 01:42:16,719
litter at that point it would have you

3251
01:42:14,479 --> 01:42:20,000
know never made it to the fruition

3252
01:42:16,719 --> 01:42:21,600
yeah great real life example so

3253
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:23,359
i think that you know there's probably a

3254
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:24,079
few people who fall into this category

3255
01:42:23,359 --> 01:42:26,639
as you but

3256
01:42:24,079 --> 01:42:27,519
having had access to arguably some of

3257
01:42:26,639 --> 01:42:29,359
the best stuff

3258
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:30,960
especially you know during the early

3259
01:42:29,359 --> 01:42:32,079
years a lot of people would kill to have

3260
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:34,639
stock from that time

3261
01:42:32,079 --> 01:42:36,000
out of all that stuff what to use stood

3262
01:42:34,639 --> 01:42:36,400
out as like some of the best stuff you

3263
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,079
know you

3264
01:42:36,399 --> 01:42:39,679
probably don't have it anymore but was

3265
01:42:38,079 --> 01:42:40,960
there anything you grew back in the day

3266
01:42:39,679 --> 01:42:42,000
and you just like in your mind you're

3267
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:44,719
like damn that was

3268
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:45,439
that was the killer yeah there was

3269
01:42:44,719 --> 01:42:48,239
actually

3270
01:42:45,439 --> 01:42:49,439
sadly enough it was the one of the first

3271
01:42:48,238 --> 01:42:52,238
things i ever grew

3272
01:42:49,439 --> 01:42:53,359
uh when i when i worked at scentsy when

3273
01:42:52,238 --> 01:42:56,879
they did that transition

3274
01:42:53,359 --> 01:42:58,799
which was in 91 i believe it was or

3275
01:42:56,880 --> 01:43:00,880
around 91.82

3276
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:02,560
when they did that transition it was

3277
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:04,639
they basically bought

3278
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:06,080
they had all of neville stuff they

3279
01:43:04,639 --> 01:43:09,440
brought that into the

3280
01:43:06,079 --> 01:43:11,359
they brought that into the mix and i was

3281
01:43:09,439 --> 01:43:14,960
cleaning out the drawers

3282
01:43:11,359 --> 01:43:15,839
and i uh so i was cleaning up the

3283
01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:17,840
drawers and then i

3284
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:19,679
found this pack and it said four and

3285
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:21,360
more and

3286
01:43:19,679 --> 01:43:23,440
most people are familiar with four-way

3287
01:43:21,359 --> 01:43:27,039
which came out

3288
01:43:23,439 --> 01:43:28,559
90s which was a four-way indica hybrid

3289
01:43:27,039 --> 01:43:30,880
they had come out with a thing called

3290
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:34,159
four and more which is a four-way

3291
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:37,840
sativa hybrid and uh

3292
01:43:34,158 --> 01:43:39,039
so i took uh that pack and grew them out

3293
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:41,520
and this was like

3294
01:43:39,039 --> 01:43:42,800
again like the first indoor grow that i

3295
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:45,520
had under my like

3296
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:47,039
i was growing for them at scentsy but

3297
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:48,320
this is like the first one at my house

3298
01:43:47,039 --> 01:43:49,840
and

3299
01:43:48,319 --> 01:43:51,759
every single one of them is mutated

3300
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:55,039
right every single one so it's like

3301
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:56,239
they had um buds growing on the stems

3302
01:43:55,039 --> 01:43:57,920
buds growing in the middle

3303
01:43:56,238 --> 01:44:00,238
of the leaves you know the kind of

3304
01:43:57,920 --> 01:44:01,039
things that now are it's no big deal you

3305
01:44:00,238 --> 01:44:03,359
see it

3306
01:44:01,039 --> 01:44:04,319
one you know once in every couple

3307
01:44:03,359 --> 01:44:06,158
thousand plants

3308
01:44:04,319 --> 01:44:07,359
but at that time it was like whoa this

3309
01:44:06,158 --> 01:44:10,000
is crazy

3310
01:44:07,359 --> 01:44:12,079
um but at the same time i wasn't really

3311
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:14,960
recognizing uh

3312
01:44:12,079 --> 01:44:16,960
the fact that even though it was like a

3313
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:18,560
sativa it was growing like

3314
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:21,198
pretty much like a pineapple it was

3315
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:22,880
small had very little stem to it it was

3316
01:44:21,198 --> 01:44:24,319
all mutated and weird

3317
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:26,079
had a weird color to it too it was like

3318
01:44:24,319 --> 01:44:29,439
a brownie kind of gray color

3319
01:44:26,079 --> 01:44:31,519
and it was so it wasn't very vibrant

3320
01:44:29,439 --> 01:44:32,559
um very little hair like had almost no

3321
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:36,000
hairs on it

3322
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:37,679
so then when i harvested it i just

3323
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:40,158
wasn't really thinking i kind of cut it

3324
01:44:37,679 --> 01:44:41,840
down harvest it hung it up

3325
01:44:40,158 --> 01:44:43,198
and then when i like the first time when

3326
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:46,480
i smoked it

3327
01:44:43,198 --> 01:44:46,799
it it was like pure haze you know so it

3328
01:44:46,479 --> 01:44:48,799
was

3329
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:50,480
one of those things where i was like the

3330
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:52,239
the ultimate right

3331
01:44:50,479 --> 01:44:53,599
where you know grows like a little

3332
01:44:52,238 --> 01:44:56,718
pineapple indica

3333
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:59,760
solid bud has literally

3334
01:44:56,719 --> 01:45:01,279
buds growing on the stems and everywhere

3335
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:04,000
so just the vigor on it was

3336
01:45:01,279 --> 01:45:04,800
amazing and when i started to smoke it i

3337
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:07,198
was like holy

3338
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:08,000
[ __ ] that is like a pure haze taste you

3339
01:45:07,198 --> 01:45:09,599
know what i mean it's like

3340
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:11,118
i kind of remember like looking back at

3341
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:13,119
the stump

3342
01:45:11,118 --> 01:45:14,639
and then smoking the joint and looking

3343
01:45:13,118 --> 01:45:15,679
back at the stump and being like i

3344
01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:17,520
probably should have like

3345
01:45:15,679 --> 01:45:19,600
not cut that down i should have probably

3346
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:21,520
kept that plant and i never to this day

3347
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:23,600
i've ever had anything like that where

3348
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:25,360
the combination of the growth pattern

3349
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:29,360
and the fact that it had such a

3350
01:45:25,359 --> 01:45:33,519
extreme sativa like hazy flavor

3351
01:45:29,359 --> 01:45:35,279
and yet uh and yet uh

3352
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:36,719
you know probably would have been the

3353
01:45:35,279 --> 01:45:38,880
easiest plant to grow in like a sea of

3354
01:45:36,719 --> 01:45:40,719
green method or something at that time

3355
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:42,079
but again you know and and that plant

3356
01:45:40,719 --> 01:45:45,198
that four and more was

3357
01:45:42,079 --> 01:45:47,600
that was i think the last pack

3358
01:45:45,198 --> 01:45:49,118
ever because when i opened up the drawer

3359
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:50,159
and found them they were like oh wow i

3360
01:45:49,118 --> 01:45:51,198
didn't even know we had that like yeah

3361
01:45:50,158 --> 01:45:51,679
you can take that home with you and i

3362
01:45:51,198 --> 01:45:54,479
was like

3363
01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:55,920
sure i took it home grew it out and sure

3364
01:45:54,479 --> 01:45:57,279
enough never get and plus even if you

3365
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:58,880
could get a pack of those i don't think

3366
01:45:57,279 --> 01:46:00,158
you'll ever get that particular female

3367
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:01,440
just because of the fact that it's a

3368
01:46:00,158 --> 01:46:03,198
four-way hybrid

3369
01:46:01,439 --> 01:46:04,559
so the fact of knowing which direction

3370
01:46:03,198 --> 01:46:05,919
it's actually going in is gonna be

3371
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:09,119
pretty hard

3372
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:09,840
yeah wow it's like the the what actually

3373
01:46:09,118 --> 01:46:12,960
say it

3374
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:15,520
the the predecessor golden ticket

3375
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:16,399
yeah exactly like just like wow this is

3376
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:18,320
like

3377
01:46:16,399 --> 01:46:19,519
just came out of left field i just

3378
01:46:18,319 --> 01:46:22,158
remembered such an

3379
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:23,360
it was such a contrast of what i was

3380
01:46:22,158 --> 01:46:24,719
expecting because when it was growing it

3381
01:46:23,359 --> 01:46:26,000
didn't really have a lot of smell it was

3382
01:46:24,719 --> 01:46:27,600
kind of like low

3383
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:29,198
low on the totem pole but it really

3384
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:29,840
popped out when you burned it was like

3385
01:46:29,198 --> 01:46:32,079
wow

3386
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:32,880
ding like whoa what's that's coming

3387
01:46:32,079 --> 01:46:35,760
that's getting me

3388
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:36,480
like so differently than i thought and

3389
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:38,320
so

3390
01:46:36,479 --> 01:46:40,479
do you think there was any kind of

3391
01:46:38,319 --> 01:46:42,238
secret to the success of all the gear

3392
01:46:40,479 --> 01:46:44,000
neville put out like was it really as

3393
01:46:42,238 --> 01:46:45,839
simple as just the stock he had to work

3394
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:47,840
with was that pure or do you think

3395
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:49,600
he really was like you know a pretty

3396
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:50,880
phenomenal breeder

3397
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:53,280
he was i mean the thing is he's a

3398
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:56,400
breeder uh he

3399
01:46:53,279 --> 01:46:58,319
he like a little bit like how simon was

3400
01:46:56,399 --> 01:47:00,238
too simon from seriously simon's a

3401
01:46:58,319 --> 01:47:02,399
falcon breeder you know what i mean and

3402
01:47:00,238 --> 01:47:04,079
so when you're breeding animals first

3403
01:47:02,399 --> 01:47:05,039
you kind of already have that baseline

3404
01:47:04,079 --> 01:47:07,519
figured out

3405
01:47:05,039 --> 01:47:08,800
and then i believe part of it i think

3406
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:10,639
part of it was the fact that he was a

3407
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:12,239
junkie you know and that he had a real

3408
01:47:10,639 --> 01:47:14,719
hard head and he really

3409
01:47:12,238 --> 01:47:16,079
had to really work for him so i kind of

3410
01:47:14,719 --> 01:47:20,158
think that was

3411
01:47:16,079 --> 01:47:20,158
part of the deal was you know like

3412
01:47:20,719 --> 01:47:24,239
i'm not you know junkie junkies are

3413
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:26,320
driven people you know

3414
01:47:24,238 --> 01:47:27,599
they're they're 100 driven because they

3415
01:47:26,319 --> 01:47:30,158
continue

3416
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:31,679
down the road regard you know with

3417
01:47:30,158 --> 01:47:32,079
nothing's going to stop the mentality

3418
01:47:31,679 --> 01:47:36,399
and i

3419
01:47:32,079 --> 01:47:37,840
think that that may have added to the

3420
01:47:36,399 --> 01:47:39,039
that with the combination of the fact

3421
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:39,600
that you know if you're used to taking

3422
01:47:39,039 --> 01:47:41,840
heroin

3423
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:42,639
that we'd better be strong you know no

3424
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:44,079
messing around

3425
01:47:42,639 --> 01:47:45,920
there's no messing around you know if

3426
01:47:44,079 --> 01:47:48,000
you're a proper junkie

3427
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:49,520
you know and he was always striving for

3428
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:51,039
the best i mean he blew himself up

3429
01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:53,600
making hash oil

3430
01:47:51,039 --> 01:47:54,880
you know way before he he was the first

3431
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:58,000
bow [ __ ] you know like

3432
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:59,520
before there was even botox exist

3433
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:01,279
or one of the first in our industry you

3434
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:04,000
know so i feel like he just

3435
01:48:01,279 --> 01:48:05,198
that that driven force and being kind of

3436
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:07,520
coming from that side of

3437
01:48:05,198 --> 01:48:08,238
the of the of the world is basically

3438
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:11,199
making you

3439
01:48:08,238 --> 01:48:13,198
uh yeah made himself plus he like what's

3440
01:48:11,198 --> 01:48:17,359
interesting too is like uh

3441
01:48:13,198 --> 01:48:18,079
i met people from everywhere that he had

3442
01:48:17,359 --> 01:48:21,039
met

3443
01:48:18,079 --> 01:48:22,719
and it was like it just it was funny how

3444
01:48:21,039 --> 01:48:23,679
every time i meet somebody i can tell he

3445
01:48:22,719 --> 01:48:25,039
really like

3446
01:48:23,679 --> 01:48:27,039
he found the best grower you know what i

3447
01:48:25,039 --> 01:48:28,479
mean he found the best grower in seattle

3448
01:48:27,039 --> 01:48:31,118
then he found the best grower in

3449
01:48:28,479 --> 01:48:32,879
california then he found the best grower

3450
01:48:31,118 --> 01:48:34,880
from wherever you know i mean he seemed

3451
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:36,560
to like to have a very good eye for that

3452
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:38,159
or a very good nose for that or whatever

3453
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:40,960
i'm not sure which senses you'd

3454
01:48:38,158 --> 01:48:42,319
do to find these people but you know and

3455
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:42,960
luckily and now it's a different world

3456
01:48:42,319 --> 01:48:46,479
so now we've

3457
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:48,079
you know we have it's easier to to find

3458
01:48:46,479 --> 01:48:50,079
and to meet these people whether it be

3459
01:48:48,079 --> 01:48:51,840
online or in person but

3460
01:48:50,079 --> 01:48:53,920
back then like so i had friends from

3461
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:57,199
seattle that neville had come to

3462
01:48:53,920 --> 01:49:00,399
and traded them for genetics

3463
01:48:57,198 --> 01:49:03,039
in the late 80s you know and so

3464
01:49:00,399 --> 01:49:04,399
so then it's like okay well he really

3465
01:49:03,039 --> 01:49:04,960
went on a mission you know he wasn't

3466
01:49:04,399 --> 01:49:06,799
just

3467
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:09,439
waiting for people to bring him material

3468
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:13,199
so the dedication of going out to

3469
01:49:09,439 --> 01:49:17,598
find it and i'm pretty sure he he uh

3470
01:49:13,198 --> 01:49:19,439
filtered everything himself and

3471
01:49:17,599 --> 01:49:20,960
probably passed all his tests you know

3472
01:49:19,439 --> 01:49:23,439
what i mean like that's

3473
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:25,359
and that's compared to like now where a

3474
01:49:23,439 --> 01:49:27,359
lot of people it's all hype and

3475
01:49:25,359 --> 01:49:28,880
you know oh it's i need to have that

3476
01:49:27,359 --> 01:49:31,920
tahoe cookies i'm gonna get that

3477
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:33,279
yo gonna get the tahoe cookies because

3478
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:34,480
everybody says that's the new hottest

3479
01:49:33,279 --> 01:49:36,479
thing you know what i mean and that's

3480
01:49:34,479 --> 01:49:38,238
totally different than

3481
01:49:36,479 --> 01:49:39,519
somehow getting on a plane back in the

3482
01:49:38,238 --> 01:49:41,279
80s and

3483
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:43,360
going to seattle and before there was

3484
01:49:41,279 --> 01:49:45,519
internet and finding people who

3485
01:49:43,359 --> 01:49:46,719
connecting with those people you know

3486
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:49,760
that was uh

3487
01:49:46,719 --> 01:49:52,158
some energy the energy put in required

3488
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:53,760
probably created but the reason why that

3489
01:49:52,158 --> 01:49:55,839
came out of it was so good

3490
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:57,840
yeah wow and i mean was that seattle

3491
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:59,840
trip do you know is that the infamous

3492
01:49:57,840 --> 01:50:00,880
northern lights one

3493
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:04,480
yeah that's where you got all those

3494
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:05,679
lights from exactly and so um

3495
01:50:04,479 --> 01:50:07,598
because a couple of those people moved

3496
01:50:05,679 --> 01:50:09,920
to amsterdam uh in the

3497
01:50:07,599 --> 01:50:11,679
early 90s and part of it was what was

3498
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:14,000
funny was okay so one the one guy that

3499
01:50:11,679 --> 01:50:14,000
actually

3500
01:50:14,079 --> 01:50:17,760
got neville some material and traded

3501
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:19,760
with him he got the original

3502
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:21,679
silver pearl from neville so it was

3503
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:25,599
north it was a nl

3504
01:50:21,679 --> 01:50:27,279
um early pearl skunk cross and

3505
01:50:25,599 --> 01:50:29,039
so he brought those cuts that he had

3506
01:50:27,279 --> 01:50:30,960
selected from the seeds he got from

3507
01:50:29,039 --> 01:50:34,719
neville he selected

3508
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:38,239
cuts brought that cut to amsterdam in 91

3509
01:50:34,719 --> 01:50:39,760
and then uh we were selling it through

3510
01:50:38,238 --> 01:50:43,439
katsu

3511
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:46,960
as five-way um because

3512
01:50:43,439 --> 01:50:49,839
nl skunk being a three-way and uh

3513
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:50,960
early pearl um so that way we were

3514
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:52,000
calling five-way at the time because it

3515
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:55,599
didn't have a name

3516
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:57,359
and then uh they bought the collection

3517
01:50:55,599 --> 01:50:59,599
off of neville

3518
01:50:57,359 --> 01:51:01,118
and it was called silver pearl he had

3519
01:50:59,599 --> 01:51:03,360
come up with a name at that point

3520
01:51:01,118 --> 01:51:04,880
and so yeah so there was kind of a like

3521
01:51:03,359 --> 01:51:05,519
and then neville was shocked that we had

3522
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:07,199
this

3523
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:09,440
like how the hell did you get the thing

3524
01:51:07,198 --> 01:51:10,638
and then he saw our friend and was like

3525
01:51:09,439 --> 01:51:12,960
oh okay well that makes sense

3526
01:51:10,639 --> 01:51:14,480
because it's one of the few people he

3527
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:18,079
actually gave to

3528
01:51:14,479 --> 01:51:20,158
yeah and so i mean over the years

3529
01:51:18,079 --> 01:51:22,639
you must have seen a million ogs a

3530
01:51:20,158 --> 01:51:24,399
million cookie cuts you know come and go

3531
01:51:22,639 --> 01:51:26,159
which of the cuttings out of those two

3532
01:51:24,399 --> 01:51:28,000
classes specifically which stand out to

3533
01:51:26,158 --> 01:51:29,519
you you know what's your og that

3534
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:31,760
you know the one the one you smoke if

3535
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:33,599
you got the choice

3536
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:35,280
well you know i mean og or the original

3537
01:51:33,599 --> 01:51:37,760
one was was

3538
01:51:35,279 --> 01:51:39,920
i mean still to this day the

3539
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:43,440
quintessential of og for me

3540
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:47,039
um but in the uh after the fact like the

3541
01:51:43,439 --> 01:51:47,519
the k the king's kush which was an og

3542
01:51:47,039 --> 01:51:50,560
that

3543
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:54,320
basically we've renamed to

3544
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:58,320
um ricky's brothers coach rbk

3545
01:51:54,319 --> 01:52:00,319
was like uh was snoop's favorite

3546
01:51:58,319 --> 01:52:02,319
back in the day and ricky's was snoop's

3547
01:52:00,319 --> 01:52:04,880
manager and i met him in amsterdam in

3548
01:52:02,319 --> 01:52:04,880
the 90s

3549
01:52:05,279 --> 01:52:11,279
and uh so when he would come over when

3550
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:12,719
they would come over on tour

3551
01:52:11,279 --> 01:52:14,319
snoop was always pissed off because

3552
01:52:12,719 --> 01:52:15,840
there was never any kush right he was in

3553
01:52:14,319 --> 01:52:17,679
amsterdam he'd be like

3554
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:19,520
this weed all sucks and so i was like

3555
01:52:17,679 --> 01:52:20,079
well if you told the manager if you can

3556
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:22,239
get me a

3557
01:52:20,079 --> 01:52:23,599
cut of whatever he likes i'll make sure

3558
01:52:22,238 --> 01:52:25,759
he has it when he's here

3559
01:52:23,599 --> 01:52:27,279
so then we managed to get a cut off of

3560
01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:28,400
his brother which is funny because

3561
01:52:27,279 --> 01:52:30,319
him and his brother didn't even get

3562
01:52:28,399 --> 01:52:32,000
along anymore but he somehow managed to

3563
01:52:30,319 --> 01:52:34,559
get over to his brothers get it cut

3564
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:36,000
i when i came to cali he gave me the cut

3565
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:39,199
i got it back to amsterdam

3566
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:40,000
and then the first time that i first

3567
01:52:39,198 --> 01:52:43,359
time that i

3568
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:44,639
uh had a couple ounces for snoop he was

3569
01:52:43,359 --> 01:52:47,118
in a sh like he couldn't even

3570
01:52:44,639 --> 01:52:49,359
wrap his head around the fact that i had

3571
01:52:47,118 --> 01:52:50,639
the same kush that he had back

3572
01:52:49,359 --> 01:52:52,719
in america you know what i mean and i

3573
01:52:50,639 --> 01:52:53,359
figure if snoop's seen enough kush too

3574
01:52:52,719 --> 01:52:55,039
so he if

3575
01:52:53,359 --> 01:52:56,799
that was his favorite i was like okay if

3576
01:52:55,039 --> 01:52:59,118
that's your favorite then i

3577
01:52:56,800 --> 01:53:00,320
will uh make sure and i'll make sure to

3578
01:52:59,118 --> 01:53:02,238
have it for you you know

3579
01:53:00,319 --> 01:53:03,599
and then it now has been renamed snoops

3580
01:53:02,238 --> 01:53:05,839
kush and a bunch of different names but

3581
01:53:03,599 --> 01:53:07,360
we still call it rbk

3582
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:09,199
because we like the idea of ricky's

3583
01:53:07,359 --> 01:53:10,799
brother's kush

3584
01:53:09,198 --> 01:53:12,238
it's kind of it's kind of ricky bobby

3585
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:15,440
somewhere between a ricky bobby

3586
01:53:12,238 --> 01:53:16,799
and uh but that uh you know i was

3587
01:53:15,439 --> 01:53:18,158
literally at one point like we should

3588
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:19,440
just start a whole trailer park seed

3589
01:53:18,158 --> 01:53:22,479
company and everything will be a

3590
01:53:19,439 --> 01:53:23,759
billy joe bob's cousins kush and jimmy

3591
01:53:22,479 --> 01:53:26,638
jo

3592
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:28,079
you know whatever because it's because

3593
01:53:26,639 --> 01:53:29,679
that's kind of where we're at nowadays

3594
01:53:28,079 --> 01:53:31,359
where a lot of people take kush

3595
01:53:29,679 --> 01:53:33,199
i mean how many people have taken kush

3596
01:53:31,359 --> 01:53:35,359
and put their own name to it or or

3597
01:53:33,198 --> 01:53:37,839
changed it or whatever and that's

3598
01:53:35,359 --> 01:53:38,639
um but to me the original kush the ogre

3599
01:53:37,840 --> 01:53:41,599
which is what i

3600
01:53:38,639 --> 01:53:42,719
brought back to amsterdam was really

3601
01:53:41,599 --> 01:53:44,480
like

3602
01:53:42,719 --> 01:53:46,560
the picture-perfect one it's the one it

3603
01:53:44,479 --> 01:53:48,638
i mean it's where mk came from

3604
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:49,679
and it's kind of where i feel like

3605
01:53:48,639 --> 01:53:52,719
that's that's

3606
01:53:49,679 --> 01:53:55,359
closest to the source at that point yeah

3607
01:53:52,719 --> 01:53:58,239
the show and so how do you feel about

3608
01:53:55,359 --> 01:54:00,559
all the current kind of drama slash

3609
01:53:58,238 --> 01:54:02,000
i guess ethical questioning going on

3610
01:54:00,560 --> 01:54:03,520
around the idea of

3611
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:05,599
breeding with other people's stuff and i

3612
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:07,280
guess specifically do you feel like if

3613
01:54:05,599 --> 01:54:08,639
you've bought a pack of seeds or

3614
01:54:07,279 --> 01:54:10,238
if you've just obtained them through

3615
01:54:08,639 --> 01:54:11,199
whatever means are you just cool to do

3616
01:54:10,238 --> 01:54:13,279
whatever you want with them at that

3617
01:54:11,198 --> 01:54:17,678
point more or less

3618
01:54:13,279 --> 01:54:19,920
i mean yeah yeah to a point i mean i i

3619
01:54:17,679 --> 01:54:21,359
here i am the guy that sells the seeds

3620
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:24,800
so of course you know it's it's

3621
01:54:21,359 --> 01:54:26,880
it's a double edge for me i'd rather

3622
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:28,480
i'd rather that people did do that but

3623
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:30,239
then also gave credit because that will

3624
01:54:28,479 --> 01:54:33,759
help build up the other person's

3625
01:54:30,238 --> 01:54:33,759
reputation as a company

3626
01:54:34,158 --> 01:54:37,198
when it comes to people buying two packs

3627
01:54:36,399 --> 01:54:39,359
of this

3628
01:54:37,198 --> 01:54:41,279
somebody's gear and then crossing those

3629
01:54:39,359 --> 01:54:42,880
together and selling those as their own

3630
01:54:41,279 --> 01:54:45,519
that's a problem you know what i mean

3631
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:47,039
um and and and to be quite honest taking

3632
01:54:45,520 --> 01:54:48,719
a pack of my seeds

3633
01:54:47,039 --> 01:54:49,920
and a pack of dna and crossing those

3634
01:54:48,719 --> 01:54:51,840
together and thinking you have a new

3635
01:54:49,920 --> 01:54:53,520
seed company or is also

3636
01:54:51,840 --> 01:54:55,039
a little lame you know what i mean and a

3637
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:56,960
little like it's not not

3638
01:54:55,039 --> 01:54:58,399
really thinking outside the box the key

3639
01:54:56,960 --> 01:55:00,158
what i've always told everybody over the

3640
01:54:58,399 --> 01:55:01,679
years is the way to get respect i think

3641
01:55:00,158 --> 01:55:03,839
in this industry

3642
01:55:01,679 --> 01:55:06,158
quickly is to bring something to the

3643
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:08,719
table which is unique

3644
01:55:06,158 --> 01:55:09,759
and then you can always collaborate with

3645
01:55:08,719 --> 01:55:10,960
everybody on that

3646
01:55:09,760 --> 01:55:13,840
point you know what i mean like so for

3647
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:16,560
instance you know sage is what i'm known

3648
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:18,000
for so like i feel like if i bring sage

3649
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:19,440
into the mix and someone else has

3650
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:21,520
something that's special and we take my

3651
01:55:19,439 --> 01:55:23,039
male or my sage or my female of my sage

3652
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:25,840
and do a cross

3653
01:55:23,039 --> 01:55:27,039
that's that's me putting my flavor into

3654
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:29,520
the into the

3655
01:55:27,039 --> 01:55:30,960
on you know putting it in there if i

3656
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:32,800
take

3657
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:34,399
somebody else's thing as a breeder and

3658
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:35,119
then i take someone two different other

3659
01:55:34,399 --> 01:55:37,439
people's

3660
01:55:35,118 --> 01:55:38,880
it's i can't really do that now it kind

3661
01:55:37,439 --> 01:55:39,519
of pigeonholes certain people but it

3662
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:41,279
also

3663
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:43,040
what you notice is the best breeders or

3664
01:55:41,279 --> 01:55:44,000
guys who like really stick to their guns

3665
01:55:43,039 --> 01:55:46,079
and

3666
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:47,520
like for instance again simon is one of

3667
01:55:46,079 --> 01:55:48,960
the better breeders out there from

3668
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:50,800
serious seeds because he has

3669
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:52,880
six varieties you know and he's had the

3670
01:55:50,800 --> 01:55:54,480
same six he's added like one or two

3671
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:55,920
varieties in the last couple years but

3672
01:55:54,479 --> 01:55:58,799
for the most part he's had the same

3673
01:55:55,920 --> 01:56:00,880
varieties for year in and year out

3674
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:02,800
are they the same no some of them have

3675
01:56:00,880 --> 01:56:05,840
changed over the years but

3676
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:08,639
it's very similar to um

3677
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:10,719
if you're breathing if you're uh looking

3678
01:56:08,639 --> 01:56:13,279
at like

3679
01:56:10,719 --> 01:56:14,560
improvements to the strain if it's an

3680
01:56:13,279 --> 01:56:16,238
improvement

3681
01:56:14,560 --> 01:56:17,599
then we should do that but if it's not

3682
01:56:16,238 --> 01:56:19,439
and that's the hard part too is we're

3683
01:56:17,599 --> 01:56:21,279
talking about annuals that we

3684
01:56:19,439 --> 01:56:22,960
have turned into perennials you know and

3685
01:56:21,279 --> 01:56:24,559
it's not really like certain plants are

3686
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:26,800
not just not

3687
01:56:24,560 --> 01:56:28,719
pre-ret you know they're not designed to

3688
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:29,520
last 20 years but somehow we've managed

3689
01:56:28,719 --> 01:56:32,560
to do that

3690
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:34,639
and over the years though the best

3691
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:36,560
people or the best breeders are people

3692
01:56:34,639 --> 01:56:37,279
who realize they have a problem and then

3693
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:39,360
they'll

3694
01:56:37,279 --> 01:56:40,639
fix it you know bring some new blood to

3695
01:56:39,359 --> 01:56:43,679
the table and

3696
01:56:40,639 --> 01:56:45,840
add some extra zinger into there into

3697
01:56:43,679 --> 01:56:49,118
whatever they're doing

3698
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:50,960
yeah and so if we take a look at kind of

3699
01:56:49,118 --> 01:56:52,799
the offerings from th seeds

3700
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:54,960
there's there's quite a few which would

3701
01:56:52,800 --> 01:56:56,400
be you know contestants to be kind of

3702
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:58,399
the poster child because they're all you

3703
01:56:56,399 --> 01:57:01,598
know such hits in their own right

3704
01:56:58,399 --> 01:57:03,118
what do you consider to be you know the

3705
01:57:01,599 --> 01:57:05,440
the one you stand behind the most i

3706
01:57:03,118 --> 01:57:07,679
guess and you know not trying to

3707
01:57:05,439 --> 01:57:09,678
be biased i mean you still say it's

3708
01:57:07,679 --> 01:57:10,319
still sage for me because of the fact

3709
01:57:09,679 --> 01:57:12,560
that

3710
01:57:10,319 --> 01:57:13,679
i always felt that sativas and you know

3711
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:15,920
sativa is a

3712
01:57:13,679 --> 01:57:17,279
overly used word let's just say narrow

3713
01:57:15,920 --> 01:57:21,039
leaf drug varieties

3714
01:57:17,279 --> 01:57:22,880
are are the uh kind of the adult weed

3715
01:57:21,039 --> 01:57:24,158
you know the adult can the adult

3716
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:26,239
cannabis as you

3717
01:57:24,158 --> 01:57:28,638
as one would say but now the the

3718
01:57:26,238 --> 01:57:29,839
sophisticated old-school smoker the guy

3719
01:57:28,639 --> 01:57:33,118
who actually

3720
01:57:29,840 --> 01:57:34,480
um has some more experience than just

3721
01:57:33,118 --> 01:57:36,399
what people have told them and what

3722
01:57:34,479 --> 01:57:38,000
dispensary they've gone to

3723
01:57:36,399 --> 01:57:40,079
those are always those sativa-based

3724
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:43,359
things that have that like

3725
01:57:40,079 --> 01:57:46,479
unique cerebral quality to them and then

3726
01:57:43,359 --> 01:57:47,920
um i feel like things like mkultra are

3727
01:57:46,479 --> 01:57:49,919
nice but they're also just

3728
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:51,520
they're just a mirror image of us of a

3729
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:52,000
kush with with a little bit of a

3730
01:57:51,520 --> 01:57:55,040
difference

3731
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:56,479
and so that that's nice but it's not

3732
01:57:55,039 --> 01:57:57,519
something that i feel like i'm standing

3733
01:57:56,479 --> 01:58:00,879
behind 100

3734
01:57:57,520 --> 01:58:04,000
as my end all i always thought like

3735
01:58:00,880 --> 01:58:05,599
like a good question i'm sure you've had

3736
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:07,198
is always be like well if you were on a

3737
01:58:05,599 --> 01:58:09,920
desert island and you had one

3738
01:58:07,198 --> 01:58:12,559
particular plant then then for me it

3739
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:12,560
would be sage

3740
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:16,079
yeah okay so it's that everyday type of

3741
01:58:14,960 --> 01:58:17,840
wheat

3742
01:58:16,079 --> 01:58:19,599
yeah and it's a lot of it's due to the

3743
01:58:17,840 --> 01:58:20,960
fact that like um

3744
01:58:19,599 --> 01:58:22,880
you know sometimes you won't smoke it

3745
01:58:20,960 --> 01:58:24,158
for a long time like just you're on this

3746
01:58:22,880 --> 01:58:24,960
other tip for a while and then you go

3747
01:58:24,158 --> 01:58:26,960
back to it

3748
01:58:24,960 --> 01:58:28,639
it's literally like like putting on a

3749
01:58:26,960 --> 01:58:31,359
glove or something oh wow this

3750
01:58:28,639 --> 01:58:32,800
i get that instant vibe where it's like

3751
01:58:31,359 --> 01:58:34,479
why the hell haven't i been smoking this

3752
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:36,239
the whole time i haven't been running

3753
01:58:34,479 --> 01:58:38,479
around trying to solve this other stuff

3754
01:58:36,238 --> 01:58:39,519
and it's just has that long-term sort of

3755
01:58:38,479 --> 01:58:42,238
quality which

3756
01:58:39,520 --> 01:58:43,360
which i think is a rare in a way because

3757
01:58:42,238 --> 01:58:45,198
everybody's always looking for the next

3758
01:58:43,359 --> 01:58:48,319

3759
01:58:45,198 --> 01:58:50,238
yeah so show everyone uh sorry

3760
01:58:48,319 --> 01:58:53,840
a question everyone has to answer on the

3761
01:58:50,238 --> 01:58:57,678
show what's your favorite cam dog cart

3762
01:58:53,840 --> 01:58:59,920

3763
01:58:57,679 --> 01:59:00,880
yeah i think so for me it's the most

3764
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:04,000
deep

3765
01:59:00,880 --> 01:59:06,239
funk you know kim 91 it seems to get a

3766
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:10,399
lot of everyone seems to love cam 91

3767
01:59:06,238 --> 01:59:13,678
too but no i can't believe definitely

3768
01:59:10,399 --> 01:59:14,960
yep so one a question i should have

3769
01:59:13,679 --> 01:59:16,399
probably asked you a bit earlier when we

3770
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:18,480
were discussing some of your stuff

3771
01:59:16,399 --> 01:59:19,839
the snow but this is australian speaks

3772
01:59:18,479 --> 01:59:22,158
my interest because it's so

3773
01:59:19,840 --> 01:59:22,960
old there's not a ton of information

3774
01:59:22,158 --> 01:59:26,238
about it

3775
01:59:22,960 --> 01:59:27,840
what's the backstory on it well

3776
01:59:26,238 --> 01:59:29,919
so i got it from a group in oregon that

3777
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:31,199
came out to amsterdam from oregon they

3778
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:35,440
brought me snow bud

3779
01:59:31,198 --> 01:59:39,198
they brought me um the predecessors

3780
01:59:35,439 --> 01:59:42,879
to the chocolate chunk like the the

3781
01:59:39,198 --> 01:59:46,638
the female side of that one um it was

3782
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:49,279
it was just a real unique um

3783
01:59:46,639 --> 01:59:51,199
like the it was more the shape of it was

3784
01:59:49,279 --> 01:59:54,399
kind of a lot to do with the

3785
01:59:51,198 --> 01:59:56,238
the name behind it because it it didn't

3786
01:59:54,399 --> 01:59:58,638
have like a peaked bud like how

3787
01:59:56,238 --> 01:59:59,919
how sours do and stuff it had really

3788
01:59:58,639 --> 02:00:01,440
like a rounded

3789
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:03,118
almost like a there was a plant called

3790
02:00:01,439 --> 02:00:04,000
citral back in amsterdam that was very

3791
02:00:03,118 --> 02:00:07,118
similar

3792
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:08,319
in its structure so a very wide top to

3793
02:00:07,118 --> 02:00:11,519
the bud

3794
02:00:08,319 --> 02:00:14,000
um yeah just a real for me it was a very

3795
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:14,000
like uh

3796
02:00:15,599 --> 02:00:19,920
like the the lingering qualities of it

3797
02:00:17,359 --> 02:00:21,359
was what i really liked about it like it

3798
02:00:19,920 --> 02:00:23,118
compared to the front end it was more

3799
02:00:21,359 --> 02:00:28,238
about the back end on that thing

3800
02:00:23,118 --> 02:00:29,920
and super strong like just really

3801
02:00:28,238 --> 02:00:31,919
we we were calling when we first got it

3802
02:00:29,920 --> 02:00:33,679
we were like we caught we were going to

3803
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:36,800
rename a dick in the dirt because

3804
02:00:33,679 --> 02:00:39,039
it's kind of like you just brought you

3805
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:40,320
really like got you really really high

3806
02:00:39,039 --> 02:00:43,519
and really

3807
02:00:40,319 --> 02:00:45,118
intense yeah wow

3808
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:46,639
and so any plans to work with that going

3809
02:00:45,118 --> 02:00:49,439
into the future

3810
02:00:46,639 --> 02:00:50,960
um no i mean i i've lost all those

3811
02:00:49,439 --> 02:00:52,559
genetics years ago actually the funny

3812
02:00:50,960 --> 02:00:53,039
part was that the acorn which we made it

3813
02:00:52,560 --> 02:00:56,239
from

3814
02:00:53,039 --> 02:01:00,238
uh what we made from the snow bud uh

3815
02:00:56,238 --> 02:01:03,359
that that we found we found it again

3816
02:01:00,238 --> 02:01:04,799
uh my partner found it in mallorca

3817
02:01:03,359 --> 02:01:06,158
was a guy down there who bought seeds

3818
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:07,520
from us years ago and he's just been

3819
02:01:06,158 --> 02:01:08,479
running with that particularly like the

3820
02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:11,920
whole

3821
02:01:08,479 --> 02:01:12,799
island smoke snowboard lovely smoked

3822
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:14,480
acorn

3823
02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:15,599
and he's like you know so it's hilarious

3824
02:01:14,479 --> 02:01:17,118
he owns a growth shop there so he

3825
02:01:15,599 --> 02:01:20,000
basically made all the cuts and

3826
02:01:17,118 --> 02:01:21,198
supplied the island with cuts and so we

3827
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:23,599
got that back

3828
02:01:21,198 --> 02:01:24,719
about a year ago so i have but i haven't

3829
02:01:23,599 --> 02:01:26,079
got it back because it's in europe still

3830
02:01:24,719 --> 02:01:27,679
but i would love to yeah definitely if i

3831
02:01:26,079 --> 02:01:28,719
can get the cut back over to this side

3832
02:01:27,679 --> 02:01:30,719
uh

3833
02:01:28,719 --> 02:01:33,039
this one it was one of my favorites back

3834
02:01:30,719 --> 02:01:35,279
in the day for sure

3835
02:01:33,039 --> 02:01:37,679
and so what's a cut that's maybe not

3836
02:01:35,279 --> 02:01:39,118
really that widely distributed but

3837
02:01:37,679 --> 02:01:41,039
you wish it were you know you wish it

3838
02:01:39,118 --> 02:01:42,799
would appear in more crosses or that the

3839
02:01:41,039 --> 02:01:45,760
public were more aware of it because you

3840
02:01:42,800 --> 02:01:48,800
know you just think it's awesome

3841
02:01:45,760 --> 02:01:49,520
um well there's a plan there's a thing

3842
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:51,599
out here

3843
02:01:49,520 --> 02:01:53,119
which i just kind of started to work

3844
02:01:51,599 --> 02:01:55,279
with um

3845
02:01:53,118 --> 02:01:56,238
and then kind of got off that i don't

3846
02:01:55,279 --> 02:01:57,279
know why i'm

3847
02:01:56,238 --> 02:01:58,959
actually now that i'm thinking about i'm

3848
02:01:57,279 --> 02:01:59,359
like maybe i should go back and get on

3849
02:01:58,960 --> 02:02:02,880
that

3850
02:01:59,359 --> 02:02:04,319
but oh i know exactly why

3851
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:07,199
boric is looking like it literally i

3852
02:02:04,319 --> 02:02:09,039
felt like the the wind got kind of

3853
02:02:07,198 --> 02:02:10,879
sucked out of the sails when i first

3854
02:02:09,039 --> 02:02:12,880
came to colorado um

3855
02:02:10,880 --> 02:02:14,239
i was made aware of a string called

3856
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:17,520
tange out of here

3857
02:02:14,238 --> 02:02:20,638
um the colorado tange and

3858
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:23,760
it's like a blackberry flavored

3859
02:02:20,639 --> 02:02:26,960
really deep um kind of somewhere like a

3860
02:02:23,760 --> 02:02:29,440
flow very like like if you didn't know

3861
02:02:26,960 --> 02:02:31,439
and you've had flow and that one back to

3862
02:02:29,439 --> 02:02:33,198
back you might think it's the same plant

3863
02:02:31,439 --> 02:02:34,479
but when you grew them out you kind of

3864
02:02:33,198 --> 02:02:36,000
you definitely would see the difference

3865
02:02:34,479 --> 02:02:39,279
so there was something in the flavor

3866
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:42,399
profile that was very much like flow um

3867
02:02:39,279 --> 02:02:43,198
but it had this uh yeah it was just an

3868
02:02:42,399 --> 02:02:45,839
intense plant

3869
02:02:43,198 --> 02:02:47,678
and we were growing that a lot when i

3870
02:02:45,840 --> 02:02:50,719
first came here and i was also

3871
02:02:47,679 --> 02:02:52,239
i made some crosses with it

3872
02:02:50,719 --> 02:02:53,920
but it just didn't but then then the

3873
02:02:52,238 --> 02:02:56,079
problem was that the tangy became so

3874
02:02:53,920 --> 02:02:58,639
popular and i just felt like

3875
02:02:56,079 --> 02:03:00,639
i can't really promote tangent tangy

3876
02:02:58,639 --> 02:03:02,400
after all the diesel issues

3877
02:03:00,639 --> 02:03:04,000
after all these like because it feels

3878
02:03:02,399 --> 02:03:06,000
like whenever there's confusion on a

3879
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:07,439
strain it doesn't help anybody it

3880
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:07,920
doesn't help either or you know it's

3881
02:03:07,439 --> 02:03:10,319
like

3882
02:03:07,920 --> 02:03:12,239
you just get people calling tang tangy

3883
02:03:10,319 --> 02:03:14,158
and people calling tangitans and

3884
02:03:12,238 --> 02:03:15,439
mixing it all up and then all of a

3885
02:03:14,158 --> 02:03:16,319
sudden it's like you're you're kind of

3886
02:03:15,439 --> 02:03:17,598
like

3887
02:03:16,319 --> 02:03:19,118
taking each other out you know what i

3888
02:03:17,599 --> 02:03:19,440
mean in the wrong way you know i mean

3889
02:03:19,118 --> 02:03:21,198
not

3890
02:03:19,439 --> 02:03:23,039
not not on a quality basis but just

3891
02:03:21,198 --> 02:03:24,719
based on confusion you know

3892
02:03:23,039 --> 02:03:26,238
so i think we just kind of it's because

3893
02:03:24,719 --> 02:03:28,800
i actually had packaging made for

3894
02:03:26,238 --> 02:03:30,238
tange and then in the end i just like

3895
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:32,480
sat on it and

3896
02:03:30,238 --> 02:03:34,000
and then and then i don't see anybody

3897
02:03:32,479 --> 02:03:34,559
part the only people that are growing it

3898
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,319
now is

3899
02:03:34,560 --> 02:03:37,840
uh derek from incredibles and that's who

3900
02:03:36,319 --> 02:03:40,559
i got the cut from originally like he's

3901
02:03:37,840 --> 02:03:43,199
like the last guy standing it seems like

3902
02:03:40,560 --> 02:03:43,760
but but that particular plant was uh one

3903
02:03:43,198 --> 02:03:45,519
that i

3904
02:03:43,760 --> 02:03:46,560
had thought when i first came had so

3905
02:03:45,520 --> 02:03:48,159
much potential and i thought that was

3906
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:51,199
going to be the next big thing

3907
02:03:48,158 --> 02:03:53,279
and in the end it didn't work out and so

3908
02:03:51,198 --> 02:03:55,439
do you have any other lines that maybe

3909
02:03:53,279 --> 02:03:56,960
you've done throughout the years which

3910
02:03:55,439 --> 02:03:58,879
were really good but for whatever reason

3911
02:03:56,960 --> 02:04:00,158
they never quite made it to market and

3912
02:03:58,880 --> 02:04:02,400
you know maybe looking back you wish

3913
02:04:00,158 --> 02:04:03,839
they had

3914
02:04:02,399 --> 02:04:05,439
um you know i did like a bunch of

3915
02:04:03,840 --> 02:04:07,279
cambodian crosses and

3916
02:04:05,439 --> 02:04:08,839
laotian crosses at one point someone

3917
02:04:07,279 --> 02:04:11,279
brought me some seeds

3918
02:04:08,840 --> 02:04:11,920
um the problem was i really felt like

3919
02:04:11,279 --> 02:04:15,118
there was no

3920
02:04:11,920 --> 02:04:18,399
not a big market for those racy land

3921
02:04:15,118 --> 02:04:19,839
like those were super racy sort of

3922
02:04:18,399 --> 02:04:22,479
sativas that

3923
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:25,679
didn't grow necessarily pretty plants

3924
02:04:22,479 --> 02:04:27,519
like very dark and kind of

3925
02:04:25,679 --> 02:04:30,399
spotty but now i feel like everybody's

3926
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:34,719
more open to the idea of land races and

3927
02:04:30,399 --> 02:04:36,319
and almost like they'd appreciate that

3928
02:04:34,719 --> 02:04:38,158
difficultness you know like i actually

3929
02:04:36,319 --> 02:04:39,519
had one recently i was at a show and

3930
02:04:38,158 --> 02:04:40,319
this one guy came up and it was like the

3931
02:04:39,520 --> 02:04:42,000
first time

3932
02:04:40,319 --> 02:04:43,279
i think i've ever heard anybody say it

3933
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,238
but this guy came up and he's like hey

3934
02:04:43,279 --> 02:04:46,078
what is the most

3935
02:04:44,238 --> 02:04:47,678
difficult thing you have to grow you

3936
02:04:46,078 --> 02:04:50,719
know and this guy was like oh well

3937
02:04:47,679 --> 02:04:51,199
this one's kind of a difficult plan to

3938
02:04:50,719 --> 02:04:52,399
grow

3939
02:04:51,198 --> 02:04:54,960
like usually it's never that it's

3940
02:04:52,399 --> 02:04:57,519
usually i want the easiest

3941
02:04:54,960 --> 02:04:58,880
biggest highest yielding most thc

3942
02:04:57,520 --> 02:05:01,679
everything you know there's never

3943
02:04:58,880 --> 02:05:02,639
there's nothing but this guy was asking

3944
02:05:01,679 --> 02:05:04,239
for

3945
02:05:02,639 --> 02:05:05,679
because in his mind it was like the most

3946
02:05:04,238 --> 02:05:06,479
complicated ones are the most rewarding

3947
02:05:05,679 --> 02:05:09,279
ones which

3948
02:05:06,479 --> 02:05:11,198
is true you know to a point but it's

3949
02:05:09,279 --> 02:05:13,519
also hard if you can't get past the

3950
02:05:11,198 --> 02:05:15,198
point of uh being satisfied how you're

3951
02:05:13,520 --> 02:05:17,920
growing

3952
02:05:15,198 --> 02:05:18,879
yeah so just to change topics up for a

3953
02:05:17,920 --> 02:05:21,679
moment

3954
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:22,560
obviously besides the adi which of the

3955
02:05:21,679 --> 02:05:25,039
current cups

3956
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:26,719
do you feel you're you know kind of most

3957
02:05:25,039 --> 02:05:27,279
happy to throw your weight behind slash

3958
02:05:26,719 --> 02:05:29,198
you enjoy

3959
02:05:27,279 --> 02:05:30,719
going to because i think there's only

3960
02:05:29,198 --> 02:05:32,238
two there's only two well there's

3961
02:05:30,719 --> 02:05:33,359
actually three there's three that i

3962
02:05:32,238 --> 02:05:35,279
would do

3963
02:05:33,359 --> 02:05:36,719
and i and they're all like coming up

3964
02:05:35,279 --> 02:05:39,039
right now so uh

3965
02:05:36,719 --> 02:05:41,279
the golden tarp awards which is uh

3966
02:05:39,039 --> 02:05:43,118
november 18th so next week

3967
02:05:41,279 --> 02:05:44,399
and that one's actually if uh i don't

3968
02:05:43,118 --> 02:05:45,118
know if when you're going to get this

3969
02:05:44,399 --> 02:05:47,679
posted but

3970
02:05:45,118 --> 02:05:49,279
if if you're you should definitely take

3971
02:05:47,679 --> 02:05:49,760
a look at it and maybe if you get a

3972
02:05:49,279 --> 02:05:51,519
chance

3973
02:05:49,760 --> 02:05:52,800
if this comes out before and anybody

3974
02:05:51,520 --> 02:05:54,239
gets a chance to

3975
02:05:52,800 --> 02:05:56,719
uh they're doing a completely

3976
02:05:54,238 --> 02:05:58,879
transparent online of the entire process

3977
02:05:56,719 --> 02:06:01,198
it's a one-day thing on the 18th

3978
02:05:58,880 --> 02:06:02,560
but they've got a professional system

3979
02:06:01,198 --> 02:06:05,118
set up like an nfl

3980
02:06:02,560 --> 02:06:06,960
camera system where they have cameras

3981
02:06:05,118 --> 02:06:10,000
set up everywhere with the testing

3982
02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:11,760
with the with the judging with the

3983
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:13,439
the award ceremony everything is based

3984
02:06:11,760 --> 02:06:13,920
on multiple camera angles and you can

3985
02:06:13,439 --> 02:06:16,960
just

3986
02:06:13,920 --> 02:06:17,840
go for free to your phone and like link

3987
02:06:16,960 --> 02:06:19,439
into them so

3988
02:06:17,840 --> 02:06:21,199
they're taking it to the next level as

3989
02:06:19,439 --> 02:06:25,039
far as transparency but also

3990
02:06:21,198 --> 02:06:28,319
it's you know 250

3991
02:06:25,039 --> 02:06:30,158
entries one winner no there's no other

3992
02:06:28,319 --> 02:06:32,000
there's just one so it's kind of very

3993
02:06:30,158 --> 02:06:33,198
similar to our idea where it's like not

3994
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:35,359
no categories no

3995
02:06:33,198 --> 02:06:36,319
nothing like that just who's got the

3996
02:06:35,359 --> 02:06:39,439
best weed

3997
02:06:36,319 --> 02:06:41,759
you know so like that that one's awesome

3998
02:06:39,439 --> 02:06:44,879
emerald cups obviously the the

3999
02:06:41,760 --> 02:06:46,400
sort of crowned i'd say that's that's

4000
02:06:44,880 --> 02:06:48,000
the best event

4001
02:06:46,399 --> 02:06:49,920
by far in the world right now when it

4002
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:51,920
comes to cannabis just because of the

4003
02:06:49,920 --> 02:06:53,199
location location location right you're

4004
02:06:51,920 --> 02:06:55,920
in norcal

4005
02:06:53,198 --> 02:06:59,439
so you're talking about the best to the

4006
02:06:55,920 --> 02:07:01,760
best when it comes to growers and then

4007
02:06:59,439 --> 02:07:03,519
i'll just have to throw some i'll just

4008
02:07:01,760 --> 02:07:04,079
have to give my friend my friend props

4009
02:07:03,520 --> 02:07:06,800
because he's

4010
02:07:04,078 --> 02:07:08,319
he's taking it to heart he's he's on the

4011
02:07:06,800 --> 02:07:10,800
east coast and

4012
02:07:08,319 --> 02:07:12,719
next week is also another cup called the

4013
02:07:10,800 --> 02:07:14,960
cannabis all-stars

4014
02:07:12,719 --> 02:07:16,158
and the fact that they are on their

4015
02:07:14,960 --> 02:07:17,840
fifth year

4016
02:07:16,158 --> 02:07:19,279
it's in a tiny little town in rhode

4017
02:07:17,840 --> 02:07:21,920
island and yet they still

4018
02:07:19,279 --> 02:07:23,840
have like method man and red man and big

4019
02:07:21,920 --> 02:07:27,440
big talent coming through

4020
02:07:23,840 --> 02:07:29,039
and they it's it the quality of the

4021
02:07:27,439 --> 02:07:31,598
cannabis is good and also

4022
02:07:29,039 --> 02:07:33,679
they it like rhode island actually

4023
02:07:31,599 --> 02:07:35,599
smokes more cannabis per capita than any

4024
02:07:33,679 --> 02:07:36,800
state in america right now so it's kind

4025
02:07:35,599 --> 02:07:38,159
of like

4026
02:07:36,800 --> 02:07:39,279
and i grew up there so for me it's

4027
02:07:38,158 --> 02:07:40,000
always funny like i'm like well i

4028
02:07:39,279 --> 02:07:41,679
thought i was the only

4029
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:43,279
guy i didn't realize anybody here was

4030
02:07:41,679 --> 02:07:46,480
smoking weed but apparently

4031
02:07:43,279 --> 02:07:48,158
everybody is smoking weed there so

4032
02:07:46,479 --> 02:07:49,839
it's interesting you know you didn't

4033
02:07:48,158 --> 02:07:51,118
mention any of the high times ones

4034
02:07:49,840 --> 02:07:53,440
because a lot of the sentiment

4035
02:07:51,118 --> 02:07:54,639
expressed these days is there it's

4036
02:07:53,439 --> 02:07:56,158
almost as if

4037
02:07:54,639 --> 02:07:58,239
the event comes off more as though it's

4038
02:07:56,158 --> 02:08:00,238
trying to be like a music festival as

4039
02:07:58,238 --> 02:08:03,039
opposed to like a cannabis event

4040
02:08:00,238 --> 02:08:03,039
do you agree with that

4041
02:08:03,599 --> 02:08:07,520
yeah well you know the thing is i've

4042
02:08:05,359 --> 02:08:08,319
been involved with the cup since 93 so

4043
02:08:07,520 --> 02:08:11,360
for me

4044
02:08:08,319 --> 02:08:12,158
it's like i watched it i watched it from

4045
02:08:11,359 --> 02:08:13,839
uh

4046
02:08:12,158 --> 02:08:16,399
from like organizer point of view in the

4047
02:08:13,840 --> 02:08:21,440
very beginning and then from a

4048
02:08:16,399 --> 02:08:23,679
uh and then from a punter sort of view

4049
02:08:21,439 --> 02:08:25,439
and then from you know and just saw how

4050
02:08:23,679 --> 02:08:26,800
it was kind of like the same cycles over

4051
02:08:25,439 --> 02:08:28,238
and over again where

4052
02:08:26,800 --> 02:08:30,239
people get real excited they get

4053
02:08:28,238 --> 02:08:32,078
involved they get screwed they move on

4054
02:08:30,238 --> 02:08:34,238
next when they can they kind of didn't

4055
02:08:32,078 --> 02:08:36,399
feel like they i don't feel like they

4056
02:08:34,238 --> 02:08:37,759
they nurtured their their people enough

4057
02:08:36,399 --> 02:08:39,598
and they kind of went for the went for

4058
02:08:37,760 --> 02:08:42,239
the kill every time on money

4059
02:08:39,599 --> 02:08:44,239
um you know and it's also like i've

4060
02:08:42,238 --> 02:08:44,638
watched them saturate their market and

4061
02:08:44,238 --> 02:08:46,718
over

4062
02:08:44,639 --> 02:08:47,920
overdo it and do too many cups in too

4063
02:08:46,719 --> 02:08:49,279
short a time and

4064
02:08:47,920 --> 02:08:51,599
really burned out a lot of people like a

4065
02:08:49,279 --> 02:08:52,880
lot of people i know you know it's

4066
02:08:51,599 --> 02:08:56,639
they don't even bother going to them

4067
02:08:52,880 --> 02:08:58,880
anymore so so i feel like high times uh

4068
02:08:56,639 --> 02:09:00,639
you know they've done a great job over

4069
02:08:58,880 --> 02:09:03,118
the years at least keeping the fire

4070
02:09:00,639 --> 02:09:05,359
going but the problem was they're now

4071
02:09:03,118 --> 02:09:06,880
it's they're turning into what they've

4072
02:09:05,359 --> 02:09:08,960
been against the whole time which is the

4073
02:09:06,880 --> 02:09:12,400
corporate kind of mentality and

4074
02:09:08,960 --> 02:09:13,920
and they've kind of moved on to that so

4075
02:09:12,399 --> 02:09:15,759
there's enough it's good though because

4076
02:09:13,920 --> 02:09:16,880
it opens up it opens up for a lot of

4077
02:09:15,760 --> 02:09:19,920
these smaller events to

4078
02:09:16,880 --> 02:09:20,560
to shine a little bit when i think

4079
02:09:19,920 --> 02:09:22,800
there's a

4080
02:09:20,560 --> 02:09:25,199
there's a sort of peak point where

4081
02:09:22,800 --> 02:09:28,159
events just burn themselves out

4082
02:09:25,198 --> 02:09:29,359
and uh it happens with every trade show

4083
02:09:28,158 --> 02:09:30,638
it doesn't matter if it's cannabis or

4084
02:09:29,359 --> 02:09:32,000
not it's just

4085
02:09:30,639 --> 02:09:33,679
there's always going to be a side

4086
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:35,840
project which goes on which is

4087
02:09:33,679 --> 02:09:37,520
more real you know the real people are

4088
02:09:35,840 --> 02:09:40,000
involved because it's

4089
02:09:37,520 --> 02:09:41,119
it's uh because they don't want to be

4090
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,960
involved with the big

4091
02:09:41,118 --> 02:09:44,639
corporate-minded and it happens in

4092
02:09:42,960 --> 02:09:46,560
fashion it happens in

4093
02:09:44,639 --> 02:09:48,159
electronics it doesn't matter there's

4094
02:09:46,560 --> 02:09:51,599
always going to be another

4095
02:09:48,158 --> 02:09:53,598
event that comes around and absorbs the

4096
02:09:51,599 --> 02:09:54,960
the energy of that event and that's

4097
02:09:53,599 --> 02:09:58,078
that's kind of where i think it's at

4098
02:09:54,960 --> 02:09:59,760
this point so

4099
02:09:58,078 --> 02:10:01,759
yeah sorry i was going to say you know

4100
02:09:59,760 --> 02:10:03,119
obviously being the host of a show i'm

4101
02:10:01,760 --> 02:10:04,800
sure you get your fair share of

4102
02:10:03,118 --> 02:10:06,719
criticisms about the show in the

4103
02:10:04,800 --> 02:10:09,360
you know email or whatnot the same way i

4104
02:10:06,719 --> 02:10:10,639
do you know the thing i get most notably

4105
02:10:09,359 --> 02:10:12,319
is like the show's too long and people

4106
02:10:10,639 --> 02:10:14,239
just get bored halfway through it

4107
02:10:12,319 --> 02:10:15,759
which yeah i'm sure yeah i can see the

4108
02:10:14,238 --> 02:10:16,399
same thing with me because my shows turn

4109
02:10:15,760 --> 02:10:17,920
out to be

4110
02:10:16,399 --> 02:10:19,598
two to three hours every time and i

4111
02:10:17,920 --> 02:10:21,279
can't but i can't squash enough

4112
02:10:19,599 --> 02:10:22,800
into that point besides i have a hard

4113
02:10:21,279 --> 02:10:27,198
time where i'm like well

4114
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:28,560
you know i can't even i can't even uh

4115
02:10:27,198 --> 02:10:30,638
you know

4116
02:10:28,560 --> 02:10:32,000
but but i i'm like one of those guys

4117
02:10:30,639 --> 02:10:34,560
where i have a hard time

4118
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:36,238
i mean i don't have a hard time but like

4119
02:10:34,560 --> 02:10:38,880
i hate when people criticize

4120
02:10:36,238 --> 02:10:40,238
the stuff i do obviously i mean nobody

4121
02:10:38,880 --> 02:10:43,199
really enjoys that but

4122
02:10:40,238 --> 02:10:44,000
i'm also happy to to take it to heart

4123
02:10:43,198 --> 02:10:45,839
sometimes

4124
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:47,118
and you know it's the same thing i got

4125
02:10:45,840 --> 02:10:49,119
guys who say

4126
02:10:47,118 --> 02:10:50,559
uh adam i hate to listen to the done

4127
02:10:49,118 --> 02:10:52,158
show that guy can't even get a thought

4128
02:10:50,560 --> 02:10:52,880
out you know and i'm like oh i thought i

4129
02:10:52,158 --> 02:10:54,879
was

4130
02:10:52,880 --> 02:10:56,159
throwing out too much stuff but i guess

4131
02:10:54,880 --> 02:10:57,920
i'm not i guess you know

4132
02:10:56,158 --> 02:10:59,439
and and you know and sometimes there's

4133
02:10:57,920 --> 02:11:01,118
little things where you're like oh

4134
02:10:59,439 --> 02:11:03,198
i mean i remember the first criticism i

4135
02:11:01,118 --> 02:11:04,158
heard was and it was funny because i

4136
02:11:03,198 --> 02:11:07,359
think everybody who

4137
02:11:04,158 --> 02:11:08,960
um listens to themselves

4138
02:11:07,359 --> 02:11:11,439
has their own critique on their own

4139
02:11:08,960 --> 02:11:14,399
voice or their their cadence or how they

4140
02:11:11,439 --> 02:11:17,439
deliver stuff or whatever and the very

4141
02:11:14,399 --> 02:11:18,638
very first one was

4142
02:11:17,439 --> 02:11:20,799
i don't know who this i don't know who

4143
02:11:18,639 --> 02:11:22,159
the hell this ray romano sounding guy is

4144
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:25,520
but he's annoying

4145
02:11:22,158 --> 02:11:27,439
i was like oh great so now i'm sounding

4146
02:11:25,520 --> 02:11:28,960
like ray romano and i was like yeah i

4147
02:11:27,439 --> 02:11:30,719
kind of get that i

4148
02:11:28,960 --> 02:11:33,679
kind of see what he's saying you know

4149
02:11:30,719 --> 02:11:35,679
what i mean and again like i think

4150
02:11:33,679 --> 02:11:37,118
what you can do as a if you're in in

4151
02:11:35,679 --> 02:11:38,480
this kind of an industry and

4152
02:11:37,118 --> 02:11:40,158
the worst thing you can do is get onto

4153
02:11:38,479 --> 02:11:41,118
youtube and look at your comments

4154
02:11:40,158 --> 02:11:42,960
because

4155
02:11:41,118 --> 02:11:44,399
you're almost always going to have the

4156
02:11:42,960 --> 02:11:45,679
haters in that world but then again you

4157
02:11:44,399 --> 02:11:47,839
know you're not successful unless you

4158
02:11:45,679 --> 02:11:50,480
have some haters in the world

4159
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:51,119
yeah so with all that being said though

4160
02:11:50,479 --> 02:11:53,439
you know

4161
02:11:51,118 --> 02:11:54,799
the longevity speaks for itself what has

4162
02:11:53,439 --> 02:11:56,559
been in your opinion

4163
02:11:54,800 --> 02:11:58,639
you know the secret to the longevity

4164
02:11:56,560 --> 02:11:59,119
overall of both the show and the career

4165
02:11:58,639 --> 02:12:00,800
even

4166
02:11:59,118 --> 02:12:03,118
you know even if there are there haters

4167
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:06,239
out there

4168
02:12:03,118 --> 02:12:08,078
i think just being uh authentic and

4169
02:12:06,238 --> 02:12:09,678
you know and true to yourself in a sense

4170
02:12:08,078 --> 02:12:11,198
i mean that's kind of the key to

4171
02:12:09,679 --> 02:12:13,199
i feel like that's the key to success

4172
02:12:11,198 --> 02:12:16,638
now because we're in such a

4173
02:12:13,198 --> 02:12:17,919
um sort of insta

4174
02:12:16,639 --> 02:12:21,679
insta world you know everything's

4175
02:12:17,920 --> 02:12:23,440
instant and everything um

4176
02:12:21,679 --> 02:12:24,880
is not authentic anymore there's really

4177
02:12:23,439 --> 02:12:27,359
like an authenticity

4178
02:12:24,880 --> 02:12:28,078
lack of authenticity in this world and

4179
02:12:27,359 --> 02:12:29,839
so

4180
02:12:28,078 --> 02:12:31,759
when something's good everyone jumps on

4181
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:32,880
that bandwagon you know what i mean and

4182
02:12:31,760 --> 02:12:35,599
i feel like

4183
02:12:32,880 --> 02:12:38,159
this industry is no not any different i

4184
02:12:35,599 --> 02:12:40,880
mean we're definitely

4185
02:12:38,158 --> 02:12:42,238
you can run around and be a hype guy and

4186
02:12:40,880 --> 02:12:44,400
jump on everybody else's

4187
02:12:42,238 --> 02:12:45,919
thing but i feel like if you're just

4188
02:12:44,399 --> 02:12:48,638
true to yourself and really authentic

4189
02:12:45,920 --> 02:12:51,679
you're gonna last a long time and

4190
02:12:48,639 --> 02:12:53,359
what's funny is i've been totally uh

4191
02:12:51,679 --> 02:12:54,639
that's been totally confirmed to me

4192
02:12:53,359 --> 02:12:56,078
recently i read an article where i was

4193
02:12:54,639 --> 02:12:59,359
talking about millennials

4194
02:12:56,078 --> 02:13:02,559
and because the millennials are

4195
02:12:59,359 --> 02:13:03,839
are oh that's they're always looking for

4196
02:13:02,560 --> 02:13:05,280
something that's real now because

4197
02:13:03,840 --> 02:13:05,840
there's so much fake in the world and

4198
02:13:05,279 --> 02:13:07,279
that's

4199
02:13:05,840 --> 02:13:08,400
something we didn't really have as a

4200
02:13:07,279 --> 02:13:10,238
when we were growing up i mean

4201
02:13:08,399 --> 02:13:11,839
everything was

4202
02:13:10,238 --> 02:13:13,039
not that everything was real but seems

4203
02:13:11,840 --> 02:13:15,279
like everything was a little bit more

4204
02:13:13,039 --> 02:13:17,519
authentic because it wasn't like

4205
02:13:15,279 --> 02:13:19,679
like now if you get on the internet it

4206
02:13:17,520 --> 02:13:21,040
might take you

4207
02:13:19,679 --> 02:13:22,480
10 minutes to figure out that you're

4208
02:13:21,039 --> 02:13:23,840
what you're reading is absolute and

4209
02:13:22,479 --> 02:13:25,678
utter [ __ ] and you might be totally

4210
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:29,279
sucked into it you know what i mean but

4211
02:13:25,679 --> 02:13:30,078
but this whole idea of of putting layers

4212
02:13:29,279 --> 02:13:33,759
of [ __ ]

4213
02:13:30,078 --> 02:13:35,359
out there yeah wasn't so

4214
02:13:33,760 --> 02:13:36,639
prevalent before you know i mean before

4215
02:13:35,359 --> 02:13:37,519
it was a little bit more like yeah it

4216
02:13:36,639 --> 02:13:39,039
was hard to get to the

4217
02:13:37,520 --> 02:13:40,719
to find the knowledge but it wasn't

4218
02:13:39,039 --> 02:13:42,238
because you had to

4219
02:13:40,719 --> 02:13:44,000
click you weren't getting clickbait

4220
02:13:42,238 --> 02:13:45,678
thrown at you you know what i mean and

4221
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:49,039
nowadays it's like

4222
02:13:45,679 --> 02:13:51,920
the uh the idea of being

4223
02:13:49,039 --> 02:13:53,198
24 years like this is our 25th year

4224
02:13:51,920 --> 02:13:54,800
coming up now

4225
02:13:53,198 --> 02:13:56,839
and so when you're into those ranges

4226
02:13:54,800 --> 02:13:58,079
once you get past 20 years it's kind of

4227
02:13:56,840 --> 02:13:59,760
like

4228
02:13:58,078 --> 02:14:02,158
like any career at that point you're

4229
02:13:59,760 --> 02:14:05,520
like i guess uh you know

4230
02:14:02,158 --> 02:14:07,598
you you uh you either and the thing is

4231
02:14:05,520 --> 02:14:08,159
it's way easier to be authentic than it

4232
02:14:07,599 --> 02:14:11,039
is to

4233
02:14:08,158 --> 02:14:13,598
to try to change all the time because

4234
02:14:11,039 --> 02:14:15,519
it's kind of like

4235
02:14:13,599 --> 02:14:16,960
you know trying to like if you just

4236
02:14:15,520 --> 02:14:18,639
imagine you create your entire company

4237
02:14:16,960 --> 02:14:21,760
based on a lie then you're

4238
02:14:18,639 --> 02:14:23,359
you're you're you're like

4239
02:14:21,760 --> 02:14:25,199
take for example saying you started in

4240
02:14:23,359 --> 02:14:27,198
1985 you know

4241
02:14:25,198 --> 02:14:28,719
how can you you know you can't really

4242
02:14:27,198 --> 02:14:29,759
what do you do when you have your 20th

4243
02:14:28,719 --> 02:14:31,599
anniversary and you're

4244
02:14:29,760 --> 02:14:33,039
only but but everyone starts questioning

4245
02:14:31,599 --> 02:14:34,560
like well how could you be 20th

4246
02:14:33,039 --> 02:14:36,158
anniversary you just started four years

4247
02:14:34,560 --> 02:14:38,840
ago you know you know i mean it's like

4248
02:14:36,158 --> 02:14:40,078
to me that's like it makes it harder as

4249
02:14:38,840 --> 02:14:41,679
a

4250
02:14:40,078 --> 02:14:43,439
to be in the industry long term you know

4251
02:14:41,679 --> 02:14:44,880
because you're always now you're

4252
02:14:43,439 --> 02:14:46,719
now you're you're always defending

4253
02:14:44,880 --> 02:14:48,159
yourself you know so i feel like just

4254
02:14:46,719 --> 02:14:48,880
being authentic and just sort of you

4255
02:14:48,158 --> 02:14:50,960
know real

4256
02:14:48,880 --> 02:14:52,560
and and one of the things that's nice is

4257
02:14:50,960 --> 02:14:54,960
that uh

4258
02:14:52,560 --> 02:14:56,320
i'm glad i'm where i'm at at the age

4259
02:14:54,960 --> 02:15:00,319
that i'm at because i'll be

4260
02:14:56,319 --> 02:15:01,920
i'm like 48 right now um

4261
02:15:00,319 --> 02:15:03,840
yeah i i think it would be too hard to

4262
02:15:01,920 --> 02:15:07,359
be coming here as a total new

4263
02:15:03,840 --> 02:15:08,639
new guy and try to create an image in

4264
02:15:07,359 --> 02:15:09,439
your own thing i think it'd be quite

4265
02:15:08,639 --> 02:15:10,960
hard so

4266
02:15:09,439 --> 02:15:12,479
kind of glad where i started when i

4267
02:15:10,960 --> 02:15:16,000
started because uh

4268
02:15:12,479 --> 02:15:17,598
it's not so hard to to last if you've

4269
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:20,158
been around that long you know

4270
02:15:17,599 --> 02:15:22,000
because it just gets easier in a sense

4271
02:15:20,158 --> 02:15:24,000
yeah yeah you got that name recognition

4272
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:25,359
as well so i mean we're on the on the

4273
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,560
tail end of it all now

4274
02:15:25,359 --> 02:15:28,078
this is the last question it's a little

4275
02:15:26,560 --> 02:15:28,880
bit more i mean you can you can go along

4276
02:15:28,078 --> 02:15:32,158
if you want but

4277
02:15:28,880 --> 02:15:34,159
a little bit more short answer based um

4278
02:15:32,158 --> 02:15:35,519
so this one actually might require a

4279
02:15:34,158 --> 02:15:36,799
little bit explaining but i saw you

4280
02:15:35,520 --> 02:15:38,079
answer a question somewhere i think it

4281
02:15:36,800 --> 02:15:39,520
might have been in the facebook group

4282
02:15:38,078 --> 02:15:41,198
somewhere like that but basically

4283
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:44,000
someone said how come we don't see a lot

4284
02:15:41,198 --> 02:15:45,678
of 100 hemp clothing and then you said

4285
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:48,158
oh it's because it's actually like quite

4286
02:15:45,679 --> 02:15:49,440
hard to make 100 versus say like a blend

4287
02:15:48,158 --> 02:15:50,479
would you mind elaborating a bit more

4288
02:15:49,439 --> 02:15:51,919
about that i don't think people are

4289
02:15:50,479 --> 02:15:54,000
familiar

4290
02:15:51,920 --> 02:15:55,520
sure uh well it's mostly cost

4291
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:58,960
restrictive you know like uh

4292
02:15:55,520 --> 02:16:00,960
say you can make 100 hemp products

4293
02:15:58,960 --> 02:16:03,520
and i and we've we've sold them over the

4294
02:16:00,960 --> 02:16:06,000
years um the problem was it was always

4295
02:16:03,520 --> 02:16:06,960
a combination of cost restrictive and

4296
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,479
also

4297
02:16:06,960 --> 02:16:10,719
i don't think people are as familiar

4298
02:16:08,479 --> 02:16:13,279
with that

4299
02:16:10,719 --> 02:16:14,639
high that high of quality material to

4300
02:16:13,279 --> 02:16:15,198
begin with because one of the things

4301
02:16:14,639 --> 02:16:17,039
that takes

4302
02:16:15,198 --> 02:16:19,039
so for instance linen is a good example

4303
02:16:17,039 --> 02:16:22,078
like linen

4304
02:16:19,039 --> 02:16:23,039
is not fashionable right now it's not

4305
02:16:22,078 --> 02:16:25,118
because it takes

4306
02:16:23,039 --> 02:16:26,719
energy to actually wear it you can't

4307
02:16:25,118 --> 02:16:28,639
wash and wear linen you know what i mean

4308
02:16:26,719 --> 02:16:30,239
you have to actually take care of it

4309
02:16:28,639 --> 02:16:32,799
a little bit like cast iron skillets

4310
02:16:30,238 --> 02:16:34,558
take a cast iron skillet compared to a

4311
02:16:32,799 --> 02:16:36,959
teflon pan they probably sell

4312
02:16:34,558 --> 02:16:39,119
100 000 teflon pans for every cast iron

4313
02:16:36,959 --> 02:16:41,119
skillet these days but if you're

4314
02:16:39,120 --> 02:16:42,800
a chef you're only going to wear you're

4315
02:16:41,120 --> 02:16:43,920
only going to use cast iron skillets

4316
02:16:42,799 --> 02:16:46,318
because

4317
02:16:43,920 --> 02:16:49,200
that's what real cooking's about but

4318
02:16:46,318 --> 02:16:52,398
it's also going to last forever

4319
02:16:49,200 --> 02:16:54,399
it needs to be treated constantly

4320
02:16:52,398 --> 02:16:55,439
and so with with hemp clothes with hemp

4321
02:16:54,398 --> 02:16:56,879
when it's 100

4322
02:16:55,439 --> 02:16:58,960
it's not going to be wrinkle free you're

4323
02:16:56,879 --> 02:17:01,279
going to have to

4324
02:16:58,959 --> 02:17:03,279
iron it every time whereas when we mix

4325
02:17:01,280 --> 02:17:06,239
it with cotton we can actually get

4326
02:17:03,280 --> 02:17:07,280
pretty much wrinkle-free material um

4327
02:17:06,239 --> 02:17:09,840
hardly needs any

4328
02:17:07,280 --> 02:17:11,200
any maintenance and people are more used

4329
02:17:09,840 --> 02:17:12,558
to that and the problem is if you if you

4330
02:17:11,200 --> 02:17:13,599
hand somebody an item which you just

4331
02:17:12,558 --> 02:17:15,119
paid more money for

4332
02:17:13,599 --> 02:17:17,599
and now you have to take care of it more

4333
02:17:15,120 --> 02:17:17,920
it's almost like so against the grain of

4334
02:17:17,599 --> 02:17:19,760
the

4335
02:17:17,920 --> 02:17:21,359
the modern way of thinking now

4336
02:17:19,760 --> 02:17:22,800
everybody's well if you

4337
02:17:21,359 --> 02:17:24,960
if you pay more it should just take care

4338
02:17:22,799 --> 02:17:25,358
of itself right you're like actually not

4339
02:17:24,959 --> 02:17:26,638
so

4340
02:17:25,359 --> 02:17:28,880
so it's kind of like one of those things

4341
02:17:26,638 --> 02:17:30,638
where just people aren't really ready to

4342
02:17:28,879 --> 02:17:31,920
to pay the amount that they have to pay

4343
02:17:30,638 --> 02:17:34,000
and then on top of that

4344
02:17:31,920 --> 02:17:35,439
learn a whole new learning curve of how

4345
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:38,318
to take care of their clothing

4346
02:17:35,439 --> 02:17:40,159
um which you know it's funny as a as a

4347
02:17:38,318 --> 02:17:41,039
to be in this industry for so long and

4348
02:17:40,159 --> 02:17:42,159
then like

4349
02:17:41,040 --> 02:17:44,880
never would have thought that i would

4350
02:17:42,159 --> 02:17:46,079
have ever been into fashion and into

4351
02:17:44,879 --> 02:17:48,159
clothing and

4352
02:17:46,079 --> 02:17:50,239
and the nice part is that because we're

4353
02:17:48,159 --> 02:17:53,039
a hemp brand

4354
02:17:50,239 --> 02:17:54,558
we're really focused on what we do and

4355
02:17:53,040 --> 02:17:57,439
so like our materials

4356
02:17:54,558 --> 02:17:58,679
over the years have like now we're doing

4357
02:17:57,439 --> 02:18:01,599
70

4358
02:17:58,679 --> 02:18:03,439
7 hemp on the outer

4359
02:18:01,599 --> 02:18:05,439
material of our jacket so we've actually

4360
02:18:03,439 --> 02:18:07,599
increased it as much as we can

4361
02:18:05,439 --> 02:18:09,359
and keeping it in line with what we've

4362
02:18:07,599 --> 02:18:11,840
already done

4363
02:18:09,359 --> 02:18:13,120
if you know what i mean yeah i know

4364
02:18:11,840 --> 02:18:15,040
that's your tagline but i'm just going

4365
02:18:13,120 --> 02:18:16,880
to throw it at you

4366
02:18:15,040 --> 02:18:18,240
we've got to keep it in there so i mean

4367
02:18:16,879 --> 02:18:20,159
if we take a step back though

4368
02:18:18,239 --> 02:18:22,079
what was kind of the inspiration to

4369
02:18:20,159 --> 02:18:24,478
initially start the clothing brand in

4370
02:18:22,079 --> 02:18:26,478
general it obviously pre-dates a lot of

4371
02:18:24,478 --> 02:18:28,799
the other currently popular clothing

4372
02:18:26,478 --> 02:18:32,318
brands like cookies and all that

4373
02:18:28,799 --> 02:18:36,799
sure we literally um

4374
02:18:32,318 --> 02:18:38,398
started selling hemp clothing in 1993

4375
02:18:36,799 --> 02:18:39,920
after i quit working for so i was

4376
02:18:38,398 --> 02:18:42,159
working when i was working at scentsy we

4377
02:18:39,920 --> 02:18:43,519
used to sell a shirt that was called

4378
02:18:42,159 --> 02:18:44,718
stoned wear and probably

4379
02:18:43,519 --> 02:18:46,000
people some of the people who listened

4380
02:18:44,718 --> 02:18:47,839
to this probably had one of these it was

4381
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:51,280
like the original hemp

4382
02:18:47,840 --> 02:18:53,679
jean shirt right long sleeve jean

4383
02:18:51,280 --> 02:18:55,040
shirt thing and it was like had a really

4384
02:18:53,679 --> 02:18:55,920
cool patch and it had really cool

4385
02:18:55,040 --> 02:18:58,000
buttons

4386
02:18:55,920 --> 02:18:59,760
it was quite thin the material it wasn't

4387
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:01,200
really like super robust but it was the

4388
02:18:59,760 --> 02:19:03,439
only hem product that

4389
02:19:01,200 --> 02:19:05,200
that we sold and so we sold tons and

4390
02:19:03,439 --> 02:19:06,639
tons of these shirts and then when i

4391
02:19:05,200 --> 02:19:09,359
started so then when i

4392
02:19:06,638 --> 02:19:11,679
left scentsy part of the reason i left

4393
02:19:09,359 --> 02:19:14,000
is because i was really into the idea of

4394
02:19:11,679 --> 02:19:16,000
selling hemp and they didn't really have

4395
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:18,398
the inspiration that i was

4396
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:19,920
seeing to get more hemp products and

4397
02:19:18,398 --> 02:19:20,718
there wasn't really a lot available at

4398
02:19:19,920 --> 02:19:23,840
that time

4399
02:19:20,718 --> 02:19:26,079
so then when i so then i left there

4400
02:19:23,840 --> 02:19:27,439
and literally ben drunker's like got me

4401
02:19:26,079 --> 02:19:29,120
you know kind of came

4402
02:19:27,439 --> 02:19:31,200
got me over by the doorway and was like

4403
02:19:29,120 --> 02:19:33,359
hey you know good luck with everything

4404
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:34,719
and you know hope you can find that hemp

4405
02:19:33,359 --> 02:19:36,239
you know and it was like he had just

4406
02:19:34,718 --> 02:19:37,678
started hempflex at the time so he was

4407
02:19:36,239 --> 02:19:38,879
about to start growing him because of

4408
02:19:37,679 --> 02:19:40,318
his frustrations of

4409
02:19:38,879 --> 02:19:41,920
that there wasn't enough hemp around you

4410
02:19:40,318 --> 02:19:43,679
know and so

4411
02:19:41,920 --> 02:19:45,280
uh in the beginning i just sold other

4412
02:19:43,679 --> 02:19:46,318
people's hemp clothing and it was like i

4413
02:19:45,280 --> 02:19:49,359
was getting

4414
02:19:46,318 --> 02:19:51,519
some pretty wonky stuff and it was like

4415
02:19:49,359 --> 02:19:52,800
i was forcing myself to wear some of the

4416
02:19:51,520 --> 02:19:54,239
gear just because i was trying to

4417
02:19:52,799 --> 02:19:56,559
promote it you know i had like

4418
02:19:54,239 --> 02:19:58,559
overalls that were too short in the legs

4419
02:19:56,559 --> 02:20:00,079
and kind of goofy and just weird weird

4420
02:19:58,559 --> 02:20:02,159
weird stuff that i wasn't really

4421
02:20:00,079 --> 02:20:04,719
thinking was like fashionable and

4422
02:20:02,159 --> 02:20:06,000
and then we um was working with a

4423
02:20:04,719 --> 02:20:07,840
company called thc

4424
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:09,520
that had some italian hemp that was

4425
02:20:07,840 --> 02:20:11,840
beautiful like italian processed

4426
02:20:09,520 --> 02:20:13,120
hemp products that were amazing and they

4427
02:20:11,840 --> 02:20:15,200
had 100

4428
02:20:13,120 --> 02:20:16,640
but the problem was again they're there

4429
02:20:15,200 --> 02:20:17,680
so the quality was there everything but

4430
02:20:16,639 --> 02:20:19,279
the prices were just

4431
02:20:17,680 --> 02:20:21,040
outrageous they were over 100 bucks for

4432
02:20:19,280 --> 02:20:23,200
a pair of jeans and this is back in the

4433
02:20:21,040 --> 02:20:24,080
90s i was like oh my god a hundred

4434
02:20:23,200 --> 02:20:26,000
dollars

4435
02:20:24,079 --> 02:20:28,159
you know and i was like well this is you

4436
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:29,680
know 100 is 200 gilders so it's like

4437
02:20:28,159 --> 02:20:31,119
we're trying to charge 200 guilders for

4438
02:20:29,680 --> 02:20:33,120
a pair of jeans

4439
02:20:31,120 --> 02:20:35,040
and people were just like you know

4440
02:20:33,120 --> 02:20:36,399
couldn't get their head around it

4441
02:20:35,040 --> 02:20:38,319
so then we started making our own

4442
02:20:36,398 --> 02:20:41,358
products and but

4443
02:20:38,318 --> 02:20:42,159
uh you know we imported all the material

4444
02:20:41,359 --> 02:20:45,760
from china

4445
02:20:42,159 --> 02:20:46,239
and the 100 hemp was always very rough

4446
02:20:45,760 --> 02:20:49,760
and very

4447
02:20:46,239 --> 02:20:52,478
burlappy and not conducive to

4448
02:20:49,760 --> 02:20:52,960
making good quality clothes so we

4449
02:20:52,478 --> 02:20:55,199
actually

4450
02:20:52,959 --> 02:20:58,159
did a we actually had a bunch of 100

4451
02:20:55,200 --> 02:21:00,240
stuff made and it was like

4452
02:20:58,159 --> 02:21:01,920
looked more like the flintstones you

4453
02:21:00,239 --> 02:21:03,760
know what i mean like as far as just the

4454
02:21:01,920 --> 02:21:05,200
the threads coming out the thickness of

4455
02:21:03,760 --> 02:21:09,200
the thread and stuff

4456
02:21:05,200 --> 02:21:10,960
um but now we could do 100

4457
02:21:09,200 --> 02:21:12,640
and we might get the price to a point

4458
02:21:10,959 --> 02:21:13,679
where people might be willing to pay for

4459
02:21:12,639 --> 02:21:17,599
it but

4460
02:21:13,680 --> 02:21:20,559
um we still feel like the blends are are

4461
02:21:17,600 --> 02:21:22,720
you know an easier way to get people

4462
02:21:20,559 --> 02:21:24,799
interested without them

4463
02:21:22,719 --> 02:21:26,559
because the worst thing is to have

4464
02:21:24,799 --> 02:21:29,279
somebody buy something

4465
02:21:26,559 --> 02:21:31,439
and then to me like the most on eco

4466
02:21:29,280 --> 02:21:33,200
thing is when you buy a

4467
02:21:31,439 --> 02:21:35,600
some clothing and you don't wear it

4468
02:21:33,200 --> 02:21:36,720
because when for one reason or another

4469
02:21:35,600 --> 02:21:38,880
like you open up your

4470
02:21:36,719 --> 02:21:40,559
if you open up your your your closet and

4471
02:21:38,879 --> 02:21:41,839
there's a bunch of hemp gear in there

4472
02:21:40,559 --> 02:21:42,959
that you never wear where you're not

4473
02:21:41,840 --> 02:21:44,719
really

4474
02:21:42,959 --> 02:21:46,478
helping out anybody are you you know but

4475
02:21:44,719 --> 02:21:48,239
if you have something that you wear

4476
02:21:46,478 --> 02:21:49,760
until it's fallen off your body because

4477
02:21:48,239 --> 02:21:51,280
they're wearing it so much then that to

4478
02:21:49,760 --> 02:21:52,719
me is the most eco

4479
02:21:51,280 --> 02:21:54,000
minded so even in the beginning like

4480
02:21:52,719 --> 02:21:56,159
when people would be like yeah but your

4481
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:57,920
dye's not eco and it was like

4482
02:21:56,159 --> 02:21:59,280
we tried that we actually worked with

4483
02:21:57,920 --> 02:22:01,280
some eco dyes and

4484
02:21:59,280 --> 02:22:02,960
they ruined all the other clothes that

4485
02:22:01,280 --> 02:22:04,720
people would have so they would never

4486
02:22:02,959 --> 02:22:06,079
want to buy your clothes again because

4487
02:22:04,719 --> 02:22:07,358
they bought that shirt off of you they

4488
02:22:06,079 --> 02:22:09,039
put it in the laundry with all their

4489
02:22:07,359 --> 02:22:11,200
other stuff because that's what they do

4490
02:22:09,040 --> 02:22:12,319
even though you put on the label washed

4491
02:22:11,200 --> 02:22:13,600
separately

4492
02:22:12,318 --> 02:22:15,680
they don't listen you know what i mean

4493
02:22:13,600 --> 02:22:17,040
people people just don't listen people

4494
02:22:15,680 --> 02:22:18,239
are yeah

4495
02:22:17,040 --> 02:22:19,520
people take it they throw it in the

4496
02:22:18,239 --> 02:22:21,039
thing they treat it like everything else

4497
02:22:19,520 --> 02:22:22,880
and if it doesn't work they'll never do

4498
02:22:21,040 --> 02:22:23,600
it again and so that that that to me is

4499
02:22:22,879 --> 02:22:25,839
a

4500
02:22:23,600 --> 02:22:27,359
the kind of you know the the stickling

4501
02:22:25,840 --> 02:22:30,159
point a sticking point between

4502
02:22:27,359 --> 02:22:31,520
doing 100 help and doing a blended

4503
02:22:30,159 --> 02:22:34,799
blends of him

4504
02:22:31,520 --> 02:22:36,319
yeah makes a lot of sense so

4505
02:22:34,799 --> 02:22:39,358
what is your preferred growth style

4506
02:22:36,318 --> 02:22:42,639
synthetic or organic and why

4507
02:22:39,359 --> 02:22:44,960
um oh 20 organic um

4508
02:22:42,639 --> 02:22:46,879
you know i i i was a victim of every

4509
02:22:44,959 --> 02:22:48,959
single

4510
02:22:46,879 --> 02:22:50,000
over-tech way of growing when i first

4511
02:22:48,959 --> 02:22:53,279
moved to holland it was all

4512
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:54,478
about hydro i was in the land of hydro i

4513
02:22:53,280 --> 02:22:56,159
wanted to build i didn't even want to

4514
02:22:54,478 --> 02:22:56,478
have soil i wanted i didn't even want to

4515
02:22:56,159 --> 02:22:59,119
have

4516
02:22:56,478 --> 02:23:00,318
medium i just wanted to do aeroponics i

4517
02:22:59,120 --> 02:23:02,640
was

4518
02:23:00,318 --> 02:23:07,119
a general hydroponics distributor

4519
02:23:02,639 --> 02:23:10,159
between 95 and 97

4520
02:23:07,120 --> 02:23:11,280
so i was like introducing general hydro

4521
02:23:10,159 --> 02:23:13,520
to everybody

4522
02:23:11,280 --> 02:23:14,399
i was totally all about it you know i

4523
02:23:13,520 --> 02:23:15,920
was like uh

4524
02:23:14,398 --> 02:23:18,478
and then at a certain point i remember

4525
02:23:15,920 --> 02:23:20,960
just like throwing all that [ __ ] away

4526
02:23:18,478 --> 02:23:23,039
and going back to soil and realizing

4527
02:23:20,959 --> 02:23:24,318
like oh my god this is so much better

4528
02:23:23,040 --> 02:23:27,200
for

4529
02:23:24,318 --> 02:23:28,799
for just all around flavors making seeds

4530
02:23:27,200 --> 02:23:29,439
i would never make seeds on hydro it's

4531
02:23:28,799 --> 02:23:32,478
always on

4532
02:23:29,439 --> 02:23:33,359
soil you know so it's just the mineral

4533
02:23:32,478 --> 02:23:34,478
contents a lot

4534
02:23:33,359 --> 02:23:36,000
it i just feel like the connection

4535
02:23:34,478 --> 02:23:37,519
between the minerals that you get from

4536
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,478
the soil compared to what you get from

4537
02:23:37,520 --> 02:23:41,840
salts

4538
02:23:38,478 --> 02:23:45,599
is so much different like just vibe wise

4539
02:23:41,840 --> 02:23:49,280
and then when you're making seeds

4540
02:23:45,600 --> 02:23:51,520
you know you really there's a lot of

4541
02:23:49,280 --> 02:23:53,520
there's really no formula on the market

4542
02:23:51,520 --> 02:23:54,880
that's made for making seeds it's always

4543
02:23:53,520 --> 02:23:56,960
you know you're growing or you're

4544
02:23:54,879 --> 02:23:58,559
flowering that's it there's different

4545
02:23:56,959 --> 02:24:00,478
you know pregnant women don't need the

4546
02:23:58,559 --> 02:24:02,000
same food as

4547
02:24:00,478 --> 02:24:04,159
non-pregnant women you know because

4548
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:06,398
their bodies are going through changes

4549
02:24:04,159 --> 02:24:07,760
and the baby needs something different

4550
02:24:06,398 --> 02:24:09,199
than the mother needs and it's the same

4551
02:24:07,760 --> 02:24:09,840
when you're making seeds you know so i

4552
02:24:09,200 --> 02:24:11,920
feel like

4553
02:24:09,840 --> 02:24:13,760
when you grow us organically there's

4554
02:24:11,920 --> 02:24:15,359
going to be a completely different shift

4555
02:24:13,760 --> 02:24:17,359
the way the plant needs but it's all

4556
02:24:15,359 --> 02:24:20,479
available because you just you give them

4557
02:24:17,359 --> 02:24:22,159
everything they need compared to like

4558
02:24:20,478 --> 02:24:23,438
trying to you know and now over the

4559
02:24:22,159 --> 02:24:24,959
years i thought oh maybe i should make

4560
02:24:23,439 --> 02:24:27,200
like a synthetic

4561
02:24:24,959 --> 02:24:28,000
food for making seeds that'd be cool but

4562
02:24:27,200 --> 02:24:29,439
i also think

4563
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:32,239
some things you can't fix you know or

4564
02:24:29,439 --> 02:24:34,479
you can't make better than nature so

4565
02:24:32,239 --> 02:24:36,079
yeah and ever since doing my show i'm

4566
02:24:34,478 --> 02:24:39,199
now more now

4567
02:24:36,079 --> 02:24:42,398
no tills come into my world and

4568
02:24:39,200 --> 02:24:44,560
that's so much more satisfying and

4569
02:24:42,398 --> 02:24:46,159
the inputs that go involved and also i

4570
02:24:44,559 --> 02:24:49,119
have like a

4571
02:24:46,159 --> 02:24:50,719
farm here in colorado so i'm living in

4572
02:24:49,120 --> 02:24:52,079
the middle of nature so the last thing i

4573
02:24:50,719 --> 02:24:54,159
want to do is

4574
02:24:52,079 --> 02:24:55,840
grow synthetically and uh and not be

4575
02:24:54,159 --> 02:24:57,359
able to utilize everything that i'm

4576
02:24:55,840 --> 02:25:00,000
doing and what i'll do is

4577
02:24:57,359 --> 02:25:02,159
you know use a raised beds for all the

4578
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:04,000
old soil and stuff and

4579
02:25:02,159 --> 02:25:05,680
recycle everything properly it's just

4580
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:08,159
it's a much better feeling and i

4581
02:25:05,680 --> 02:25:09,600
i only eat organic food now and i'm

4582
02:25:08,159 --> 02:25:12,799
pretty much you know

4583
02:25:09,600 --> 02:25:16,079
i'm over i'm over all the idea of of

4584
02:25:12,799 --> 02:25:19,279
uh of synthetics

4585
02:25:16,079 --> 02:25:20,639
yeah almost really you know so a bit of

4586
02:25:19,280 --> 02:25:23,200
an interesting question

4587
02:25:20,639 --> 02:25:24,959
what is your least favorite strain

4588
02:25:23,200 --> 02:25:30,079
throughout all of history that you've

4589
02:25:24,959 --> 02:25:30,079
sadly had the pleasure of trying um

4590
02:25:30,398 --> 02:25:33,439
yeah you know to be quite honest one of

4591
02:25:31,840 --> 02:25:36,318
the ones was the

4592
02:25:33,439 --> 02:25:37,040
psalmist [ __ ] diesel was because it

4593
02:25:36,318 --> 02:25:40,318
it tastes

4594
02:25:37,040 --> 02:25:41,920
terrible like it has like the it has and

4595
02:25:40,318 --> 02:25:43,199
it got such a big amount of hype in

4596
02:25:41,920 --> 02:25:46,000
holland

4597
02:25:43,200 --> 02:25:47,520
it was the the hot ticket item you know

4598
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:49,680
what i mean and it was just like it

4599
02:25:47,520 --> 02:25:50,560
never delivered like it smells really

4600
02:25:49,680 --> 02:25:53,600
good

4601
02:25:50,559 --> 02:25:54,879
it looks really good it tastes terrible

4602
02:25:53,600 --> 02:25:55,760
and it just doesn't get me high you know

4603
02:25:54,879 --> 02:25:57,519
what i mean so that was one of those

4604
02:25:55,760 --> 02:26:00,398
strains that it just

4605
02:25:57,520 --> 02:26:01,040
took me it it always it just it it was

4606
02:26:00,398 --> 02:26:03,119
like a

4607
02:26:01,040 --> 02:26:04,640
huge disappointment like if anybody ever

4608
02:26:03,120 --> 02:26:06,160
says like something oh dude

4609
02:26:04,639 --> 02:26:08,559
oh look i got diesel and i'd be like

4610
02:26:06,159 --> 02:26:10,318
sour no

4611
02:26:08,559 --> 02:26:12,159
it's almond i'm like oh and that was

4612
02:26:10,318 --> 02:26:13,359
like so i think that was one of the ones

4613
02:26:12,159 --> 02:26:14,959
and i wouldn't say it's the worst

4614
02:26:13,359 --> 02:26:15,359
variety but it was the least sad it was

4615
02:26:14,959 --> 02:26:18,478
the

4616
02:26:15,359 --> 02:26:20,479
the one that bummed me out just every

4617
02:26:18,478 --> 02:26:22,478
time like bums me out

4618
02:26:20,478 --> 02:26:24,719
yeah what about your favorite of all

4619
02:26:22,478 --> 02:26:24,719
time

4620
02:26:26,079 --> 02:26:31,840
favorite of all time is nothing that any

4621
02:26:29,120 --> 02:26:35,760
of us have ever grown it was a tie

4622
02:26:31,840 --> 02:26:38,239
it's a 1985

4623
02:26:35,760 --> 02:26:39,680
purple tie that kind of flooded the east

4624
02:26:38,239 --> 02:26:40,159
coast for a little while and i actually

4625
02:26:39,680 --> 02:26:42,000
met

4626
02:26:40,159 --> 02:26:43,920
the one of the main guys who brought it

4627
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:45,520
in at one point where i

4628
02:26:43,920 --> 02:26:47,120
was we were talking about you know back

4629
02:26:45,520 --> 02:26:48,319
in the day and old times and stuff and i

4630
02:26:47,120 --> 02:26:49,840
was explaining and he's like oh that

4631
02:26:48,318 --> 02:26:51,359
those are the loads i brought into

4632
02:26:49,840 --> 02:26:53,840
into rhode island and i was like oh

4633
02:26:51,359 --> 02:26:56,720
those were amazing it was just like this

4634
02:26:53,840 --> 02:26:58,639
super slow burning purple tie thing that

4635
02:26:56,719 --> 02:27:01,119
was like tiny little buds

4636
02:26:58,639 --> 02:27:02,239
and just amazing and yeah you just don't

4637
02:27:01,120 --> 02:27:03,280
see because you know and it probably

4638
02:27:02,239 --> 02:27:04,079
wasn't from thailand i'm sure it was

4639
02:27:03,280 --> 02:27:06,399
from

4640
02:27:04,079 --> 02:27:08,799
it was probably ocean or something but

4641
02:27:06,398 --> 02:27:12,478
for the most part it was uh

4642
02:27:08,799 --> 02:27:16,639
um you know most memorable

4643
02:27:12,478 --> 02:27:19,679
thing that i've ever had yeah wow

4644
02:27:16,639 --> 02:27:20,559
okay so lucky last question if you could

4645
02:27:19,680 --> 02:27:23,520
go back to

4646
02:27:20,559 --> 02:27:25,039
one place in history and geography to

4647
02:27:23,520 --> 02:27:28,399
collect land race seeds where would you

4648
02:27:25,040 --> 02:27:28,399
go and from what time period

4649
02:27:28,840 --> 02:27:36,239
um probably in the same region like in

4650
02:27:32,639 --> 02:27:39,358
leos um basically every vietnam vet

4651
02:27:36,239 --> 02:27:40,879
out there always has the best weed

4652
02:27:39,359 --> 02:27:43,040
that's always been the case like it

4653
02:27:40,879 --> 02:27:44,318
seems like in america like wow this

4654
02:27:43,040 --> 02:27:47,439
needs america amazing where did you get

4655
02:27:44,318 --> 02:27:49,840
it from i was just vietnam vet

4656
02:27:47,439 --> 02:27:51,120
and they always and the thing is that

4657
02:27:49,840 --> 02:27:52,478
everybody there would always tell me

4658
02:27:51,120 --> 02:27:55,280
that

4659
02:27:52,478 --> 02:27:56,079
the laotian weed was psychedelic you

4660
02:27:55,280 --> 02:27:58,159
know

4661
02:27:56,079 --> 02:27:59,120
i mean and these are people who took a

4662
02:27:58,159 --> 02:28:00,879
lot of psychedelics so

4663
02:27:59,120 --> 02:28:02,800
they wouldn't they wouldn't say it i'm

4664
02:28:00,879 --> 02:28:06,639
not understanding it you know

4665
02:28:02,799 --> 02:28:08,639
um and i feel like that that

4666
02:28:06,639 --> 02:28:10,159
would be probably some of the more

4667
02:28:08,639 --> 02:28:12,000
unique things out there because it's

4668
02:28:10,159 --> 02:28:12,398
such a hard plan to grow too so it's

4669
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,318
like

4670
02:28:12,398 --> 02:28:16,159
a lot of hermaphrodites a lot of issues

4671
02:28:14,318 --> 02:28:18,079
like that so

4672
02:28:16,159 --> 02:28:19,359
so i think um but it still would be

4673
02:28:18,079 --> 02:28:20,559
great to find something out of there

4674
02:28:19,359 --> 02:28:22,479
that was

4675
02:28:20,559 --> 02:28:24,159
super electric also that kawhi electric

4676
02:28:22,478 --> 02:28:26,159
was one of those ones i wish i could get

4677
02:28:24,159 --> 02:28:28,239
my hands on

4678
02:28:26,159 --> 02:28:30,159
and that's something that i've heard

4679
02:28:28,239 --> 02:28:32,559
over the years from friends which just

4680
02:28:30,159 --> 02:28:33,760
sounds so amazing but i i actually went

4681
02:28:32,559 --> 02:28:37,119
on a hunt for it

4682
02:28:33,760 --> 02:28:38,318
around 2005 but i met people who grew it

4683
02:28:37,120 --> 02:28:40,399
and i met people who

4684
02:28:38,318 --> 02:28:41,519
knew the guys who would go to the power

4685
02:28:40,398 --> 02:28:43,840
lines and

4686
02:28:41,520 --> 02:28:46,960
collect it and etc but but it never got

4687
02:28:43,840 --> 02:28:46,960
a chance to actually try it

4688
02:28:48,398 --> 02:28:52,079
yeah wow i mean i guess we can only hope

4689
02:28:50,478 --> 02:28:54,398
it pops its head up again

4690
02:28:52,079 --> 02:28:56,879
with that being said any shout outs or

4691

it's been a struggle you know it's one

4717
02:29:42,398 --> 02:29:44,639
of those things over the years of doing

4718

this um

4719
02:29:44,639 --> 02:29:48,398

everybody has the same vision that you

4721
02:29:48,398 --> 02:29:51,680
have but

4722
02:29:49,280 --> 02:29:54,159

and not get not get eaten up which is

4731

4732
02:30:10,799 --> 02:30:13,438
