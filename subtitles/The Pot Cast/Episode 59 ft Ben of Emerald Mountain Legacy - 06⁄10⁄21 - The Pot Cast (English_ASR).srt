00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:17,418
people what have you been smoking on

112
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:20,599
today

113
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:25,019
a little bit of

114
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:28,080
uh oil spill and uh a little garlic

115
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:30,719
mince as well that A friend gave me

116
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,978
oh nice garlic mints that's that's an

117
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,660
interesting one is there like a little

118
00:04:31,978 --> 00:04:37,258
garlic coming through on that one or

119
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:40,320
more of the wedding mints uh definitely

120
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:43,080
garlic forward it's you know it's

121
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,879
I think it's pretty similar to GMO the

122
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:48,418
cushman's is kind of hidden in the back

123
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:50,759
for sure yeah okay and I mean what's

124
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:53,099
your thoughts and preferences on things

125
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:55,740
like the GMO and the chemd are you

126
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:59,400
generally a fan yeah you know

127
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:01,379
I'm not generally a big fan of cookie

128
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:05,819
hybrids but that one in particular is

129
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:08,399
just amazing I really enjoy it uh GMO I

130
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:10,379
think is one of the more unique profiles

131
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,478
that's come out over the last

132
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:15,300
few years for sure

133
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:17,099
yeah interesting okay and I mean just

134
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,660
because a little bit of personal love

135
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,400
you know we love to talk about Kim dog

136
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:23,460
on the show have you ever been a big fan

137
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:26,339
of the chem dogs at all or not so much

138
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:29,159
yeah you know for me I really enjoy

139
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:32,099
chemdog hybrids I feel like you know

140
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:35,340
almost all of my favorites you know like

141
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:37,100
uh headband and Sour Diesel and you know

142
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:40,138
some of the ogs and stuff are all

143
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,820
relatives of chemdog and I enjoy all of

144
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:45,120
them but I really feel like it's a good

145
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:47,879
breeder and maybe like it chem dog

146
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,500
itself isn't my favorite smoke but like

147
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:50,519
almost everything you breed it with it's

148
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,038
great

149
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:54,719
yeah okay that's cool that's good to

150
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:57,659
hear and I mean you mentioned the oil

151
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,000
spill earlier that's one a lot of people

152
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,860
are interested in I guess you know sort

153
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,959
of out the gate how would you describe

154
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,939
the flavor the smell and the effect for

155
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:07,978
people who you know haven't been lucky

156
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:11,219
enough to come across it yet

157
00:06:07,978 --> 00:06:14,579
uh it's a unique one it you know

158
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,860
my favorite phenotypes or uh chemotypes

159
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:20,519
are

160
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:22,680
they have like a two-cycle engine oil

161
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:25,918
smell to them you know like it can be a

162
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:28,319
little bit propane-y sometimes but it's

163
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:31,258
um there's like burned Rubber and kind

164
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,900
of like Road tar and all these kind of

165
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:35,819
really noxious what you know like in

166
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:39,739
describing it it doesn't sound appealing

167
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:42,660
but it's really really special the the

168
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:45,180
smell and The Taste and

169
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:47,759
it's one of the most potent heavy

170
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:50,038
indicas or well it's not even a pure

171
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,680
Indica but it's incredibly mercy and

172
00:06:50,038 --> 00:06:56,459
dominant I've seen it test at like six

173
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:58,079
percent mercine before which is crazy so

174
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:59,879
it's a it's a good one for the real

175
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:01,318
heavy smokers

176
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:03,300
you know that description actually

177
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:05,220
sounds lovely to me I think a lot of

178
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,379
people are really into the sort of you

179
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,360
know the gas and the skunk and the burnt

180
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:11,038
rubber that sounds really appealing but

181
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,800
something that definitely caught my eye

182
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:16,199
about the oil spill was how it utilized

183
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,660
the triple X OG and I had been lucky

184
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,460
enough in the past to try some of that I

185
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:23,639
was so blown away by it I thought this

186
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:24,839
is like a sick OG it's so good but you

187
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:27,300
really don't see it getting a lot of

188
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:29,399
love from other breeders any idea why

189
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:32,280
that might be

190
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:35,159
it's a confusing situation because there

191
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:39,179
there are a few different cultivars that

192
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:43,259
have been called triple X OG uh the one

193
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:46,439
that we got a long time ago was from LA

194
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:49,139
and we got it like a friend of ours was

195
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:50,579
who named it triple X OG because he got

196
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:53,579
it from

197
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:55,620
uh small dispensary in the Bay Area that

198
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:57,959
was right next to a strip club and

199
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:00,120
that's how it got its name but there's

200
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:04,560
another triple X OG out there that's

201
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:06,598
purple and it's not that gassy and you

202
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,720
know that I'm not sure exactly where it

203
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:13,439
all got confused but the XXX that we use

204
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:16,440
is green and it's super pungent and it's

205
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:19,139
a real OG it's not like uh you know

206
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:21,240
watered down at all so

207
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:23,460
um sometimes people are like Oh you mean

208
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,098
this and it's not what a lot of people

209
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:27,359
think of it's triple X so

210
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:27,959
you know

211
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,620
um

212
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:34,740
but it's one of the earlier ogs that we

213
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:38,940
got our hands on maybe 20 years ago or

214
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:41,158
15 years ago at least yeah wow okay I

215
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,959
mean generally speaking that sort of

216
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:44,519
checks out with the one I tried I

217
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:47,458
remember it was like a bright electric

218
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:49,860
green and it just full-on like lime

219
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:52,859
flavor like pure lime sort of thing does

220
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,759
that sound right to you yeah lime and

221
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:57,419
like

222
00:08:53,759 --> 00:09:00,120
that chem funk you know like yeah in the

223
00:08:57,419 --> 00:09:04,139
background yeah easily sort of okay cool

224
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:06,179
and so the oil spill seeds that are

225
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:09,179
available through Emerald Mountain

226
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:10,919
Legacy today are they quite similar to

227
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:12,719
sort of the original ones or is there

228
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:14,579
any sort of changes in any of the

229
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,540
parents

230
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,339
um well

231
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:20,399
what we try to do

232
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:24,420
for the most part is to keep the the

233
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:27,958
jeans pretty open so you can find a

234
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:30,360
range in the seeds that we put out some

235
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:32,219
are leaning more toward the Royal and

236
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,899
some more to the XXX

237
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,459
and you know with our back cross

238
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:37,620
projects that's a lot of the time what

239
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:40,439
we're trying to do is to keep

240
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:42,480
a wide array of phenotypes that are all

241
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,760
good though you know like it's not like

242
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,100
a total crap shoot but we have

243
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:48,299
our selections and we use three males a

244
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:51,420
lot of the time

245
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:54,120
so that you can kind of find a range

246
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:58,740
uh in there you know but my favorites

247
00:09:54,120 --> 00:10:02,159
are definitely the The Greener uh

248
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:04,200
more chem funky in the gassy ones and

249
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:05,819
not the the ones that lead into the

250
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:10,140
Royal you know

251
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:11,820
okay I mean something I had heard from a

252
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:14,699
variety of different people who were

253
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:17,399
really fond of the brand was that they

254
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:19,440
always mentioned the emerald Legacy

255
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:21,600
seeds or just emerald seeds in the

256
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,060
context of outdoor and how well they

257
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,040
would do outdoor is that sort of a focal

258
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:28,199
part of the breeding is to sort of cater

259
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:30,360
for that outdoor Market or it'll or it

260
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:34,259
sort of just happened to be that way

261
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:36,778
uh no that's been our goal all along for

262
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:39,120
sure you know we started out in coastal

263
00:10:36,778 --> 00:10:40,980
Mendocino where you couldn't grow

264
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,839
anything gassy back in the day because

265
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,899
of the climate you know like it just

266
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:47,700
couldn't tolerate it so

267
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:49,980
we we started out just trying to breed

268
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:52,200
for ourselves and to make something that

269
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:54,600
was gassy and appealing to the market

270
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:57,240
that you could grow in our wet climate

271
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,220
you know like we were in Albion in

272
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,799
Mendocino County where it's you know

273
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,959
foggy and wet all through summer and

274
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:05,639
then it rains a lot in the fall you know

275
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:07,799
and um

276
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:10,559
so that's we were initially just

277
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:13,500
breeding for our own use that's how we

278
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:16,259
started but over the years we've you

279
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:18,600
know gotten a reputation for

280
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:20,700
breeding stuff that can perform well in

281
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,579
difficult climates and that's definitely

282
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:26,339
what people come to us

283
00:11:23,578 --> 00:11:27,120
yeah really really solid point there for

284
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:29,760
sure

285
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,919
I guess just to loop back to the XXX for

286
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:35,519
a moment you've got me curious now

287
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:37,919
what's your all-time favorite OG

288
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:41,220
oh that's a hard one

289
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:43,799
I think the XXX you know because it to

290
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:47,579
me it was one of the first you know it's

291
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:50,819
a more authentic OG if you ask me

292
00:11:47,578 --> 00:11:54,120
um like the sfv and the triplex or the

293
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:57,240
only ogs I knew of 20 years ago you know

294
00:11:54,120 --> 00:12:00,299
and uh there are a lot of other good

295
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,278
ones and variations you know but for me

296
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:04,259
like when I think of OG that's what I

297
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:06,600
think of I don't I don't consider a lot

298
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:10,259
of the newer versions to be the

299
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:12,420
authentic real deal you know so I mean

300
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:14,939
there's a lot of discussion around OG in

301
00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:17,399
the community and a lot of people sort

302
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:19,920
of tend to agree with each other that

303
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:21,778
they think the TK might have been the

304
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:25,139
first or one of the first along with say

305
00:12:21,778 --> 00:12:27,419
the ghost my question to you is these

306
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:29,939
other ogs that have come out slightly

307
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:33,179
afterwards maybe the sfv maybe the XXX

308
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:35,880
do you think that they were crosses with

309
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:38,819
males or more probably just s ones from

310
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:40,679
the original I think it was Bank seed I

311
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:44,040
think they were accidental

312
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:46,859
creations and the TK was definitely

313
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:49,439
around sooner but it wasn't in Southern

314
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,778
California I don't think I think for

315
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,120
SoCal and like that

316
00:12:51,778 --> 00:12:57,539
Market I think that the triple X was

317
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,459
more prevalent earlier than the TK was

318
00:12:57,539 --> 00:13:02,278
but like in Florida

319
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:04,919
you know the TK was around earlier I

320
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:07,379
would say but just from my recollection

321
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:11,099
and you know this is 20 plus years ago

322
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:12,778
but the way I remember it is the sfv and

323
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:16,200
the um

324
00:13:12,778 --> 00:13:17,399
triple X were more dominant earlier in

325
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,800
California

326
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:24,179
wow there you go that's that's cool to

327
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:26,578
hear okay so take me back what was your

328
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:28,919
first experience smoking cannabis

329
00:13:26,578 --> 00:13:33,599
oh that's the fun one

330
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:36,240
um I was 14 and it was my birthday and

331
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:40,320
my older sister took me to her friend

332
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:43,320
Bishop's house and they had this um

333
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,420
uh you know a big elaborate bong with

334
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,639
multi-chambers you know like honey bears

335
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:51,059
and acrylic tubes and all these tubes

336
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:53,940
going in between them all and I never

337
00:13:51,059 --> 00:13:55,979
smoked before took a huge bong hit like

338
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:57,660
way bigger than I should have and for

339
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:59,940
half an hour I was like oh I'm not even

340
00:13:57,659 --> 00:14:03,059
high and then I was [ __ ] asleep for

341
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:04,800
the rest of the day you know uh trying

342
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:07,319
to act all cool because I was with my

343
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:09,958
older siblings and [ __ ] you know

344
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,200
remember that super clearly

345
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:15,359
there you go and I guess the question is

346
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:17,220
did you sort of have like an epiphany

347
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,139
moment at that point thinking like wow

348
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,879
this is something I could really sort of

349
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:23,519
become a part of or did that sort of

350
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:25,500
become more evident later on

351
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,659
no I you know I hit the ground running

352
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:30,778
for sure uh

353
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:32,100
started at 14 which is pretty young you

354
00:14:30,778 --> 00:14:34,860
know and

355
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:37,920
um I was a big fan of the the culture of

356
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:41,278
it like not just smoking but

357
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:44,759
uh you know I was raised by liberal

358
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:47,039
activists political types spin just the

359
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:48,539
fact that it was illegal and it was you

360
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,278
know kind of this counterculture thing

361
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:53,219
that was really drawn to that

362
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:54,600
yeah gosh I mean I can only imagine what

363
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:57,000
that would have been like growing up it

364
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,278
would have been awesome like do you sort

365
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,259
of have any you know memories that

366
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:04,019
jumped to mind about what it was like

367
00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:06,539
growing up in what largely could be

368
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:08,459
described as like the epicenter of

369
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:09,778
worldwide cannabis it must have been an

370
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:12,119
interesting experience

371
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:15,120
yeah you know and we had a kind of a

372
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,919
unique perspective on it because we were

373
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,039
born in San Francisco

374
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:24,360
and we lived there until I was six and

375
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:26,698
uh brought or Mac or was 12. and we

376
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:29,220
moved to Montana because my mom needed

377
00:15:26,698 --> 00:15:32,039
to be near her parents who were you know

378
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:35,160
elderly and sick and needed family

379
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:37,019
nearby so we lived in like the liberal

380
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:39,059
Bastion of

381
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:41,060
San Francisco and then we moved to a

382
00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:44,099
conservative area in Montana

383
00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:46,859
and we were hippies and like you know we

384
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:50,519
didn't fit in quite right and it was a

385
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:53,100
shock you know to our systems and

386
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:56,759
um so as soon like when

387
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:58,320
Mack was 15 he moved or he went on tour

388
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:00,179
and then came back to California and

389
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,339
then you know a few years later when I

390
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:03,899
turned 15 I did the same thing I just as

391
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:05,579
soon as I can get out of the house I

392
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:07,259
came back to California and I've been

393
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:10,019
here pretty much ever since

394
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:13,259
okay wow and I mean when you first moved

395
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:15,539
back what was sort of the real hot spots

396
00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:17,100
in the area for cannabis production is

397
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:18,899
it were they still largely speaking the

398
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,519
same ones as today or was the landscape

399
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:22,919
a little different back then

400
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:27,959
yeah I would say it's more or less the

401
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:32,039
same but we so when I was 15 I came out

402
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:34,619
and Mac had um established a little

403
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:36,419
project in Albion in Mendocino County

404
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:38,278
and

405
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:40,259
you know it was kind of the Heyday of

406
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:41,820
cannabis or the prices were incredibly

407
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:43,980
High and

408
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:46,980
you know you can grow a really small

409
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,879
scale and do very well for yourself and

410
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,100
um

411
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:52,679
so it was you know it was kind of the

412
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:55,440
Glory Days where you could grow like 50

413
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:57,958
pounds and do very well for yourself you

414
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,699
know and the climate here was very good

415
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:02,039
for quality

416
00:16:59,698 --> 00:17:04,019
you know you don't get big yields and

417
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:07,318
all that but you can grow incredible

418
00:17:04,019 --> 00:17:11,039
quality stuff near the coast for sure

419
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:13,918
and uh so you know

420
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:17,119
it was both a great place to grow but

421
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:21,000
also politically and just the community

422
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:22,259
here was amazing so we were drawn to

423
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,439
that for sure

424
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:27,058
wow okay and I mean what sort of strains

425
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,100
were they growing back at that time

426
00:17:27,058 --> 00:17:30,899
because you mentioned that you know some

427
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:33,539
of the more gassy stuff didn't do too

428
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:35,519
well and I'm sure that extends to even

429
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:37,200
more genetics than just the gassy so I

430
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:39,179
guess I'm sort of wondering what did do

431
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,058
well there at that time

432
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:44,700
uh

433
00:17:41,058 --> 00:17:48,298
we started with you know like Salmon

434
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:50,580
Creek big bud and um there were like

435
00:17:48,298 --> 00:17:53,819
Highland Afghani like before people

436
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:56,159
started calling it OG or you know this

437
00:17:53,819 --> 00:17:59,460
or that there were like some Afghani

438
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:02,580
land race stuff you know like from the

439
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:04,980
high mountains in Afghanistan and that's

440
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:07,740
what we started with for the most part

441
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,940
that and the big bud and you know a few

442
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,079
other things

443
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,298
um

444
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:14,220
that when we got access to them we

445
00:18:12,298 --> 00:18:18,119
started growing a lot of Sour Diesel and

446
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:20,460
OG and uh headband and stuff but that we

447
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:21,918
didn't have right off the bat so we were

448
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:24,240
kind of working with what the local

449
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,759
folks around here had

450
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,620
okay sure and I mean I know you're

451
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:31,079
friends with the guy I mean Jane we had

452
00:18:28,619 --> 00:18:32,519
him on not too long ago and there's a

453
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:34,379
there's a few strains he remembers

454
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:36,298
growing up with that he sort of wished

455
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:39,000
he still had access to are there any

456
00:18:36,298 --> 00:18:41,519
that sort of fit that criteria for you

457
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,720
yeah totally I was just talking to a

458
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:46,019
friend today

459
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,880
um you know like the Trinity from Eugene

460
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:50,279
area

461
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,200
uh that one one of the best I've ever

462
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:54,119
seen but I haven't seen it in a long

463
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,519
time and I just saw on Instagram today a

464
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:58,918
friend posted a picture and he was like

465
00:18:56,519 --> 00:19:01,619
I got the Trinity and I you know I was

466
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:05,460
kind of shocked so I'm excited to see if

467
00:19:01,619 --> 00:19:06,119
I can get that one back uh what else

468
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:10,319
um

469
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:13,259
I don't know uh yeah I'd say Sour Diesel

470
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:15,359
and Trinity and you know like Hindu Kush

471
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:16,859
there was a purple Hindu Kush that I

472
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:19,319
used to grow that was just [ __ ]

473
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:21,119
phenomenal and I can't get that one

474
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:24,599
anymore either you know a lot of the

475
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:26,819
best stuff has kind of Hidden Away you

476
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:29,159
know hard to find

477
00:19:26,819 --> 00:19:31,558
yeah it certainly seems like that I mean

478
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:33,480
hopefully some of those old Hindus pop

479
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:36,058
their heads back out I think you know I

480
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:38,819
mean Gene also mentioned that there was

481
00:19:36,058 --> 00:19:40,558
a few Cuts Hindu variety slash those

482
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:43,740
early Afghans that he was particularly

483
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:45,960
fond of but if we sort of fast forward a

484
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:48,000
little bit from your first grow uh your

485
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,400
first smoking experience

486
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,380
how did you then get involved with sort

487
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,298
of the growing climate did it come

488
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,980
shortly after or was there a bit of a

489
00:19:54,298 --> 00:19:58,079
time delay

490
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:59,880
it was a couple of years later but you

491
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,798
know I was super fortunate to have an

492
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,960
older brother who was six years older

493
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:07,019
and who had all the same interests as I

494
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:09,419
did you know so like I was not very many

495
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:11,038
15 year old kids got to just go work on

496
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:12,120
a pot farm you know drop out of high

497
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:16,079
school and

498
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:19,199
do that at that age you know so I I was

499
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:21,779
just super fortunate to be related to

500
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,100
my older brother and the you know kind

501
00:20:21,779 --> 00:20:26,279
of have that

502
00:20:23,099 --> 00:20:27,298
that entry at that time you know

503
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:30,660
um

504
00:20:27,298 --> 00:20:32,400
so for me it was just like it wasn't

505
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:34,620
even a choice it was just like here's

506
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,340
what you're obviously supposed to do you

507
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:36,359
know

508
00:20:35,339 --> 00:20:40,079
um

509
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:42,479
I don't know hard to describe I guess no

510
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:44,759
it sounds like you uh you were born into

511
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,038
it which sounds like a path I'm sure

512
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:49,558
many of us wish we had sort of the

513
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:51,839
opportunity to to walk down the way you

514
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:53,220
did I guess I'm sort of interested in

515
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,199
those early years you know when you're

516
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:57,179
first like for example I remember when I

517
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,038
first came to the States you know being

518
00:20:57,179 --> 00:21:01,440
from Australia it's obviously all lots

519
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:03,480
of just tense in people's

520
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,279
um you know cupboards here but when I

521
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,839
went to the States you know you see

522
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:08,639
these big facilities and you just you're

523
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:10,740
blown away and just everything's super

524
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,299
interesting was that what it was like

525
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:15,839
for you when you first got to the farm

526
00:21:12,298 --> 00:21:17,879
with Mac yeah absolutely you know like

527
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:20,939
because he had been here a few years

528
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:22,620
before I got here uh he had a whole

529
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,120
network of people that were doing the

530
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:26,579
same thing that we were doing you know

531
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:29,339
or that he was doing and uh

532
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:30,899
so I got to you know learn from you know

533
00:21:29,339 --> 00:21:32,879
he was really one of the best Growers

534
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,860
that I've ever known and so I got to

535
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,620
learn from him but I also got to see all

536
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:40,199
these other projects that he was maybe

537
00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:42,839
involved in on the side or like you know

538
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,240
provided plans to people or you know and

539
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:46,079
also his Elders like people who taught

540
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,019
him

541
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:51,058
and so it was really like a crash course

542
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:52,259
you know I got to learn a lot really

543
00:21:51,058 --> 00:21:54,839
quickly

544
00:21:52,259 --> 00:21:57,000
yeah wow what a what an introductory

545
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:58,558
sounds great so I mean if you're able to

546
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,538
recall any of the details do you

547
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:03,538
remember you know like I'm assuming you

548
00:22:00,538 --> 00:22:05,460
guys were outdoor like we you're growing

549
00:22:03,538 --> 00:22:07,079
organic I assume like can you give us a

550
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:09,120
rundown on maybe if you remember any of

551
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:11,220
the genetics you guys grew or like sort

552
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:13,859
of the general style in which you grew

553
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:16,259
was a like super soil or like amendments

554
00:22:13,859 --> 00:22:20,459
or anything like that you can recall

555
00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:23,158
so yeah it was definitely organic super

556
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:25,919
soil you know not like the sub cool

557
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:28,500
version but my brother's own concoction

558
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:33,000
that he had come up with

559
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:35,460
um that he learned I think from uh I'm

560
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,240
trying to remember the guy's name

561
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:39,360
um

562
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:42,538
friend of his in Sonoma County who you

563
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:45,298
know maybe 10 years older who had worked

564
00:22:42,538 --> 00:22:47,279
on a vegetable farm and so it was

565
00:22:45,298 --> 00:22:49,379
basically just a mix that they used to

566
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:52,259
grow vegetables but you know if you can

567
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:55,260
grow vegetables so you can cannabis and

568
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:56,879
uh so we started out in the pygmy forest

569
00:22:55,259 --> 00:22:58,679
in Albion which is a really interesting

570
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,919
climate because

571
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:04,080
you're growing like to avoid being

572
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,640
caught you know like they had the

573
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:08,099
campaign against marijuana production

574
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,720
back then camp and they flew helicopters

575
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:12,418
all over and they were really gonna know

576
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,400
about eradicating Gardens so we were

577
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:16,919
growing in the pygmy Forest where we had

578
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,659
some light tree cover so you know there

579
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:20,280
was still a good Sun but you couldn't

580
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:23,220
see the ground

581
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:24,240
uh or plants really because of the you

582
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:26,819
know like

583
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,099
a pygmy Forest is like a forest where

584
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:30,658
all the trees are stunted and they're

585
00:23:29,099 --> 00:23:34,619
smaller you know and they're not as

586
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:36,000
densely populated so it was the perfect

587
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:39,119
place to

588
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,339
you know hide your weed basically and uh

589
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:43,019
so we were growing really small plants

590
00:23:41,339 --> 00:23:44,639
and doing a lot of them because you know

591
00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:47,099
you couldn't go too big or they'd start

592
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,400
to be visible from Love

593
00:23:47,099 --> 00:23:52,500
so we you know we had like trenches and

594
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,759
small pots and we'd just do really a lot

595
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:57,179
of plants

596
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:58,259
and that way we were able to find

597
00:23:57,179 --> 00:24:00,659
special

598
00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:02,158
genetics because of the numbers you know

599
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:05,220
so we were planting

600
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:08,640
at one point like hundreds and thousands

601
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:12,240
even like I think 3 000 plants one time

602
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:15,299
to find this special Highland Afghani

603
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,200
that we were uh really impressed by we

604
00:24:15,298 --> 00:24:18,599
um

605
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:21,419
one year we were doing like a seed

606
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:23,639
propagation Nursery where we would plant

607
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:25,320
seeds and grow them up to be you know 18

608
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,299
inches tall and then sell them to the

609
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:30,058
other farmers in the area

610
00:24:27,298 --> 00:24:33,418
and we were doing that all through the

611
00:24:30,058 --> 00:24:36,480
season until fall and um

612
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:39,720
that the Highland Afghani that we used

613
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,579
in the Royal was just immune to the bad

614
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,460
weather like all the other plants were

615
00:24:41,579 --> 00:24:47,399
dying and rotting and you know just

616
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:49,740
couldn't handle the weather but this one

617
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:54,659
plant just didn't look bothered by it at

618
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:56,759
all and uh that's you know probably one

619
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:58,880
of the keys to our success in breeding

620
00:24:56,759 --> 00:25:01,259
really strong outdoor

621
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,720
cultivars is that we were able to hunt

622
00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:06,720
through those big numbers of plants and

623
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,159
find the really special ones wow yeah I

624
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,380
mean you you touched on some of the

625
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:13,320
questions I had for you later so thank

626
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:15,720
you for doing that I mean I guess my

627
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:18,418
first sort of inclination when you say

628
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:20,339
that is do you know where those Highland

629
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:21,900
Afghani seeds come from they sound like

630
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:24,178
special stock

631
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:27,360
uh yeah so it was

632
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:28,500
from OB from Sonoma County that was the

633
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:31,678
guy who couldn't think of his name a

634
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:33,839
minute ago uh uh so you know he was kind

635
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,519
of a deadhead that my brother had met on

636
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:39,538
tour

637
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:42,298
um before he settled in Mendo and so oh

638
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:43,859
but it was kind of the The Key to Our

639
00:25:42,298 --> 00:25:44,599
Success because he had all the old

640
00:25:43,859 --> 00:25:47,038
school

641
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:49,980
genetics that he got from his hippie

642
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:52,740
friend on tour and uh he passed on a lot

643
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:56,400
of that to us wow it's it's so

644
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:58,740
remarkable how much of like the really

645
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,659
influential genetics traced back to like

646
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:04,558
a dead tour in some way

647
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:07,380
yeah that's the truth man like or you

648
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:10,379
know just the concert tour

649
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:12,960
people in general like the Trinity that

650
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:14,520
I mentioned before that was a fish tour

651
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:18,960
thing that we got

652
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:20,579
at a fish concert you know and uh we you

653
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,558
know like shake down the street at those

654
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:23,819
shows where everyone's hustling they're

655
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:26,158
different

656
00:26:23,819 --> 00:26:29,519
products you know like cannabis

657
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:32,039
mushrooms and all this stuff and we

658
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:34,980
bought some flour from a guy

659
00:26:32,038 --> 00:26:36,900
there and we were just so impressed by

660
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:38,940
it that we like hunted him down later

661
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:41,400
and you know begged him to give us this

662
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:44,580
clone the Trinity clone

663
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:46,140
and uh you know it's just a lot of

664
00:26:44,579 --> 00:26:49,379
like-minded people all coming together

665
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:51,720
and doing business and you know partying

666
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:54,299
together and it's the perfect Network

667
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:57,960
for that sort of Exchange

668
00:26:54,298 --> 00:26:59,819
yeah wow I mean it makes me wonder do

669
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:03,319
you feel like people were sort of more

670
00:26:59,819 --> 00:27:06,359
receptive back in the day to for example

671
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:08,538
sharing clones with people because I

672
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:10,918
guess it sort of feels like at times

673
00:27:08,538 --> 00:27:12,778
there can you know somewhat

674
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:15,240
understandably be a bit of hesitation

675
00:27:12,778 --> 00:27:18,419
and giving clones out do you feel like

676
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:21,359
that's changed a bit since back then I

677
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:23,700
definitely do you know like

678
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:25,439
it depends on the group and the

679
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:27,960
circumstances definitely but back then

680
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,759
if you were like a really passionate

681
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,679
follower of the Grateful Dead you were

682
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:34,019
kind of in a club with these other

683
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:37,559
people and it was like a big family you

684
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:40,980
know uh so there wasn't that hesitancy

685
00:27:37,558 --> 00:27:42,960
to share that you find more often today

686
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,700
you know it's it's become a lot more

687
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,298
commercial and

688
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:49,740
uh more of a profit motivated thing than

689
00:27:48,298 --> 00:27:51,599
it used to be you know like we were all

690
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:53,099
making a good living but that wasn't the

691
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:54,719
reason that we started doing it

692
00:27:53,099 --> 00:27:57,719
necessarily you know like we were really

693
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:00,720
passionate about the the herb itself and

694
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:03,960
the also the music and the the whole

695
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:06,179
thing you know yeah okay so do you

696
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:08,460
remember when it was you did your first

697
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:10,038
indoor grow or was it just all outdoor

698
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:13,740
for the longest time

699
00:28:10,038 --> 00:28:16,500
uh that so you know we lived in

700
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:20,099
Mendocino on the coast for a couple of

701
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:22,500
years and then we moved Inland to uh

702
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:24,418
Greenfield Ranch outside of Ukiah which

703
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:26,460
was just an ideal growing environment

704
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:30,600
and we did that for a few years and then

705
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:33,000
we moved up to Arcata uh in Humboldt

706
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:35,219
County and so

707
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,700
that's when we started doing indoor I

708
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:42,720
think it was about 2002 2004

709
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:45,720
uh in there and we lucked into a big

710
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:48,778
Warehouse in downtown Arcata which is an

711
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:50,100
interesting story in itself but uh

712
00:28:48,778 --> 00:28:52,380
you know

713
00:28:50,099 --> 00:28:54,240
um we had gotten busted we're not we

714
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:57,179
didn't get in trouble but our we got cut

715
00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:00,419
down on Greenfield Ranch and it kind of

716
00:28:57,179 --> 00:29:03,240
motivated us to try to do indoor to

717
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:06,840
avoid having that happen again

718
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:08,940
um so we had this Warehouse in Arcata

719
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:10,798
you know it's you know a few blocks away

720
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:12,419
from the plaza a few blocks away from

721
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:16,740
the police station

722
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:19,799
and uh we did pretty big indoor in there

723
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:23,099
uh and that was you know

724
00:29:19,798 --> 00:29:25,200
pretty bold my brother wasn't as afraid

725
00:29:23,099 --> 00:29:26,939
of the consequences as a lot of people

726
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,940
were back then

727
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:32,880
and so that continued for 10 years in

728
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:35,820
Arcata at the warehouse there

729
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:38,278
yeah wow I guess you had to really risk

730
00:29:35,819 --> 00:29:39,538
it for the biscuit I perfectly you

731
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:41,960
mentioned that because one of our

732
00:29:39,538 --> 00:29:45,119
listeners had submitted a question where

733
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:47,038
they had been you know following both

734
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:49,678
yours and Max work for some time and

735
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:52,200
they just gave a brilliant question very

736
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:54,538
succinct they said any crazy Warehouse

737
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:57,538
days stories from Arcata

738
00:29:54,538 --> 00:29:58,679
yeah all right so

739
00:29:57,538 --> 00:29:59,700
yeah

740
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:03,480
um

741
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:06,600
there was so we rented this place from a

742
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:09,179
tiling company they you know it was like

743
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:11,339
where they stored all the tile for their

744
00:30:09,179 --> 00:30:13,679
business and they they did tiling for

745
00:30:11,339 --> 00:30:14,699
you know homes and businesses All Around

746
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,880
Town

747
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:20,940
um and they upgraded their space and so

748
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:25,080
we rented their warehouse from them and

749
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:27,000
we built four 10 light rooms in the

750
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:29,278
building and then we kept the whole

751
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,380
front of the building looking like a

752
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:33,720
tile business like you could come into

753
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:35,278
the building and it looked like just

754
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,319
shelves and shelves of tile and

755
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:38,880
everything and then you know you go

756
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:41,879
through a couple of more doors and then

757
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:45,299
you get to the grill

758
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:47,580
um and my brother was friends with the

759
00:30:45,298 --> 00:30:49,918
guy who owned a local coffee shop and so

760
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:52,019
to mitigate the smell we would pile

761
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:53,940
coffee grounds outside

762
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:55,918
where right near where the ventilation

763
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:58,259
came out of the building and you know we

764
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:01,740
use carbon filters and everything too

765
00:30:58,259 --> 00:31:03,839
but still even with the filters with you

766
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:06,179
know really good quality or a bit hard

767
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:07,500
to keep that smell under control so the

768
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:10,620
coffee helped

769
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:12,179
wow that is like the uh sort of like

770
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:13,439
back in the days when there's no carbon

771
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:16,019
filters right like you're just coming up

772
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,659
with any way to keep it all going did

773
00:31:16,019 --> 00:31:20,519
you ever have any like close calls where

774
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:22,020
you were like you know the hearts racing

775
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:23,158
and you're like oh God this is it we're

776
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:26,278
done

777
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:29,220
you know not really at the building

778
00:31:26,278 --> 00:31:32,099
itself there were times when there was

779
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:33,360
kind of a general odor of cannabis in

780
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:35,519
the neighborhood but you couldn't

781
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:37,558
pinpoint where it was coming from

782
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,298
so like you'd be a block away and you

783
00:31:37,558 --> 00:31:40,798
can smell the weed we were growing but

784
00:31:39,298 --> 00:31:45,000
you couldn't tell where it was coming

785
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:46,740
from and you know it was kind of a funny

786
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,960
thing that uh

787
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:50,399
the amount of cannabis that was there

788
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,919
and it was so close to the police

789
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:55,558
station and the busiest part of town and

790
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:59,640
you know you oh also just a couple of

791
00:31:55,558 --> 00:32:01,200
blocks from Safeway in Arcadia uh but no

792
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,840
we never really had

793
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,278
any heat we just sometimes would be

794
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:06,898
stinking up the neighborhood and people

795
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:09,500
would be asking questions but they

796
00:32:06,898 --> 00:32:11,759
wouldn't know who to blame

797
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:14,099
that's brilliant that's brilliant I can

798
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:15,898
imagine some young teenagers just

799
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:19,819
walking around the block just frustrated

800
00:32:15,898 --> 00:32:23,519
they can't pinpoint it yeah yeah funny

801
00:32:19,819 --> 00:32:26,579
okay so I mean when you started growing

802
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:29,519
indoor I'm assuming the the quality of

803
00:32:26,579 --> 00:32:31,918
the Cannabis went up a bit compared to

804
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:33,960
the outdoor did that cause you to have

805
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,120
any preference between the two like I

806
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:38,460
know me personally like I I really like

807
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:40,259
certain strains Outdoors but I think if

808
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:42,600
I had to give a blanket rule I sort of

809
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:44,339
prefer indoor these days did that cause

810
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:47,278
anything like that in you at all having

811
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:49,980
experience with the both uh

812
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:53,398
you know I wouldn't go so far as to say

813
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:55,798
that indoor is better it looks better

814
00:32:53,398 --> 00:32:58,558
you can definitely make more attractive

815
00:32:55,798 --> 00:33:01,200
looking and probably a little bit more

816
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:04,019
potent flower indoors but if you're

817
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,720
growing organically in a good climate

818
00:33:04,019 --> 00:33:10,259
that's not too hot you know like you can

819
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:13,558
produce better terpenes or you know more

820
00:33:10,259 --> 00:33:15,720
terpene-rich product Outdoors where it

821
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:19,200
gets colder at night and you have that

822
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:21,120
like saline humidity you know that that

823
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,700
you can't really beat mother nature in

824
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:25,678
that way as far as terpene production

825
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:28,259
goes I don't think

826
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:32,038
um but definitely for potency and the

827
00:33:28,259 --> 00:33:35,759
looks indoor was better you know

828
00:33:32,038 --> 00:33:37,319
as far as what people wanted to buy you

829
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:40,619
know a lot of it was just based on the

830
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:43,500
look and so yeah more marketable product

831
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:46,379
but not better in my mind

832
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:49,079
yeah okay and I mean given when we

833
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:50,820
discuss the the seeds that you and your

834
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:53,460
brother have made over the years there's

835
00:33:50,819 --> 00:33:55,319
always this notable element of how

836
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:57,659
enjoyable it was for an outdoor strain

837
00:33:55,319 --> 00:34:00,599
are there any of the lines you're

838
00:33:57,659 --> 00:34:02,580
associated with that you think just sort

839
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:04,798
of in your mind at least definitively

840
00:34:02,579 --> 00:34:07,199
you prefer them to be outdoor grown than

841
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:11,579
indoor

842
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:15,559
um yeah so with the Royal the Royal Kush

843
00:34:11,579 --> 00:34:18,719
um it doesn't get as gassy and musky

844
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:21,119
indoors as it does Outdoors you know

845
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:22,439
like it's still good but there's a

846
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,780
unique

847
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:27,000
profile to it when you grow it in a

848
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:29,519
outdoor climate that gets kind of cold

849
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,699
at night it has a totally different

850
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:35,699
appeal than if you grow it indoors you

851
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:37,319
know and it's still Great Indoors but

852
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:40,678
it's not the same

853
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:42,899
like terpene profile at all that you

854
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:46,980
know like especially certain like the

855
00:34:42,898 --> 00:34:49,319
gas or phenotypes are way better grown

856
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:50,398
outdoors with cold nights than they are

857
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,440
indoors

858
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:54,299
that's that's brilliant because I'll

859
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:56,760
I'll be honest I've only actually been

860
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:59,280
able to smell and smoke

861
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:01,800
um the Royal one time but it was a

862
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,560
legitimate Source it was um I got it

863
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:06,180
through a friend of the dragonfly Earth

864
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:07,980
medicine crew and I was at one of their

865
00:35:06,179 --> 00:35:09,419
parties and I remembered it was outdoor

866
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,820
and I remembered smoking and thinking

867
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:13,619
this is one of the most unique Turpin

868
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:16,079
profiles I've ever smelled in the sense

869
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:17,700
that you could smell The Afghani you

870
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,320
could smell the sour but you could

871
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:21,480
definitely smell the Urkel and I think

872
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:24,300
that was what like there was just

873
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,338
something so intoxicating about that do

874
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:28,740
you remember the first time you smelt it

875
00:35:26,338 --> 00:35:30,420
and were you sort of similarly Blown

876
00:35:28,739 --> 00:35:31,979
Away the way I just sort of described it

877
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:35,760
or how did that go

878
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:38,760
yeah definitely so before it was ever

879
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:42,300
called royal Kush it was a purple kush

880
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:46,859
diesel Afghani and so it was in the

881
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:50,280
Arcata warehouse and we um

882
00:35:46,858 --> 00:35:53,639
we had about 15 phenotypes you know we

883
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:56,700
made the first generation uh crossing

884
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:59,639
the Purple Kush with the diesel Afghani

885
00:35:56,699 --> 00:36:01,919
and um there were about 15 phenotypes

886
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:03,960
and we labeled them all pkda one two

887
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,940
three four five six you know

888
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:08,099
um all the way through and so there it

889
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:10,740
wasn't like I just experienced the Royal

890
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:14,700
as we know it now it was like this whole

891
00:36:10,739 --> 00:36:16,919
array of or a spectrum of the different

892
00:36:14,699 --> 00:36:19,039
parents you know and so

893
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:22,320
we kind of just

894
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:23,519
grew them you know two or three Cycles

895
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,320
in different

896
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:27,420
you know different rooms and with

897
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,380
slightly different feeding regimen and

898
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:30,420
so

899
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:33,599
we didn't really discover the most

900
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:35,159
amazing ones until we had been growing a

901
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:37,859
bunch of different versions of it for a

902
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:42,960
year or so and um

903
00:36:37,858 --> 00:36:45,598
so then the pkda8 was the one that ended

904
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,320
up being called royal kush later and it

905
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,480
was

906
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:51,660
it you know it was purple but it was

907
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,760
mostly Sour Diesel terpene profile with

908
00:36:51,659 --> 00:36:56,819
that Afghani too but like the Urkel

909
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:59,520
didn't really come through in the flavor

910
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:01,380
the smell it was just the color that

911
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:04,619
came from that in the one that we like

912
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:07,079
the best nice and is this the cutting

913
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:09,420
which sometimes I read about online is

914
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:11,460
called royal Kush seven or is that

915
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:15,539
different

916
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:19,079
um it's different so the seven is a

917
00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:20,338
clone that Kevin Jody selected

918
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:22,500
um or well

919
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:25,619
I don't know exactly know

920
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:27,659
how it all played out but it's the one

921
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:30,780
that he liked the best and the one that

922
00:37:27,659 --> 00:37:34,139
I like the best is different it's

923
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:35,400
um more diesel leaning than that one is

924
00:37:34,139 --> 00:37:39,179
but

925
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:41,760
for you know for outdoor uh mold

926
00:37:39,179 --> 00:37:44,838
resistance and like the grow ability I

927
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:50,160
would say that's the best one the seven

928
00:37:44,838 --> 00:37:52,858
but the pkda8 the diesel

929
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:53,819
one was my personal favorite versus

930
00:37:52,858 --> 00:37:56,279
Smoke

931
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:57,780
yeah okay I mean that makes sense you

932
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:00,420
know different folks Different Strokes

933
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:03,119
so I guess something I'm interested in

934
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:05,940
is that you've got all these you know

935
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:09,000
incredible strains that you know in the

936
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:10,740
area regarded as super well known in

937
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,139
just pretty much all of California I

938
00:38:10,739 --> 00:38:14,639
think a lot of Max work is just really

939
00:38:13,139 --> 00:38:17,460
well recognized

940
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:20,639
do you remember him ever talking to you

941
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:22,199
about like the process of when it was

942
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:23,519
actually happening like you know he sort

943
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:25,439
of comes home one day and he's like oh

944
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:27,719
man I just found this sick Fino in these

945
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,338
seeds I pop that I made like sort of as

946
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:31,559
it was going along do you remember him

947
00:38:29,338 --> 00:38:33,179
talking about it or or it more so just

948
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:35,820
sort of appeared at the end of the whole

949
00:38:33,179 --> 00:38:37,980
creation process well it was

950
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:40,680
collaborative you know like we would

951
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:43,740
they were us and a few of our friends

952
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:47,460
and people who worked at the uh

953
00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:50,759
Warehouse in Arcata you know what Mac

954
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:53,358
would do was he would just jar up and

955
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:55,800
label like a dozen samples or whatever

956
00:38:53,358 --> 00:38:58,619
and then he would let everyone try them

957
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:01,019
and we'd kind of decide together what

958
00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:02,460
everyone liked the best and you know it

959
00:39:01,019 --> 00:39:05,460
would change over time there would be

960
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:07,920
like okay we all agreed that this one's

961
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:09,539
the best overall you know and then you

962
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,220
grow it a couple more times and you'd be

963
00:39:09,539 --> 00:39:14,820
like nope never mind we're going you

964
00:39:11,219 --> 00:39:16,759
know this one's better and so it was

965
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:19,079
really convoluted I can't even remember

966
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,760
exactly how that all went because there

967
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:22,859
you know we were doing a lot of breeding

968
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:25,320
projects all at once not just the Royal

969
00:39:22,858 --> 00:39:27,598
but we were also working on like the

970
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,920
Maui super dog and um

971
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,440
you know

972
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:36,300
um we bred a lot with some

973
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:39,358
super skunk and Maui and uh chemdog and

974
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:41,940
headband and you know so it

975
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:43,739
the Royal was just one of those projects

976
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:46,559
that we were working on all at the same

977
00:39:43,739 --> 00:39:48,479
time and so we had hundreds of jars of

978
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:52,679
really good flour that we were always

979
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:54,119
you know trying to improve on and work

980
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:56,399
in different directions

981
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:58,980
sounds like you had so many incredible

982
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:01,320
crosses on the sort of horizon for you

983
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:02,699
guys that it was hard to see that just

984
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,920
one of them was standing out to the

985
00:40:02,699 --> 00:40:06,719
other that's that's exciting and you

986
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,820
mentioned the super skunk which is a

987
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:11,039
strain which comes up regularly on the

988
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:13,200
show what's your Recollections of the

989
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:15,420
super skunk and do you have any seeds

990
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:17,338
with it as like one of the parents that

991
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:18,500
maybe you're sort of keen to get into at

992
00:40:17,338 --> 00:40:22,799
some point

993
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:26,460
well it's a little fuzzy because so long

994
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:29,280
ago but it the super skunk that we got

995
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:31,519
was a clone and we were told it was from

996
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,740
Amherst Massachusetts

997
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:35,699
uh so it we called it the Amherst super

998
00:40:34,739 --> 00:40:38,578
skunk

999
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:42,078
and there was also the Amherst Sour

1000
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:46,320
Diesel that we got from the same guy

1001
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:48,900
and I think that that was not so dog

1002
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:50,338
um or Francis is his name

1003
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:52,619
um and we got a lot of good stuff from

1004
00:40:50,338 --> 00:40:54,299
him but it was so long ago like I didn't

1005
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:55,800
even know Francis at that time my

1006
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:58,500
brother had gotten these plants from him

1007
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:59,940
I think and that's the story as I

1008
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,559
remember it now but like I never

1009
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:05,639
actually met Francis because he was real

1010
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:09,539
private back then and but the Maui and

1011
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:11,578
the skunk and the uh diesel all came

1012
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:13,500
from him and maybe chem dog too you know

1013
00:41:11,579 --> 00:41:15,000
it's a little confusing in my

1014
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,440
recollection but

1015
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,780
he

1016
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:21,119
had all the good East Coast stuff and

1017
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:23,700
traded with my brother like we had the

1018
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:26,880
LA Kush which was one that was really

1019
00:41:23,699 --> 00:41:29,519
incredible too and I think my brother

1020
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:32,338
treated that to Francis for a bunch of

1021
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:34,739
other stuff amazing I mean we actually

1022
00:41:32,338 --> 00:41:37,799
had a few questions from the listeners

1023
00:41:34,739 --> 00:41:39,838
about that sort of thing and one of the

1024
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:43,200
really big ones that people were

1025
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:44,699
interested in hearing about was

1026
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:46,559
um oh you know I'll just read you word

1027
00:41:44,699 --> 00:41:47,819
for it what the question submitted was

1028
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:49,980
because that'll make it easier so

1029
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:51,838
they've just said I'd like to know if

1030
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:54,659
Ben knows anything about the seeds or

1031
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:56,699
Cuts not so dog passed off to Mac I

1032
00:41:54,659 --> 00:41:59,399
think it was the super dog question mark

1033
00:41:56,699 --> 00:42:01,319
I think it was a super skunk cross any

1034
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:03,660
Recollections about that does it still

1035
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:06,480
exist

1036
00:42:03,659 --> 00:42:11,098
um so the way I remember it

1037
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:16,619
we got the super skunk and the chem dog

1038
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:19,800
as clones and seeds of the Maui

1039
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:23,519
um but the I don't think that we got the

1040
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:26,339
the skunk by Kim or you know like the

1041
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:28,199
skunk dog or you know I think that we

1042
00:42:26,338 --> 00:42:30,179
got them individually from Francis

1043
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:32,879
that's the way I remember it but it was

1044
00:42:30,179 --> 00:42:34,618
so long ago I'm not totally sure

1045
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:38,700
um but

1046
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:41,460
so there was a chemdog and the sour and

1047
00:42:38,699 --> 00:42:44,460
the skunk and the Maui and they're all

1048
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:47,760
individual it's the way I remember

1049
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:50,639
nice okay sure another one we had which

1050
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:53,520
is sort of in that same line is what's

1051
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:56,460
Ben's thoughts on the Maui dog super dog

1052
00:42:53,519 --> 00:43:00,119
currently he says I'm running the Maui

1053
00:42:56,460 --> 00:43:02,099
dog cross I-95 it's super nice uh you

1054
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:04,920
know what because you you didn't do the

1055
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:06,480
the Superdog cross I-95 that would have

1056
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:11,579
been someone else I'm assuming right

1057
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:15,179
right right we did Maui super dog which

1058
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:18,900
you know so it was the Super Skunk the

1059
00:43:15,179 --> 00:43:21,598
chem dog and the Maui and that's where

1060
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:23,818
our truth came out of

1061
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:27,420
um you know the truth was just one

1062
00:43:23,818 --> 00:43:29,099
selection of that Maui super dog that we

1063
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:31,260
had made

1064
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:33,900
um and

1065
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:35,880
I don't know that much about the I know

1066
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:38,220
that there's a skunk dog out there that

1067
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,780
we didn't make and there's a Maui dog

1068
00:43:38,219 --> 00:43:41,459
out there you know like a lot of the

1069
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:43,560
things that people breed have either

1070
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:46,019
been done before or

1071
00:43:43,559 --> 00:43:47,400
are you know happening simultaneously in

1072
00:43:46,019 --> 00:43:50,460
different people's hands in different

1073
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:52,019
parts of the world and so there are

1074
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:53,880
definitely versions of all this stuff

1075
00:43:52,019 --> 00:43:55,679
that we had nothing to do with or you

1076
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:58,200
know like might be real similar but

1077
00:43:55,679 --> 00:44:01,799
weren't ours or whatever

1078
00:43:58,199 --> 00:44:05,039
um but the Maui Superdog is where our

1079
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:07,619
version came from yeah okay that makes

1080
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:09,539
perfect sense yeah the truth okay well

1081
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:11,579
you know what let's let's loot back and

1082
00:44:09,539 --> 00:44:14,880
jump into that so it sort of makes sense

1083
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:17,039
chronologically I mean when I looked

1084
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,619
online if you look at the forums the

1085
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:22,440
sort of the the big three strains that

1086
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:24,420
just you know continuously pop up when

1087
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:26,280
you're reading about Emerald mountain

1088
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:28,318
seeds or Emerald Mountain legacies is

1089
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:31,260
you know the Royal cush the truth and

1090
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:33,380
the 707 Headband

1091
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:36,240
um I guess my question is

1092
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:38,579
how did these come about did they come

1093
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:40,199
one after the other or were they all

1094
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:42,119
occurring as you sort of mentioned a bit

1095
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:44,759
earlier like at the same time or was

1096
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:47,099
there of progression it was all in the

1097
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:49,200
same window within a couple of years of

1098
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:51,300
each other because you know like when

1099
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:53,639
you start a big breeding project it

1100
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:57,000
takes a long time to hunt through it all

1101
00:44:53,639 --> 00:45:00,118
and so we we started out by doing like

1102
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,280
three rooms of open pollination where we

1103
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:04,019
just had one male and a bunch of

1104
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:06,180
different females in there with that

1105
00:45:04,019 --> 00:45:08,699
male or sometimes it would be three

1106
00:45:06,179 --> 00:45:11,039
males of the same thing you know so you

1107
00:45:08,699 --> 00:45:14,239
get a lot of variation or whatever but

1108
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:18,599
um so the the Maui super dog and the

1109
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:21,118
pkda that can't became the Royal were

1110
00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:24,420
definitely at the same time and then

1111
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:27,480
um I think that uh so there was a

1112
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:30,900
headband out there before hours and it

1113
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:34,500
was just headband and the way I remember

1114
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:36,660
it is it came from a guy named weasel

1115
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:39,059
and I don't know much about him or

1116
00:45:36,659 --> 00:45:42,480
anything like that but our version the

1117
00:45:39,059 --> 00:45:46,139
707 Headband was that crossed with the

1118
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:48,838
diesel Afghani that we had made so you

1119
00:45:46,139 --> 00:45:51,480
know there's a headband out there that

1120
00:45:48,838 --> 00:45:53,039
isn't as well known I guess I think I

1121
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,818
don't even know honestly all the details

1122
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:57,179
but

1123
00:45:53,818 --> 00:45:58,980
um our version this 707 had been was the

1124
00:45:57,179 --> 00:46:01,739
original headband crossed with a diesel

1125
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:05,219
Afghani okay that makes sense and I

1126
00:46:01,739 --> 00:46:06,838
remember in a recent episode we were

1127
00:46:05,219 --> 00:46:08,699
sort of getting the rundown on the

1128
00:46:06,838 --> 00:46:10,920
different headbands from Bob Hemphill

1129
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:13,799
because he has quite a few and he

1130
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:15,720
mentioned that like mac had been one of

1131
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:17,700
the people who brought one of them to

1132
00:46:15,719 --> 00:46:19,618
the scene I think it was

1133
00:46:17,699 --> 00:46:22,019
I think he might have said that the what

1134
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:24,720
you referenced earlier the LA pure kush

1135
00:46:22,019 --> 00:46:26,940
might have even sort of got turned into

1136
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:28,559
a headband or renamed or something like

1137
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:31,679
that do you remember anything along

1138
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:34,619
those lines yeah well the they're very

1139
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:36,598
similar I can't remember exactly how it

1140
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:39,660
all happened I know that we got the LA

1141
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:42,359
Kush from our friend Akasha in Los

1142
00:46:39,659 --> 00:46:44,460
Angeles area and

1143
00:46:42,358 --> 00:46:46,679
um we had that at the same time and we

1144
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:48,900
had the other headband and we had the

1145
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:51,480
diesel Afghani and the way I remember it

1146
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:53,400
it was just the original headband cross

1147
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:56,460
with the diesel Afghani but we did have

1148
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:58,800
that El acush at the same time you know

1149
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:00,900
and my memory is not perfect I could

1150
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:04,920
have it a little mixed up

1151
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:08,099
um but the LA Kush had a little

1152
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:10,700
different thing going on you know uh had

1153
00:47:08,099 --> 00:47:14,280
a little more leaning toward the chem

1154
00:47:10,699 --> 00:47:16,919
than the 707 Headband but

1155
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:18,900
um we did get like we had my brother was

1156
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:22,460
known for Distributing those cuts early

1157
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:25,500
on the LA Kush the headband the

1158
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:27,240
sfvog and the sour diesel a lot of

1159
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:30,000
people think he bred all of that stuff

1160
00:47:27,239 --> 00:47:32,818
because he was the first one that had it

1161
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,940
back then like you know 25 years ago or

1162
00:47:32,818 --> 00:47:37,500
23 years ago whatever so you know he

1163
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:39,780
didn't take credit for this stuff but

1164
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:42,300
because he was the source in North like

1165
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:44,760
Northern California hadn't seen any of

1166
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:47,818
that stuff before he started pumping out

1167
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:50,579
the Clones in Arcata so there's a lot of

1168
00:47:47,818 --> 00:47:53,159
confusion as to like where it all came

1169
00:47:50,579 --> 00:47:56,579
from and you know people have credited

1170
00:47:53,159 --> 00:47:58,379
him for breeding the sfv for example but

1171
00:47:56,579 --> 00:48:00,119
you didn't he just got it before anyone

1172
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:03,539
else did or you know that kind of thing

1173
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:05,160
yeah now that makes sense sure okay so I

1174
00:48:03,539 --> 00:48:07,619
mean you may not remember but do you

1175
00:48:05,159 --> 00:48:09,539
remember sort of around this time well

1176
00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:11,818
out of curiosity what were some of Mac's

1177
00:48:09,539 --> 00:48:15,239
favorite strains to smoke on

1178
00:48:11,818 --> 00:48:18,179
uh uh definitely headband in the LA Kush

1179
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:22,078
I I think the LA Kush was probably his

1180
00:48:18,179 --> 00:48:25,259
what he smoked the most for sure

1181
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:27,599
um and the sour he was a huge huge fan

1182
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:30,359
of this hour I guess those two would be

1183
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:34,920
his top smokers the sour diesel like the

1184
00:48:30,358 --> 00:48:37,679
original sour and that La Kush yeah two

1185
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:39,358
two Powerhouse picks right there as far

1186
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:41,818
as you're concerned do you think the

1187
00:48:39,358 --> 00:48:45,900
original sour still exists

1188
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:48,358
yeah definitely the one that we had for

1189
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:51,180
a long time and still have

1190
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:53,460
a lot of people call it the AJ sour but

1191
00:48:51,179 --> 00:48:55,440
I don't know for sure if AJ had anything

1192
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:57,059
to do with it or what you know it's it

1193
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,139
was a clone that we got from a friend in

1194
00:48:57,059 --> 00:49:02,338
L.A

1195
00:48:58,139 --> 00:49:05,578
um and so I don't know which version you

1196
00:49:02,338 --> 00:49:08,578
know but I've seen it called AJ sour

1197
00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:11,099
preview or you know more recently and

1198
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:14,099
back then it was just the only sour that

1199
00:49:11,099 --> 00:49:15,960
existed as far as I knew so there wasn't

1200
00:49:14,099 --> 00:49:18,359
like oh it's this one or that one or

1201
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:20,760
whatever it was just sour no

1202
00:49:18,358 --> 00:49:23,159
yeah okay cool I mean it's one of those

1203
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:25,140
ones which I'm not sure if I've ever

1204
00:49:23,159 --> 00:49:27,118
really had real Sour it's hard to know

1205
00:49:25,139 --> 00:49:30,719
you know because people talk about it so

1206
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:32,760
so mythically it's um it's sort of hard

1207
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:34,858
to know are you trying the real thing or

1208
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:37,500
like what's the situation and you know

1209
00:49:34,858 --> 00:49:40,858
with old clones they they sort of start

1210
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:43,559
to con fade a little bit you know yeah

1211
00:49:40,858 --> 00:49:45,239
but that I mean the real Sour is so

1212
00:49:43,559 --> 00:49:49,199
special that you would know if you found

1213
00:49:45,239 --> 00:49:51,899
it you know uh really unique and special

1214
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:53,818
you know it's the kind of the foundation

1215
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:57,059
for our whole breeding program I would

1216
00:49:53,818 --> 00:50:00,900
say so it's you know both for my brother

1217
00:49:57,059 --> 00:50:03,239
and I it's kind of the the

1218
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:04,318
the origin of all of the and our

1219
00:50:03,239 --> 00:50:06,118
favorite

1220
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:09,599
yeah that makes sense

1221
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:12,420
so last question sort of from a super

1222
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:15,599
historical basis I had for you is do you

1223
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:18,838
remember what it was like when OG first

1224
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:20,700
hit the local scene you're in or we were

1225
00:50:18,838 --> 00:50:22,980
already a part of the community and I

1226
00:50:20,699 --> 00:50:25,980
guess I'm sort of wondering was it just

1227
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:28,260
like this Monumental sort of Paradigm

1228
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:30,300
Shift when it first got up there or was

1229
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:32,599
it sort of slow to catch on and then it

1230
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:37,500
started dominating things more

1231
00:50:32,599 --> 00:50:39,960
well so it was very hard to find

1232
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:42,179
and you know no one in the Emerald

1233
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:44,159
Triangle had it until my brother got the

1234
00:50:42,179 --> 00:50:46,019
clones and started pumping him out like

1235
00:50:44,159 --> 00:50:48,420
the people who had it kept it to

1236
00:50:46,019 --> 00:50:51,119
themselves and you know it it was

1237
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:53,818
special and it was so coveted the the

1238
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:56,880
flower that the people who had it didn't

1239
00:50:53,818 --> 00:51:00,058
want to let it out and we were lucky to

1240
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:02,280
have a friend who passed it to us and

1241
00:51:00,059 --> 00:51:03,900
didn't give any rules on whether we

1242
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:07,019
could give it out or not so my brother

1243
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:09,599
just started pumping it out you know um

1244
00:51:07,019 --> 00:51:14,219
the all of that stuff the headband the

1245
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:16,800
sfv the LA Kush and the sour

1246
00:51:14,219 --> 00:51:18,358
and so he kind of changed the whole game

1247
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,440
and then we'll triangle that way you

1248
00:51:18,358 --> 00:51:21,179
know um

1249
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:23,519
yes he was making thousands and

1250
00:51:21,179 --> 00:51:25,259
thousands of clones every month and

1251
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:27,179
there weren't a lot of people doing that

1252
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:32,579
because it was so risky to have so many

1253
00:51:27,179 --> 00:51:35,159
plants back then you know uh so it like

1254
00:51:32,579 --> 00:51:37,920
it definitely started the whole

1255
00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:40,618
transition to everyone growing gas out

1256
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:42,240
of that Arcata Warehouse wow you know

1257
00:51:40,619 --> 00:51:43,800
what you've you've just made me realize

1258
00:51:42,239 --> 00:51:46,799
I'd be a fool if I missed this

1259
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:48,539
opportunity to ask given you know how

1260
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,700
many clones you guys must have done over

1261
00:51:48,539 --> 00:51:53,639
the years how do you root clones what's

1262
00:51:50,699 --> 00:51:57,358
your method for doing it uh my favorite

1263
00:51:53,639 --> 00:51:59,338
for my own projects is easy cloner and

1264
00:51:57,358 --> 00:52:01,500
then putting them directly into soil

1265
00:51:59,338 --> 00:52:04,440
like you know in a four inch pot so you

1266
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:06,838
like get a nice healthy root mass and

1267
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:08,039
then transplant that big ball of roots

1268
00:52:06,838 --> 00:52:11,338
into the

1269
00:52:08,039 --> 00:52:13,800
soil in a four inch pot that's you know

1270
00:52:11,338 --> 00:52:15,900
it there are a lot of good ways to do it

1271
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:19,619
but I don't really like to have rockwool

1272
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:21,599
or Oasis cubes or any of that stuff in

1273
00:52:19,619 --> 00:52:23,280
my soil because I feel like it's you

1274
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:25,740
know there's always algae and all these

1275
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:27,780
different issues so I like to use an

1276
00:52:25,739 --> 00:52:29,519
easy cloner and then just take the plant

1277
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:33,180
with the roots then put it directly into

1278
00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:37,079
some good soil and avoid those mediums

1279
00:52:33,179 --> 00:52:39,239
that way nice a man off to my own hot I

1280
00:52:37,079 --> 00:52:41,640
guess the follow-up is how would you

1281
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:43,979
broadly describe your growth style is it

1282
00:52:41,639 --> 00:52:45,900
sort of like a no-till sort of thing or

1283
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:48,358
is it a little bit of like a mixture of

1284
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:51,059
other things how do you do it in soil

1285
00:52:48,358 --> 00:52:54,000
I pretty much copy my brother's methods

1286
00:52:51,059 --> 00:52:58,619
you know it's uh just making a really

1287
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:01,980
rich very humic and very like a compost

1288
00:52:58,619 --> 00:53:05,280
heavy soil with a lot of amendments and

1289
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:07,858
then for the most part just feeding or

1290
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:10,400
you know just watering and you use a

1291
00:53:07,858 --> 00:53:13,199
little molasses and some kelp and stuff

1292
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:16,619
in your liquid feeding and you know

1293
00:53:13,199 --> 00:53:19,379
maybe sometimes make a a fertigated tea

1294
00:53:16,619 --> 00:53:21,900
with some guanos or whatever but if you

1295
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:24,300
just start with really good soil that's

1296
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:26,519
got all the stuff in there you know it

1297
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:28,559
gives the time to break down and to

1298
00:53:26,519 --> 00:53:30,358
become available when the plants need it

1299
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:33,839
you know if you're growing organically

1300
00:53:30,358 --> 00:53:35,639
and you're making liquid food for your

1301
00:53:33,838 --> 00:53:37,019
plants it's it's not really doing

1302
00:53:35,639 --> 00:53:40,019
anything for the plants when you water

1303
00:53:37,019 --> 00:53:43,440
it in it has to break down and you know

1304
00:53:40,019 --> 00:53:46,019
the whole the biology in the soil has to

1305
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:48,780
really have some time to work

1306
00:53:46,019 --> 00:53:51,780
and so you need to have it all in there

1307
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:54,359
at the beginning it's my opinion

1308
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:57,119
okay nice and I mean we've got a pretty

1309
00:53:54,358 --> 00:53:59,699
healthy population of outdoor Growers

1310
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:03,180
who are listeners for this show do you

1311
00:53:59,699 --> 00:54:05,338
have any you know maybe really good tips

1312
00:54:03,179 --> 00:54:06,960
or tricks in your mind that might help

1313
00:54:05,338 --> 00:54:08,880
them get more out of their outdoor

1314
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:11,039
plants or something which maybe you see

1315
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,780
people often doing wrong when they're

1316
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:15,058
Outdoors

1317
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:17,400
oh man that's the big question there's

1318
00:54:15,059 --> 00:54:18,900
so many different ways and you know I'm

1319
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:21,800
not going to tell people my way is

1320
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:24,780
better I just know what works for me

1321
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:26,099
and you know there's so many variables

1322
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:29,040
and just

1323
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:32,579
like how much you water and how much

1324
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:34,679
like or maybe my soil recipe is going to

1325
00:54:32,579 --> 00:54:36,599
be too hot for some people or you know

1326
00:54:34,679 --> 00:54:38,118
and it might burn plants or you know

1327
00:54:36,599 --> 00:54:40,140
depending on

1328
00:54:38,119 --> 00:54:41,640
environmental conditions and all these

1329
00:54:40,139 --> 00:54:45,118
different things so it's very hard to

1330
00:54:41,639 --> 00:54:50,039
give advice that is going to apply to

1331
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:53,338
everyone or to every grow you know so

1332
00:54:50,039 --> 00:54:56,159
it really I can't I can't say much on

1333
00:54:53,338 --> 00:54:59,699
that just because it's so specific to

1334
00:54:56,159 --> 00:55:02,578
different element or variables you know

1335
00:54:59,699 --> 00:55:06,838
but for people who really don't know

1336
00:55:02,579 --> 00:55:09,660
where to begin I would say to read the

1337
00:55:06,838 --> 00:55:11,639
article my brother wrote the lowdown on

1338
00:55:09,659 --> 00:55:15,078
dirt and you can find that on our

1339
00:55:11,639 --> 00:55:17,879
website at emeraldmountainlegacy.com

1340
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:20,700
that is pretty you know it's old he

1341
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:24,119
wrote that more than 10 years ago

1342
00:55:20,699 --> 00:55:26,578
um but it's a real good introduction to

1343
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:28,619
all of that for sure there you go gang

1344
00:55:26,579 --> 00:55:30,599
some required reading homework for

1345
00:55:28,619 --> 00:55:32,460
everyone I'm gonna go have a read on

1346
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:33,838
that one myself after we wrap things up

1347
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:36,780
here but that's good tonight thank you

1348
00:55:33,838 --> 00:55:38,639
for that sure I mean if we fast forward

1349
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:41,760
a little bit I'm sure a lot of people

1350
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:45,480
are aware but you know really sadly in

1351
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:48,119
2015 Mac passed away and I guess I'm

1352
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:50,760
just sort of wondering how did that

1353
00:55:48,119 --> 00:55:52,858
change things when he passed away was it

1354
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:56,220
obvious to you that you needed to

1355
00:55:52,858 --> 00:55:58,980
continue Emerald Mountain or was it a

1356
00:55:56,219 --> 00:56:01,500
more of a slow Discovery as you sort of

1357
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:04,380
grieved and dealt with his loss

1358
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:06,900
yeah man it was the Whirlwind you know I

1359
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:09,059
it started out just my younger brother

1360
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:13,079
and I you know like

1361
00:56:09,059 --> 00:56:16,440
Mac passed in October of 2015 and his

1362
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:19,200
crop was still standing and you know um

1363
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:22,079
he has kids that needed to be provided

1364
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:24,598
for so it started out just my younger

1365
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:26,880
brother Bogey and I helping to harvest

1366
00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:29,818
that crop and to try to you know turn it

1367
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:31,559
into cash for the kids and that was a

1368
00:56:29,818 --> 00:56:34,139
big undertaking and you know it all hap

1369
00:56:31,559 --> 00:56:37,200
like my daughter was born that summer

1370
00:56:34,139 --> 00:56:39,179
right before my brother passed and so I

1371
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:42,118
you know I was balancing a lot of plates

1372
00:56:39,179 --> 00:56:44,159
for sure trying to you know raise an

1373
00:56:42,119 --> 00:56:47,099
infant and

1374
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:50,759
um provide for my own family and to help

1375
00:56:47,099 --> 00:56:53,460
get you know a solid foundation for my

1376
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:56,160
brother's kids and so I really didn't

1377
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:59,400
even have time to think about a plan at

1378
00:56:56,159 --> 00:57:01,379
that time it was just like dealing with

1379
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:03,720
circumstance after circumstance and

1380
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:06,260
trying to just get through it you know

1381
00:57:03,719 --> 00:57:09,419
so I didn't it kind of all just happened

1382
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:13,380
one step after another and I didn't plan

1383
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:14,940
any of it really uh it's funny to think

1384
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:16,260
about it that way but

1385
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:18,300
um

1386
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:22,559
yeah so it started out just trying to

1387
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:24,420
like make sure his crop uh went to where

1388
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:25,619
it should and

1389
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:27,838
um

1390
00:57:25,619 --> 00:57:30,119
the you know we tried to save the farm

1391
00:57:27,838 --> 00:57:31,380
so for the first year

1392
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:33,900
like

1393
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:36,960
so he was about 100 Grand behind on his

1394
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:38,400
mortgage he had gotten robbed about a

1395
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:41,460
year before

1396
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:44,220
uh he passed and so he was really far

1397
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:46,199
behind on the mortgage and

1398
00:57:44,219 --> 00:57:48,779
um we were just trying to save the farm

1399
00:57:46,199 --> 00:57:51,838
and save the crop and that was our Focus

1400
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:54,540
initially but then shortly after he

1401
00:57:51,838 --> 00:57:55,858
passed the new laws in California kicked

1402
00:57:54,539 --> 00:57:57,239
in you know the

1403
00:57:55,858 --> 00:57:59,098
uh

1404
00:57:57,239 --> 00:58:02,759
adult use

1405
00:57:59,099 --> 00:58:03,420
cultivation and in Mendocino County they

1406
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:05,700
um

1407
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:07,858
said that you know the only people

1408
00:58:05,699 --> 00:58:10,318
eligible to apply for licenses are

1409
00:58:07,858 --> 00:58:12,719
pre-existing cultivators

1410
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:13,980
and you know it's really unfortunate

1411
00:58:12,719 --> 00:58:16,739
because

1412
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:21,420
my brother passed right before

1413
00:58:16,739 --> 00:58:23,159
his like lifelong career became legal

1414
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:25,858
and you know like something that he

1415
00:58:23,159 --> 00:58:28,139
could admit to doing publicly like it

1416
00:58:25,858 --> 00:58:29,039
was very underground and

1417
00:58:28,139 --> 00:58:31,858
um

1418
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:35,579
you know like using code names and

1419
00:58:31,858 --> 00:58:37,858
[ __ ] pseudonyms or whatever uh and

1420
00:58:35,579 --> 00:58:40,619
then just you know six months after he

1421
00:58:37,858 --> 00:58:42,480
passed it is all of a sudden legal and

1422
00:58:40,619 --> 00:58:43,740
I'm not sure you know he wasn't a fan of

1423
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:47,940
the

1424
00:58:43,739 --> 00:58:49,019
regulated market and Licensing and all

1425
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:50,460
that but

1426
00:58:49,019 --> 00:58:52,980
you know I think he would have

1427
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:56,639
eventually been happy to be able to come

1428
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:58,679
out and speak more openly about what he

1429
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:03,000
did and like

1430
00:58:58,679 --> 00:59:04,019
not use the pseudonym and you know like

1431
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:08,460
yeah

1432
00:59:04,019 --> 00:59:10,858
heard the explain but um

1433
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:12,599
you know he passed right before it all

1434
00:59:10,858 --> 00:59:14,578
changed a lot

1435
00:59:12,599 --> 00:59:17,640
yeah okay

1436
00:59:14,579 --> 00:59:19,619
and so when you finally started to sink

1437
00:59:17,639 --> 00:59:21,838
your teeth into the idea of doing

1438
00:59:19,619 --> 00:59:24,000
Emerald Mountain Legacy was there

1439
00:59:21,838 --> 00:59:25,920
anything that immediately jumped to mine

1440
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,719
as like oh you know like we've got to

1441
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:29,818
crack these seeds and start doing this

1442
00:59:27,719 --> 00:59:31,379
strain what was sort of first on the

1443
00:59:29,818 --> 00:59:34,099
agenda

1444
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:37,619
so he had done this huge

1445
00:59:34,099 --> 00:59:40,920
shotgun Crux is what he called it where

1446
00:59:37,619 --> 00:59:42,960
you know he had a bunch of female plants

1447
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:46,380
and he had

1448
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:49,699
two groups of males uh the the Maui

1449
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:54,059
super dog and like OG truth band males

1450
00:59:49,699 --> 00:59:55,318
on one side and the Royal Kush males on

1451
00:59:54,059 --> 00:59:58,319
the other

1452
00:59:55,318 --> 01:00:00,659
big open pollination so like his

1453
00:59:58,318 --> 01:00:01,920
thinking was that you know there would

1454
01:00:00,659 --> 01:00:03,539
be a little bit of like

1455
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:05,700
cross-pollination where you don't know

1456
01:00:03,539 --> 01:00:09,539
for sure what the male was but that

1457
01:00:05,699 --> 01:00:11,460
you'd have like the plants on the one

1458
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:13,139
side would be mostly pollinated by the

1459
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:15,358
Royal males and the plants on the other

1460
01:00:13,139 --> 01:00:18,900
side would be mostly pollinated by the

1461
01:00:15,358 --> 01:00:20,880
the truth and the OG truth band males

1462
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:23,099
and so we had this like ridiculous

1463
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:25,980
amount of seeds and they were all just

1464
01:00:23,099 --> 01:00:28,380
labeled by number based on what the

1465
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:30,838
female was you know and so we had this

1466
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:32,099
catalog of like hundreds of different

1467
01:00:30,838 --> 01:00:36,420
uh

1468
01:00:32,099 --> 01:00:38,400
plants and you know just it was a ton of

1469
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:40,500
work trying to sift through and find the

1470
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:43,019
special stuff in there and we haven't

1471
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:43,980
even finished that work to be honest

1472
01:00:43,019 --> 01:00:46,500
um

1473
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:49,318
so we had a big project

1474
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:52,079
on our hands definitely

1475
01:00:49,318 --> 01:00:54,920
yeah wow I mean it raises the question

1476
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:57,839
when you're looking to work on a project

1477
01:00:54,920 --> 01:01:00,720
how many seeds or what sort of numbers

1478
01:00:57,838 --> 01:01:02,759
do you like to run to sort of be

1479
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:04,919
confident you've got a good idea of

1480
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:07,440
what's in the seeds what's lurking there

1481
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:10,619
what might not be there how do you like

1482
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:11,220
to do the final hunt so to speak

1483
01:01:10,619 --> 01:01:12,900
um

1484
01:01:11,219 --> 01:01:15,838
you know

1485
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:19,200
the I mean to find special plants you

1486
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:22,078
need to grow a lot of them and so

1487
01:01:19,199 --> 01:01:24,298
I would always try to do one project at

1488
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:27,000
a time where like my brother would

1489
01:01:24,298 --> 01:01:30,079
always do these massive projects that

1490
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:32,460
you'd have so many different

1491
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:35,640
combinations that it's almost impossible

1492
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:38,460
to grow them all out and find everything

1493
01:01:35,639 --> 01:01:40,139
that's in there you know I think the way

1494
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:43,139
he thought about it is he would make

1495
01:01:40,139 --> 01:01:45,118
sure to use really strong parents and

1496
01:01:43,139 --> 01:01:47,578
then to give those seeds out to people

1497
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:49,318
so that they could find special stuff

1498
01:01:47,579 --> 01:01:50,240
and

1499
01:01:49,318 --> 01:01:52,798
um

1500
01:01:50,239 --> 01:01:56,159
that's you know I think

1501
01:01:52,798 --> 01:01:58,318
that really works for certain people who

1502
01:01:56,159 --> 01:02:00,179
like to hunt through

1503
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:01,858
a bunch of different stuff and find

1504
01:02:00,179 --> 01:02:03,899
special ones and keep them around as

1505
01:02:01,858 --> 01:02:06,420
clones or whatever

1506
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:09,180
um but what I found is that what people

1507
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:10,740
wanted from me after he passed was to

1508
01:02:09,179 --> 01:02:12,838
keep

1509
01:02:10,739 --> 01:02:15,179
the things that had been found out there

1510
01:02:12,838 --> 01:02:18,239
and that were really special and just to

1511
01:02:15,179 --> 01:02:20,699
make sure that we had versions of those

1512
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:22,979
things commercially available you know

1513
01:02:20,699 --> 01:02:26,219
and so

1514
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:28,500
um really just trying to

1515
01:02:26,219 --> 01:02:31,139
make sure we didn't lose anything it was

1516
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:33,358
my folks

1517
01:02:31,139 --> 01:02:35,338
yeah understandable that you'd want to

1518
01:02:33,358 --> 01:02:38,639
make sure none of those lines go dead so

1519
01:02:35,338 --> 01:02:40,980
to speak and it sort of segues into the

1520
01:02:38,639 --> 01:02:43,440
next few questions I had for you nicely

1521
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:44,940
in terms of when you're working with

1522
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:46,200
these lines and they're sort of

1523
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:48,119
established and you're looking to

1524
01:02:46,199 --> 01:02:50,480
preserve them how do you go about

1525
01:02:48,119 --> 01:02:53,640
preserving them are you looking to

1526
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:55,679
utilize all the females and males that

1527
01:02:53,639 --> 01:02:57,900
don't have hermaphrodig traits or are

1528
01:02:55,679 --> 01:03:00,480
you still doing some minor amount of

1529
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:04,500
selection or is it just a free-for-all

1530
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:06,740
open pollination how do you do that one

1531
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:09,838
um it definitely depends on

1532
01:03:06,739 --> 01:03:12,779
where you start in the process like

1533
01:03:09,838 --> 01:03:15,179
you know with the Royal Kush

1534
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:17,880
my brother had already back crossed it

1535
01:03:15,179 --> 01:03:19,919
seven times or eight times actually or

1536
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:22,019
well no the first generation then seven

1537
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:24,500
back crosses to get to the eighth

1538
01:03:22,019 --> 01:03:28,019
generation so with the Royal for example

1539
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:30,059
I his goal was to get that to the 10th

1540
01:03:28,019 --> 01:03:32,639
Generation of bat Crossing so I just

1541
01:03:30,059 --> 01:03:35,700
continued with that until we got to the

1542
01:03:32,639 --> 01:03:37,440
10th Generation but

1543
01:03:35,699 --> 01:03:39,179
um and I'm doing that with the oil spill

1544
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:40,920
too but we're only on the seventh

1545
01:03:39,179 --> 01:03:41,460
generation on that one

1546
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:43,200
um

1547
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:45,599
but

1548
01:03:43,199 --> 01:03:47,879
the idea of back Crossing for us was

1549
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:50,400
that you keep most of the genetic

1550
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:52,619
material from the original so that

1551
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:54,900
there's still some variability and it's

1552
01:03:52,619 --> 01:03:56,338
it's kind of like the original cross

1553
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:58,858
where you have a bunch of different

1554
01:03:56,338 --> 01:04:00,539
phenotypes some of them leaning towards

1555
01:03:58,858 --> 01:04:01,440
one parent some of them leaning towards

1556
01:04:00,539 --> 01:04:04,380
the other

1557
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:07,079
but more and more like once you get

1558
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:09,720
pretty far down that road then your

1559
01:04:07,079 --> 01:04:12,140
focus in my mind should shift to trying

1560
01:04:09,719 --> 01:04:14,818
to isolate the special

1561
01:04:12,139 --> 01:04:18,239
individuals and make seeds of those

1562
01:04:14,818 --> 01:04:20,219
individuals that come out mostly the

1563
01:04:18,239 --> 01:04:23,219
same so what I've been working on

1564
01:04:20,219 --> 01:04:27,480
recently is trying to like isolate the

1565
01:04:23,219 --> 01:04:30,239
sour gleaming phenotype of Royal Kush in

1566
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:33,599
the Afghan meaning one and the the

1567
01:04:30,239 --> 01:04:36,358
grapey strawberry one you know so

1568
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:39,960
after getting to that 10th generation

1569
01:04:36,358 --> 01:04:42,960
back cross now I'm working on making f2s

1570
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:47,400
and f3s of you know like the sour and

1571
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:50,460
the the Afghan and the strawberry and

1572
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:52,680
grape versions and so

1573
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:55,740
with those projects the goal would be

1574
01:04:52,679 --> 01:04:59,539
for the seeds to all be mostly the same

1575
01:04:55,739 --> 01:05:02,759
and isolated into those different groups

1576
01:04:59,539 --> 01:05:04,619
but you know there are so many different

1577
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:07,440
goals for different

1578
01:05:04,619 --> 01:05:10,920
purposes and stuff that you know it very

1579
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:13,740
much depends on what you're trying to do

1580
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:15,180
okay yeah brilliant answer there and I

1581
01:05:13,739 --> 01:05:17,338
think you might have sort of answered

1582
01:05:15,179 --> 01:05:19,019
this next question but I'll just double

1583
01:05:17,338 --> 01:05:21,358
back just to make sure we got the right

1584
01:05:19,019 --> 01:05:22,920
thing one of our listeners was wondering

1585
01:05:21,358 --> 01:05:25,318
they said you know is it true that

1586
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:28,019
there's like a royal cush Fina that's

1587
01:05:25,318 --> 01:05:30,298
sort of like a strawberry jam and if so

1588
01:05:28,019 --> 01:05:32,338
is it like a unicorn does the average

1589
01:05:30,298 --> 01:05:34,858
person have any chance of finding it or

1590
01:05:32,338 --> 01:05:38,639
it's really buried in there

1591
01:05:34,858 --> 01:05:40,578
okay so there definitely is one and it's

1592
01:05:38,639 --> 01:05:43,019
very much different from all the other

1593
01:05:40,579 --> 01:05:46,140
Royal selections

1594
01:05:43,019 --> 01:05:49,259
um we put it out as the snozzberries

1595
01:05:46,139 --> 01:05:50,759
this season

1596
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:52,500
um and you know we're sold out of it

1597
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:55,740
right now but if you want that

1598
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:58,679
strawberry uh selection of the royal

1599
01:05:55,739 --> 01:06:01,679
Kush which you know it's

1600
01:05:58,679 --> 01:06:05,279
not very similar to Royal

1601
01:06:01,679 --> 01:06:08,219
otherwise like it's not gassy and it's

1602
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:10,980
not very strong smoke as flour but it

1603
01:06:08,219 --> 01:06:13,439
makes Incredible concentrates like the

1604
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:16,679
the strawberry terpenes come out very

1605
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:19,740
very strong and concentrate and it's

1606
01:06:16,679 --> 01:06:21,659
just tastes incredible and the most like

1607
01:06:19,739 --> 01:06:23,879
strawberry of anything I've ever seen

1608
01:06:21,659 --> 01:06:26,519
out there

1609
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:28,318
um but you know it's not that impressive

1610
01:06:26,519 --> 01:06:31,739
as flour but when you concentrate it

1611
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:32,460
down it's really really special

1612
01:06:31,739 --> 01:06:34,858
um

1613
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:36,780
so yeah that's what that one's all about

1614
01:06:34,858 --> 01:06:38,578
nice there you go people the

1615
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:39,839
snozzberries I had seen that one when I

1616
01:06:38,579 --> 01:06:42,660
was looking at all the different strains

1617
01:06:39,838 --> 01:06:44,940
on offer so it's a good name I like it

1618
01:06:42,659 --> 01:06:46,679
um so I mean just touching back on what

1619
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:50,460
you mentioned before about having done

1620
01:06:46,679 --> 01:06:53,000
the bx8 and uh even to the 10. I guess

1621
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:55,619
I'm wondering are there any you know

1622
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:59,159
perceivable differences you've found

1623
01:06:55,619 --> 01:07:01,260
between say the F1 and the bx10

1624
01:06:59,159 --> 01:07:03,838
um in the I'm sure by the bx10 you've

1625
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:05,940
you've got the the phenotypes and the

1626
01:07:03,838 --> 01:07:08,460
type of plant you want in seed but have

1627
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:12,179
you seen a gain or loss of any traits

1628
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:15,119
since that F1 generation definitely you

1629
01:07:12,179 --> 01:07:16,980
know you set out with a goal and

1630
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:19,019
sometimes you get there and sometimes

1631
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:22,139
you don't and

1632
01:07:19,019 --> 01:07:25,139
um I found that the eighth generation

1633
01:07:22,139 --> 01:07:26,940
back cross was the best and you know our

1634
01:07:25,139 --> 01:07:29,038
goal was to get to the 10th Generation

1635
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:31,260
back cross and we did that but it didn't

1636
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:34,260
improve from the eighth to the 10th and

1637
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:37,319
I I think that in breeding depression is

1638
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:41,280
probably the reason for that

1639
01:07:37,318 --> 01:07:44,099
um but so basically the 10th Generation

1640
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:47,039
has some really incredible plans and

1641
01:07:44,099 --> 01:07:49,200
some of the gaseous phenos of Royal that

1642
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:51,900
I've ever seen but it also has some that

1643
01:07:49,199 --> 01:07:54,298
aren't as desirable too you know and

1644
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:55,980
it's so with the 10 you kind of have to

1645
01:07:54,298 --> 01:07:58,679
hunt through and find the really special

1646
01:07:55,980 --> 01:08:00,298
ones and keep them around whereas the

1647
01:07:58,679 --> 01:08:02,519
eighth generation you could grow them

1648
01:08:00,298 --> 01:08:04,440
out and they were all incredible you

1649
01:08:02,519 --> 01:08:06,119
know they were all very good not quite

1650
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:08,159
as good as some of the ones that you

1651
01:08:06,119 --> 01:08:10,798
find in the 10 but better than a lot of

1652
01:08:08,159 --> 01:08:15,659
the others you know and

1653
01:08:10,798 --> 01:08:18,960
so as a breeder like I don't use like

1654
01:08:15,659 --> 01:08:20,698
um genetic testing and stuff to like you

1655
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:23,399
know like genome mapping and all this

1656
01:08:20,698 --> 01:08:25,439
high-tech stuff we've just done it

1657
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:27,238
the way we are used to doing it for so

1658
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:30,000
long that I don't really

1659
01:08:27,238 --> 01:08:32,759
use those tools and so you might set out

1660
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,479
with a goal of

1661
01:08:32,759 --> 01:08:35,939
um

1662
01:08:33,479 --> 01:08:38,939
you know let's say trying to get the

1663
01:08:35,939 --> 01:08:40,858
gaseous Royal that you can and you'll

1664
01:08:38,939 --> 01:08:43,139
you'll try that and maybe you won't get

1665
01:08:40,859 --> 01:08:44,699
there the way you meant to you know and

1666
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:46,259
you'll have to go back and start again

1667
01:08:44,698 --> 01:08:47,818
at a certain point

1668
01:08:46,259 --> 01:08:48,960
or whatever

1669
01:08:47,819 --> 01:08:50,520
um

1670
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:52,500
so yeah

1671
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:54,540
yeah no that that makes sense and I

1672
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:56,640
think that you know undertaking a

1673
01:08:54,539 --> 01:08:58,979
project you know that's at least 10

1674
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:01,259
Generations deep it makes sense that you

1675
01:08:58,979 --> 01:09:04,019
maybe need to go back at certain points

1676
01:09:01,259 --> 01:09:05,640
and re-look at things it sort of plays

1677
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:07,980
into the next question being that

1678
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:10,319
there's a lot of people with a variety

1679
01:09:07,979 --> 01:09:12,599
of sort of Royal stock you know

1680
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:14,819
different Generations different sources

1681
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:16,560
maybe just F2 and given to them by a

1682
01:09:14,819 --> 01:09:19,199
mate sort of thing or I mean maybe it's

1683
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:21,660
not an F2 maybe it's an F6 or F7 or

1684
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:25,079
whatever I guess my question becomes

1685
01:09:21,659 --> 01:09:27,420
have you found a breeding style that you

1686
01:09:25,079 --> 01:09:29,579
prefer more like do you prefer to back

1687
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:31,980
cross those lines or do you think filial

1688
01:09:29,579 --> 01:09:34,439
breeding like f2f3 sort of brings more

1689
01:09:31,979 --> 01:09:36,238
to the table or does it have different

1690
01:09:34,439 --> 01:09:40,500
purposes

1691
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:43,019
well for the way the Cannabis business

1692
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:46,259
has evolved I think that filial breeding

1693
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:49,199
is going to please more people but it

1694
01:09:46,259 --> 01:09:52,319
depends on the people that you're

1695
01:09:49,198 --> 01:09:54,599
catering to like my brother definitely

1696
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:56,940
liked to hunt through a bunch of

1697
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:59,520
different plants and to find ones that

1698
01:09:56,939 --> 01:10:00,779
were like his special one you know and

1699
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:02,520
there are a lot of people out there that

1700
01:10:00,779 --> 01:10:05,219
are that way where they they want

1701
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:07,800
variation and they want to find their

1702
01:10:05,219 --> 01:10:10,198
unicorn and the Hunt is really thrilling

1703
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:12,119
for them you know but the more

1704
01:10:10,198 --> 01:10:13,979
commercial this all becomes the more

1705
01:10:12,119 --> 01:10:16,140
people just want some seeds that'll come

1706
01:10:13,979 --> 01:10:18,238
out the same and are pretty good you

1707
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:19,679
know and uh

1708
01:10:18,238 --> 01:10:22,019
so

1709
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:23,699
I'd say it's it's going further and

1710
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:25,260
further towards the direction of people

1711
01:10:23,698 --> 01:10:27,599
just wanting seeds that come out

1712
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:30,719
consistently so that they can mix those

1713
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:34,380
plants together and Market that product

1714
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:36,899
as one product but there are still those

1715
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:38,579
people who want to have a bunch of

1716
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:39,960
different ones and they're okay with the

1717
01:10:38,579 --> 01:10:43,079
fact that they can't mix the flowers

1718
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:45,960
together and sell them as one thing you

1719
01:10:43,079 --> 01:10:47,340
know and um so we're definitely going to

1720
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:50,399
continue with both

1721
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:53,000
but we're going to be focusing more on

1722
01:10:50,399 --> 01:10:56,279
making f2s and f3s and

1723
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:59,520
isolating treats into seed lines that

1724
01:10:56,279 --> 01:11:01,859
are consistent because that's

1725
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:04,980
more often than not these days that's

1726
01:11:01,859 --> 01:11:07,380
what people need to be successful

1727
01:11:04,979 --> 01:11:09,059
yeah definitely I think yeah what you

1728
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:12,539
said reflects you know a little bit of

1729
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:15,239
the changing landscape in the market it

1730
01:11:12,539 --> 01:11:17,460
causes me to wonder you've made a lot of

1731
01:11:15,238 --> 01:11:19,319
really nice looking crosses since

1732
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:22,560
starting to work with the Emerald

1733
01:11:19,319 --> 01:11:25,139
Mountain Legacy brand so to speak a few

1734
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:27,060
of them had really really caught my eye

1735
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:30,360
you know like I mean obviously the the

1736
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:32,880
old faithfuls but new releases like the

1737
01:11:30,359 --> 01:11:35,519
you know the the 47 and the black lime

1738
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:37,920
pie and the Royal limes all things like

1739
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:39,780
that out of all the new lines you've

1740
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:41,940
been putting out what are the some of

1741
01:11:39,779 --> 01:11:43,859
the ones that you're most impressed with

1742
01:11:41,939 --> 01:11:46,079
and are maybe considering doing more

1743
01:11:43,859 --> 01:11:49,439
with going forward

1744
01:11:46,079 --> 01:11:54,719
uh those you mentioned definitely

1745
01:11:49,439 --> 01:11:57,119
um but the royal wedding I think is

1746
01:11:54,719 --> 01:12:00,179
my favorite well the Royal limes and The

1747
01:11:57,119 --> 01:12:01,500
Royal Wedding are my two favorites

1748
01:12:00,179 --> 01:12:04,500
um

1749
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:06,060
you know I like wedding cake a lot but

1750
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:08,579
the royal wedding

1751
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:12,000
takes most of what's appealing about

1752
01:12:08,579 --> 01:12:13,859
wedding cake and puts it in a eight and

1753
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,840
a half week finisher which you know

1754
01:12:13,859 --> 01:12:18,000
wedding cake goes really long and that's

1755
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:19,560
difficult for a lot of outdoor Growers

1756
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:22,439
so The Royal Wedding is something really

1757
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:25,440
special because it's that really high

1758
01:12:22,439 --> 01:12:29,479
demand product but it finishes fast and

1759
01:12:25,439 --> 01:12:32,339
it's easier to grow and so I'd say both

1760
01:12:29,479 --> 01:12:35,639
I like it a lot and it's very popular

1761
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:38,699
because of that early finishing and

1762
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:41,460
really appealing product but like the

1763
01:12:38,698 --> 01:12:45,000
Royal limes

1764
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:48,119
um there is one unicorn Fino that might

1765
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:51,420
be my favorite weed ever it's like very

1766
01:12:48,119 --> 01:12:55,198
skunky and very limey but it also has

1767
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:58,560
that like vanilla Skittles element to it

1768
01:12:55,198 --> 01:13:01,619
and it the flavors don't really muddle

1769
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:03,539
like they don't mix together like you

1770
01:13:01,619 --> 01:13:05,340
squeeze a flower once and it smells like

1771
01:13:03,539 --> 01:13:07,380
skunk and then you squeeze it again and

1772
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:09,900
it smells like vanilla and then again

1773
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:13,020
and it's limey or you know it's like

1774
01:13:09,899 --> 01:13:15,238
it's Unique in that way where it has a

1775
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:16,560
lot of different elements to it but they

1776
01:13:15,238 --> 01:13:19,738
kind of

1777
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:22,739
come out at different times and um

1778
01:13:19,738 --> 01:13:24,899
it's not like Blended together you know

1779
01:13:22,738 --> 01:13:25,678
it's Unique in that way

1780
01:13:24,899 --> 01:13:28,019
um

1781
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:28,739
the black line pie is another amusing

1782
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:31,380
one

1783
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:34,859
uh you know like it could be really loud

1784
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:36,359
cherry or really limey or more Royal

1785
01:13:34,859 --> 01:13:39,619
dominant

1786
01:13:36,359 --> 01:13:43,019
um and really beautiful as far as

1787
01:13:39,619 --> 01:13:44,698
looks that one's probably the best

1788
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:47,460
looking flower

1789
01:13:44,698 --> 01:13:49,139
I would say but you know it's Different

1790
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:50,579
Strokes for different folks there's a

1791
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:53,159
lot of good stuff in there and it's

1792
01:13:50,579 --> 01:13:55,619
depends what you're into

1793
01:13:53,158 --> 01:13:56,879
yeah definitely I mean it's it's

1794
01:13:55,619 --> 01:13:58,619
interesting you mentioned the royal

1795
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:00,119
wedding because that was one I had sort

1796
01:13:58,619 --> 01:14:02,279
of scribbled down and thought that looks

1797
01:14:00,119 --> 01:14:04,079
really neat and I guess as a follow-up

1798
01:14:02,279 --> 01:14:06,840
to what you sort of already touched on

1799
01:14:04,079 --> 01:14:10,859
with that one do you plan to maybe

1800
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:12,480
continue taking some of the popular

1801
01:14:10,859 --> 01:14:14,639
um you know your wedding cake type ones

1802
01:14:12,479 --> 01:14:15,899
where they're that real sort of hype

1803
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:18,360
Market

1804
01:14:15,899 --> 01:14:21,539
um and then trying to work those into

1805
01:14:18,359 --> 01:14:22,859
sort of more grower friendly lines be it

1806
01:14:21,539 --> 01:14:24,840
as you said like you know faster

1807
01:14:22,859 --> 01:14:26,819
flowering or it sort of handles the

1808
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:28,860
conditions a bit more is that something

1809
01:14:26,819 --> 01:14:30,840
we might see going forward or more of a

1810
01:14:28,859 --> 01:14:33,119
one absolutely that we're working on

1811
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:34,260
that right now it just takes time you

1812
01:14:33,119 --> 01:14:36,300
know because

1813
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:39,539
if you're growing for people who are

1814
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:42,719
going to grow outdoor you don't want to

1815
01:14:39,539 --> 01:14:45,119
be breathing that stuff indoors because

1816
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:48,899
like the

1817
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:51,599
the heritable treats you know like

1818
01:14:48,899 --> 01:14:55,139
it's like a climate type like people

1819
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:57,000
from the Andes right uh developed Barrel

1820
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:58,739
chests over time so that they could

1821
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:02,640
breathe better in that really high

1822
01:14:58,738 --> 01:15:05,039
altitude that they their ancestors come

1823
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:07,380
from right it's like that where if

1824
01:15:05,039 --> 01:15:09,060
you're gonna grow outdoors in a

1825
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:10,619
difficult climate you need to breathe

1826
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:13,140
outdoors in a difficult climate or

1827
01:15:10,619 --> 01:15:16,198
you're gonna move away from those traits

1828
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:19,260
that were so helpful to you in that

1829
01:15:16,198 --> 01:15:22,099
environment you know so we can only do

1830
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:26,159
one breeding cycle a year

1831
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:27,600
outdoors in the natural way that you

1832
01:15:26,158 --> 01:15:29,460
would do that if you're trying to

1833
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:32,159
produce something that would perform

1834
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:33,480
well Outdoors so a lot of breeders can

1835
01:15:32,158 --> 01:15:35,158
get through four or five filial

1836
01:15:33,479 --> 01:15:37,139
generations in a year

1837
01:15:35,158 --> 01:15:40,379
we can't you know

1838
01:15:37,140 --> 01:15:41,940
um not when we're intending to

1839
01:15:40,380 --> 01:15:45,420
provide for people who are grown

1840
01:15:41,939 --> 01:15:48,178
Outdoors so we are working on those each

1841
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:50,880
one of those lines right now but it's

1842
01:15:48,179 --> 01:15:54,179
it's a slow process

1843
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:56,340
yeah certainly I can imagine I mean I

1844
01:15:54,179 --> 01:15:58,739
looking on the website and another thing

1845
01:15:56,340 --> 01:16:02,219
sort of related to The Outdoor growing

1846
01:15:58,738 --> 01:16:03,779
was I noticed that there was a few packs

1847
01:16:02,219 --> 01:16:05,340
where you were selling them in much

1848
01:16:03,779 --> 01:16:08,579
larger volumes like you know like maybe

1849
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:10,440
a hundred plus seeds in a pack is that

1850
01:16:08,579 --> 01:16:12,300
something you release because you're

1851
01:16:10,439 --> 01:16:14,759
sort of trying to cater for outdoor

1852
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:17,279
Growers or is it more so that people can

1853
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:18,659
run big Fino hunts and find that really

1854
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:21,300
special one

1855
01:16:18,658 --> 01:16:23,939
uh both and you know that's something

1856
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:27,119
that we're gonna do more going forward

1857
01:16:23,939 --> 01:16:28,799
offering you know bulk quantities at a

1858
01:16:27,119 --> 01:16:31,079
discounted price

1859
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:33,420
um I didn't know for sure how much

1860
01:16:31,079 --> 01:16:37,079
demand there would be for that but I

1861
01:16:33,420 --> 01:16:39,179
just put out the spice cream in 120

1862
01:16:37,079 --> 01:16:40,439
packs and that was really popular people

1863
01:16:39,179 --> 01:16:41,579
are really into it you know because

1864
01:16:40,439 --> 01:16:43,559
they're getting a good deal and they're

1865
01:16:41,579 --> 01:16:44,760
getting a lot of seeds

1866
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:47,760
um so we're going to do that more and

1867
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:51,179
more yeah that's exciting okay cool cool

1868
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:53,219
cool and uh one of the questions

1869
01:16:51,179 --> 01:16:55,739
submitted by one of our listeners was

1870
01:16:53,219 --> 01:16:58,980
they were wondering if you had noticed

1871
01:16:55,738 --> 01:17:01,919
any specific traits on the Royal line

1872
01:16:58,979 --> 01:17:03,839
which might indicate that the mail was

1873
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:06,179
going to be a good breeder and I guess

1874
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:09,000
this is probably subjective in terms of

1875
01:17:06,179 --> 01:17:10,199
what traits you want to pass on but I

1876
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,238
guess they're just generally wondering

1877
01:17:10,198 --> 01:17:14,460
you know anything to keep an eye out for

1878
01:17:12,238 --> 01:17:15,319
so in the Royal

1879
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:19,319
um

1880
01:17:15,319 --> 01:17:22,259
we most often do our selections for

1881
01:17:19,319 --> 01:17:24,238
males based on Vigor you know just

1882
01:17:22,260 --> 01:17:28,800
strong plants that get bigger than the

1883
01:17:24,238 --> 01:17:31,019
others faster but also on stem rub which

1884
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:33,900
is a tricky thing because

1885
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:35,820
to really have a good stem rub I think a

1886
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:39,139
plant needs to be grown totally

1887
01:17:35,819 --> 01:17:42,960
organically and it will have a stronger

1888
01:17:39,140 --> 01:17:46,140
stem rub you know the smell if it's done

1889
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:48,480
Outdoors so if you're growing outdoors

1890
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:52,260
and you're doing it organically look for

1891
01:17:48,479 --> 01:17:55,339
the really funky kind of skunky gassy

1892
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:57,900
rubbery stem rub in your Royal Mail

1893
01:17:55,340 --> 01:17:59,880
but you won't find them very often like

1894
01:17:57,899 --> 01:18:02,399
the a lot of the plants will all have

1895
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:05,699
the same smell when you rub the stem but

1896
01:18:02,399 --> 01:18:07,979
then one in 50 will be really incredible

1897
01:18:05,698 --> 01:18:10,799
compared to the rest and so if you have

1898
01:18:07,979 --> 01:18:12,718
enough of them to hunt through and find

1899
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:15,659
the one that really stands out with a

1900
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:18,359
strong stem rub that's a good bet but

1901
01:18:15,658 --> 01:18:19,738
going off a Vigor is another good way to

1902
01:18:18,359 --> 01:18:22,139
do it

1903
01:18:19,738 --> 01:18:24,599
yeah okay that that all makes sense and

1904
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:26,579
I mean if we talk specifically about the

1905
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:28,739
Royal cush line itself and the back

1906
01:18:26,579 --> 01:18:30,658
cross project are there any particular

1907
01:18:28,738 --> 01:18:33,178
traits that you're looking to really

1908
01:18:30,658 --> 01:18:34,859
focus on and preserve slash Take It

1909
01:18:33,179 --> 01:18:36,739
Forward in that direction or is it more

1910
01:18:34,859 --> 01:18:40,319
of just keeping it open

1911
01:18:36,738 --> 01:18:42,899
well like I said I'm I'm isolating the

1912
01:18:40,319 --> 01:18:46,039
different treats that we liked in the

1913
01:18:42,899 --> 01:18:50,899
Royal so for me that's

1914
01:18:46,039 --> 01:18:55,380
the early finishing sour profile so it's

1915
01:18:50,899 --> 01:18:57,839
Greener and soured useful terp dominant

1916
01:18:55,380 --> 01:19:00,000
but early finishing because that's

1917
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:02,880
what really made popular or the Royal

1918
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:06,300
popular was its early finishing mold

1919
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:08,039
resistant gas and it's purple so that's

1920
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:11,219
definitely something we're going to

1921
01:19:08,039 --> 01:19:13,800
continue to refine and isolate and then

1922
01:19:11,219 --> 01:19:19,020
there's also a really special Afghan

1923
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:22,140
dominant that's uh more like an OG but a

1924
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:23,219
lot greasier like it has the you know

1925
01:19:22,140 --> 01:19:25,800
how

1926
01:19:23,219 --> 01:19:29,520
the resin can if you put it in a bag

1927
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:31,380
some herbal like rub grease all over the

1928
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:33,320
inside of the bag and some won't it'll

1929
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:37,020
be more dry

1930
01:19:33,319 --> 01:19:41,039
uh crumbly resin you know um so we're

1931
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:44,040
trying to get the greasy OG selection

1932
01:19:41,039 --> 01:19:46,859
as well and then the strawberry and the

1933
01:19:44,039 --> 01:19:50,880
grape selections

1934
01:19:46,859 --> 01:19:54,539
um so we're isolating those into their

1935
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:56,579
own groups uh and trying to make you

1936
01:19:54,539 --> 01:19:58,738
know individual they'll still be royal

1937
01:19:56,579 --> 01:20:01,198
Kush but we'll say like this is the

1938
01:19:58,738 --> 01:20:03,539
strawberry selection and this is the

1939
01:20:01,198 --> 01:20:05,939
sour diesel selection

1940
01:20:03,539 --> 01:20:08,819
uh yeah

1941
01:20:05,939 --> 01:20:11,219
yeah okay and I mean just a moment ago

1942
01:20:08,819 --> 01:20:12,840
when you were referencing the stem rubs

1943
01:20:11,219 --> 01:20:15,600
you sort of mentioned like you know you

1944
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:19,020
might get a skunky sort of thing the

1945
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:21,179
whole family and um you know sort of Hot

1946
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:22,920
Topic in the community at the moment is

1947
01:20:21,179 --> 01:20:25,440
skunk genetics you know particularly

1948
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:27,600
that more acid sort of thing is that

1949
01:20:25,439 --> 01:20:28,738
something you have any memories of or

1950
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:30,300
something you'd like to work with going

1951
01:20:28,738 --> 01:20:31,738
forward or you're sort of more focused

1952
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:36,000
on other stuff

1953
01:20:31,738 --> 01:20:40,198
no it so I'm just as intrigued by all of

1954
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:43,800
that as most everyone else seems to be

1955
01:20:40,198 --> 01:20:46,439
um I really enjoy skunk terpenes and you

1956
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:48,600
know as far as strong smoke I think

1957
01:20:46,439 --> 01:20:50,698
that's some of the strongest out there

1958
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:52,860
if you find the you know the real deal

1959
01:20:50,698 --> 01:20:56,039
but I think it's

1960
01:20:52,859 --> 01:21:00,000
there's this something got lost in

1961
01:20:56,039 --> 01:21:01,679
memory because skunk weed doesn't really

1962
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,779
smell like a skunk when you have it

1963
01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:06,658
right up in your face you know like when

1964
01:21:03,779 --> 01:21:09,179
you're squeezing it and sniffing it

1965
01:21:06,658 --> 01:21:11,879
um it doesn't have that same

1966
01:21:09,179 --> 01:21:14,640
smell but like if you have it in a

1967
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:17,819
backpack in a hot car it's like very

1968
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:19,199
skunky because it's this like odor that

1969
01:21:17,819 --> 01:21:23,099
kind of

1970
01:21:19,198 --> 01:21:25,079
um evaporates into the the ambient air

1971
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:28,400
you know and so I think this whole hunt

1972
01:21:25,079 --> 01:21:31,439
for the real deal skunk is kind of

1973
01:21:28,399 --> 01:21:34,559
misguided because you know like sour

1974
01:21:31,439 --> 01:21:36,479
diesel you have really good Sour Diesel

1975
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:38,039
and you put it in a backpack and it gets

1976
01:21:36,479 --> 01:21:39,419
hot it smells like a skunk you know and

1977
01:21:38,039 --> 01:21:40,140
I think

1978
01:21:39,420 --> 01:21:42,960
um

1979
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:44,400
you but you take it out and you squeeze

1980
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:46,679
it and you roll a joint and you're

1981
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:48,420
smelling it up close it has more to it

1982
01:21:46,679 --> 01:21:50,340
than that it's got that you know the

1983
01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:51,600
fuel and everything but

1984
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:53,940
so I think

1985
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:56,100
people reminisce about the skunk that

1986
01:21:53,939 --> 01:21:58,379
they used to have and that nobody has

1987
01:21:56,100 --> 01:22:00,840
anymore I don't really think that's an

1988
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:03,420
accurate way of looking at it I think

1989
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:06,960
you know gassy weed is skunky and limey

1990
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:08,699
weed is skunky and if you you know in a

1991
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:10,198
certain circumstance it's going to smell

1992
01:22:08,698 --> 01:22:12,658
like a skunk but if you get up close

1993
01:22:10,198 --> 01:22:15,839
it's not going to have that same exact

1994
01:22:12,658 --> 01:22:18,420
profile and it has a few additional

1995
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:20,640
elements you know and so people think

1996
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:22,319
like no I want that real skunk from the

1997
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:26,340
80s and I think we still have it I think

1998
01:22:22,319 --> 01:22:28,799
like sour diesel and uh the limey ogs

1999
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:32,400
and stuff or skunky weed and I think

2000
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:35,159
that people in their memory

2001
01:22:32,399 --> 01:22:38,099
they're kind of misremembering

2002
01:22:35,158 --> 01:22:39,779
what it really was you know like I don't

2003
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:43,199
think there was ever anything that was

2004
01:22:39,779 --> 01:22:45,300
purely skunk Terps you know

2005
01:22:43,198 --> 01:22:48,479
um there's always been like some

2006
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:49,880
skunkiness with some other elements and

2007
01:22:48,479 --> 01:22:52,619
I think that

2008
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:54,960
Nostalgia and

2009
01:22:52,619 --> 01:22:56,640
you know the way our olfactory system is

2010
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:58,800
tied into our memory

2011
01:22:56,640 --> 01:23:02,239
has complicated the way people remember

2012
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:05,100
that yeah most certainly most certainly

2013
01:23:02,238 --> 01:23:07,979
on the topic of sort of fable genetics

2014
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:09,840
do you have any like old school or

2015
01:23:07,979 --> 01:23:11,819
special strains in your collection that

2016
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:13,619
you're sort of itching to bust out and

2017
01:23:11,819 --> 01:23:17,698
do a funeral hunt or work on in the

2018
01:23:13,619 --> 01:23:20,819
future yeah so the headband we're really

2019
01:23:17,698 --> 01:23:23,759
really trying to make good headband

2020
01:23:20,819 --> 01:23:25,859
seeds and it's kind of similar to like

2021
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:27,780
trying to make a sour diesel seed line

2022
01:23:25,859 --> 01:23:30,719
it's hard to do because there are a lot

2023
01:23:27,779 --> 01:23:31,859
of recessive treats and you can breed it

2024
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:34,140
and breed it and breed it all different

2025
01:23:31,859 --> 01:23:36,420
ways then you might never get there you

2026
01:23:34,140 --> 01:23:39,300
know like we're working on both trying

2027
01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:41,340
to make sour diesel or seeds that come

2028
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:43,560
as close to sour as we can in the

2029
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:45,600
headband as well but we're just not

2030
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:48,120
quite getting there yet you know and so

2031
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:50,400
we're working on that and it's a slow

2032
01:23:48,119 --> 01:23:52,859
process and it's a lot of like two steps

2033
01:23:50,399 --> 01:23:54,899
forward one step back or two steps back

2034
01:23:52,859 --> 01:23:57,359
one step forward you know and it's just

2035
01:23:54,899 --> 01:24:00,539
gotta work through it but yeah I'm

2036
01:23:57,359 --> 01:24:02,698
excited to eventually get back this 707

2037
01:24:00,539 --> 01:24:05,519
Headband and Seed form that we really

2038
01:24:02,698 --> 01:24:07,979
like nice and I mean is that you

2039
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:09,960
thinking that might be sort of like a

2040
01:24:07,979 --> 01:24:12,419
recreation or you're looking to do it

2041
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:13,800
via a different genetic pathway

2042
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:17,039
well

2043
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:20,060
we're trying to start with the

2044
01:24:17,039 --> 01:24:25,198
appearance that we started with before

2045
01:24:20,060 --> 01:24:27,300
and you know like we have the clones and

2046
01:24:25,198 --> 01:24:30,059
um some seeds that are close you know

2047
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:33,600
like the diesel diesel Afghani seeds and

2048
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:36,120
so we're kind of like redoing processes

2049
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:38,159
that we've done in the past but it you a

2050
01:24:36,119 --> 01:24:39,899
lot of times you can take the parents

2051
01:24:38,158 --> 01:24:40,759
that you think are going to create this

2052
01:24:39,899 --> 01:24:45,439
thing

2053
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:47,579
and just based on you know the random

2054
01:24:45,439 --> 01:24:49,859
probabilities of all of it you don't

2055
01:24:47,579 --> 01:24:52,019
quite get what you wanted out of it you

2056
01:24:49,859 --> 01:24:54,479
know and or maybe you have some traits

2057
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:56,820
that aren't desirable like a Herm or uh

2058
01:24:54,479 --> 01:24:59,339
you know some weird structure problem

2059
01:24:56,819 --> 01:25:02,460
with the plants or something so you know

2060
01:24:59,340 --> 01:25:04,679
it's so it takes time to do that and

2061
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:07,439
also we're just doing a lot all at once

2062
01:25:04,679 --> 01:25:09,840
like I run a farm you know fifteen

2063
01:25:07,439 --> 01:25:12,359
thousand square feet of light depth in

2064
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:14,460
full term and also trying to do all

2065
01:25:12,359 --> 01:25:16,439
these breeding projects and it's we're

2066
01:25:14,460 --> 01:25:18,239
spread a little bit thin so

2067
01:25:16,439 --> 01:25:21,238
takes a long time to get through all

2068
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:23,399
these projects yeah I can only imagine

2069
01:25:21,238 --> 01:25:25,019
and you know I'm gonna play devil's

2070
01:25:23,399 --> 01:25:27,299
advocate here and try to throw a little

2071
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:30,060
bit more work on your plate do you ever

2072
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:32,760
plan to do any work with like some sort

2073
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:35,100
of more sativa related lines I noticed

2074
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:36,960
that something which you know I might

2075
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:38,880
not have been able to spot it but it

2076
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:40,140
wasn't particularly represented is that

2077
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:42,840
something you would ever do or you're

2078
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:46,260
more sort of just into the Indica stuff

2079
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:48,960
well I personally get paranoid when I

2080
01:25:46,260 --> 01:25:51,179
smoke sativa dominant stuff it's just

2081
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:53,880
something with my body chemistry

2082
01:25:51,179 --> 01:25:57,840
it doesn't really agree with me and

2083
01:25:53,880 --> 01:26:00,300
that's you know for me to be good at

2084
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:01,800
breeding I have to breed things that are

2085
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:03,960
appealing to me

2086
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:05,820
or I can't make a good selection and I

2087
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:08,639
can't create a product that I can really

2088
01:26:05,819 --> 01:26:09,420
be proud of and you know put my name on

2089
01:26:08,639 --> 01:26:13,619
it

2090
01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:16,440
um so I do kind of focus on the things

2091
01:26:13,619 --> 01:26:17,639
that I like and indica's work for me or

2092
01:26:16,439 --> 01:26:19,919
you know I don't even think the Indica

2093
01:26:17,639 --> 01:26:22,079
sativa thing really makes sense of like

2094
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:26,520
that there are broad leaf plants that

2095
01:26:22,079 --> 01:26:29,039
have a sativa type of chemical profile

2096
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:30,900
and vice versa you know so that whole

2097
01:26:29,039 --> 01:26:34,079
way of talking about it doesn't even

2098
01:26:30,899 --> 01:26:36,960
really make sense to me but I do focus

2099
01:26:34,079 --> 01:26:39,960
on mercy and dominant terpene profiles

2100
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:40,679
definitely and beta-cariotylene

2101
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:42,658
um

2102
01:26:40,679 --> 01:26:44,760
might stay away from

2103
01:26:42,658 --> 01:26:48,059
a lot of the more sativa dominant stuff

2104
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:49,199
it's mostly my own taste and feeling

2105
01:26:48,060 --> 01:26:51,659
like

2106
01:26:49,198 --> 01:26:53,279
in order to be good at breathing I have

2107
01:26:51,658 --> 01:26:55,920
to focus on things that are appealing to

2108
01:26:53,279 --> 01:26:59,819
me but also I think the market much

2109
01:26:55,920 --> 01:27:04,319
prefers gas and mercy and dominant

2110
01:26:59,819 --> 01:27:08,099
flower too so yeah I'm not sure that I

2111
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:11,340
will focus much on sativas just because

2112
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:12,480
they're not what I would choose to smoke

2113
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:15,060
you know

2114
01:27:12,479 --> 01:27:17,158
yeah okay I mean that sounds like some

2115
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:18,960
good advice for you know people looking

2116
01:27:17,158 --> 01:27:21,179
to breed like read the things you're

2117
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:23,698
passionate about that you can discern

2118
01:27:21,179 --> 01:27:26,340
and whatnot do you have any other sort

2119
01:27:23,698 --> 01:27:28,379
of recommendations for people sort of

2120
01:27:26,340 --> 01:27:30,840
aspiring breeders maybe looking to start

2121
01:27:28,380 --> 01:27:32,760
their own breeding program what would

2122
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:35,699
you recommend to them in terms of how to

2123
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:37,760
do things properly to do only one

2124
01:27:35,698 --> 01:27:41,698
breeding project at a time

2125
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:44,460
don't start by putting a male in with 50

2126
01:27:41,698 --> 01:27:46,500
hype clones because you'll create too

2127
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:48,960
much work for yourself to hunt through

2128
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:50,100
all of those plants and to find the ones

2129
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:52,260
that are special that you should

2130
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:54,719
continue breeding with like you know the

2131
01:27:52,260 --> 01:27:58,199
Royal is a good example where we started

2132
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:59,639
with you know three plants and you know

2133
01:27:58,198 --> 01:28:01,019
we crossed two of them together and then

2134
01:27:59,639 --> 01:28:04,199
we cross those two with the other one

2135
01:28:01,020 --> 01:28:06,780
and just by refining that work over you

2136
01:28:04,198 --> 01:28:08,759
know 15 years or whatever we've found

2137
01:28:06,779 --> 01:28:11,519
really special stuff that's very

2138
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:13,800
different from the other phenotypes or

2139
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:16,620
whatever the different profiles that are

2140
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:18,779
in there you don't need to use a lot of

2141
01:28:16,619 --> 01:28:21,420
starting material to find a lot of

2142
01:28:18,779 --> 01:28:23,759
different things in the lines you're

2143
01:28:21,420 --> 01:28:26,340
working on that you can you know just

2144
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:28,619
really thoroughly hunt through one cross

2145
01:28:26,340 --> 01:28:31,739
and that will be more rewarding I think

2146
01:28:28,619 --> 01:28:34,319
for people than it would be to try to

2147
01:28:31,738 --> 01:28:37,019
you know put a male in with the 50 hype

2148
01:28:34,319 --> 01:28:38,880
loans and then to try to hunt through

2149
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:40,679
all of that well take you a really long

2150
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:43,319
time and it'll be really difficult so

2151
01:28:40,679 --> 01:28:46,679
focus on one project at a time it's my

2152
01:28:43,319 --> 01:28:48,179
advice and to be thorough and to take

2153
01:28:46,679 --> 01:28:50,940
your time doing it

2154
01:28:48,179 --> 01:28:53,460
solid advice solid advice

2155
01:28:50,939 --> 01:28:57,419
so something I wanted to bring up and

2156
01:28:53,460 --> 01:29:00,420
ask you was how do you feel slash how do

2157
01:28:57,420 --> 01:29:03,539
you deal with the sort of variety of

2158
01:29:00,420 --> 01:29:05,340
various companies that have been using a

2159
01:29:03,539 --> 01:29:07,439
lot of mandelbrot's genetics in their

2160
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:09,360
work probably more notably since his

2161
01:29:07,439 --> 01:29:11,039
past you know are you okay with it do

2162
01:29:09,359 --> 01:29:13,799
you have any issues what's your thoughts

2163
01:29:11,039 --> 01:29:18,179
on that I'm totally okay with it in fact

2164
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:20,820
I I like I think the more his work gets

2165
01:29:18,179 --> 01:29:24,440
out there the better the only time I've

2166
01:29:20,819 --> 01:29:26,059
had issues is when people are lying and

2167
01:29:24,439 --> 01:29:29,099
misrepresenting

2168
01:29:26,060 --> 01:29:31,620
relationships or saying they're doing it

2169
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:34,139
for charity when they're not you know

2170
01:29:31,619 --> 01:29:36,479
like there's a good way to do it and a

2171
01:29:34,139 --> 01:29:39,840
not so good way to do it if if you're

2172
01:29:36,479 --> 01:29:41,459
just making knockoffs for profit and

2173
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:43,260
you're lying to people about your

2174
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:45,658
relationship with him which is the thing

2175
01:29:43,260 --> 01:29:47,219
that has happened several times I really

2176
01:29:45,658 --> 01:29:49,439
don't like that and I've spoken out

2177
01:29:47,219 --> 01:29:51,719
about it but if you're just breeding

2178
01:29:49,439 --> 01:29:54,419
things that you like and like maybe

2179
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:57,179
making a recreation of his work and

2180
01:29:54,420 --> 01:29:59,639
you're doing it with respect for him and

2181
01:29:57,179 --> 01:30:01,679
the you know the work that he put in I'm

2182
01:29:59,639 --> 01:30:04,920
totally all about that you know it's

2183
01:30:01,679 --> 01:30:06,840
just the the being decent about it is

2184
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:10,020
important

2185
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:12,420
yeah okay I mean sort of the the

2186
01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:16,380
elephant in the room but I think people

2187
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:17,940
will sort of expect us to to touch on it

2188
01:30:16,380 --> 01:30:20,400
um you know there has been a few

2189
01:30:17,939 --> 01:30:22,259
releases from Aficionado seeds in the

2190
01:30:20,399 --> 01:30:24,479
past which were just sort of straight

2191
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:27,600
filial breedings or just sort of

2192
01:30:24,479 --> 01:30:29,279
extensions without necessarily new input

2193
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:31,320
of genetics

2194
01:30:29,279 --> 01:30:35,579
um that were done under the Aficionado

2195
01:30:31,319 --> 01:30:38,340
brand has that ever did Leo make good on

2196
01:30:35,579 --> 01:30:41,219
the um the the promises in terms of

2197
01:30:38,340 --> 01:30:43,679
donating funds towards

2198
01:30:41,219 --> 01:30:45,239
um your your nephew and the the things

2199
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:48,539
that were sort of said at the time or is

2200
01:30:45,238 --> 01:30:51,419
that still a contentious sort of no not

2201
01:30:48,539 --> 01:30:53,100
at all so that's that's kind of the

2202
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:54,480
example I was bringing up and I don't

2203
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:57,420
like to talk about this stuff too much

2204
01:30:54,479 --> 01:30:59,638
but people ask all the time so

2205
01:30:57,420 --> 01:31:03,060
um yeah you know at the emerald cup a

2206
01:30:59,639 --> 01:31:05,039
few years ago he put out the oil spill

2207
01:31:03,060 --> 01:31:07,440
and he said that all the proceeds were

2208
01:31:05,039 --> 01:31:09,600
going to charity for my nephew you who

2209
01:31:07,439 --> 01:31:11,819
had had a stroke like you know my

2210
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:14,280
brother dies and then not very much

2211
01:31:11,819 --> 01:31:17,039
later his son has a stroke and almost

2212
01:31:14,279 --> 01:31:20,759
died like he was life-flighted between

2213
01:31:17,039 --> 01:31:23,219
hospitals and you know clinging for life

2214
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:26,699
and right around that same time

2215
01:31:23,219 --> 01:31:28,859
this guy is selling knockoffs and saying

2216
01:31:26,698 --> 01:31:30,599
the money is going to charity charging

2217
01:31:28,859 --> 01:31:32,939
eight hundred dollars a pack for the

2218
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:34,920
seeds and keeping all the money you know

2219
01:31:32,939 --> 01:31:38,099
he gave a really tiny percentage of it

2220
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:40,500
publicly like through GoFundMe you know

2221
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:43,079
he probably sold 300 Grand worth of the

2222
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:46,319
seeds and he gave a few thousand dollars

2223
01:31:43,079 --> 01:31:48,300
uh in a public way to make it look like

2224
01:31:46,319 --> 01:31:51,179
look what we're doing for the sick kid

2225
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:52,679
you know but he was lying and cheating

2226
01:31:51,179 --> 01:31:55,079
and

2227
01:31:52,679 --> 01:31:56,699
um promising thus that oh when he has

2228
01:31:55,079 --> 01:31:59,219
the money he's going to give us a bunch

2229
01:31:56,698 --> 01:32:01,619
more and never intending to make good on

2230
01:31:59,219 --> 01:32:05,579
it and you know it's not

2231
01:32:01,619 --> 01:32:07,380
selling seeds that were you know my

2232
01:32:05,579 --> 01:32:10,439
brother's creation that bothers me it's

2233
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:12,239
the fact that he was lying and stealing

2234
01:32:10,439 --> 01:32:14,879
from a sick kid and telling people he's

2235
01:32:12,238 --> 01:32:19,198
doing charity when he wasn't you know

2236
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:21,719
um and it's a very long and convoluted

2237
01:32:19,198 --> 01:32:25,079
story he did that with the oil spill the

2238
01:32:21,719 --> 01:32:28,198
Royal Kush the what he you know this is

2239
01:32:25,079 --> 01:32:31,738
another thing where he um

2240
01:32:28,198 --> 01:32:33,899
called it the magnum opus but he made a

2241
01:32:31,738 --> 01:32:36,059
watered-down version of Royal Kush that

2242
01:32:33,899 --> 01:32:38,158
hermed and then he called it my

2243
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:40,800
brother's magnum opus and sold it for

2244
01:32:38,158 --> 01:32:42,299
obscene amounts of money again saying

2245
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:44,820
that the money was going to my family

2246
01:32:42,300 --> 01:32:45,980
when it wasn't and that's like a slap in

2247
01:32:44,819 --> 01:32:48,658
the face you know

2248
01:32:45,979 --> 01:32:52,678
my brother's actual work what's his

2249
01:32:48,658 --> 01:32:55,799
magnum opus not this [ __ ] delete

2250
01:32:52,679 --> 01:32:57,539
yeah that's that's a that's Obama to

2251
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:59,579
hear that that sort of how that one's

2252
01:32:57,539 --> 01:33:02,158
played out and you know we hope your

2253
01:32:59,579 --> 01:33:04,920
nephew can get all the the funds and um

2254
01:33:02,158 --> 01:33:07,799
help that he's been promised it raises

2255
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:10,980
another question in my mind in general

2256
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:13,020
about the pricing in the retail Seed

2257
01:33:10,979 --> 01:33:14,939
Market and much like many other

2258
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:17,040
Industries in this world you know

2259
01:33:14,939 --> 01:33:18,539
there's always a high-end scene for

2260
01:33:17,039 --> 01:33:20,639
things but I was wondering what's your

2261
01:33:18,539 --> 01:33:23,519
thoughts on the high-end retail market

2262
01:33:20,639 --> 01:33:25,619
for breeders who do sell you know what

2263
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:28,380
might be described as sort of limited

2264
01:33:25,619 --> 01:33:30,960
releases or just premium prices in

2265
01:33:28,380 --> 01:33:32,639
general do you have any issues with that

2266
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:34,739
or do you think it's sort of akin to

2267
01:33:32,639 --> 01:33:36,179
like the premium sneaker market like

2268
01:33:34,738 --> 01:33:38,759
there's just always going to be demand

2269
01:33:36,179 --> 01:33:41,219
for the high-end exclusive sort of stuff

2270
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:44,340
you know I don't have a problem with it

2271
01:33:41,219 --> 01:33:46,920
I don't charge that much you know I

2272
01:33:44,340 --> 01:33:49,980
think two hundred dollars is the most

2273
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:52,199
that you can reasonably charge for a

2274
01:33:49,979 --> 01:33:54,000
pack of seeds you know and like for that

2275
01:33:52,198 --> 01:33:57,299
to be justified by the work that you've

2276
01:33:54,000 --> 01:34:00,000
done but at the same time that there is

2277
01:33:57,300 --> 01:34:03,119
demand for the most expensive product

2278
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:05,340
like the people that buy Gucci and uh

2279
01:34:03,119 --> 01:34:08,099
Louis Vuitton buy it because it's

2280
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:11,340
[ __ ] expensive and it it gives them a

2281
01:34:08,100 --> 01:34:13,260
sense of status and uh like they have

2282
01:34:11,340 --> 01:34:16,020
something that most people can't get and

2283
01:34:13,260 --> 01:34:17,579
there is demand for that and it's a free

2284
01:34:16,020 --> 01:34:20,100
market where people should create

2285
01:34:17,579 --> 01:34:22,019
products that are in demand I have no

2286
01:34:20,100 --> 01:34:25,679
issue with that

2287
01:34:22,020 --> 01:34:28,260
um but I think that it would be better

2288
01:34:25,679 --> 01:34:29,880
those companies that charge 800 for a

2289
01:34:28,260 --> 01:34:31,800
pack of seeds should also have some

2290
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:34,800
offerings that other people can afford

2291
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:36,980
you know you shouldn't just sell the

2292
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:39,840
very high-end stuff you should have

2293
01:34:36,979 --> 01:34:42,299
limited releases maybe of some high-end

2294
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:43,980
stuff that's expensive

2295
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:46,860
um but you should also have some stuff

2296
01:34:43,979 --> 01:34:50,459
that most people can afford and also you

2297
01:34:46,859 --> 01:34:54,359
shouldn't put out f1s that are untested

2298
01:34:50,460 --> 01:34:57,719
in a fancy box and say that they're this

2299
01:34:54,359 --> 01:35:00,719
coveted rare very refined thing when

2300
01:34:57,719 --> 01:35:03,179
they're not I I find that a lot of the

2301
01:35:00,719 --> 01:35:05,039
companies that charge that much

2302
01:35:03,179 --> 01:35:07,679
are really taking advantage of people

2303
01:35:05,039 --> 01:35:09,658
and selling them an inferior product I

2304
01:35:07,679 --> 01:35:12,539
don't like that you know but

2305
01:35:09,658 --> 01:35:15,420
um there's there is demand for that

2306
01:35:12,539 --> 01:35:17,698
Boutique expensive product that's you

2307
01:35:15,420 --> 01:35:20,460
know limited and you know hard to get

2308
01:35:17,698 --> 01:35:21,960
and I don't fault that it's just the way

2309
01:35:20,460 --> 01:35:25,139
that some of these companies have done

2310
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:27,600
it isn't super classy

2311
01:35:25,139 --> 01:35:30,359
sure I mean I noticed on your website

2312
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:33,120
that you had a strain called the real

2313
01:35:30,359 --> 01:35:34,920
rose and it made me wonder are you able

2314
01:35:33,119 --> 01:35:36,238
to give us any more backstory on that

2315
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:37,619
one at all

2316
01:35:36,238 --> 01:35:41,698
yeah

2317
01:35:37,619 --> 01:35:44,698
um you know so Shiloh and I were like

2318
01:35:41,698 --> 01:35:47,759
been talking about opening a new brand

2319
01:35:44,698 --> 01:35:50,519
together like the mandelbrot's family

2320
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:52,739
heirlooms name was actually something

2321
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:55,500
that he thought up and we were planning

2322
01:35:52,738 --> 01:35:59,339
on putting out the rose under that label

2323
01:35:55,500 --> 01:36:00,840
and then a few months later you know

2324
01:35:59,340 --> 01:36:03,119
like we just hadn't talked for a little

2325
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:05,940
while and then they put out the rose

2326
01:36:03,119 --> 01:36:07,439
under dying breeds you know and they

2327
01:36:05,939 --> 01:36:09,500
entered it in the cup and they won and

2328
01:36:07,439 --> 01:36:13,379
then you made this article

2329
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:15,719
saying um that they didn't know the

2330
01:36:13,380 --> 01:36:19,079
actual parentage of the Rose

2331
01:36:15,719 --> 01:36:21,600
and so you know like that the terpene

2332
01:36:19,079 --> 01:36:23,579
profile of the Rose is definitely Royal

2333
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:26,579
Kush dominant you know that floral

2334
01:36:23,579 --> 01:36:27,600
profile it's Royal and they just lied

2335
01:36:26,579 --> 01:36:29,460
about it and they made this article

2336
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:32,520
saying oh we don't know what the parents

2337
01:36:29,460 --> 01:36:33,420
are you know uh so I definitely felt

2338
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:36,300
cheated

2339
01:36:33,420 --> 01:36:38,940
after all that wasn't very cool

2340
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:40,320
yeah that's that's interesting that they

2341
01:36:38,939 --> 01:36:42,899
would do that I you know what you're

2342
01:36:40,319 --> 01:36:45,179
right I remember they entered it in the

2343
01:36:42,899 --> 01:36:47,460
the emerald cup and uh there was a bit

2344
01:36:45,179 --> 01:36:48,840
of controversy that year and like I

2345
01:36:47,460 --> 01:36:51,119
think a lot of people were sort of

2346
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:53,279
expecting that Rose to win but it ended

2347
01:36:51,119 --> 01:36:55,380
up not winning yeah you know I don't

2348
01:36:53,279 --> 01:36:57,420
know like there's

2349
01:36:55,380 --> 01:36:59,279
you know after that happened there you

2350
01:36:57,420 --> 01:37:01,380
know people that are really well tuned

2351
01:36:59,279 --> 01:37:03,359
to the history of all this stuff and

2352
01:37:01,380 --> 01:37:05,340
like who saw the flower at the cup they

2353
01:37:03,359 --> 01:37:07,559
were selling eights at their booth at

2354
01:37:05,340 --> 01:37:08,819
the cup and people knew us as they

2355
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:10,620
opened those jars that it was a royal

2356
01:37:08,819 --> 01:37:12,779
hybrid you know and like

2357
01:37:10,619 --> 01:37:14,579
so I got immediately afterwards people

2358
01:37:12,779 --> 01:37:17,819
were like so what's going on with that

2359
01:37:14,579 --> 01:37:21,000
you know uh why are they being dishonest

2360
01:37:17,819 --> 01:37:23,639
and then you know I was like not fully

2361
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:25,679
aware of what was going on with it at

2362
01:37:23,639 --> 01:37:27,659
first and then after they put out that

2363
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:29,639
article where they said that they didn't

2364
01:37:27,658 --> 01:37:30,299
know what the parents were it was you

2365
01:37:29,639 --> 01:37:33,239
know

2366
01:37:30,300 --> 01:37:35,639
yeah understandable understandable

2367
01:37:33,238 --> 01:37:38,218
well look if people are looking to get

2368
01:37:35,639 --> 01:37:40,800
some uh some real rose seeds it's not

2369
01:37:38,219 --> 01:37:42,658
just a pun it's also the strain name

2370
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:44,940
um you know I know that you guys have

2371
01:37:42,658 --> 01:37:47,460

2398
01:38:41,039 --> 01:38:45,719
place where people can watch some of the

2399
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:49,279
mini documentary series that was done on

2400
01:38:45,719 --> 01:38:51,480
mandelbrot uh no actually so that's that

2401
01:38:49,279 --> 01:38:53,219
emeraldmountainlegacy.com which is like

2402
01:38:51,479 --> 01:38:55,138
an informational website where we don't

2403
01:38:53,219 --> 01:38:57,060
do any sales

2404
01:38:55,139 --> 01:38:59,460
um but you that's a good place to reach

2405
01:38:57,060 --> 01:39:01,860
out if you have questions about the

2406
01:38:59,460 --> 01:39:04,319
genetics or about you know

2407
01:39:01,859 --> 01:39:05,939
maybe like how they might perform for

2408
01:39:04,319 --> 01:39:07,139
you and your environment or anything

2409
01:39:05,939 --> 01:39:08,879
like that

2410
01:39:07,139 --> 01:39:11,699
um but the sales are all done through

2411
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:12,779
North Coast Novelties and then we do a

2412
01:39:11,698 --> 01:39:15,599
lot of like

2413
01:39:12,779 --> 01:39:19,019
educational and like the video series is

2414
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:21,960
posted at Emerald Mountain legacy.com

2415
01:39:19,020 --> 01:39:23,940
yeah I mean on the other end of the

2416
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:25,859
spectrum you know you've done some

2417
01:39:23,939 --> 01:39:27,658
collabs which have been really quite

2418
01:39:25,859 --> 01:39:29,639
successful and the one that I think a

2419
01:39:27,658 --> 01:39:32,219
lot of people have taken note of is The

2420
01:39:29,639 --> 01:39:34,739
Royale with cherries which is not only a

2421
01:39:32,219 --> 01:39:36,480
collab with me and Gene but you know a

2422
01:39:34,738 --> 01:39:39,178
great sort of little play on words from

2423
01:39:36,479 --> 01:39:41,519
the Pulp Fiction movie how do you

2424
01:39:39,179 --> 01:39:43,440
describe that line to people and will we

2425
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:45,480
be seeing more of it slash any more

2426
01:39:43,439 --> 01:39:46,979
collaborations in the future

2427
01:39:45,479 --> 01:39:51,479
yeah

2428
01:39:46,979 --> 01:39:54,479
um so that one you know it's interesting

2429
01:39:51,479 --> 01:39:56,879
because a lot of Royal crosses come out

2430
01:39:54,479 --> 01:39:59,879
mostly Royal dominant you know where

2431
01:39:56,880 --> 01:40:01,679
it's like Royal with a little bit of the

2432
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:05,219
elements of the other thing just because

2433
01:40:01,679 --> 01:40:07,679
Royal has been bred or inbred for a long

2434
01:40:05,219 --> 01:40:10,380
time so it has a lot of the treats kind

2435
01:40:07,679 --> 01:40:12,539
of locked in and they they tend to pass

2436
01:40:10,380 --> 01:40:14,819
on to The Offspring but the Royale with

2437
01:40:12,539 --> 01:40:16,619
cherries you know Jackson does a lot of

2438
01:40:14,819 --> 01:40:18,238
great work and he

2439
01:40:16,619 --> 01:40:21,359
um kind of has a similar thing going on

2440
01:40:18,238 --> 01:40:23,158
where uh the traits of his stuff are

2441
01:40:21,359 --> 01:40:25,259
dominant in The Offspring and that's one

2442
01:40:23,158 --> 01:40:26,819
of you where you know you cross Royal

2443
01:40:25,260 --> 01:40:29,280
with something else and it comes out

2444
01:40:26,819 --> 01:40:32,460
actually leaning more towards the cherry

2445
01:40:29,279 --> 01:40:35,698
limeade or whatever Cherry Lime Pop

2446
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:38,579
um than it does the Royal but so it's a

2447
01:40:35,698 --> 01:40:41,099
very cherry and lime dominant terpene

2448
01:40:38,579 --> 01:40:43,260
profile but it has a lot of the

2449
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:46,079
strengths of the royal where you know

2450
01:40:43,260 --> 01:40:49,679
it's mold resistant and chunky in early

2451
01:40:46,079 --> 01:40:51,119
finishing and has some gas you know so

2452
01:40:49,679 --> 01:40:53,760
that one was really interesting because

2453
01:40:51,119 --> 01:40:55,679
it didn't follow the trend of being like

2454
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:58,199
Royal with a little element of something

2455
01:40:55,679 --> 01:41:01,199
else it's it's really cherry and lime

2456
01:40:58,198 --> 01:41:04,559
dominant and it's great smoke there uh

2457
01:41:01,198 --> 01:41:07,859
there's some variation but they all have

2458
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:11,039
lime and chicken and I'm for sure and

2459
01:41:07,859 --> 01:41:13,259
your other question we probably will be

2460
01:41:11,039 --> 01:41:16,198
doing more collabs but you know you

2461
01:41:13,260 --> 01:41:20,039
gotta make something new and test it out

2462
01:41:16,198 --> 01:41:22,379
and both of us have to approve of how it

2463
01:41:20,039 --> 01:41:23,939
comes out you know maybe we'll be able

2464
01:41:22,380 --> 01:41:24,859
to do that again and maybe not it's hard

2465
01:41:23,939 --> 01:41:28,019
to say

2466
01:41:24,859 --> 01:41:30,000
yeah sure understandable I mean another

2467
01:41:28,020 --> 01:41:33,120
one that I was interested in was you'd

2468
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:35,460
done a collab with HBK the Chile Verde

2469
01:41:33,119 --> 01:41:37,198
cross Royal it's not not a ton of

2470
01:41:35,460 --> 01:41:38,880
information about that one out there how

2471
01:41:37,198 --> 01:41:40,859
would you describe that one for people

2472
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:43,618
who might have a pack and are sort of

2473
01:41:40,859 --> 01:41:46,979
wondering if they want to pop it

2474
01:41:43,618 --> 01:41:48,479
um it's really interesting it's the the

2475
01:41:46,979 --> 01:41:50,638
flavor

2476
01:41:48,479 --> 01:41:53,218
like the lavender

2477
01:41:50,639 --> 01:41:56,159
that comes through in the Chile Verde

2478
01:41:53,219 --> 01:41:58,679
has this lingering feeling in your mouth

2479
01:41:56,158 --> 01:42:01,259
where it's like you have like candy

2480
01:41:58,679 --> 01:42:04,079
coating in your mouth that just lingers

2481
01:42:01,260 --> 01:42:05,820
after you take a puff you know and

2482
01:42:04,079 --> 01:42:07,920
that's what I found most intriguing

2483
01:42:05,819 --> 01:42:10,799
about that cross is that it's got this

2484
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:13,739
really nice lingering flavor

2485
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:15,900
um and it's again it's one that has

2486
01:42:13,738 --> 01:42:18,118
traits of both parents it doesn't lean

2487
01:42:15,899 --> 01:42:20,399
one way or the other really

2488
01:42:18,118 --> 01:42:23,519
um but it's very good it doesn't yield

2489
01:42:20,399 --> 01:42:25,559
super well and some of the plants are a

2490
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:28,260
little finicky with feeding and stuff

2491
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:29,400
but the the terpene profile is really

2492
01:42:28,260 --> 01:42:31,860
awesome

2493
01:42:29,399 --> 01:42:33,238
yeah nice nice little description there

2494
01:42:31,859 --> 01:42:35,279
I've always been interested in the Chile

2495
01:42:33,238 --> 01:42:37,678
Verde crosses because for all the sort

2496
01:42:35,279 --> 01:42:39,420
of critical Acclaim it's it's hard you

2497
01:42:37,679 --> 01:42:41,819
really don't see it getting used in a

2498
01:42:39,420 --> 01:42:43,260
lot of crosses but that'll be a cool one

2499
01:42:41,819 --> 01:42:44,579
for people to check out

2500
01:42:43,260 --> 01:42:47,219
yeah

2501
01:42:44,579 --> 01:42:49,198
so the next question I had which was

2502
01:42:47,219 --> 01:42:51,899
submitted by one of the listeners was

2503
01:42:49,198 --> 01:42:54,960
they were sort of wondering if you were

2504
01:42:51,899 --> 01:42:57,118
aware of any differences between the

2505
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:59,880
Long Valley Royal cush which was put out

2506
01:42:57,118 --> 01:43:02,158
by Aficionado versus the Royal Kush and

2507
01:42:59,880 --> 01:43:04,980
specifically this person said you know I

2508
01:43:02,158 --> 01:43:07,319
got some of the Long Valley Royal and

2509
01:43:04,979 --> 01:43:08,939
um wasn't didn't really feel like it

2510
01:43:07,319 --> 01:43:12,000
took in the direction that the Royal

2511
01:43:08,939 --> 01:43:14,039
Kush was described as do you feel like

2512
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:15,899
there's some pretty big differences in

2513
01:43:14,039 --> 01:43:17,519
those releases or they are fairly

2514
01:43:15,899 --> 01:43:18,658
similar given it's sort of just line

2515
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:22,560
worked

2516
01:43:18,658 --> 01:43:24,539
uh no they are very different and I have

2517
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:26,039
some theories about that but I don't

2518
01:43:24,539 --> 01:43:28,979
want to get into

2519
01:43:26,039 --> 01:43:29,698
the drama of all that

2520
01:43:28,979 --> 01:43:32,218
um

2521
01:43:29,698 --> 01:43:35,399
so I'd rather not fully answer that one

2522
01:43:32,219 --> 01:43:38,039
but they are different see that

2523
01:43:35,399 --> 01:43:39,479
okay sure so maybe we'll just leave it

2524
01:43:38,039 --> 01:43:41,039
as you know if you tried the Long Valley

2525
01:43:39,479 --> 01:43:43,500
Royal and you weren't impressed maybe

2526
01:43:41,039 --> 01:43:46,079
just give the real deal a go and put

2527
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:49,079
some faith in that yeah

2528
01:43:46,079 --> 01:43:50,880
okay cool cool cool just a few more

2529
01:43:49,079 --> 01:43:52,920
questions before we jump into the tail

2530
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:55,199
end the strain which I think probably

2531
01:43:52,920 --> 01:43:58,679
most caught my eye on the site was in

2532
01:43:55,198 --> 01:44:00,779
fact the 47 and it's sort of interesting

2533
01:43:58,679 --> 01:44:02,819
because I'm assuming it's a little bit

2534
01:44:00,779 --> 01:44:04,380
more special a little bit more rare it's

2535
01:44:02,819 --> 01:44:06,000
it's priced a little differently but

2536
01:44:04,380 --> 01:44:08,279
when you read the description it sort of

2537
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:09,719
makes sense how would you pitch this to

2538
01:44:08,279 --> 01:44:12,000
someone would this maybe be a good

2539
01:44:09,719 --> 01:44:13,439
option for our friend in the last

2540
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:15,600
question who didn't have the best

2541
01:44:13,439 --> 01:44:17,158
experience with the Long Valley

2542
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:20,940
yeah

2543
01:44:17,158 --> 01:44:24,118
um so if you actually want the original

2544
01:44:20,939 --> 01:44:27,359
authentic Royal Kush don't go for the 47

2545
01:44:24,118 --> 01:44:29,698
the 47 is different but it's amazing you

2546
01:44:27,359 --> 01:44:31,920
know it's very good it's just its own

2547
01:44:29,698 --> 01:44:35,638
separate thing kind of

2548
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:38,520
um there are some phenotypes that are

2549
01:44:35,639 --> 01:44:41,639
like smell like cantaloupe and they're

2550
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:43,560
like it just looks incredible the I

2551
01:44:41,639 --> 01:44:46,739
think the look of it is really special

2552
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:50,960
and it's very early finishing

2553
01:44:46,738 --> 01:44:54,779
um but not all of them are super gassy

2554
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:56,698
authentic Royal Kush Vinos but there

2555
01:44:54,779 --> 01:44:59,219
there are some phinos in there that are

2556
01:44:56,698 --> 01:45:01,979
incredibly gassy it's just that they're

2557
01:44:59,219 --> 01:45:06,719
in there with a mix of that and a more

2558
01:45:01,979 --> 01:45:10,138
fruity kind of uh different variation on

2559
01:45:06,719 --> 01:45:12,960
it so as far as looks it's one of the

2560
01:45:10,139 --> 01:45:15,239
best looking flowers I've ever grown and

2561
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:17,639
I really like all the different profiles

2562
01:45:15,238 --> 01:45:18,718
of it but there are some different ones

2563
01:45:17,639 --> 01:45:22,980
and

2564
01:45:18,719 --> 01:45:26,520
the the gassy more Royal authentic Royal

2565
01:45:22,979 --> 01:45:28,799
is in there but it's you know it's you

2566
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:30,239
gotta hunt through them to find it and

2567
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:31,380
that is if you do find it it's

2568
01:45:30,238 --> 01:45:35,099
incredible

2569
01:45:31,380 --> 01:45:37,079
but if you're wanting all the seeds to

2570
01:45:35,100 --> 01:45:39,719
come out gassy

2571
01:45:37,079 --> 01:45:42,960
um just go with the like Royal Kush nine

2572
01:45:39,719 --> 01:45:46,020
or ten you'll find more gasifinos in

2573
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:48,300
there but the one the couple of phinos

2574
01:45:46,020 --> 01:45:49,679
that are really gassy in the 47 are

2575
01:45:48,300 --> 01:45:52,920
super special

2576
01:45:49,679 --> 01:45:54,539
and you know it's just kind of more of a

2577
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:56,819
grab bag

2578
01:45:54,539 --> 01:45:58,139
um but one that you'll be happy with I

2579
01:45:56,819 --> 01:46:00,899
think

2580
01:45:58,139 --> 01:46:03,060
yeah nice I mean you've certainly got me

2581
01:46:00,899 --> 01:46:05,279
hyped to to grow out some Royal seeds

2582
01:46:03,060 --> 01:46:08,400
and see what I can find it's a special

2583
01:46:05,279 --> 01:46:11,340
line by the sounds of it no question so

2584
01:46:08,399 --> 01:46:12,359
in terms of I mean we've kind of touched

2585
01:46:11,340 --> 01:46:14,400
on this but I just want to get a

2586
01:46:12,359 --> 01:46:16,920
definitive verdict so that the listeners

2587
01:46:14,399 --> 01:46:19,019
know for sure out of all the crosses

2588
01:46:16,920 --> 01:46:21,539
you've been able to create since

2589
01:46:19,020 --> 01:46:23,159
starting Emerald Mountain Legacy if you

2590
01:46:21,539 --> 01:46:25,139
could only recommend one to someone

2591
01:46:23,158 --> 01:46:26,819
without really knowing much about their

2592
01:46:25,139 --> 01:46:29,219
preferences but just something that you

2593
01:46:26,819 --> 01:46:31,019
can really stand behind which of the

2594
01:46:29,219 --> 01:46:31,980
crosses you've made would you recommend

2595
01:46:31,020 --> 01:46:35,159
to someone

2596
01:46:31,979 --> 01:46:37,079
uh if I have to pick one it would be the

2597
01:46:35,158 --> 01:46:37,679
royal wedding

2598
01:46:37,079 --> 01:46:40,019
um

2599
01:46:37,679 --> 01:46:43,079
you know it kind of checks all the boxes

2600
01:46:40,020 --> 01:46:46,139
it it yields very well it's very mold

2601
01:46:43,079 --> 01:46:49,859
resistant it's easy to grow it has good

2602
01:46:46,139 --> 01:46:52,859
structure it's gassy and it's purple and

2603
01:46:49,859 --> 01:46:55,618
it comes out consistently you know like

2604
01:46:52,859 --> 01:46:57,000
there's not a ton of variation in how

2605
01:46:55,618 --> 01:47:00,238
they come out

2606
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:01,698
um so for for our more recent projects

2607
01:47:00,238 --> 01:47:06,118
that one

2608
01:47:01,698 --> 01:47:09,419
just across the board really kind of

2609
01:47:06,118 --> 01:47:12,000
gets everything or you know it uh covers

2610
01:47:09,420 --> 01:47:14,460
all the bases I would say and you know

2611
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:16,738
but there are different ones like my

2612
01:47:14,460 --> 01:47:19,980
favorite Fino out of everything I've

2613
01:47:16,738 --> 01:47:23,459
made is a royal line spino that's very

2614
01:47:19,979 --> 01:47:27,299
skunky and uh it's got that limey gas

2615
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:29,039
skunk kind of thing going on but not all

2616
01:47:27,300 --> 01:47:31,139
the seeds come out that way you know so

2617
01:47:29,039 --> 01:47:34,800
but the royal wedding I'd say it's

2618
01:47:31,139 --> 01:47:37,380
consistently great and really fits the

2619
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:40,800
demand out there

2620
01:47:37,380 --> 01:47:42,600
yeah great response and sort of as a

2621
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:45,119
follow-up to that given the wedding cake

2622
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:47,579
in the lineage you mentioned that you

2623
01:47:45,118 --> 01:47:50,039
like sort of being able to work these

2624
01:47:47,579 --> 01:47:52,979
hype strands into sort of more

2625
01:47:50,039 --> 01:47:55,260
well-behaved lines shall we say

2626
01:47:52,979 --> 01:47:57,959
um another question we got was do you

2627
01:47:55,260 --> 01:47:59,880
ever feel like the brand culture or hype

2628
01:47:57,960 --> 01:48:01,439
culture sort of affects your breeding

2629
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:04,079
and that there's sort of like a bit of

2630
01:48:01,439 --> 01:48:06,839
pressure to work with these super new

2631
01:48:04,079 --> 01:48:08,880
exotic Cookie varieties which admittedly

2632
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:11,579
a lot of the old school breeders are not

2633
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:13,739
as fond of as say the more newer modern

2634
01:48:11,579 --> 01:48:15,779
enthusiasts do you ever feel pressured

2635
01:48:13,738 --> 01:48:17,158
to work with them or not really if you

2636
01:48:15,779 --> 01:48:19,859
do it's just

2637
01:48:17,158 --> 01:48:23,698
yeah definitely like if you want to sell

2638
01:48:19,859 --> 01:48:27,118
seeds for profit unfortunately you need

2639
01:48:23,698 --> 01:48:29,638
to cross stuff that you like with the

2640
01:48:27,118 --> 01:48:32,658
hypey in demand

2641
01:48:29,639 --> 01:48:35,639
stuff like cookies and the sherbs and

2642
01:48:32,658 --> 01:48:37,799
GMO or actually I love GMO and I would

2643
01:48:35,639 --> 01:48:39,659
grow that all the time that's not one

2644
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:42,539
that's a good example of the hype but

2645
01:48:39,658 --> 01:48:44,099
you know like the look that cookies and

2646
01:48:42,539 --> 01:48:45,960
sherb and all this stuff have and it's

2647
01:48:44,100 --> 01:48:49,260
kind of what the market has come to

2648
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:51,239
expect good flour to look like and I

2649
01:48:49,260 --> 01:48:54,300
think it's pretty much all looks driven

2650
01:48:51,238 --> 01:48:57,839
you know it's like these real dense kind

2651
01:48:54,300 --> 01:49:00,000
of triangular geometric shapes that are

2652
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:01,679
super Frosty and

2653
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:03,719
um it's just the way they look that

2654
01:49:01,679 --> 01:49:05,639
people really like and so I do make

2655
01:49:03,719 --> 01:49:07,198
hybrids with that stuff because it's in

2656
01:49:05,639 --> 01:49:09,300
demand and you know you're trying to

2657
01:49:07,198 --> 01:49:12,059
sell seeds you gotta

2658
01:49:09,300 --> 01:49:14,159
make some that are in demand but what

2659
01:49:12,060 --> 01:49:15,960
I'm more passionate about is the old

2660
01:49:14,158 --> 01:49:19,500
school stuff like the headbands and the

2661
01:49:15,960 --> 01:49:21,779
sours and um skunkier stuff and if like

2662
01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:23,219
if I was just breeding for my own

2663
01:49:21,779 --> 01:49:24,599
interests I would do that all the time

2664
01:49:23,219 --> 01:49:27,420
and I wouldn't touch any of that other

2665
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:29,340
hypey stuff but you know you kind of

2666
01:49:27,420 --> 01:49:31,618
have to do both and

2667
01:49:29,340 --> 01:49:33,420
um you know like you have your passion

2668
01:49:31,618 --> 01:49:36,539
projects but you also have

2669
01:49:33,420 --> 01:49:39,600
stuff that is high demand

2670
01:49:36,539 --> 01:49:40,738
that makes sense been bringing a balance

2671
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:44,100
to the table

2672
01:49:40,738 --> 01:49:45,599
so another thing I wanted to flag if if

2673
01:49:44,100 --> 01:49:47,760
listeners haven't seen it already

2674
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:50,280
there's this like fantastic video series

2675
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:52,380
that was sort of made about mandelbrot's

2676
01:49:50,279 --> 01:49:54,840
life and a lot of the work and it kind

2677
01:49:52,380 --> 01:49:57,719
of a lot of various aspects of sort of

2678
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:59,520
his overall Legacy and work was there

2679
01:49:57,719 --> 01:50:01,560
anything in that which maybe didn't get

2680
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:03,260
touched on that you were hoping you shed

2681
01:50:01,560 --> 01:50:07,980
some light on for the public

2682
01:50:03,260 --> 01:50:10,020
oh man that's a big big question

2683
01:50:07,979 --> 01:50:15,059
um definitely there is

2684
01:50:10,020 --> 01:50:18,000
um but I don't want to go into too much

2685
01:50:15,060 --> 01:50:20,760
detail because I like I like the organic

2686
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:23,219
kind of like just starting to talk about

2687
01:50:20,760 --> 01:50:25,500
that stuff and seeing where it goes and

2688
01:50:23,219 --> 01:50:27,719
I don't I'm not really planning how the

2689
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:29,698
next videos will make will go right now

2690
01:50:27,719 --> 01:50:31,859
I kind of just like to play it by ear

2691
01:50:29,698 --> 01:50:34,678
and let people say what they want to say

2692
01:50:31,859 --> 01:50:36,420
about him or you know I don't want to I

2693
01:50:34,679 --> 01:50:39,899
don't want it to be formulaic I want it

2694
01:50:36,420 --> 01:50:42,420
to be more of like a conversation

2695
01:50:39,899 --> 01:50:44,158
oh okay cool so I guess the takeaway is

2696
01:50:42,420 --> 01:50:45,840
that there's going to be more videos

2697
01:50:44,158 --> 01:50:49,079
produced in that series and we'll find

2698
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:50,460
out even more yeah you know what we had

2699
01:50:49,079 --> 01:50:54,779
planned to do

2700
01:50:50,460 --> 01:50:58,618
uh season this year but I have too much

2701
01:50:54,779 --> 01:51:01,559
on my plate and the GW smoke break guys

2702
01:50:58,618 --> 01:51:04,380
do too you know I think the series they

2703
01:51:01,560 --> 01:51:07,020
made with us kind of created a lot of

2704
01:51:04,380 --> 01:51:09,060
demand for more of that sort of stuff

2705
01:51:07,020 --> 01:51:11,159
and so they have you know probably a

2706
01:51:09,060 --> 01:51:13,560
dozen projects they're working on this

2707
01:51:11,158 --> 01:51:15,420
year and I'm right now

2708
01:51:13,560 --> 01:51:17,159
trying to expand my business into

2709
01:51:15,420 --> 01:51:19,618
Michigan and so I'm splitting my time

2710
01:51:17,158 --> 01:51:23,460
between California and Michigan and it's

2711
01:51:19,618 --> 01:51:25,139
it's a lot you know so we're taking some

2712
01:51:23,460 --> 01:51:27,719
time off and

2713
01:51:25,139 --> 01:51:30,359
we're gonna you know kind of play it by

2714
01:51:27,719 --> 01:51:32,340
ear and see when we can get back to it

2715
01:51:30,359 --> 01:51:34,500
yeah understandable you know you're

2716
01:51:32,340 --> 01:51:36,659
juggling a lot of balls there so uh

2717
01:51:34,500 --> 01:51:38,520
kudos for that I guess the final

2718
01:51:36,658 --> 01:51:40,698
question before we jump into the final

2719
01:51:38,520 --> 01:51:43,679
quick five questions we ask everyone is

2720
01:51:40,698 --> 01:51:45,899
what's your thoughts on the way the

2721
01:51:43,679 --> 01:51:47,940
market in terms of breeding and selling

2722
01:51:45,899 --> 01:51:49,500
seeds is sort of moving and what do you

2723
01:51:47,939 --> 01:51:51,118
think Max thoughts on this would have

2724
01:51:49,500 --> 01:51:53,698
been

2725
01:51:51,118 --> 01:51:55,279
um I don't know I uh

2726
01:51:53,698 --> 01:51:58,979
it's definitely

2727
01:51:55,279 --> 01:52:02,279
moving in a Direction that's more

2728
01:51:58,979 --> 01:52:05,218
focused on in you know um more and more

2729
01:52:02,279 --> 01:52:08,460
people are buying seeds to grow indoors

2730
01:52:05,219 --> 01:52:12,118
in their their small you know personal

2731
01:52:08,460 --> 01:52:14,340
use garden and unfortunately the

2732
01:52:12,118 --> 01:52:17,698
commercial Growers that are growing at

2733
01:52:14,340 --> 01:52:20,940
scale Outdoors are having to move more

2734
01:52:17,698 --> 01:52:24,419
and more towards clone based cultivation

2735
01:52:20,939 --> 01:52:26,158
because you know like the testing

2736
01:52:24,420 --> 01:52:28,679
requirements you have to have a lot of

2737
01:52:26,158 --> 01:52:31,019
product that's all exactly the same or

2738
01:52:28,679 --> 01:52:32,520
you know you'd have to it's hard to sell

2739
01:52:31,020 --> 01:52:34,320
a bunch of small batches that are

2740
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:37,860
different that have a different

2741
01:52:34,319 --> 01:52:40,799
chemical profile and stuff so a lot more

2742
01:52:37,859 --> 01:52:42,719
over the the years it's become

2743
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:45,060
where the outdoor Growers are growing

2744
01:52:42,719 --> 01:52:47,340
from clone more and more because they

2745
01:52:45,060 --> 01:52:50,340
need that consistency in the people who

2746
01:52:47,340 --> 01:52:52,139
are buying seeds are doing it to find

2747
01:52:50,340 --> 01:52:54,480
special stuff that they want to run

2748
01:52:52,139 --> 01:52:56,880
indoors or maybe they're they're in a

2749
01:52:54,479 --> 01:52:59,039
place where there's not a legal clone

2750
01:52:56,880 --> 01:53:01,679
market and they can't just go out and

2751
01:52:59,039 --> 01:53:04,979
buy clones so they're buying seeds

2752
01:53:01,679 --> 01:53:06,539
because they can be mailed discreetly to

2753
01:53:04,979 --> 01:53:07,799
their location where maybe the

2754
01:53:06,539 --> 01:53:10,679
government's not very friendly to

2755
01:53:07,800 --> 01:53:12,659
cannabis or whatever and so the

2756
01:53:10,679 --> 01:53:15,539
landscape has changed a lot it used to

2757
01:53:12,658 --> 01:53:18,658
be that we sold a lot of seeds in bulk

2758
01:53:15,539 --> 01:53:22,500
to Farmers in our area but more and more

2759
01:53:18,658 --> 01:53:24,719
it's like people in the UK and all over

2760
01:53:22,500 --> 01:53:25,439
South America or wherever

2761
01:53:24,719 --> 01:53:28,319
um

2762
01:53:25,439 --> 01:53:31,738
that the only way that they can get

2763
01:53:28,319 --> 01:53:34,198
interesting genetics is in seed form and

2764
01:53:31,738 --> 01:53:36,539
that's why they're doing it you know

2765
01:53:34,198 --> 01:53:39,178
um so

2766
01:53:36,539 --> 01:53:41,519
I would like to continue to focus

2767
01:53:39,179 --> 01:53:44,158
reading on stuff that performs well

2768
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:46,860
outdoors and does well in my local

2769
01:53:44,158 --> 01:53:49,920
climate but the the truth is the demand

2770
01:53:46,859 --> 01:53:52,819
is not there it's in

2771
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:56,279
you know what will do well for people

2772
01:53:52,819 --> 01:53:58,198
indoors on a smaller scale and

2773
01:53:56,279 --> 01:54:00,479
so you know you have to cater to both

2774
01:53:58,198 --> 01:54:01,138
and

2775
01:54:00,479 --> 01:54:03,299
um

2776
01:54:01,139 --> 01:54:05,039
I think it's unfortunate

2777
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:07,079
that

2778
01:54:05,039 --> 01:54:09,238
the outdoor Growers who are in the

2779
01:54:07,079 --> 01:54:11,519
regulated market are not able to

2780
01:54:09,238 --> 01:54:12,899
continue to grow from seed and to you

2781
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:15,780
know because seed plants are really

2782
01:54:12,899 --> 01:54:17,899
strong outdoors and clones sometimes

2783
01:54:15,779 --> 01:54:21,359
have problems that

2784
01:54:17,899 --> 01:54:24,719
seeds wouldn't have but the way it's all

2785
01:54:21,359 --> 01:54:26,880
regulated and the new market is kind of

2786
01:54:24,719 --> 01:54:29,340
forced us all in the direction

2787
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:30,480
we just have to go along

2788
01:54:29,340 --> 01:54:32,639
um

2789
01:54:30,479 --> 01:54:33,599
I don't think that Mac would like that

2790
01:54:32,639 --> 01:54:36,359
much

2791
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:38,820
you know but it is what it is

2792
01:54:36,359 --> 01:54:41,460
sure so I mean if you could make one

2793
01:54:38,819 --> 01:54:44,099
sort of change in the current you know

2794
01:54:41,460 --> 01:54:46,139
legalities around it what would you do

2795
01:54:44,100 --> 01:54:47,940
like just to give you an example of what

2796
01:54:46,139 --> 01:54:52,079
I mean in the past we've heard a lot of

2797
01:54:47,939 --> 01:54:54,178
people sort of talk about how the one

2798
01:54:52,079 --> 01:54:56,340
acre rule that was always proposed

2799
01:54:54,179 --> 01:54:58,800
before legalization which has since sort

2800
01:54:56,340 --> 01:55:00,420
of been changed a bit they always felt

2801
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:02,579
like that would allow sort of Fair

2802
01:55:00,420 --> 01:55:04,440
competition between small and big

2803
01:55:02,579 --> 01:55:06,238
Growers what's your thoughts is there

2804
01:55:04,439 --> 01:55:08,879
any sort of glaring changes you'd like

2805
01:55:06,238 --> 01:55:11,279
to make in the laws

2806
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:12,779
well that's the perfect example I would

2807
01:55:11,279 --> 01:55:15,719
love for

2808
01:55:12,779 --> 01:55:18,000
the law to actually be what was promised

2809
01:55:15,719 --> 01:55:20,819
to the people who voted for

2810
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:23,219
uh 64 you know like it definitely said

2811
01:55:20,819 --> 01:55:25,380
right in the short paragraph description

2812
01:55:23,219 --> 01:55:26,340
that large-scale Farms wouldn't be

2813
01:55:25,380 --> 01:55:30,659
allowed

2814
01:55:26,340 --> 01:55:32,819
to operate until 2023 and even then

2815
01:55:30,658 --> 01:55:33,979
there would be a conversation about

2816
01:55:32,819 --> 01:55:37,859
whether

2817
01:55:33,979 --> 01:55:41,218
huge corporate scaled agriculture would

2818
01:55:37,859 --> 01:55:44,519
be allowed to take over you know and I

2819
01:55:41,219 --> 01:55:46,260
really don't want that to happen no I

2820
01:55:44,520 --> 01:55:48,960
don't think smokers want that to happen

2821
01:55:46,260 --> 01:55:50,699
the product's going to be worse and it's

2822
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:53,579
you know they're going to have Shady

2823
01:55:50,698 --> 01:55:55,919
business practices that choke out small

2824
01:55:53,579 --> 01:55:57,899
farmers that have been doing this their

2825
01:55:55,920 --> 01:56:00,319
whole lives and who are better at it and

2826
01:55:57,899 --> 01:56:02,519
more passionate about it

2827
01:56:00,319 --> 01:56:04,979
the way

2828
01:56:02,520 --> 01:56:07,139
like we were sold a bill of goods and it

2829
01:56:04,979 --> 01:56:09,899
was a scam all along you know it was

2830
01:56:07,139 --> 01:56:14,639
definitely plotted out that they would

2831
01:56:09,899 --> 01:56:17,939
have this loophole to you know get like

2832
01:56:14,639 --> 01:56:22,199
the previous iteration of the California

2833
01:56:17,939 --> 01:56:24,479
legalization or adult use law failed

2834
01:56:22,198 --> 01:56:25,678
because all the people in the Emerald

2835
01:56:24,479 --> 01:56:27,658
Triangle

2836
01:56:25,679 --> 01:56:30,420
showed up to vote against it because

2837
01:56:27,658 --> 01:56:32,939
they knew it was a corporate takeover so

2838
01:56:30,420 --> 01:56:36,179
on the next try they they cleverly

2839
01:56:32,939 --> 01:56:37,678
crafted this false Narrative of like oh

2840
01:56:36,179 --> 01:56:39,539
no we're gonna make sure that small

2841
01:56:37,679 --> 01:56:41,699
farmers have a seat at the table all

2842
01:56:39,539 --> 01:56:44,698
this stuff and that was [ __ ] you

2843
01:56:41,698 --> 01:56:45,479
know it was definitely a wolf in sheep's

2844
01:56:44,698 --> 01:56:49,138
clothing

2845
01:56:45,479 --> 01:56:50,638
so if we could go back and get that

2846
01:56:49,139 --> 01:56:53,579
right then

2847
01:56:50,639 --> 01:56:57,539
make you know small farmers competitive

2848
01:56:53,579 --> 01:57:00,179
and protected I would love to do that I

2849
01:56:57,539 --> 01:57:02,399
think it's unrealistic to expect it but

2850
01:57:00,179 --> 01:57:04,920
I would do it if I could

2851
01:57:02,399 --> 01:57:06,238
yeah nice that's a pretty understandable

2852
01:57:04,920 --> 01:57:09,539
change that I think a lot of people

2853
01:57:06,238 --> 01:57:11,579
could get behind so to jump in our final

2854
01:57:09,539 --> 01:57:14,279
five questions that we ask everyone who

2855
01:57:11,579 --> 01:57:17,219
comes on the show first one being what

2856
01:57:14,279 --> 01:57:20,359
is the best or most memorable single

2857
01:57:17,219 --> 01:57:22,739
smoke you can recall

2858
01:57:20,359 --> 01:57:24,839
that's tough

2859
01:57:22,738 --> 01:57:27,419
um headband for me

2860
01:57:24,840 --> 01:57:29,520
personally like the effect

2861
01:57:27,420 --> 01:57:32,880
it's something special about it like I

2862
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:37,260
can smoke headband that's like 17 THC

2863
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:39,599
and get way more ripped or way more in

2864
01:57:37,260 --> 01:57:44,400
the mode that I want to be in

2865
01:57:39,599 --> 01:57:46,139
uh from you know like 17 THC 3 total

2866
01:57:44,399 --> 01:57:49,379
terpenes

2867
01:57:46,139 --> 01:57:50,699
um which it doesn't on paper look very

2868
01:57:49,380 --> 01:57:53,520
impressive compared to a lot of the

2869
01:57:50,698 --> 01:57:55,738
stuff that's out there these days but uh

2870
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:58,020
from personal use and like the way it

2871
01:57:55,738 --> 01:57:59,638
affects me it's really perfect you know

2872
01:57:58,020 --> 01:58:02,580
and it it doesn't matter that it's not

2873
01:57:59,639 --> 01:58:05,719
that potent it still affects me the way

2874
01:58:02,579 --> 01:58:07,859
I want it to every day I could smoke it

2875
01:58:05,719 --> 01:58:09,060
exclusively and it would still get me

2876
01:58:07,859 --> 01:58:11,819
where I want to go

2877
01:58:09,060 --> 01:58:15,840
whereas you know I could go by

2878
01:58:11,819 --> 01:58:17,639
something that's 30 THC and not get that

2879
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:20,639
effect like it's

2880
01:58:17,639 --> 01:58:21,659
the numbers are not what's important on

2881
01:58:20,639 --> 01:58:23,699
paper

2882
01:58:21,658 --> 01:58:26,519
as far as what affects you the way you

2883
01:58:23,698 --> 01:58:28,738
want it to you know it's uh

2884
01:58:26,520 --> 01:58:32,280
it's more complicated than that

2885
01:58:28,738 --> 01:58:34,198
yeah certainly so I mean I guess on the

2886
01:58:32,279 --> 01:58:36,238
other end of the spectrum was there ever

2887
01:58:34,198 --> 01:58:38,339
a strain where you know everyone was

2888
01:58:36,238 --> 01:58:40,138
really hyping it up and just sort of

2889
01:58:38,340 --> 01:58:42,960
excited and then when you finally tried

2890
01:58:40,139 --> 01:58:45,060
it you were like left a bit disappointed

2891
01:58:42,960 --> 01:58:47,158
yeah for sure

2892
01:58:45,060 --> 01:58:49,139
um I feel like I'd be calling out a

2893
01:58:47,158 --> 01:58:51,359
breeder though if I were to say oh I

2894
01:58:49,139 --> 01:58:53,039
hate this one thing I don't want to do

2895
01:58:51,359 --> 01:58:56,519
that but there's definitely

2896
01:58:53,039 --> 01:59:00,118
stuff out there that um I don't think is

2897
01:58:56,520 --> 01:59:02,040
as good as the market has made it appear

2898
01:59:00,118 --> 01:59:04,559
to be you know

2899
01:59:02,039 --> 01:59:07,260
I don't want to be specific though the

2900
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:09,960
Diplomatic I can get behind that okay so

2901
01:59:07,260 --> 01:59:11,760
the next one being let's do a desert

2902
01:59:09,960 --> 01:59:13,679
island situation if you're getting

2903
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:16,079
dropped off to a desert island and you

2904
01:59:13,679 --> 01:59:17,460
can only grow three strains or you know

2905
01:59:16,079 --> 01:59:20,158
they could be clones or they could be

2906
01:59:17,460 --> 01:59:22,020
packs of seeds which three are you taken

2907
01:59:20,158 --> 01:59:26,460
with you

2908
01:59:22,020 --> 01:59:29,280
um it's a headband oil spill and GMO

2909
01:59:26,460 --> 01:59:32,099
oh nice GMO lover

2910
01:59:29,279 --> 01:59:33,719
yeah you know it's a cookie cross and I

2911
01:59:32,099 --> 01:59:35,400
have feelings about it but I like the

2912
01:59:33,719 --> 01:59:37,079
weed it's really good

2913
01:59:35,399 --> 01:59:38,519
that's good stuff that's good stuff I'm

2914
01:59:37,079 --> 01:59:40,439
sure there's a lot of our listeners out

2915
01:59:38,520 --> 01:59:43,699
there right now who are like just take

2916
01:59:40,439 --> 01:59:47,098
the KMD you can Harvest it quicker

2917
01:59:43,698 --> 01:59:50,039
no no I uh I have love for the GMO don't

2918
01:59:47,099 --> 01:59:51,840
worry so the next question is the it's

2919
01:59:50,039 --> 01:59:53,460
sort of the same situation we're

2920
01:59:51,840 --> 01:59:55,679
dropping we're doing the island

2921
01:59:53,460 --> 01:59:58,198
situation except this time rather than

2922
01:59:55,679 --> 02:00:00,179
you staying there it's someone else and

2923
01:59:58,198 --> 02:00:02,698
you don't really like them that much

2924
02:00:00,179 --> 02:00:04,500
what three strains are you gonna leave

2925
02:00:02,698 --> 02:00:05,839
them

2926
02:00:04,500 --> 02:00:08,658
um

2927
02:00:05,840 --> 02:00:10,260
Jack and train wreck

2928
02:00:08,658 --> 02:00:11,579
and

2929
02:00:10,260 --> 02:00:13,800
uh

2930
02:00:11,579 --> 02:00:16,500
green crack

2931
02:00:13,800 --> 02:00:18,179
there you go you know what's funny like

2932
02:00:16,500 --> 02:00:20,698
I totally get where you're coming from

2933
02:00:18,179 --> 02:00:23,158
with that but as someone who hasn't been

2934
02:00:20,698 --> 02:00:25,079
around in the the California region my

2935
02:00:23,158 --> 02:00:27,719
whole life I'm like not burnt out on

2936
02:00:25,079 --> 02:00:29,399
Jack so I'd probably happily take that

2937
02:00:27,719 --> 02:00:31,859
but that's that's that's a good one I

2938
02:00:29,399 --> 02:00:34,379
like that it makes me paranoid I feel

2939
02:00:31,859 --> 02:00:37,019
terrible if I smoke that stuff you know

2940
02:00:34,380 --> 02:00:39,719
like I feel like climbing out a window

2941
02:00:37,020 --> 02:00:41,219
I don't know what it is it's interesting

2942
02:00:39,719 --> 02:00:43,560
like how you get these sort of

2943
02:00:41,219 --> 02:00:46,319
geographical differences in taste like

2944
02:00:43,560 --> 02:00:48,480
as you've sort of alluded to anywhere in

2945
02:00:46,319 --> 02:00:50,219
the Mendo area you offer someone train

2946
02:00:48,479 --> 02:00:51,899
wreck they just laugh at you but I'm

2947
02:00:50,219 --> 02:00:53,939
like man give it to me like I've only

2948
02:00:51,899 --> 02:00:57,299
had it a few times but yeah there you go

2949
02:00:53,939 --> 02:00:59,158
yeah you know that's interesting the

2950
02:00:57,300 --> 02:01:02,159
yeah like you said the geographic

2951
02:00:59,158 --> 02:01:04,319
element of that okay so final question

2952
02:01:02,158 --> 02:01:06,779
for the interview if you could go back

2953
02:01:04,319 --> 02:01:09,000
to any place in time presumably to

2954
02:01:06,779 --> 02:01:10,738
collect seeds or a clone you can go

2955
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:13,380
anywhere anytime throughout history

2956
02:01:10,738 --> 02:01:15,000
where are you going when and what are

2957
02:01:13,380 --> 02:01:17,099
you grabbing

2958
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:20,340
uh

2959
02:01:17,099 --> 02:01:23,520
uh so definitely I would say the the

2960
02:01:20,340 --> 02:01:25,560
Hindu Kush mountains or you know the

2961
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:28,800
like

2962
02:01:25,560 --> 02:01:30,780
um India and Afghanistan you know the

2963
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:33,239
whole region I don't know if I could

2964
02:01:30,779 --> 02:01:36,899
pick a specific area but the high

2965
02:01:33,238 --> 02:01:38,939
mountains of Afghanistan or that general

2966
02:01:36,899 --> 02:01:43,618
area

2967
02:01:38,939 --> 02:01:45,719
um and you know like the

2968
02:01:43,618 --> 02:01:48,359
Hindu Kush

2969
02:01:45,719 --> 02:01:50,399
look as a cultivar I think is really

2970
02:01:48,359 --> 02:01:53,519
amazing and the

2971
02:01:50,399 --> 02:01:55,679
the like the wide open land race that

2972
02:01:53,520 --> 02:01:57,179
that comes from I would love to really

2973
02:01:55,679 --> 02:01:59,940
hunt through that

2974
02:01:57,179 --> 02:02:02,158
yeah that's a that's a popular choice I

2975
02:01:59,939 --> 02:02:05,399
think some of those old Hindu Afghani

2976
02:02:02,158 --> 02:02:07,738
sort of genetics are certainly Fable so

2977
02:02:05,399 --> 02:02:09,059
I think that pretty much brings us to

2978
02:02:07,738 --> 02:02:10,678
the end of things were there any

2979
02:02:09,060 --> 02:02:12,360
comments or shout outs you wanted to

2980
02:02:10,679 --> 02:02:15,899
make before we wrap up

2981
02:02:12,359 --> 02:02:18,118
uh no I think uh I'd just like to say I
