jeremy for coming on the show again and

44
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:38,560
for spending the time with us

45
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,799
yeah thanks for having me on it's

46
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,960
exciting to coordinate this from

47
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:47,840
across the ocean as always so

48
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:51,118
same question as what we did last time

49
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:54,159
what are you smoking on at the moment

50
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,599
right now i harvested most recently some

51
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,320
angel bat cross from

52
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:59,359
boneyard and i think it was his bat

53
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,199
cross two

54
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:02,560
so i think he outcrossed it with blue

55
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,040
cheese

56
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,399
and a boneyard his mail is basically the

57
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,200
same for everything that he works with

58
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:12,080
and it's named after his father

59
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,359
and uh i'm not sure the exact lineage

60
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,879
off the top of my head i'd have to look

61
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,599
it up

62
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:18,719
but i like a lot of his crosses and at

63
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:20,959
the same time

64
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,639
i also grew some northern lights five

65
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,759
haze

66
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:27,439
crosses and they were interesting

67
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:28,959
um the seeds were really old i popped

68
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,878
them it really just kind of has an

69
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,598
earthy odor nothing to get excited about

70
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:35,359
but it does pack a pretty good punch

71
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:37,839
and so that's those are the two that i

72
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,680
have right now

73
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,439
and i mean overall would you describe

74
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,319
yourself as more of like a sativa type

75
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:48,400
of person or a more indica head

76
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:50,639
i like it all um i'd say that

77
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,680
at this point i'm more attracted to

78
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:53,759
something different

79
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,360
unique odors unique flavors something i

80
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,919
haven't had before

81
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,959
and um i like to have a little bit of

82
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:00,719
everything in my house

83
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,959
based on the time of day whether it's

84
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:05,120
morning whether i got to work whether

85
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,400
i'm trying to sleep and so one of the

86
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,039
benefits of

87
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,519
having a small home grow is you can grow

88
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,158
as many

89
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,680
different flavors as you want and yield

90
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,799
doesn't necessarily have to be at the

91
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,800
forefront

92
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,040
and so i have kind of a bad seed habit

93
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,360
and uh for my birthday a couple days ago

94
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:21,598
i

95
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,519
popped some new seeds and got a few

96
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:24,798
different things in the greenhouse

97
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,640
and they're all over the place i found

98
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,760
that i don't really lean towards sativa

99
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:31,359
or indica one way or the other

100
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,199
okay and just as a little personal

101
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,959
question do you keep clones at all

102
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:35,280
because i noticed you do really tend to

103
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,719
run

104
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,239
different things every time so do you

105
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:38,799
just kind of like enjoy it and let it

106
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,158
move on

107
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,480
or do you keep stuff around uh there's

108
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:44,318
been

109
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:46,560
times where i've kept them around for

110
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:48,639
periods of time and now it seems like

111
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,158
with family and everything that i've got

112
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,158
going in my life it's a lot easier to

113
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:53,280
just pop seeds when i want them

114
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:55,519
and one of the things that i started

115
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,519
doing um when i keep clones

116
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,438
i have this feeling that it's taken away

117
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,200
from me going through a lot of the seeds

118
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:02,639
that i'd like to go through

119
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,079
and so i've always tell myself telling

120
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:05,119
myself you know one day i'm gonna settle

121
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,799
down and just get this

122
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,799
one clone this one girl and i'm just

123
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,080
gonna grow her the whole time

124
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,000
and then i can actually do some

125
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,480
comparative um

126
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,519
testing versus different runs different

127
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:16,639
lights and so

128
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,478
we're going to do that but i think

129
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,239
that's going to become more of the build

130
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,039
the soil test grow and then i'm going to

131
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:25,120
always have my

132
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,560
personal seed runs and from there

133
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,399
if i find something i really like in the

134
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,399
pack then i'll go by more

135
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:31,679
run them and then keep a clone around

136
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:33,039
another way to keep a clone that i've

137
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,040
found is to give it to a few different

138
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,560
buddies and if you ever want it back

139
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,639
and they're the types that you know are

140
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,918
really good they do a good job and we'll

141
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,918
keep them

142
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:43,039
it's a great way to expand your library

143
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:46,560
without having

144
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,280
so many in your house and just as maybe

145
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,199
like

146
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,638
a little bit of a finicky question do

147
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,280
you go to the effort of like

148
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,960
researching the breeders and seeing you

149
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:55,519
know does this one breed their stuff in

150
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:58,879
soil

151
00:04:55,519 --> 00:05:01,519
yes or no uh

152
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:01,918
i i would say yes i do i do do that it's

153
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:03,599
not

154
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:05,918
really the first and foremost thing but

155
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,960
the epidemic quality that i believe is

156
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:08,959
there

157
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:10,399
for instance with vegetable seeds at our

158
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:12,159
build a soil shop

159
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:13,599
we carry locally produced seed from a

160
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,039
similar altitude

161
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,720
and i feel like that's going to be best

162
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:20,159
for the local gardeners here

163
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,199
and similarly if you have a gardener

164
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,880
that's going to be growing or

165
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,560
cultivating in a certain style i think

166
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:27,839
that might be the best way to go

167
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,160
so yeah okay sweet

168
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:31,519
so i guess in general in this episode i

169
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,840
was kind of thinking we could

170
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,599
maybe hit a few more advanced ideas than

171
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:36,959
we did last time because i think

172
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,520
last episode we did a good job of

173
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:41,680
hitting most of the basics

174
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:42,560
so the first thing i wanted to touch on

175
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,120
because there's just

176
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,160
a lot of i guess kind of interest in it

177
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,918
in australia

178
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,280
mammoth p you know it's one of those

179
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:50,560
products where it's

180
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:52,478
definitely appears to be one of those

181
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,360
more high-end ones from what i've seen

182
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:56,000
it uh it tends to promote like different

183
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,919
uh

184
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,079
growth styles from plants like i've seen

185
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:02,799
plants where when it's used on it it

186
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:05,279
promotes like really hard foxtailing

187
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,000
um and for some people that's maybe a

188
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:08,478
bit of a cause for

189
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,160
concern i also know other organic gurus

190
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:12,000
so to speak who say they won't touch it

191
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,199
and they don't consider it to be organic

192
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,319
what's your opinion on it you know do

193
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,160
you think it's a bit getting into the

194
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,000
semantics or do you feel it's a product

195
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,120
worth getting it seems to be quite cost

196
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,720
prohibitive if nothing else

197
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,959
these products are really interesting

198
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,440
and they they play on a few different

199
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:28,478
things

200
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:30,000
which i feel from a business background

201
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:32,560
and from a marketing perspective

202
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,560
are sure to be successful in sales i

203
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,879
think that time is going to predict if

204
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,199
it's going to be sure to be successful

205
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:40,319
uh in results and i know that people are

206
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,120
using mammoth p

207
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,400
and that they're experiencing a plethora

208
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,759
of different results

209
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:48,478
i think that there's more to be learned

210
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,240
about this stuff and so um depending on

211
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:51,519
the soil recipe if we have a really high

212
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,439
phosphorous mix

213
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:55,198
it may release an undesirably large

214
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:58,079
amount of stuff

215
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,478
and so um depending on the soil recipe

216
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:01,439
that's

217
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:02,560
that's something interesting to consider

218
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:03,519
and then when we're looking at

219
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,879
phosphorus

220
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:06,639
uh when we started looking at some of

221
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:07,918
these products one of the things

222
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,759
that was interesting to me is like where

223
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:12,318
you're at for instance um

224
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,919
phosphorus is a problem and so the

225
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,479
hydroponic nutrients are actually

226
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:16,240
different

227
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:18,000
than the products that are sold here

228
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,000
based on the phosphorus being

229
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,360
a prohibiting factor is that correct

230
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,598
that's it

231
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,720
okay and so it becomes something that

232
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:26,560
obviously

233
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,000
we want to be open to and have an open

234
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,160
mind for

235
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,680
and so now um as we're going to see more

236
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,599
products come on the market

237
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,598
i think that most importantly i would

238
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:37,279
like to base it on results but

239
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:39,199
just in thinking about it it makes sense

240
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:42,719
from an agricultural perspective that

241
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,960
phosphorus mobilization is one of the

242
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,000
lag binds that the synthetic nutrients

243
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:48,560
are able to

244
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,478
you know contend with and for the first

245
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,598
time looking at acreage grows and doing

246
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:53,598
soil testing

247
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:55,680
when you're confronted with having to

248
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:57,279
raise the phosphorus levels

249
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,519
and you need to do it in a short period

250
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:00,159
of time without using animal husbandry

251
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,120
cover crop

252
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,720
and long long term approaches um it

253
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,720
becomes pretty clear that

254
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,840
it would be advantageous to have an

255
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:13,440
organic way to either release phosphorus

256
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:14,959
or add phosphorus cost effectively and

257
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:17,199
i don't necessarily mean just to feed

258
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:19,120
the plant but maybe to balance the soil

259
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,199
so that we're operating with a balance

260
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,720
of potassium and phosphorus or whatever

261
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,478
is desirable to the particular

262
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,160
agronomist

263
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:27,839
and so i'm like okay it makes a lot of

264
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,199
sense you release phosphorus from

265
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:30,638
um these microbes and there's white

266
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,320
papers that actually study it and go

267
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,799
over it prove it

268
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,680
the cost side is very interesting to me

269
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,439
and so

270
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,639
mammoth p i haven't run all the numbers

271
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,320
on it but that's one of the complaints

272
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:41,439
that we hear

273
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,360
i know that there's been some

274
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,080
discussions about the type of microbes

275
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,959
that may

276
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,800
not be present and being dangerous or

277
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:50,079
being non-existent and it may be just a

278
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:51,199
hormone

279
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,360
but everyone knows there's a lot of

280
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,080
conversation about it and so to add to

281
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,320
that

282
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,600
recently we carry some products under

283
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,160
the brand root wise

284
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,159
it's actually a friend of mine legendary

285
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:05,600
uh grower and farmer

286
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:05,919
and he's been using biology for a long

287
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,240
time

288
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:10,159
and he brought a product called biofoss

289
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,240
just released last week

290
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:14,319
and or i should say he did and we got

291
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,080
our first order of it in

292
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,440
and that's what we're going to be going

293
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,320
with as opposed to something like

294
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,839
mammoth p

295
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,760
and the reason is we want something to

296
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,240
be more of a complete soil support

297
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:24,559
system

298
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,919
instead of so singular and this one is a

299
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:29,599
mixture of different

300
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:32,000
um microorganisms that will help

301
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,440
liberate phosphorus but when you start

302
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,839
reading up on what's in the package

303
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,959
you'll notice that a lot of them are

304
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,560
just for instance one of the largest

305
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,159
ones in there is i believe mega terum

306
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,000
and that one is one of the largest rod

307
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:42,559
ship bacteria and it's just an enzyme

308
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,080
producer

309
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:46,399
and it feeds to the phosphorus

310
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,240
mobilizers that are in that

311
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,080
and so i'm gonna have to do some

312
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,680
side-by-side tests i'm going to have to

313
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,440
you know really wrap my head around this

314
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:55,120
but the writing's on the wall that the

315
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,839
industry is moving towards

316
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,320
phosphorus solubilizing instead of heavy

317
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,800
phosphorus applications

318
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,920
which makes a lot of sense and the other

319
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:05,919
thing that we're looking at right

320
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:07,439
now um if you want to try and play with

321
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:09,278
this on your own

322
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,640
and i think over the next year i'll

323
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:12,559
probably have a product

324
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:13,838
um should i love to send you guys some

325
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:15,359
stuff all the way up there i'll see if

326
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,760
we can make it work

327
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,800
oh yeah amino acids are really

328
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:21,759
interesting and we've got

329
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:22,078
a freeze-dried fish amino acid under the

330
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:25,519
name

331
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:27,599
thrive dot n thrivin

332
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,919
and one of the things the manufacturer's

333
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,920
been discussing with me is how they've

334
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:33,278
noticed that when they use it with a

335
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:35,919
mineral calcium like

336
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:37,600
kalphos and it's micronized and they use

337
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:38,639
the two together the amino acids

338
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,639
actually chelate it

339
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:42,078
and release a much higher percentage of

340
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:44,639
the phosphorus to be available

341
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:45,838
than would be without it and so i feel

342
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:47,278
like we're on the cusp of a few

343
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,640
different things for phosphorus to be

344
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:49,200
coming around the corner and organic

345
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:51,360
gardening

346
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,519
at least that's what i feel like in the

347
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,839
discussions i'm having right now

348
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,639
um but one of the things that's nice is

349
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,760
if you have

350
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:01,759
typical no-till practices where you have

351
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,799
earthworms and you have a mulch layer

352
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,360
and you have

353
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:06,399
products that have phosphorus in them

354
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,320
even in low amounts

355
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,919
and you're utilizing these processes

356
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,440
especially with compost which is usually

357
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,599
rich in phosphorus

358
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,440
i don't feel like it's something that is

359
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,839
imperative that we all reach out to

360
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,519
um as far as a must-have especially when

361
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,399
you mention the cops prohibitive side of

362
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,879
it but

363
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,839
um i think that anybody who is doing

364
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:25,278
this at

365
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,200
as a hobby or anybody who's really

366
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:29,120
serious about it is going to be

367
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,640
wanting to try these things and see

368
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,720
personally if they make a difference

369
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:34,639
um what has your experience been i've

370
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,959
never used mammoth key before

371
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:38,799
well i actually haven't used it myself

372
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,759
but i've used a similar product which

373
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:41,519
uses

374
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:43,759
what they described as a phosphorus

375
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,000
liberator in conjunction with a

376
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:48,000
phosphorus solubilizer so i guess

377
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,480
they're so it's two microbes they said

378
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,240
it's uh

379
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:56,000
azeobacter and bacillus subtilis

380
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,519
so it seemed like uh

381
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,200
i actually got a little bit of that fox

382
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,720
tailing as well and it was from

383
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,240
something where i'd never observed fox

384
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,720
telling before so i was just wondering

385
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,799
if

386
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,480
maybe i was like had expected to see

387
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:08,399
that in a way you know what i mean like

388
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,399
confirm it like a false confirmation

389
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,639
type thing but yeah

390
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,919
what was interesting was it it struck

391
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,159
this idea in my mind of

392
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:17,519
maybe the idea isn't just to use some

393
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:20,639
really exotic

394
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,399
you know testosterone eye type bacteria

395
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,120
which is in mammoth p but instead to

396
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,720
just use

397
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,639
maybe some more common ones like

398
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,240
azerbachter and subtilis

399
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,079
and just have you know like a more

400
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,560
symbiotic relationship between the

401
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:35,679
microbes in your pot

402
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:36,239
yeah and it's um i think that where we

403
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:38,399
lack

404
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,399
knowledge a lot of times we make up in

405
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,320
diversity and we notice nature does that

406
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,078
and so if we're able to find

407
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,639
a group or consortium of different

408
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:48,399
phosphorous solubilizers that work

409
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,680
like in the root wise product or the one

410
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,600
that you found over there

411
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:53,919
or something a little more singular like

412
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,920
the mammoth p

413
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:57,759
i think that right now the hard part is

414
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:00,078
all these products have

415
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:02,159
either full transparency or no

416
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:03,838
transparency and a lot of times it's

417
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:06,240
based on the labeling loopholes

418
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,760
of labeling problems with the lack of

419
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,959
knowledge of these products and how they

420
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:11,278
may affect the

421
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:13,039
environment um and how they may affect

422
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:14,399
the consumer based on agricultural

423
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:16,000
policies which affect you know

424
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,759
multi-million dollar multi-billion

425
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,120
dollar crops depending on

426
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:21,360
you know which state or which country

427
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,078
they're coming into and so

428
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,399
um like you mentioned i don't think we

429
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:26,078
know

430
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,440
and i think that there's a lot of people

431
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:28,799
have done a lot of research and they're

432
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,160
able to narrow it down using the

433
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:31,599
scientific method

434
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:34,399
finding out which ones are best for

435
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,720
phosphorus create phosphates or whatever

436
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,240
is most important there but i feel like

437
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,560
it's just the very beginning

438
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,919
there's only a few products out there's

439
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:45,359
um

440
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:48,000
there's yet to be a dramatic shift

441
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,039
um you know everybody's using silica or

442
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,198
everybody

443
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:53,360
uh uses certain key products that we

444
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:55,838
always talk about but i don't think

445
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,039
uh so far it's really penetrated 100

446
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,040
across the board

447
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:00,159
and so as the new products come out

448
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:02,799
we'll be talking about them

449
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:04,799
and we'll see um as we do some some

450
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:06,479
build a soil test grows

451
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,319
uh maybe we'll do a side-by-side with

452
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,759
and without a phosphorus additive and

453
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,800
see if there's any differences using the

454
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:12,559
same cut

455
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:13,759
and as we get a little bit uh more

456
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:15,198
comfortable around here i'm thinking we

457
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,919
can send that into the lab and

458
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:19,439
you know get some analysis that way but

459
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:22,799
um

460
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,399
as far as actual you know recommendation

461
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:26,559
right now i think i would recommend

462
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,839
you just trying it and not believing any

463
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:30,239
of the marketing

464
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,959
claims unless you try it for yourself

465
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,039
and

466
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,719
also make sure that you're not wasting a

467
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:38,240
whole bunch of money on something that

468
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,920
has no benefit by doing that trial

469
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,320
yeah so the last little question on

470
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:44,078
phosphorus it's actually a bit of a

471
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,120
tricky one to find down under

472
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:48,399
because bone meal is almost non-existent

473
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,159
surprisingly

474
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,679
so what would you recommend as a good

475
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:54,639
organic source of phosphorus

476
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:55,439
for on scale because i've looked into

477
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,919
brands

478
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,120
that you know like wheat bran rice bran

479
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:01,039
seems like it might be a

480
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,799
viable option given it you know like in

481
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:04,399
terms of its overall profile it seems to

482
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:06,719
be phosphorus heavy but

483
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,159
still nothing abundant outside of like

484
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,959
guano which a lot of people want to

485
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:13,679
avoid nowadays

486
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:15,359
um do you have any minerals that are

487
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:17,120
rich in phosphorus probably not in that

488
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,800
area right that you could use

489
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,159
yeah i mean there's soft rock phosphate

490
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:21,519
i don't know if you consider that heavy

491
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,319
and phosphorous but um

492
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,078
that's certainly a vacuum i would

493
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,000
consider feeding that through a warm bin

494
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:28,879
as a more specific type of feed to

495
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,639
direct the

496
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:32,799
amount available phosphorus in the end

497
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,399
product and then you could use that

498
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:35,039
which has been chelated through the

499
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,919
process

500
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:38,480
of enzyme and breakdown of the of the

501
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:40,639
food web

502
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,079
in the worm bin and so then you'd have

503
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,320
something that was

504
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:45,599
instead of you know just a mineral

505
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,959
phosphorus that may not be so

506
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,480
bio-available you now have something

507
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:51,039
that is more

508
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,480
more nutritionally available and so that

509
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,919
might be a possibility

510
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,800
other things to consider would be look

511
00:15:53,919 --> 00:16:00,000
up material that you could farm

512
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:02,799
on scale depending on the environment

513
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,480
that produce phosphorus so pumpkin seeds

514
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:08,159
i know cucumber

515
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,920
skin has a large amount of phosphorus

516
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:12,958
and so if there was something that you

517
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:14,958
could cultivate as opposed to mine

518
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:17,119
and that could be cultivated in a method

519
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:19,919
that wasn't you know super expensive and

520
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,440
it was a big biomass producer or maybe

521
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:25,278
it was a waste product

522
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:27,199
um that might be a possibility

523
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:28,799
and so imagine if you had like a pumpkin

524
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:32,240
seed phosphorus extract

525
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:34,240
that was put together with some sort of

526
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,639
product that actually worked

527
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,839
and so those are the things that that i

528
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,600
would think about the other thing

529
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,959
that i look at is most the compost test

530
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,920
results that we look at have a lot of

531
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,838
phosphorus

532
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:46,078
and a lot of potassium depending on the

533
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,920
source and so have you looked at local

534
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:51,838
compost is there any availability of

535
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:51,838
decent compost can you look at any tests

536
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,600
yeah i think honestly we're in the

537
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,880
beginning stages of that i think a few

538
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,959
of the soil companies are starting to

539
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:00,799
get tests done which is cool but

540
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:03,198
at the moment it seems like diy is

541
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:05,678
always going to be the best quality

542
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:07,279
okay yeah that makes sense to me um i

543
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,120
would probably be top dressing any

544
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:10,798
material that would have phosphorus in

545
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,000
it quick google search would turn up a

546
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:14,318
number of them

547
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,838
um and then the idea of working things

548
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:17,038
through a warm bend especially when you

549
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:20,798
don't have as much available

550
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:22,400
is one of them it makes it more

551
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:24,558
effective as far as it's used to the

552
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,120
plant but it also has the ability to

553
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:28,000
mitigate

554
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:30,000
a lot of potential problems worms can

555
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,759
alleviate some of the toxic properties

556
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,079
that may come with some of the

557
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:35,759
mined materials or some of the lower

558
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:37,439
quality compost

559
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:39,679
and so if anyone's in an area where all

560
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,080
they have is a compost that they may not

561
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:45,280
be a big fan of or it's just not as

562
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:46,720
potent or attractive or maybe it's

563
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:47,839
just not as good as they think it should

564
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,600
be you can always run that through a

565
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:50,240
warm bin and make your own superior

566
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:52,558
material

567
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,599
starting with that uh you know lower

568
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:56,319
quality uh

569
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:57,519
starting material and so just as a

570
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:59,839
little follow-up question

571
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:02,160
how long do you think you should ideally

572
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:02,959
leave stuff to mature in a compost bin

573
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,360
for because i

574
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,960
it almost feels like it's becoming a bit

575
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:09,199
of a wanking contest where people are

576
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,798
like oh my one year matured worm

577
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,679
castings it's like i thought three years

578
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,679
was pretty out of

579
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,440
sorry three years i thought three months

580
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,960
was fairly adequate but um

581
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,720
it almost seems like it's just creeping

582
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,440
up and up as a way of trying to make

583
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,960
yours seem better

584
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,038
yeah i think that's always the same in

585
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,640
any industry there's always going to be

586
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:28,240
a competitive spirit to it

587
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,120
and there's going to be people that want

588
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,558
to show off and that's fine

589
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:34,479
but at the end of the day it also

590
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:35,599
depends on your starting inputs and so

591
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,200
if you have

592
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:38,719
if you're trying to make compost from

593
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,319
woody material and things that are

594
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,200
higher lignin and take a long time to

595
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,558
break down

596
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,279
you're going to have to take a longer

597
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:46,798
time to make that compost and

598
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:48,319
if you're doing thermal compost that

599
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:49,918
you're turning and it's the proper

600
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:51,439
carbon the nitrogen ratio

601
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,360
in a few weeks you have something that's

602
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,558
closer to finish than most would expect

603
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:56,959
and then um from there either finish it

604
00:18:56,558 --> 00:18:59,519
through

605
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,640
worms or let it finish on its own and it

606
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:02,160
shouldn't take very long

607
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,440
um three to four months you can have a

608
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,400
good finished product if you get really

609
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,080
good at it

610
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,080
i prefer to buy compost it takes a

611
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:09,759
couple of years to make and is on larger

612
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:10,000
scale and one of the only reasons i

613
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:12,000
think

614
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,119
that is that it seems to be more stable

615
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,200
for batch to batch

616
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:17,199
and a little more homogeneous because it

617
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,960
takes so long and it seems to settle in

618
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,400
at like around 6.4 ph

619
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,759
where the stuff that is made a little

620
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,559
bit faster with manures or with grasses

621
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:26,319
or

622
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:27,918
whatever makes that carbon and nitrogen

623
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:29,200
ratio it seems that a lot of times

624
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,759
they're a little bit more volatile they

625
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,679
have a wider carbon than nitrogen ratio

626
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:35,359
they have a little bit more salts a

627
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,038
little bit more potency and so

628
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:39,279
using them at a high high percentage and

629
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:40,960
is hard

630
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:43,038
and at home for instance if you're

631
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,600
making vermicompost from newspaper

632
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:47,119
recycling and you know waste mail it's

633
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:48,558
going to be nutritionally very different

634
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,879
from something like feeding it

635
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:52,879
high phosphorus amendments and composts

636
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,000
and coffee grounds and

637
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,360
stuff that's really rich and so um

638
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,519
it's just important to consider all that

639
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:02,240
stuff

640
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:03,839
and so i wanted to bring up this

641
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,359
overarching idea i should have probably

642
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:07,199
done it earlier on but

643
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:08,639
there's been you know that forever

644
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,558
there's been arguments over the

645
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,159
semantics of organic amendments and last

646
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:13,918
episode we referenced how

647
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,000
some people don't consider gypsum or

648
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,840
pumice to technically be organic

649
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,798
and so what i've been thinking of is

650
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:20,319
i've been thinking about this a long

651
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:23,038
time and what i basically think is

652
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:23,918
should the topic instead of being is it

653
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:26,319
organic or not

654
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,120
should we not instead maybe rephrase it

655
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:29,599
to be

656
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:31,439
is it harmful to the microlife because

657
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:33,119
is that not really the real

658
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,200
factor like if something's not going to

659
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:36,719
be detrimental to the microbes

660
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,319
does it really matter if it's organic or

661
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,600
not

662
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:41,038
um i think that's a really good way to

663
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:41,839
look at it and i think the other side of

664
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:43,919
that is

665
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:45,439
the process of how it's extracted the

666
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,559
process of how it's mined

667
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,240
the availability of the materials and so

668
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:52,399
sometimes you might find something that

669
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,558
wouldn't be quote unquote organic

670
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,840
from maybe a chemistry perspective where

671
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:58,960
we're trying to find carbon

672
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:00,558
in it but gypsum is certainly organic as

673
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,600
far as approved for organic production

674
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:03,359
as far as

675
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:05,678
you know uh minerals are something that

676
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:08,158
plants grow in as well as soil

677
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,759
and so it's interesting how convoluted

678
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,720
that that conversation gets and i'm

679
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:12,558
right there with you

680
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,400
the problem the problem is as soon as

681
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:15,599
you open up a policy that says

682
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,798
let's just look if it's good for the

683
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:20,319
microbe life um

684
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:21,918
we could potentially open ourselves up

685
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:23,038
to using materials that may have some

686
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,280
more negative effects

687
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:26,558
and so i guess what i mean by that is

688
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:29,519
even in organics

689
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:30,000
um i you know is it is it good for the

690
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:31,599
microbe

691
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,759
life is it good for the environment is

692
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:34,480
it good for us in particular our local

693
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,720
area

694
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,000
does it make financial sense i think

695
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,919
that you have to pass it through a

696
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,599
number of different tests

697
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,919
particular to either the farm or the

698
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:45,279
grower and we're working on scale it

699
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,799
becomes a lot more important because we

700
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:49,918
don't have like luxury but

701
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:53,200
luxury budgets for uh wasteful

702
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:55,600
products that we may not need and so

703
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,360
um it gets real you know when you look

704
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:58,879
at it at an acre

705
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:00,639
and you may have said no i'm not going

706
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,880
to use any chicken manure but you notice

707
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,960
that there's a local product that has

708
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,400
phosphorus and it's chicken manure and

709
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,240
you can use it

710
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,400
now it becomes okay well that's good

711
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,759
it's local it's a waste product

712
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,519
should you visit the farm and see if the

713
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:14,960
chickens are treated good or is it

714
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:15,679
already a waste and you need to purchase

715
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,120
it so

716
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,360
you have to draw the line in the sand to

717
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:22,319
determine how important it is for you

718
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:24,158
to be supporting businesses supporting

719
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:26,079
processes that you would support if you

720
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,440
knew all the details of

721
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:29,439
but that's that line's going to be

722
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,240
different for everybody and so at the

723
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,798
base level

724
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,159
of course if you have no-till soil the

725
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:37,200
last thing you want to do is in

726
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:39,280
in introduce something that would

727
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,798
waste your investment in the long-term

728
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:42,158
use of your soil

729
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:45,279
and so right away it becomes a

730
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:47,520
difference of okay do i want to use

731
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:48,879
all these fast release nutrients or do i

732
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:50,000
actually want to have a balanced soil

733
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,120
that's going to work for me in the long

734
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,119
term

735
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:54,719
and we found different ways to use

736
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:56,239
different products that help kind of cut

737
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,480
corners if that makes sense

738
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,000
in living soil like when you're sexing

739
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,079
seedlings in smaller containers you can

740
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,679
get away with a few things

741
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:07,279
but for your main soil for the long term

742
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,200
i think it is more than just the microbe

743
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:10,720
life so

744
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,120
but but it's not as simple as just

745
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,120
organic

746
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,960
yeah sorry does that make any sense it's

747
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,519
just it gets convoluted no matter how we

748
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,400
do that

749
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:21,759
um yeah i think in the basis it just

750
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,000
doesn't matter if it's organic or not in

751
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:25,279
my

752
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,279
opinion it matters especially if uh you

753
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:29,038
can support the entire idea behind the

754
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:30,399
product the producer of the product if

755
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:31,839
it's good for your soil if it's good for

756
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,519
your local environment

757
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:35,279
but if you're shipping it for instance

758
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:36,879
uh like right right now we support

759
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:38,879
the use of the even karanja seat and

760
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,640
we'll talk a little more about that but

761
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,480
well one of the reasons why is we've

762
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,480
been working with a company

763
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,599
behind the scenes and we're going to be

764
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,720
locking down

765
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:50,879
a contract on a

766
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,000
locally stateside produce product that i

767
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,278
think is going to be really good for the

768
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,400
environment and really good for the

769
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:57,200
growers

770
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,159
and so right now though is importing

771
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,240
something all the way from

772
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,840
india worth it if there's something in

773
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,599
my backyard that i could use

774
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:06,079
um i don't know that's an individual

775
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:08,158
question

776
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:09,359
that's what you're doing i guess i was

777
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,960
about to say don't worry we're going to

778
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:13,359
get to neem gate

779
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,200
so i guess what you're getting at is the

780
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:16,158
devil really is in the details isn't it

781
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,120
and so

782
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,919
to to highlight an example this is one i

783
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:22,959
always hit you know

784
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,640
sub cool super soil this is uh

785
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,480
a product which has epsom salt in it

786
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,919
well he advocates if you follow the

787
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,079
recipe correctly it will

788
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,600
do you feel epsom salt is like a majorly

789
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:33,439
detrimental thing to the soil and more

790
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:36,079
importantly do you think it would

791
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,720
turn a product sorry would a product no

792
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:39,038
longer be

793
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,798
organic if it has a bit of epsom salt in

794
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:42,319
it in your opinion

795
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:44,480
no not at all i think it's perfectly

796
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:45,759
fine to use it um i think that the

797
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,558
question more becomes

798
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:50,158
why would i be using it and is there a

799
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:53,519
purpose and in my garden i've

800
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:55,200
never found a purpose to consciously

801
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:56,798
putting it as far as a soil mix

802
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,480
um and the reason why is we use soil

803
00:24:56,798 --> 00:24:59,359
testing and when we get a balance back

804
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,720
it looks like

805
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:03,119
for the most part we're very good in

806
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,720
magnesium now there's been cases

807
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:06,319
where we'll work with farms whether it's

808
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,400
in potting soil or native soil where it

809
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:10,158
comes back and it's low in magnesium

810
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,000
so the next question is where are we on

811
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,440
sulfur are we already high are we low

812
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,880
if we're low on sulfur we're low in

813
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,159
magnesium uh using magnesium sulfate or

814
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,240
epsom salt is

815
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,840
perfectly fine for organic production

816
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,079
and should be used accordingly

817
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:25,199
um i've never seen any detriment to the

818
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:27,439
soil i've never seen

819
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,519
any any reason other than the fact that

820
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,080
the word salt is in the name not to use

821
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:31,759
it

822
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:33,678
and if you look at comparatively the

823
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:35,038
fact that gypsum is widely used it's in

824
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,759
our soil recipe

825
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:39,519
and i love it it's calcium sulfate from

826
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:42,079
a chemicals perspective magnesium

827
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:44,158
sulfate if those were just the two names

828
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:45,199
it'd be hard to say one is good and one

829
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,880
is bad

830
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,480
but because i think the word is epsom

831
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,240
salt if we think of something we buy at

832
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,759
the drug store with the drug label on it

833
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,640
for soaking our feed in

834
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:55,119
all of a sudden it becomes a convoluted

835
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,480
topic

836
00:25:55,119 --> 00:26:00,719
but it's not salt it's not sodium and

837
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,519
even sodium is required in the soil

838
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,798
depending on

839
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:07,599
um you know what the soil test says so

840
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:08,240
everything has its purpose on this

841
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,719
planet

842
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,359
and i think that uh for better or worse

843
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,278
the whole

844
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:18,000
organic i'm better than you thing has

845
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:20,079
uh confused the topic of ingredients a

846
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,480
lot

847
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:24,558
so you referenced earlier amino acids

848
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,919
this is another kind of trending topic

849
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:28,319
at the moment

850
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,320
what is your go-to for amino acids i

851
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:32,000
think and even more so than that

852
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:34,319
i think underlying these a lot of people

853
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
don't understand what they're doing

854
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:37,359
you know i think if you've done a bit of

855
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,159
research into it you

856
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:42,479
maybe understand that not all nitrogen

857
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,400
is amino acids

858
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,240
and amino acids are generally more

859
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,919
valuable than just nitrogen

860
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,038
but you know do you want to expand on

861
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,038
that a little for us and more

862
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:53,038
importantly what are your go-to sources

863
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:56,000
for them

864
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:56,319
absolutely now with all of this stuff i

865
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,599
am

866
00:26:56,319 --> 00:27:01,278
just somebody who likes to do research

867
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:02,879
someone who is passionate about this

868
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:03,599
stuff and i encourage you to do your own

869
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,679
research

870
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:07,199
most the time when i'm conversing online

871
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:09,840
and we're typing i'm

872
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,080
pasting references in i'm doing a little

873
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:13,599
bit of research before i open my mouth

874
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:14,798
and so as we go through this just take

875
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:16,719
it with a grain of salt i'm not a

876
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:17,679
scientist or an agronomist and amino

877
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,798
acids

878
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:22,240
from what i understand have um

879
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:23,519
always been important but they're at the

880
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,000
forefront because we're finding better

881
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:28,000
ways to produce

882
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,038
to produce them and from organics it is

883
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,640
one of those

884
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:32,480
key boosters that you can apply either

885
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,000
foliarly or through the solar

886
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,240
through the soil and what we found is

887
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,319
they're building blocks and so

888
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,880
when you look at nitrogen and if you

889
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:43,519
were to think of it as

890
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,679
an organic material like alfalfa and the

891
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:48,558
nitrogen that therein has a really long

892
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,840
chain and if you were to break it down

893
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:51,918
they would be

894
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:53,359
kind of a polypeptide chain they'd call

895
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,278
it and then from there those

896
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:55,678
polypeptides broken down would contain

897
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:57,359
the

898
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,759
individual links of the chain the the

899
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:02,158
amino acids and so the amino acids are

900
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:05,200
the building blocks of the nitrogen

901
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,520
and so i think that if we take a step

902
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,960
back

903
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:08,798
and we look at organics and we're

904
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:12,319
talking about

905
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:15,759
how to use

906
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:19,439
our knowledge and use biomimicry to

907
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:19,440
the highest level to say okay

908
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:25,519
how can we boost this process without

909
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,880
taking over

910
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:31,200
how can we complement and better be

911
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,640
soil and plant you know apply better

912
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,038
plant husbandry

913
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,320
um without you know being in a position

914
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:37,119
where now it's all synthetic and we're

915
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:40,079
in control

916
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:42,079
and then the key things that we see are

917
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:44,558
fulvic acids

918
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:45,519
amino acids and a lot of it revolves

919
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:47,359
around

920
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:49,278
lowering the energy required for the

921
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:52,240
plant to do its job

922
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:53,200
and if the plant has to do a job that's

923
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,319
necessary for

924
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,558
every part of its production would it be

925
00:28:56,319 --> 00:29:00,960
right to supplement that or

926
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:02,398
would it be helpful to give the plant

927
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,798
more of it so that it doesn't have to

928
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:06,719
produce it itself so that it can

929
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:08,158
then continue its job at a more

930
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,600
efficient pace

931
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,120
and so when i ask these questions i

932
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:12,398
start to think about human nutrition

933
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:13,439
because i often times compare it to

934
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:15,839
myself

935
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,120
and i think of the stomach as a cation

936
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:19,519
exchange

937
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:21,038
and the colon and that whole process so

938
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:23,278
there's some similarities

939
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:24,960
and i think you know what if i was going

940
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:27,278
for

941
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,079
a bodybuilding contest or if i wanted to

942
00:29:27,278 --> 00:29:30,480
be

943
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:32,240
at um an olympic athlete or whatever it

944
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,159
was and i'm trying to be in peak

945
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,759
optimal condition like we want out of

946
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,840
our plants not just a general

947
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:40,319
run-of-the-mill organic plant but one

948
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:42,798
that is at the top of its game with

949
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:43,678
every ability to produce possible

950
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:46,639
according to

951
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,278
its own genetic profile so much like a

952
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,240
human

953
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:49,359
it's not like you're going to grow

954
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,480
taller because you're taking a

955
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:52,319
supplement but

956
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,079
you might be healthier and better able

957
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:56,398
to perform your functions

958
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:57,918
i feel like it would be like an athlete

959
00:29:56,398 --> 00:29:59,839
eating all the square meals and all

960
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:01,759
vegetables they're supposed to

961
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:03,359
but at a certain point it takes so much

962
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:04,079
time out of their day to prepare those

963
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:07,038
meals to

964
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:08,240
chew them and to digest them alongside

965
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:10,480
with all the work they have to do to

966
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,399
maintain their optimal results

967
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,839
it makes sense that they would blend

968
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:15,439
stuff in a smoothie and that is

969
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:15,918
micronization we do that all the time

970
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,000
with

971
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:20,080
organics we found that they're faster

972
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,599
available when we micronize things

973
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:23,918
and then the next thing we look at is

974
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:26,319
amino acids as part of the

975
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,360
profile for recovery and for building

976
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:29,119
those muscles

977
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:30,719
and for performing at a higher level

978
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:32,398
instead of just looking at protina's

979
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,399
protein from a mcdonald's cheeseburger

980
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:38,398
versus a very selective

981
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:40,798
grass-fed protein product or

982
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:42,158
premium vegetable or whatever you get

983
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:44,000
your protein from

984
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,440
and so if you think of it that way of

985
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,919
course it makes sense no matter who you

986
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,679
are

987
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:49,360
you could always be improved upon with a

988
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,000
couple of supplements that are natural

989
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:52,319
and

990
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,240
giving you that peak optimal potential

991
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:56,000
for either keeping your energy up or

992
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,759
making sure that you can perform

993
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,599
so we go back to plants and it's like

994
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:01,359
okay we can do water only we can build a

995
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:03,439
soil to me that is eating the three

996
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:05,918
square meals or the four meals a day

997
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,798
with the right balance of vegetables

998
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,480
right

999
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:10,240
but then we look at supplements as the

1000
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,679
next level that we can start to apply

1001
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,319
and so we did the basics in the last

1002
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,000
episode

1003
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:15,519
everyone knows you make a good living

1004
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,038
soil good compost

1005
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:19,759
water only as long as you have a lot of

1006
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:21,038
soil and a mulch layered worms and stuff

1007
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:22,319
you're going to have very good results

1008
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:24,319
but

1009
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:25,359
aminos are kind of that next level and

1010
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:27,278
so

1011
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:30,719
we've been playing with a product called

1012
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:33,359
thriving and it's a freeze-dried

1013
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,839
fish hydrolysate and so it doesn't

1014
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:35,918
require

1015
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:38,558
the phosphoric acid or the liquid that

1016
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,759
comes along with the liquidish products

1017
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:42,000
and we've also played with some soy

1018
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:43,519
products um what do you guys have

1019
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,159
available out there that might be called

1020
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:48,480
an amino acid product

1021
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,519
there's a few different ones um i've

1022
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,558
seen

1023
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:55,839
uh i think someone was using like the

1024
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:57,440
coconut pulp um i see people

1025
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:59,199
people making you know a lot of fish

1026
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,720
hydrosylates things like that sorry

1027
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,960
hydro satellites

1028
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:06,240
so yeah i get all the words wrong yeah a

1029
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:09,519
lot of diy stuff at the moment basically

1030
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,880
okay um we got the amino acid products

1031
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,839
and we started with one called pure

1032
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,039
protein dry

1033
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:18,558
and the story goes that um

1034
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:19,679
rootwise and some of the other big tree

1035
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:21,678
outdoor growers

1036
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,278
he turned me on to he mentioned that a

1037
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:24,159
lot of them were using these amino acid

1038
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:27,038
products to grow

1039
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:28,000
bigger than 10 pound plants outdoors and

1040
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:29,839
that it became

1041
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,759
a big thing where people would foliar

1042
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:32,879
spray amino acids a couple of times a

1043
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:35,919
week or more

1044
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,320
even deep into flour um on these outdoor

1045
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:37,840
crops

1046
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:39,839
and have superior results and they

1047
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:40,798
wouldn't get the fading of the leaves so

1048
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:42,319
early

1049
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:43,918
they wouldn't get all these problems

1050
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:45,759
that would happen when you're really

1051
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,278
trying to grow a 10 pound plus plant

1052
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:49,038
which will highlight a lot of your

1053
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:50,960
weaknesses much faster than when you're

1054
00:32:49,038 --> 00:32:54,079
growing a small plant

1055
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:55,600
and on a short season and so that got my

1056
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:56,398
interest because now i know okay the

1057
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:58,240
pros

1058
00:32:56,398 --> 00:32:59,918
the people that i look up to a lot of

1059
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,679
times they're not talking about a lot of

1060
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,080
their processes because they'll get

1061
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,840
um judged from every angle for maybe

1062
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:07,038
folder spraying something in flower or

1063
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:08,959
maybe using a product

1064
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:11,038
that is not the typical permaculture

1065
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,319
style and so we started using the pure

1066
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:15,119
protein dry and we had

1067
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:16,319
really incredible results it really sped

1068
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:19,359
up the vegetative process

1069
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:22,158
it allowed us to take advantage

1070
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:23,038
of the hormonal change that happens when

1071
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,559
you go into flour

1072
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:26,240
and leverage some very available

1073
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:28,240
nitrogen that's not the same type that

1074
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,159
normally causes burn and problems and

1075
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,960
fox tailing and so you can use a small

1076
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,640
amount of it

1077
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,120
all the way through flour or at least up

1078
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:38,159
near the end and it'll allow you to

1079
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:38,639
leverage the flour components even

1080
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:39,840
better

1081
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,080
as far as the building blocks of

1082
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:44,000
building those flowers and so

1083
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:45,918
right away we knew okay amino acids are

1084
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,398
important and so from pure protein dry

1085
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:49,759
we found there was actually some extra

1086
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:52,239
products mixed into that

1087
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:53,839
there was zinc and there was iron and

1088
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,038
there was some bacterias and

1089
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:56,639
we just weren't interested in all that

1090
00:33:55,038 --> 00:33:58,158
we also started getting a mixture of

1091
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,000
different packages showing up when we

1092
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:01,600
ordered the product in bulk

1093
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,519
and so behind the scenes we talked to a

1094
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:05,918
few growers that knew the real story

1095
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:06,640
and found out that computers have had a

1096
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:11,358
falling out

1097
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:14,960
and um beyond all of that drama

1098
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:16,398
uh the product thrive n is supposedly

1099
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,679
the leader in the industry

1100
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:19,519
and they're taking their time to get all

1101
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,679
the labels right we've got the product

1102
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:22,878
in our store now and it is a singular

1103
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,838
ingredient

1104
00:34:22,878 --> 00:34:26,639
and it is the more pure form of aminos

1105
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:28,239
and so

1106
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,159
right now i'm encouraging others to play

1107
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:32,000
with it share their feedback

1108
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:33,679
and so if you don't have access to that

1109
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,878
product i'd encourage you to research

1110
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:37,119
and find something that may be

1111
00:34:34,878 --> 00:34:38,799
applicable um because i've never been a

1112
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,480
big foliar spray guy but these amino

1113
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,359
acids are making a big difference and i

1114
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,159
think that

1115
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:45,440
um besides that also just using them as

1116
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,119
part of the

1117
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,480
first couple weeks during stretch and

1118
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,240
flower um

1119
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,519
it might make a big difference to a lot

1120
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:53,918
of growers now

1121
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:55,358
if you've got a huge bed of soil it's

1122
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:57,838
been there for years you've got worms in

1123
00:34:55,358 --> 00:34:59,199
it you've got tons of nitrogen and

1124
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:01,039
i just think you're always going to be

1125
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:02,719
okay with that but as we mentioned

1126
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:04,880
the olympic athlete compared to the

1127
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:06,319
average person a lot of times that a

1128
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,838
couple of supplements might make that

1129
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,480
one percent difference that make that

1130
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:11,279
gold medal

1131
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,838
difference versus someone who's at home

1132
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,839
um

1133
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:16,320
you know not achieving the same results

1134
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:18,400
so i'm open to it and

1135
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,240
i think amino acids is really one of the

1136
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,519
paramount organic

1137
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:24,399
uh tools just like fulvix and a few

1138
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:26,239
other things

1139
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,920
that are worth the money and what i mean

1140
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:30,239
by that is around here

1141
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,960
when you're looking at the soil one of

1142
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:32,879
the

1143
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,639
problems with our clay soil leads a lot

1144
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,119
of people to getting a fish fertilizer

1145
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:37,679
to

1146
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,960
organically farm on on scale and they

1147
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:41,919
recommend about

1148
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,480
i think it's 10 to 15 gallons per acre

1149
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,880
for

1150
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,079
a higher production crop like corn or

1151
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,880
tomatoes or

1152
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,079
hemp and so when we look at the dry

1153
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,400
amino acids

1154
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:54,240
because they are as you mentioned a more

1155
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:57,519
available form of nitrogen

1156
00:35:54,239 --> 00:36:00,559
a smaller more micronized more

1157
00:35:57,519 --> 00:36:01,119
available absorbable form you can now

1158
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:04,719
use

1159
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:06,320
a pound per acre or and that replaces

1160
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:08,319
about five to seven gallons

1161
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,920
and so if you wanted to go up to that 15

1162
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,680
gallon mark you would only use maybe two

1163
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,280
to three pounds at the most

1164
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:14,960
and that dramatically lowers the

1165
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,440
shipping cost of the material to the

1166
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,358
farmer

1167
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,800
and so i'm all about those leverage

1168
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:19,598
points you're at a farm that has no

1169
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,000
nitrogen

1170
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:23,599
what are you gonna do dump ten thousand

1171
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,280
pounds or maybe tens of thousands of

1172
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,280
pounds of compost out there

1173
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,720
are you going to go till in typical

1174
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,640
nitrogen fertilizer

1175
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:33,358
and so i think that having aminos is a

1176
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:35,519
good advantage at that point

1177
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:36,639
yeah definitely and i mean if we use

1178
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:39,199
your analogy of

1179
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:40,078
the uh the athletes or the olympic

1180
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:42,719
athletes

1181
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:44,880
um and and supplements let's let's jump

1182
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:49,118
from supplements to steroids

1183
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,119
i've seen yeah that both

1184
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:52,838
you and myself are playing around with

1185
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:55,119
the uh the try

1186
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:57,119
continental how what's your thoughts on

1187
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:58,000
this one i'm i'm really interested in it

1188
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:01,280
i think it's

1189
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,400
gonna possibly be a game changer um

1190
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,040
have you played around with it yet i've

1191
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,880
seen you did a post about it

1192
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:08,719
um i played around with it but i will

1193
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,480
say no i haven't what i mean by that

1194
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:12,319
is i'm guessing if i'm playing with it

1195
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,320
i'm just doing natural processes

1196
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,760
sprouting alfalfa seeds which i don't

1197
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,400
think have any in there

1198
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,079
um and playing with alfalfa meal i

1199
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,440
really think that alfalfa compost is

1200
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,599
probably a good way to get some

1201
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,599
and we're talking about the waxy

1202
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:28,320
substance the tricontinol

1203
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:30,480
um that comes from the plant and alfalfa

1204
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,400
makes a very good compost it's got a

1205
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,119
good carbon and nitrogen ratio

1206
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,720
there's some very documented processes

1207
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,880
on making it and so

1208
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:41,199
um i think that might be something that

1209
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,640
i'm interested in as far as the actual

1210
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:45,199
chemical product you can just go buy an

1211
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:46,799
extra active tricontinol

1212
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:48,879
i've not played with it and i would

1213
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,560
really really like to i guess

1214
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,400
i haven't because it's not something

1215
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:54,559
that i really want to focus on

1216
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,559
carrying those particular types of

1217
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:58,159
products that are

1218
00:37:56,559 --> 00:37:59,599
a little bit less documented a little

1219
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:00,879
bit more out there right now i want to

1220
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:02,160
make sure when someone goes to build a

1221
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,400
soil we've at least put it through its

1222
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:07,279
paces we know there's some value there

1223
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,680
um and so it's not something i've really

1224
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,880
done

1225
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:12,399
but um i know like you though that a lot

1226
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,519
of growers have

1227
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,160
and there's um a couple pieces of

1228
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:17,920
information

1229
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:19,358
one is that a little goes a long way

1230
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,519
they can definitely be abused

1231
00:38:19,358 --> 00:38:22,480
and cause some weird problems but for

1232
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:25,199
the most part

1233
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,480
i'm hearing that like you there is some

1234
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:28,639
huge potential

1235
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,159
and so i would encourage everyone to do

1236
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,759
their own research

1237
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:33,279
and see what they can come up with but

1238
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,960
for right now um

1239
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,280
i don't have any at my house and i have

1240
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,440
never even looked at buying it

1241
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,760
okay yeah i've i've played around with

1242
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,599
it it's it's a little bit of a nightmare

1243
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,359
to be honest because it's um the

1244
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:48,640
molecule itself

1245
00:38:45,358 --> 00:38:49,440
it's just a big suspect or is it like a

1246
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:50,719
chemical thing

1247
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,960
i know they're probably both available

1248
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:54,559
right yeah i believe this one's just

1249
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,400
straight chemically derived

1250
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:58,320
but um the problem is because it is such

1251
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,800
a waxy molecule in nature

1252
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:03,200
it's like 98 percent surfactant two

1253
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:05,200
percent trichantinol

1254
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:06,639
that makes sense yeah and then as you

1255
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:07,519
said again a little goes a long way i

1256
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:10,639
believe it's like

1257
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:12,239
uh one mil of it you mix into like

1258
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:13,759
50 liters or something like this it's

1259
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:15,838
the craziest dilution i've ever seen

1260
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,520
basically for an organic product oh

1261
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:19,679
sorry i shouldn't say that just for a

1262
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:21,199
product that's not blatantly sold i

1263
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:23,118
guess

1264
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:25,279
yeah that's interesting um a lot of

1265
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:27,920
times you'll find that and

1266
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,440
for instance we carry a yucca product um

1267
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,920
that is

1268
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,358
uh for the saponin and the one we carry

1269
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,039
is 100

1270
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:36,559
yucca it's like a molasses and a certain

1271
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:38,320
percentage is a saponin

1272
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:40,239
but when you pour it it's like molasses

1273
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,680
and i believe that on the market

1274
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:43,358
when someone's making a product that

1275
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:45,118
could be a detracting factor for the

1276
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:45,838
home user because it's sloppy it gets on

1277
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,119
the bottle

1278
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:48,559
and so why don't we just dilute it down

1279
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,920
to about four percent put it in water

1280
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:50,400
and now it's really easy to pour and

1281
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,800
charge

1282
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,559
you know a thousand times the price and

1283
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,240
so there's always this effect where

1284
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:57,838
people can sell more if it's easier to

1285
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:59,279
use but you'll notice the newer

1286
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:01,119
products that are really out there like

1287
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,480
this they haven't been really formulated

1288
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,240
into an easy to use

1289
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,240
really expensive it's typically these

1290
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:09,118
crazy dilution rates

1291
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:10,959
these really small amounts and it

1292
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,318
doesn't make sense on scale but once we

1293
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,760
figure out how to use it in actual

1294
00:40:12,318 --> 00:40:15,838
dosages i'd imagine there'll be a lot of

1295
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,440
products out there that'll contain it

1296
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:18,799
i feel like right now when people are

1297
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,079
talking about mammoth p one of the

1298
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,318
things that there's been a discussion on

1299
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,640
is

1300
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:24,079
is that really just a tricontinol that

1301
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:26,159
they're

1302
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:27,280
getting around saying because they're

1303
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:29,440
saying they're fermenting

1304
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,800
the alfalfa as part of the extract of

1305
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,400
the microbes

1306
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,160
and so whether it's politics or whether

1307
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,599
it's a label a lot of times you can get

1308
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:38,639
away with

1309
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:40,880
the unknown product

1310
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:42,639
piggybacking on the one that you can say

1311
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,200
is is the important thing to be on the

1312
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:44,960
label

1313
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:47,679
and so i have no knowledge of that about

1314
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:51,039
mammoth p i don't i i could care less

1315
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:53,039
but um in playing with that when you

1316
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:54,079
talk to anybody that has and compared it

1317
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:55,920
to maybe mammoth p

1318
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:57,519
or had had issues with it i'm just

1319
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,519
curious

1320
00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:01,358
no i'm the only one i know who's played

1321
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:04,960
around with the tricanteno

1322
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:05,598
tricontinol sorry um but yeah it's it's

1323
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,358
mostly

1324
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:08,800
my american buds who have played around

1325
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:10,480
with the mammoth p because it's so

1326
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,240
it's so expensive to get over here it's

1327
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,880
like the normal prices plus an arm and a

1328
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:14,879
leg for shipping

1329
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,720
yeah okay well interesting i'll have to

1330
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,720
talk about that more later maybe i'll

1331
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:23,838
get something and go for it i'm

1332
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:24,799
gonna do uh a few different test rounds

1333
00:41:23,838 --> 00:41:26,159
at the build a soil

1334
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,760
store but one of the things that gets

1335
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:28,960
overwhelming is the amount of ideas we

1336
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,240
have for side by sides

1337
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:33,280
i'd love to have you know a college size

1338
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:35,519
or a

1339
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:37,599
facility that just had nothing but you

1340
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:39,679
know well-documented side-by-sides so we

1341
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,800
can run tests like this but

1342
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:42,318
fortunately with the laws it's not

1343
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,920
exactly like barley where we can just

1344
00:41:42,318 --> 00:41:45,119
have a greenhouse everywhere testing

1345
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,119
you know all the varieties for the next

1346
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:49,358
year's production

1347
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:50,960
i know what you mean well let's jump

1348
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:52,960
onto a topic that's probably going to

1349
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:56,400
make a lot of people real butt hurt

1350
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:58,318
omri registration this is one that i

1351
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,079
actually just cannot stand it's like a

1352
00:41:58,318 --> 00:42:01,679
huge pet peeve because

1353
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,760
as far as all the research points to

1354
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:05,039
that i've done a product with omni

1355
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,280
registration is

1356
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:08,400
more likely to not be organic than to be

1357
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,359
organic

1358
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:13,280
um but i want to know your opinions on

1359
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:15,358
it you know i've got a great photo on my

1360
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,280
instagram of a big bag of calcium

1361
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:18,799
sulfate like the bluest looking salt

1362
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,200
you've ever seen and it's got that big

1363
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:23,359
old omni registration on it so

1364
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:25,358
how do you deal with this uh conundrum

1365
00:42:23,358 --> 00:42:28,159
shall we say

1366
00:42:25,358 --> 00:42:29,440
um well at a certain level if you know

1367
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:31,519
what omri means

1368
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,358
you can at least use it as a filter for

1369
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:35,358
giving you a certain direction but

1370
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:38,078
you get you hit the the nail on the head

1371
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:40,559
when you said the word register

1372
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,359
it's not a certification and so the

1373
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:44,159
organic

1374
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:46,078
materials review institute reviews

1375
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:47,519
products puts them on a list so really

1376
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,880
the the proper terminology would be

1377
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:50,719
listed

1378
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,160
and that's interesting because all they

1379
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:53,519
do is they charge money to put you on a

1380
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:55,199
list

1381
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:56,880
and as we all know when there's money

1382
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:58,000
being exchanged to be on a list a lot of

1383
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,240
times there's ways to get that

1384
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,079
done where the product may not be

1385
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:03,679
necessarily organic but it's approved

1386
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,119
for organic production under one

1387
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:07,440
scenario or another so it's a little

1388
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:10,480
misleading

1389
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,760
and i feel that

1390
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,199
it probably started out with the right

1391
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,440
intention you know when you follow and i

1392
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:18,078
talked to uh clackamas coots

1393
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,119
about the origins of some of the

1394
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:22,160
processes

1395
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:22,720
and how oregon tilf uh used to be called

1396
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:24,719
tilth

1397
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:26,159
and it was a group of a couple of

1398
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:27,598
different states and then eventually

1399
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:29,358
they got big enough and broke off and

1400
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:31,119
then you have the california organic

1401
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:31,838
farmers and you have the oregon tilth

1402
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,838
and you have

1403
00:43:31,838 --> 00:43:35,358
um all these different uh institutes and

1404
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:36,400
then you have omri that comes in and

1405
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:38,719
says okay well

1406
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,318
we've seen all these and so as long as

1407
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:41,759
it meets all of these different ones

1408
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:43,358
will put you on the list whether you're

1409
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,880
oregon tilth they might have a me too

1410
00:43:43,358 --> 00:43:46,639
where they say okay well you passed that

1411
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,240
for sure you could be omri just send us

1412
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:50,719
your information

1413
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:51,838
and so the the the idea is to

1414
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:54,799
communicate

1415
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:56,159
about the actual products and make sure

1416
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,760
that everything's acceptable and

1417
00:43:56,159 --> 00:43:59,598
transparent for the consumer so i really

1418
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,640
like the idea but it starts to convolute

1419
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,240
things because

1420
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:04,159
as soon as you can't trust it now you

1421
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:05,358
have this misleading badge out there

1422
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:07,598
that

1423
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:09,199
becomes more of a marketing ploy and a

1424
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:11,440
dollar generating machine than

1425
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:12,399
actual creating transparency for the

1426
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,960
consumer

1427
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,079
and so i always look for organ telf if i

1428
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,000
can

1429
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:19,680
and then second to that i'm not so

1430
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,358
concerned with certifications if i can

1431
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:22,799
meet the producer or if i can get a

1432
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:25,519
better understanding of how it's

1433
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,079
created a lot of times the barrier to

1434
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:27,920
these

1435
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:29,359
expensive organic protocols is that you

1436
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,280
have a lot of smaller producers that

1437
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:33,039
have higher quality products

1438
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,880
unable to compete by putting these

1439
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:36,800
labels on there

1440
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,318
which is a good and bad thing you know

1441
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,960
sometimes the smaller producers

1442
00:44:38,318 --> 00:44:42,639
also will do things that aren't

1443
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,519
acceptable on large scale as far as

1444
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:46,639
cleanliness

1445
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:48,800
or packing and so we're experiencing a

1446
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:52,480
lot of this as we grow as a company

1447
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:54,400
we've never sought to put npk labels or

1448
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:57,440
to put omri listing or to put

1449
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,720
green clean or anything it's it's it's

1450
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:02,000
completely

1451
00:44:58,719 --> 00:45:03,358
of no value to us because if our

1452
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,880
products aren't good enough already

1453
00:45:03,358 --> 00:45:05,838
going out and buying some label to put

1454
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,519
on it to me doesn't

1455
00:45:05,838 --> 00:45:09,279
make it any better it's just trying to

1456
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:10,719
communicate that faster to the customer

1457
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,560
on the shelf and we rely

1458
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:14,559
on a more direct conversation with our

1459
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:18,159
customer and with our

1460
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:18,880
material producers so what does aubrey

1461
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:20,480
uh is in

1462
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,160
australia do they also list a lot of the

1463
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,559
products out there what do you guys

1464
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:26,159
have that would be more like oregon till

1465
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:28,159
damn you caught me out i should know the

1466
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:30,078
answer to who's like the good body to

1467
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:31,679
refer to but there's definitely omri out

1468
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:33,200
here

1469
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:34,719
i don't know at all what's out there and

1470
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:36,239
so i'm wondering if it's similar out

1471
00:45:34,719 --> 00:45:39,118
here that it's more of like a

1472
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:40,159
political thing than it is an actual

1473
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,599
something you can make a purchase

1474
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:42,318
decision off of because if it says

1475
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:45,119
oregon tilt

1476
00:45:42,318 --> 00:45:46,559
um i'm confident buying it um if it says

1477
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,680
aubry i'm gonna do more research

1478
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:50,480
and so i think that's the difference for

1479
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:53,279
me yeah i'm pretty lucky after um

1480
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:54,880
our last chat i messaged steve solomon

1481
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,040
and he's been kind enough to

1482
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,640
be in correspondence with me so if i've

1483
00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:00,000
ever got a question i can usually run it

1484
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:03,039
by him and you know he's a

1485
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,559
gold mine of information i'm really

1486
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:06,880
happy to hear you're talking to him

1487
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:08,318
um you know i don't speak with him often

1488
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,559
it's only been a couple times but he was

1489
00:46:08,318 --> 00:46:11,920
always so forthcoming with information

1490
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:14,400
and he seemed so passionate that i felt

1491
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:16,400
like he too would hit it off well

1492
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,240
yeah it's interesting after reading his

1493
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,920
book the intelligent gardener upon your

1494
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:21,679
recommendation and everyone else should

1495
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:24,400
have read it by now it's been a year

1496
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:25,279
um it definitely brought up the idea of

1497
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,720
and you even

1498
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,880
very briefly touched on it how there's

1499
00:46:26,719 --> 00:46:30,559
this community of people out there who

1500
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,640
think that it's very possible that like

1501
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:34,480
the overall increase in disease and

1502
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:36,239
cancer and things like that

1503
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,240
could be due to a decrease in the

1504
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:40,159
nutrient density within our food

1505
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:41,679
are you are you kind of very much on

1506
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:44,719
board with that or you've maybe changed

1507
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:47,598
your mind a little bit since then

1508
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:48,639
no 100 i feel that it is definitely

1509
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:51,039
related to that

1510
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:52,239
we are what we eat we look at historical

1511
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:53,440
numbers we look at

1512
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:55,118
countries that are doing better and

1513
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,720
start eating more meat and start eating

1514
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:58,160
products that are not as nutrient dense

1515
00:46:56,719 --> 00:46:59,759
and the rate of disease goes up it's

1516
00:46:58,159 --> 00:47:02,480
directly correlated

1517
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:03,040
and i feel that anyone that doesn't see

1518
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,039
that

1519
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:06,318
is just lying to themselves because they

1520
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:06,639
have something they're more comfortable

1521
00:47:06,318 --> 00:47:09,199
with

1522
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:10,719
and so when you start growing plants and

1523
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:12,078
you see a garden and see how quickly

1524
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:14,239
deficiencies can affect it

1525
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:15,680
it's it it reflects back on you and i

1526
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:17,919
think that it makes you someone

1527
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:18,960
more aware of these things um to

1528
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:22,800
convolute that more

1529
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:24,480
a lot of times we see things um

1530
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,160
there's a quote out there like every

1531
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,838
disease can be related to a mineral

1532
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:29,358
deficiency and when you look it up that

1533
00:47:27,838 --> 00:47:30,719
quote's actually completely misquoted it

1534
00:47:29,358 --> 00:47:32,480
doesn't really exist by the scientist

1535
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:34,078
it's quoted to

1536
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,920
and so i feel like people can go a

1537
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:37,839
little bit overboard um

1538
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,039
and then that turns into products like

1539
00:47:37,838 --> 00:47:41,920
shilajit and

1540
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:43,519
you know um mineral products that may or

1541
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:46,318
may not be necessary

1542
00:47:43,519 --> 00:47:47,920
um but at the same time if you're

1543
00:47:46,318 --> 00:47:48,558
getting food that's made from hydroponic

1544
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,318
bottles

1545
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:52,079
i really think that there's going to be

1546
00:47:50,318 --> 00:47:53,920
a decline in health and when we start

1547
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:54,559
looking at calcium and other things that

1548
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,960
are important

1549
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:57,839
to our body and we look at the soil that

1550
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,559
these products are

1551
00:47:57,838 --> 00:48:01,519
growing in we see a direct correlation

1552
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:04,319
um

1553
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:06,159
and so it's just it's so obvious to me

1554
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:09,599
it's one of those things that is just

1555
00:48:06,159 --> 00:48:11,118
almost upsets me when you when you

1556
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:12,800
hear that people don't believe that or

1557
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:15,519
they think that their

1558
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,160
uh the new technology is just always the

1559
00:48:15,519 --> 00:48:18,079
answer

1560
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:19,519
and that um farming organically is not

1561
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:20,559
sustainable it can you know feed the

1562
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:22,079
people

1563
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:24,079
and i feel like a lot of the problems

1564
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:25,920
are more to do with the fact that we've

1565
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:28,480
all just accepted that

1566
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,599
um and i feel like it's changed you know

1567
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,199
certainly over the last five years

1568
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:32,800
there's been a huge movement at least

1569
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:34,318
it feels that way to me maybe i'm just

1570
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:37,519
involved in it more

1571
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:39,039
um but is it the same over there is

1572
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:39,358
there kind of a division where people

1573
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:41,759
just

1574
00:48:39,358 --> 00:48:43,279
like either don't agree with it at all

1575
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,400
or or it's just obvious

1576
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:47,359
i feel like there's not a lot of middle

1577
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:49,519
ground there yeah i think that

1578
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:51,199
there it'd be a much smaller percentage

1579
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:52,079
of people who are aware of it i feel

1580
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:53,919
like

1581
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:55,440
i was almost a bit in like the twilight

1582
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,000
zone when i was in oregon and it was

1583
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,760
like

1584
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,838
almost everyone was really concerned

1585
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,880
about like the use of glyphosate and

1586
00:48:59,838 --> 00:49:02,558
stuff like that

1587
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:04,400
i was just like man you'd never get this

1588
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:04,880
in australia like people are not really

1589
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,039
that

1590
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,318
worried about it not not to say that

1591
00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:09,358
it's not to be worried about but you

1592
00:49:08,318 --> 00:49:10,960
know what i mean like they just they

1593
00:49:09,358 --> 00:49:13,279
accept it as you put it

1594
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,639
yeah interesting stuff but i guess the

1595
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:16,319
point it brings to my mind is

1596
00:49:14,639 --> 00:49:18,239
do you think it's almost like uh

1597
00:49:16,318 --> 00:49:20,159
responsibility then if you go organic to

1598
00:49:18,239 --> 00:49:21,519
like try to just grow some regular stuff

1599
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:23,118
as well seeing as you know you've got

1600
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:25,358
all the skills and probably all the gear

1601
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:27,280
to do it

1602
00:49:25,358 --> 00:49:29,039
yeah i think that it it's always been

1603
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,559
that way at least for me

1604
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:32,159
i grew up in a cul-de-sac and then when

1605
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:34,000
i moved to colorado um

1606
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:35,838
having land and all of this was a little

1607
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,119
bit new to me and so the opportunity was

1608
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:38,960
a little bit more available

1609
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:40,400
and i think that people that don't have

1610
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,519
that land but now know how to use a

1611
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,119
container

1612
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:44,480
they go through the same process canvas

1613
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:46,880
to me was a gateway to a better

1614
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:48,639
lifestyle it taught me how to garden

1615
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,240
and i realized that you didn't really

1616
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:52,078
need a green thumb it was just this

1617
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:53,679
perpetuated model of

1618
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:55,760
hey if you want a garden that's kind of

1619
00:49:53,679 --> 00:49:56,960
like you know it's like playing you're

1620
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,400
never really going to do anything you go

1621
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,920
get a start from home depot

1622
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,119
and it's never really going to grow

1623
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,639
because you're going to buy potting soil

1624
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:03,680
that doesn't really have anything in it

1625
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:05,118
you're going to be frustrated you're

1626
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:06,879
never going to get any food and then

1627
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:08,559
you're going to realize you spent 300

1628
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,559
on four tomatoes and it would have been

1629
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:12,319
just better to go to the grocery store

1630
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:13,599
and as soon as you start producing you

1631
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:15,358
know really

1632
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:17,039
good yields of your own cannabis you

1633
00:50:15,358 --> 00:50:18,400
start to realize hey man maybe i could

1634
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:19,920
do pretty good over here

1635
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,079
and while i don't need 100 of my food

1636
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,920
from the garden it's on my heart

1637
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:26,000
to do that and i would love it if i had

1638
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,920
that much time to do

1639
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,440
that and i feel like one of the one of

1640
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:32,880
the challenges that we

1641
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:34,639
we face today is that we're we have the

1642
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,318
ability to spend a lot more of our day

1643
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:37,838
doing other things to produce an income

1644
00:50:36,318 --> 00:50:41,039
that allows us to buy food

1645
00:50:37,838 --> 00:50:42,639
and so um it's just

1646
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:44,159
it starts to happen though and all of a

1647
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:45,519
sudden when you have lettuce and more

1648
00:50:44,159 --> 00:50:47,440
produce and more things that

1649
00:50:45,519 --> 00:50:49,599
are really a lot taste a lot better and

1650
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:51,039
last longer and are produced by you

1651
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:52,400
they end up working their way into more

1652
00:50:51,039 --> 00:50:52,880
of your meals and your health will

1653
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,480
change

1654
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,920
um everything in your life will change

1655
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:58,000
when you start growing organic

1656
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,599
and i think that's definitely different

1657
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,318
from someone who is farming in the

1658
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:02,640
typical

1659
00:51:00,318 --> 00:51:03,838
the typical methodology and for me when

1660
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:06,480
i started growing food

1661
00:51:03,838 --> 00:51:08,960
because because of this i looked at all

1662
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:11,760
the npk bottles that i had and i thought

1663
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:13,358
well when do i flush my tomatoes is this

1664
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,520
safe to eat how does this work

1665
00:51:13,358 --> 00:51:17,279
and so a lot of those questions started

1666
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:18,880
to be get other questions that put me

1667
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,599
down that rabbit hole of well why am i

1668
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:23,119
doing this with

1669
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:25,039
my cannabis and so if we jump back to a

1670
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:26,559
point you mentioned earlier

1671
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:28,800
this is another one which you know

1672
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:30,800
grinds my gears shilajit

1673
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:32,160
shills there's only really one out there

1674
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,960
we all know who it is i'm not going to

1675
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:35,598
give him any

1676
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:37,920
credibility saying his name but you know

1677
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:40,640
can we get like a ruling on it shilajit

1678
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:42,240
is not going to cure your cancer it's uh

1679
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:45,159
it's not viagra

1680
00:51:42,239 --> 00:51:46,318
it's not um your replacement for your

1681
00:51:45,159 --> 00:51:50,159
antidepressant

1682
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:52,400
it's um yeah what do you think

1683
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:54,480
yeah i think that um one of the

1684
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,480
challenges when we're working with

1685
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,400
nutritional information is that it can

1686
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:02,079
be skewed so many different ways

1687
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:04,318
and i highlighted on the conversation of

1688
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:05,920
micronutrient and the quote of you know

1689
00:52:04,318 --> 00:52:08,239
every disease being related to some

1690
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:09,838
micronutrient deficiency and then

1691
00:52:08,239 --> 00:52:12,000
catalyzing that out there saying you

1692
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:13,920
know this product xyz has every

1693
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,358
micronutrient and look it they're all in

1694
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,960
really low levels

1695
00:52:15,358 --> 00:52:18,880
and so i would encourage you to do your

1696
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:20,240
own research i'm not using any shilijit

1697
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,838
products and i'm not saying that they're

1698
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:23,598
bad or that they don't have a place

1699
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:25,599
i just didn't jump on the bandwagon

1700
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:27,359
because i find that when i do jump on

1701
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:28,880
bandwagons i end up running it at least

1702
00:52:27,358 --> 00:52:30,000
for my customer base we try and slow

1703
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,400
down a little bit

1704
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,760
do our research and if things hold up to

1705
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,920
the test of time

1706
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:37,520
and um we started to see reason and our

1707
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:40,800
research which points to

1708
00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:41,920
um a purpose then we want to test it

1709
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,440
but one of the things that we've always

1710
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:46,000
been a believer of is that if we're

1711
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:47,440
after fulvic acid get fulvic acid

1712
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,358
and one of the things that we learned

1713
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:53,200
when looking for fulvic acids from dr

1714
00:52:49,358 --> 00:52:54,960
faust is that it's it's a golden liquid

1715
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:57,598
that is completely free of

1716
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,880
any of the colloidal minerals or the

1717
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:01,920
fulvic minerals

1718
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:03,680
and if we are after minerals

1719
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,720
as a human i feel like eating plants is

1720
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:06,159
the way we're supposed to get our

1721
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:09,039
minerals not by eating

1722
00:53:06,159 --> 00:53:10,879
mind mind material part of the reason

1723
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:12,480
why is there is a ton of research that

1724
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,318
shows that we don't know

1725
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:16,000
much about the periodic table of

1726
00:53:14,318 --> 00:53:18,558
elements and the

1727
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:21,760
slow build up in our body of even trace

1728
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:24,079
amounts of a lot of that periodic table

1729
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:25,680
and so um i would feel more comfortable

1730
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:27,359
eating kelp because of how long we've

1731
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:27,679
eaten it for and the trace minerals that

1732
00:53:27,358 --> 00:53:30,558
are

1733
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:32,159
available there and the alganic acid and

1734
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:33,760
other materials that come with it to

1735
00:53:32,159 --> 00:53:35,199
make it safe for us to use

1736
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:37,920
where when we look at a product like

1737
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:39,838
shilajit if i want the fulvic

1738
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:41,680
when it is completely open to chelate it

1739
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:42,000
has beneficial properties and you can

1740
00:53:41,679 --> 00:53:44,000
add

1741
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,280
it to whatever you'd like to chelate and

1742
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,719
so if we

1743
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,319
without going too far in the word

1744
00:53:46,719 --> 00:53:50,399
chelate just think of that as

1745
00:53:48,318 --> 00:53:51,759
make a little bit more available because

1746
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,200
fulvic can

1747
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,880
it has this ability of being so

1748
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:58,480
molecularly lightweight that it can

1749
00:53:54,880 --> 00:54:02,559
carry across into the plant nutrients at

1750
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:04,159
an alarming rate and so um

1751
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:06,319
even with normal folic acid if we're

1752
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:06,879
using large amounts of aluminum silicate

1753
00:54:06,318 --> 00:54:10,239
rock

1754
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:11,599
dust and the fulvic acid is releasing

1755
00:54:10,239 --> 00:54:12,959
that aluminum because it's so good at

1756
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:14,559
its job is that a problem

1757
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,000
and so if we're using shilajit and it

1758
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:18,480
already has

1759
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,079
um all these minerals in it or any of

1760
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,719
those at alarmingly high rates or if

1761
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:22,960
they're not

1762
00:54:20,719 --> 00:54:24,399
with the slow use add up over time and

1763
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,000
where we have lack of knowledge i just

1764
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,519
tend to stay away from and go to stuff

1765
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,119
that's been around for

1766
00:54:27,519 --> 00:54:30,880
a longer period of time when it when it

1767
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:32,800
comes to agriculture

1768
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:34,240
and when it comes to efficacy for versus

1769
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,480
the cost

1770
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:37,439
for instance faust was working with dr

1771
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,719
send um

1772
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:41,920
of the author of the um

1773
00:54:40,719 --> 00:54:43,838
forget the name of the book but the

1774
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:46,639
seaweed book

1775
00:54:43,838 --> 00:54:47,679
and um they extracted fulvic and cubics

1776
00:54:46,639 --> 00:54:49,199
from seaweed but

1777
00:54:47,679 --> 00:54:51,358
it just wasn't cost effective for

1778
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:53,439
agriculture and so i don't think that

1779
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:54,639
you know it it's going to take off for

1780
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:58,240
any reason

1781
00:54:54,639 --> 00:54:59,519
and so um when we look at shilajit it

1782
00:54:58,239 --> 00:55:01,679
comes with the minerals and

1783
00:54:59,519 --> 00:55:03,039
so the red flag goes off immediately dr

1784
00:55:01,679 --> 00:55:03,679
faust pointed in my head if you're going

1785
00:55:03,039 --> 00:55:06,639
to be after

1786
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:07,519
human fulvix humic are the molecular

1787
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:09,679
weight that are

1788
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:11,358
it's it's different it's a black darker

1789
00:55:09,679 --> 00:55:12,960
darker product more like

1790
00:55:11,358 --> 00:55:14,480
the looks of some of these that comes

1791
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,119
with all the mineral where the fulvic is

1792
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:17,599
like the

1793
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:18,559
hash the extract without any of that

1794
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:20,079
stuff

1795
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:22,240
and so if you're looking for fulvic the

1796
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:23,839
completely open is not only more cost

1797
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:25,838
effective but it's going to do its job

1798
00:55:23,838 --> 00:55:26,719
on what you intend

1799
00:55:25,838 --> 00:55:28,400
and if you're looking for a

1800
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:30,239
micronutrient i encourage you to do a

1801
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,200
soil test we can hit the micronutrient

1802
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:32,879
on the head

1803
00:55:31,199 --> 00:55:34,159
if you have a micronutrient issue in

1804
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,200
your body where you feel it's a problem

1805
00:55:34,159 --> 00:55:36,879
you can talk to a doctor

1806
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:38,879
and we can figure out exactly what that

1807
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,400
is because some people need iron and

1808
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,160
some people are high in iron

1809
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,079
so it's i just think that blanket

1810
00:55:42,159 --> 00:55:44,719
approaches are not necessarily the best

1811
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:49,519
way

1812
00:55:44,719 --> 00:55:52,318
to communicate um these processes

1813
00:55:49,519 --> 00:55:53,599
perfect answer i think uh to just loop

1814
00:55:52,318 --> 00:55:55,679
back on what you mentioned

1815
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:57,519
bandwagoning you don't like to get on

1816
00:55:55,679 --> 00:55:59,598
them that's a good thing i noticed you

1817
00:55:57,519 --> 00:56:00,559
didn't get on the neem gate bandwagon

1818
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:02,880
however

1819
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:04,720
our shilajit friend did which is all the

1820
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:07,280
more hilarious in my opinion

1821
00:56:04,719 --> 00:56:08,000
um this was such an interesting one to

1822
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,880
me this whole

1823
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,838
neem controversy thing because in my

1824
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,318
mind it was

1825
00:56:11,838 --> 00:56:16,480
so stupid like if anyone has ever top

1826
00:56:14,318 --> 00:56:18,239
dressed with just a handful of neem

1827
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:20,960
within a day or two they would have seen

1828
00:56:18,239 --> 00:56:21,919
it's just totally engulfed in fungal

1829
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,838
hyphae

1830
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:25,680
so the idea that neem just totally

1831
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:28,159
retards fungal

1832
00:56:25,679 --> 00:56:30,078
uh bacterial colony numbers i think that

1833
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:32,239
was the claim being made ultimately

1834
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:33,680
um i just thought it was ridiculous and

1835
00:56:32,239 --> 00:56:35,679
and you know like it just

1836
00:56:33,679 --> 00:56:38,159
it was so obvious that neem was like a

1837
00:56:35,679 --> 00:56:39,679
positive thing to add to your soil

1838
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:41,118
how did you feel when you first saw it

1839
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:43,199
more importantly how did you feel when

1840
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:44,798
like a few people kind of started to

1841
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:48,639
say that they were believing and whatnot

1842
00:56:44,798 --> 00:56:50,159
was it just like the world's gone mad

1843
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:52,239
yeah i felt like the sky was falling was

1844
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:53,358
really funny to me and i gotta tell you

1845
00:56:52,239 --> 00:56:55,919
no matter what it is

1846
00:56:53,358 --> 00:56:57,039
i treat it seriously i don't wanna get

1847
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:00,480
this

1848
00:56:57,039 --> 00:57:03,440
um cognitive dissonance i guess or

1849
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:05,440
whatever you'd call it where i just um

1850
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:08,639
like you said oh that's ridiculous

1851
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:09,358
my firmly held beliefs are superior and

1852
00:57:08,639 --> 00:57:11,279
correct

1853
00:57:09,358 --> 00:57:13,039
and so i'm always open to challenge

1854
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,760
those and so i just run them through a

1855
00:57:13,039 --> 00:57:15,679
standard

1856
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,960
series of questions so to speak and i

1857
00:57:15,679 --> 00:57:19,440
compare them to

1858
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:21,199
um you know research and information and

1859
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,838
so when someone says that it's not going

1860
00:57:21,199 --> 00:57:23,358
to

1861
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:24,719
work because it kills fungus and it's

1862
00:57:23,358 --> 00:57:26,480
going to cause a detriment first to take

1863
00:57:24,719 --> 00:57:28,000
a step back

1864
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:29,679
is there any evidence that a bacterial

1865
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,039
or fungally dominated soil is going to

1866
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:33,118
be any different in production

1867
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:34,798
no we can look at the compost all day

1868
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:35,920
long but i look at the results and

1869
00:57:34,798 --> 00:57:37,440
growers that i

1870
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:40,559
know are comparing flowers they're not

1871
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:41,838
comparing the fungal domination

1872
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:44,160
now that being said we work with a

1873
00:57:41,838 --> 00:57:46,400
number of greenhouses on large scale

1874
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:48,558
that are interested in documenting every

1875
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:50,240
subsect of informations that they can

1876
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:53,280
compare against crop

1877
00:57:50,239 --> 00:57:55,199
to crop to crop and when you keep that

1878
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,680
in mind you find out that most of the

1879
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:57,759
data

1880
00:57:55,679 --> 00:57:59,759
is completely irrelevant but when you

1881
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:01,440
have a problem you can start to compare

1882
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:03,040
data run to run

1883
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:04,960
and so we're finding that our growers

1884
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:05,599
using our soils with neem cake mixed in

1885
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,838
there

1886
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:09,680
and top dresses of nemanja and using

1887
00:58:07,838 --> 00:58:12,000
neem oils

1888
00:58:09,679 --> 00:58:14,000
they're getting tested at a very same

1889
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,119
facility uh earth fort that does a lot

1890
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,400
of the testing

1891
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:18,480
through the ingame camp for the

1892
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:20,639
bacterial fungal process domination or

1893
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:23,599
the balance there i should say

1894
00:58:20,639 --> 00:58:24,639
and they're doing phenomenally well as

1895
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:26,640
far as

1896
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:27,920
would be reviewed in the industry and it

1897
00:58:26,639 --> 00:58:29,759
would appear as if they

1898
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:31,440
uh wouldn't be using mean cake if that

1899
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,880
was the point so for me it was just

1900
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,000
immediately i already knew we already

1901
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,200
had the testing we already had the

1902
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,199
documentation

1903
00:58:35,199 --> 00:58:38,879
i know that this was a non-issue but

1904
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:40,798
what i also know is that

1905
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,079
for every one of my customers that uses

1906
00:58:40,798 --> 00:58:45,599
products correctly

1907
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:49,039
and uses them with balance and with

1908
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:50,480
maturity i feel like there is another

1909
00:58:49,039 --> 00:58:53,599
couple of customers

1910
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:55,119
that will use them um

1911
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:56,640
maybe to learn how they work and where

1912
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:58,160
the limits are and they'll use them

1913
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:59,118
every time they'll top dress with

1914
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:01,358
massive amounts

1915
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:03,358
they will double the results because if

1916
00:59:01,358 --> 00:59:04,960
someone's good and more is better

1917
00:59:03,358 --> 00:59:06,318
and sometimes they're right sometimes

1918
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,679
they're wrong and i feel like it's

1919
00:59:06,318 --> 00:59:10,000
possible in this case

1920
00:59:07,679 --> 00:59:12,639
maybe that's a possibility but maybe

1921
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,480
that led to some of the conversation but

1922
00:59:12,639 --> 00:59:16,400
the problem with this one is it was so

1923
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:18,318
ridiculous to me i didn't follow most of

1924
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:20,639
it as soon as i figured out that

1925
00:59:18,318 --> 00:59:21,759
it didn't pass my my test as far as

1926
00:59:20,639 --> 00:59:23,039
being really something i needed to pay

1927
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:24,799
attention to

1928
00:59:23,039 --> 00:59:26,318
i pretty much disacted at that point and

1929
00:59:24,798 --> 00:59:27,199
i feel like everyone's entitled to their

1930
00:59:26,318 --> 00:59:28,960
own opinion

1931
00:59:27,199 --> 00:59:30,239
they can share whatever information they

1932
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:32,559
feel is true

1933
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:34,239
um and then i always ask if there's some

1934
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:36,160
reason for someone to lie or some reason

1935
00:59:34,239 --> 00:59:36,959
to manipulate the data for the financial

1936
00:59:36,159 --> 00:59:38,960
gain

1937
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:40,240
and some people mentioned that i don't

1938
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,280
you know i didn't do any research there

1939
00:59:40,239 --> 00:59:44,479
to see if that's

1940
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:45,680
a part of the process but um it's just

1941
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:48,480
not even an issue

1942
00:59:45,679 --> 00:59:49,919
mean cake is not something that i would

1943
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:51,519
worry about at all especially when used

1944
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:55,039
according to our recommended

1945
00:59:51,519 --> 00:59:56,719
suggestions for sure so

1946
00:59:55,039 --> 00:59:58,838
an interesting point i picked uh by the

1947
00:59:56,719 --> 01:00:01,118
way thanks for pointing out my logical

1948
00:59:58,838 --> 01:00:02,558
fallacy

1949
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:04,240
the thing i noticed was a lot of the

1950
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:07,119
comments i read in the uh

1951
01:00:04,239 --> 01:00:08,479
surrounding the topic was they would say

1952
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:11,838
oh this is just

1953
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:12,719
like um ingame's teachings taken to the

1954
01:00:11,838 --> 01:00:15,679
nth degree

1955
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:17,519
you know do you think that is the truth

1956
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:18,719
or that was a misinterpretation in

1957
01:00:17,519 --> 01:00:20,079
itself and i think maybe what they're

1958
01:00:18,719 --> 01:00:23,039
alluding to is that

1959
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:24,000
she believes um maybe not specifically

1960
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:27,358
that neem

1961
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:29,920
retards uh fungal dominance but

1962
01:00:27,358 --> 01:00:31,598
that i think less fungal dominance is

1963
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:35,358
better

1964
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:37,920
yeah um when you look at the numbers um

1965
01:00:35,358 --> 01:00:38,558
i'm not somebody who follows that

1966
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:40,318
process

1967
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:42,000
and so it's not of huge importance for

1968
01:00:40,318 --> 01:00:43,838
me to memorize the balance of

1969
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,199
bacteria count versus fungal account

1970
01:00:43,838 --> 01:00:46,639
that we're looking for on all of these

1971
01:00:45,199 --> 01:00:48,318
reviews

1972
01:00:46,639 --> 01:00:50,239
but it's not like you want a fungally

1973
01:00:48,318 --> 01:00:51,199
dominated soil there's a balance that's

1974
01:00:50,239 --> 01:00:53,679
supposed to be there

1975
01:00:51,199 --> 01:00:55,039
and like i mentioned we're seeing really

1976
01:00:53,679 --> 01:00:56,639
good balance and a number of our

1977
01:00:55,039 --> 01:00:59,358
customers are using mean kicks

1978
01:00:56,639 --> 01:01:00,318
and so it just became a non-issue to me

1979
01:00:59,358 --> 01:01:03,440
um

1980
01:01:00,318 --> 01:01:04,960
but i do feel that

1981
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:07,200
without me getting really deep into

1982
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:08,559
researching mean gate

1983
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:10,318
immediately it was brought to my

1984
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:12,160
attention and it was a thought that i

1985
01:01:10,318 --> 01:01:14,000
had that this was

1986
01:01:12,159 --> 01:01:15,440
taking the income thing you know to that

1987
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,280
to that nth degree and

1988
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:18,559
the reason i say that is in the past in

1989
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:20,480
working with tim wilson

1990
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:22,480
mike ruben and he's been you know really

1991
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:23,920
helpful in my business and helpful in

1992
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:25,920
answering gardening questions without

1993
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:28,159
really any financial motivation

1994
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:29,838
even the products he offers are so

1995
01:01:28,159 --> 01:01:32,159
poorly thought out as far as

1996
01:01:29,838 --> 01:01:34,719
how much profit would be there for him

1997
01:01:32,159 --> 01:01:38,000
it's really all about the gardener

1998
01:01:34,719 --> 01:01:39,519
unlike income who i have respect

1999
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,119
for i don't have any reason you know

2000
01:01:39,519 --> 01:01:42,480
i've not been to her classes to say that

2001
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:43,599
they're bad or anything but she has a

2002
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,880
little bit more of a financial

2003
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:48,079
motivation

2004
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:51,440
um to the information being regarded as

2005
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:54,960
absolute truth and so when i talk to

2006
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:58,240
um and he mentions that

2007
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:59,920
um tad over keep it simple who

2008
01:01:58,239 --> 01:02:02,239
i think already did a podcast on this

2009
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:03,280
topic had studies going against that and

2010
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:04,959
that his father

2011
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:06,400
leon was actually mentioned in the

2012
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:09,280
ingham um

2013
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:10,798
intro as really as the as the creator or

2014
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:12,000
the inventor the first person to use

2015
01:02:10,798 --> 01:02:13,759
compost tea

2016
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,280
and the process that we discussed today

2017
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:17,359
and they are

2018
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:19,359
fully of the agreement that there is you

2019
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:21,119
know a benefit to using neem cake it

2020
01:02:19,358 --> 01:02:24,558
further convolutes the situation

2021
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:26,720
and so um i think that if i were to ask

2022
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:29,119
tim wilson if i were to asked

2023
01:02:26,719 --> 01:02:30,959
tad if i were to ask anybody that's been

2024
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:32,318
involved in this whole process

2025
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:34,000
a lot of times there's been a different

2026
01:02:32,318 --> 01:02:35,838
viewpoint in the exact opposite of what

2027
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,280
the online income camp says

2028
01:02:35,838 --> 01:02:39,358
what's so funny is both of these

2029
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:40,798
processes work you can use mean cake you

2030
01:02:39,358 --> 01:02:41,838
don't have to you can use molasses you

2031
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:43,519
can use fish

2032
01:02:41,838 --> 01:02:45,519
you could do anaerobic you could do

2033
01:02:43,519 --> 01:02:46,639
aerobic and i feel like we're still

2034
01:02:45,519 --> 01:02:49,838
seeing gardeners produce

2035
01:02:46,639 --> 01:02:52,318
killer results so um

2036
01:02:49,838 --> 01:02:53,599
as with anything in life does the person

2037
01:02:52,318 --> 01:02:54,880
you're following have the results you're

2038
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:57,599
looking for

2039
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:57,920
and if so do that if they don't don't do

2040
01:02:57,599 --> 01:02:59,599
that

2041
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:01,200
and what i can't find is people that are

2042
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:01,599
having crazy high fungal dominance

2043
01:03:01,199 --> 01:03:04,159
getting

2044
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:05,680
amazing crops and showing me that

2045
01:03:04,159 --> 01:03:07,598
they're superior than the other methods

2046
01:03:05,679 --> 01:03:09,038
of bacterial dominated soil and so i

2047
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:10,160
don't feel like it's a metric that's

2048
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:12,559
really worth investing

2049
01:03:10,159 --> 01:03:13,679
a lot of money into i think that quality

2050
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:15,599
compost will create

2051
01:03:13,679 --> 01:03:17,519
a quality result whatever balance that

2052
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:19,440
funnel of bacterial is is irrelevant to

2053
01:03:17,519 --> 01:03:21,920
me

2054
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:23,838
yeah fantastic and i remember i took a

2055
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:26,159
look into that myself and i think

2056
01:03:23,838 --> 01:03:27,920
tad and his dad were also some of the

2057
01:03:26,159 --> 01:03:29,279
first people to take like really high

2058
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:31,280
quality photos of

2059
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:32,480
like microscopic photos of the fungal

2060
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:34,480
tea and you know like actually be able

2061
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:36,079
to see the bacteria and stuff so

2062
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:37,760
they're definitely some dudes to listen

2063
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:39,599
to on the issue

2064
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:41,920
what i did like is you mentioned coot

2065
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:43,599
there and i've seen recently you know

2066
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:45,440
you guys have released your official

2067
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:47,039
koots line where you know like a little

2068
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:48,960
bit of that's going towards coots when

2069
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:51,520
someone buys it which is awesome

2070
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:52,079
it raised this idea in my mind do you

2071
01:03:51,519 --> 01:03:55,599
think

2072
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:55,920
um ku it's like as a recipe so to speak

2073
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:57,519
is

2074
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:59,519
it just a recipe or is it something he

2075
01:03:57,519 --> 01:04:00,480
can kind of claim ownership over in a

2076
01:03:59,519 --> 01:04:02,798
sense because

2077
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:04,318
i was thinking you could just try to

2078
01:04:02,798 --> 01:04:05,679
build a soil so to speak

2079
01:04:04,318 --> 01:04:06,880
and you just built it to what you think

2080
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:08,078
is pretty good and then someone comes

2081
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:09,760
along and they're like oh yeah that's

2082
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:10,960
like basically coot's mix

2083
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:12,799
and you know what i mean it's kind of

2084
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:14,480
like it's just kind of it seems to me

2085
01:04:12,798 --> 01:04:17,199
like it's almost just a name

2086
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:18,318
for a rough amount of amendments in a

2087
01:04:17,199 --> 01:04:20,639
soil you know what i mean it's almost

2088
01:04:18,318 --> 01:04:23,199
like a cake recipe you know it's like

2089
01:04:20,639 --> 01:04:23,838
and so it raised this idea in my mind of

2090
01:04:23,199 --> 01:04:26,639
like

2091
01:04:23,838 --> 01:04:28,960
yeah do you think it's like a name

2092
01:04:26,639 --> 01:04:30,000
recognition thing or an association

2093
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:32,000
thing like

2094
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,838
it's a weird topic you know like should

2095
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,000
should coot get compensated if someone

2096
01:04:33,838 --> 01:04:38,838
uses the name coot's mix or is it just

2097
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,239
in kind of the general domain at this

2098
01:04:38,838 --> 01:04:41,679
point

2099
01:04:40,239 --> 01:04:43,038
i think that he would say that he

2100
01:04:41,679 --> 01:04:44,558
doesn't take any right to any of that

2101
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:46,480
stuff that it's totally in the general

2102
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:49,519
domain he's regurgitating

2103
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:50,798
complete um information that was taken

2104
01:04:49,519 --> 01:04:53,280
from many other sources

2105
01:04:50,798 --> 01:04:55,280
and so build the soil as much as we

2106
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:57,599
could have a build a soil recipe

2107
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:58,640
it wouldn't be something that was mine

2108
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:00,798
and what i mean by that

2109
01:04:58,639 --> 01:05:02,400
is it's just a culmination of ideas and

2110
01:05:00,798 --> 01:05:05,038
what's so great about this is

2111
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:06,480
like he turned me on to the no need

2112
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:08,480
bread making process if you haven't

2113
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:09,519
looked into it go on youtube type in no

2114
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:11,440
need bread

2115
01:05:09,519 --> 01:05:13,119
and there's this guy uh artisan bread

2116
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:15,838
with stev or steve

2117
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:17,760
s-t-e-v on there you'll find it and just

2118
01:05:15,838 --> 01:05:19,519
the regular recipe is incredible

2119
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,880
it's just a little bit of flour a little

2120
01:05:19,519 --> 01:05:24,960
bit of salt water yeast

2121
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:26,960
and it's key is using thyme a 24 hour or

2122
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:28,720
12 hour eight hour you know at least

2123
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:30,240
overnight type of fermentation

2124
01:05:28,719 --> 01:05:32,639
and it makes one of the best breads i've

2125
01:05:30,239 --> 01:05:33,679
ever had it's just bread though is it

2126
01:05:32,639 --> 01:05:36,159
steve's bread

2127
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:38,078
no but it that term basically that no

2128
01:05:36,159 --> 01:05:38,639
need bread now points to him because he

2129
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:40,559
is the

2130
01:05:38,639 --> 01:05:42,159
one that has perpetuated sharing that

2131
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:44,640
information with everyone

2132
01:05:42,159 --> 01:05:45,199
so they could benefit from it and coot

2133
01:05:44,639 --> 01:05:47,679
took

2134
01:05:45,199 --> 01:05:49,358
uh the basic um you know solomon

2135
01:05:47,679 --> 01:05:51,199
three-way lime mix from steve solomon we

2136
01:05:49,358 --> 01:05:53,199
mentioned him with the dolomite and the

2137
01:05:51,199 --> 01:05:54,639
gypsum and the oyster shell or whatever

2138
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:56,719
the recipe was

2139
01:05:54,639 --> 01:05:59,199
and he put his own spin on it and he

2140
01:05:56,719 --> 01:06:01,038
took the recommended amounts of certain

2141
01:05:59,199 --> 01:06:02,960
dry amendments and played with him over

2142
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:04,480
time so if he followed lumper dogs and

2143
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:05,358
clackamas cute over the years in the

2144
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:07,039
forums

2145
01:06:05,358 --> 01:06:08,400
the coot's mix changed over time it was

2146
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:10,880
the coot's fix-it mix

2147
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:12,720
it was these different recommendations

2148
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:14,160
when build a soil started

2149
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:16,159
we tried a number of different soil

2150
01:06:14,159 --> 01:06:18,399
recipes what we found is that the

2151
01:06:16,159 --> 01:06:19,519
simpler recipe with the best compost

2152
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,519
always

2153
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:23,119
out produced as far as from a balance

2154
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:24,239
and you could you could certainly add to

2155
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:26,240
it what it needed

2156
01:06:24,239 --> 01:06:27,759
but if you started with an unbalanced

2157
01:06:26,239 --> 01:06:29,038
soil that just had the whole kitchen

2158
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:31,280
sink thrown in

2159
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:33,039
it didn't make for a better product so i

2160
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:35,119
guess what coot taught us was

2161
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:36,960
use critical thinking when finding

2162
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:38,640
premium ingredients that aren't wasteful

2163
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:41,440
as far as cost

2164
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:43,679
and then from there you cannot amend

2165
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:46,159
your way to a good soil so our coots

2166
01:06:43,679 --> 01:06:48,000
mixed is great but it is just amendments

2167
01:06:46,159 --> 01:06:49,759
you need the best compost

2168
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,440
and the amendments to marry this whole

2169
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:52,880
process together

2170
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:54,079
i certainly give him credit for the coot

2171
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:55,599
name and the reason why we're actually

2172
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:57,440
paying them a percentage is we feel like

2173
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:59,838
it's going to help us sell more

2174
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:01,519
in the sense that we want to instead of

2175
01:06:59,838 --> 01:07:02,639
everyone call whatever out there is a

2176
01:07:01,519 --> 01:07:04,719
coot's mix

2177
01:07:02,639 --> 01:07:07,199
we want the koots mix to be exactly what

2178
01:07:04,719 --> 01:07:09,519
we discussed what he helped us procure

2179
01:07:07,199 --> 01:07:11,279
and what i mean by that is if you mix

2180
01:07:09,519 --> 01:07:13,679
some crappy kelp from it from

2181
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:14,480
uh you know some random ocean and you

2182
01:07:13,679 --> 01:07:17,759
take some

2183
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:19,838
um seed meal and you take some

2184
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:21,680
you know run-of-the-mill rock dust and

2185
01:07:19,838 --> 01:07:22,960
you call it a coots mix

2186
01:07:21,679 --> 01:07:25,358
i don't think it's doing honor to the

2187
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:27,440
name and so that's why we wanted to make

2188
01:07:25,358 --> 01:07:29,038
sure that it's separated and highlighted

2189
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:30,639
it's also really great that we can pass

2190
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:33,599
on some financial

2191
01:07:30,639 --> 01:07:34,960
compensation to him mainly because he

2192
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:37,280
helps us behind the he

2193
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:39,119
behind the scenes so much still

2194
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:41,440
exercising these ideas running through

2195
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:45,039
processes looking at different composts

2196
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:47,200
talk to him several times a week and

2197
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:49,280
i just feel like he he gives so much

2198
01:07:47,199 --> 01:07:51,038
without ever asking that if this really

2199
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:51,519
does work and it can provide an income

2200
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:53,280
through him

2201
01:07:51,519 --> 01:07:55,199
through retirement i would feel like

2202
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:57,440
build a soil did something

2203
01:07:55,199 --> 01:07:58,239
and um we're not the only ones you know

2204
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,760
there's some other

2205
01:07:58,239 --> 01:08:01,358
people that i think are trying to find

2206
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:03,520
ways to support coot and

2207
01:08:01,358 --> 01:08:04,639
um i think anybody should support who

2208
01:08:03,519 --> 01:08:06,559
brought them to the party

2209
01:08:04,639 --> 01:08:08,078
and support who supported them when they

2210
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:10,559
didn't have anything

2211
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:11,599
and um coot that name and that

2212
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:14,400
association has done

2213
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:16,000
really well for us um i think partially

2214
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:17,759
because

2215
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,838
uh he's always been a part of my life as

2216
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:21,039
far as gardening and so it was authentic

2217
01:08:19,838 --> 01:08:23,679
it wasn't something we were just trying

2218
01:08:21,039 --> 01:08:26,719
to brand off of

2219
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:26,719
yeah really organic

2220
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:30,319
so and then the next thing was barley

2221
01:08:28,798 --> 01:08:32,238
was kind of the next evolution

2222
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:34,159
and then uh moving away from glacial

2223
01:08:32,238 --> 01:08:35,519
rock dust towards the basalt

2224
01:08:34,158 --> 01:08:37,519
so i feel like coot's mix is a little

2225
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:39,040
bit specific as far as where it's at but

2226
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:42,080
it'll probably be evolving even

2227
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:42,079
you know forward in the future

2228
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:46,318
without a doubt so one of the

2229
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:49,119
interesting posts i came across

2230
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:50,480
last night which i think some people

2231
01:08:49,119 --> 01:08:52,079
might be a little upset about in

2232
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:53,519
australia because it's

2233
01:08:52,079 --> 01:08:55,439
insect frass it's one of those things

2234
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:57,920
where people are really excited about it

2235
01:08:55,439 --> 01:08:59,678
but it's it's not widely available

2236
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:01,199
there's a few companies who are starting

2237
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:02,640
to produce some and a few people are

2238
01:09:01,198 --> 01:09:04,158
getting their hands on it but then i

2239
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:07,199
found your post

2240
01:09:04,158 --> 01:09:10,960
oh my god less than one percent cotton

2241
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:14,519
is it just a complete waste of time

2242
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:17,279
um maybe but i think that any you know

2243
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:18,080
biologically natural waste product has

2244
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:20,400
some benefit

2245
01:09:18,079 --> 01:09:22,238
the challenge is is i feel like if you

2246
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:24,000
get a sales person a scientist together

2247
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:25,678
and you just start researching the

2248
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,479
chemical makeup of any product you can

2249
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:28,960
come up with some

2250
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:30,399
benefits to it you know when i was a kid

2251
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:31,359
i remember those cereal commercials that

2252
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:33,920
would say it'll take

2253
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:36,319
12 bowls of this cereal to equal one of

2254
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:38,000
this you're like yeah for iron i mean

2255
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:39,440
it's not exactly an apple apples

2256
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,960
comparison and

2257
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:44,238
so um it's just important

2258
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:46,798
i think to keep that in mind does that

2259
01:09:44,238 --> 01:09:48,000
make sense yeah well i mean outside of

2260
01:09:46,798 --> 01:09:50,960
insect frass then what

2261
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:53,359
is a source to get some actual existent

2262
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:56,158
chitin from

2263
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:56,719
well um we have a product that is one of

2264
01:09:56,158 --> 01:09:59,039
the first

2265
01:09:56,719 --> 01:10:01,119
you know documentable guaranteed titan

2266
01:09:59,039 --> 01:10:03,679
products so we're interested in that

2267
01:10:01,119 --> 01:10:05,439
um but crustacean meal has titan in it

2268
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:07,279
the manufacturer of the chitin product

2269
01:10:05,439 --> 01:10:07,839
we use makes it from a consortium of

2270
01:10:07,279 --> 01:10:10,000
ground up

2271
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:11,520
insects and so what that's interesting

2272
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,119
is that normally we would buy the waste

2273
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:14,880
products so you have an insect farm

2274
01:10:13,119 --> 01:10:17,119
they sell insects to you know pet

2275
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:19,440
companies and people that use insects

2276
01:10:17,119 --> 01:10:21,599
for all these different purposes

2277
01:10:19,439 --> 01:10:23,439
all the waste is considered a frass that

2278
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:25,520
frost is now sold as

2279
01:10:23,439 --> 01:10:26,879
a product and so the frost is more about

2280
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:28,480
the waste it's not about the production

2281
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:30,239
but the insects are and so

2282
01:10:28,479 --> 01:10:32,559
this product called optive edge that we

2283
01:10:30,238 --> 01:10:33,439
carry is an 8.1 percent i believe is the

2284
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:34,880
number

2285
01:10:33,439 --> 01:10:37,198
of chitin and that's because they

2286
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:38,960
actually micronize the insects not the

2287
01:10:37,198 --> 01:10:39,919
waste and the waste has such a low

2288
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:43,279
amount of

2289
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:44,640
um actual titan is because the

2290
01:10:43,279 --> 01:10:46,079
titan comes from the insect and so

2291
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:47,920
there's a little bit of dead material

2292
01:10:46,079 --> 01:10:49,279
along with the waste and that determines

2293
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:51,600
the variable amount of kite

2294
01:10:49,279 --> 01:10:53,599
in the insect grass now it's still a

2295
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:54,880
waste product like a guano or like a

2296
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:55,760
chicken manure or anything else so

2297
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:57,520
there's some

2298
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:59,920
there's some value and it's typically

2299
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:01,280
that the input material whatever is

2300
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:02,800
feeding these bugs was going to be

2301
01:11:01,279 --> 01:11:05,359
micronized and made slightly more

2302
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:07,360
bioavailable by working it through a bug

2303
01:11:05,359 --> 01:11:09,920
so there again is this theme instead of

2304
01:11:07,359 --> 01:11:10,238
taking raw minerals or raw materials we

2305
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:11,920
feed

2306
01:11:10,238 --> 01:11:13,599
them either through warm bins through

2307
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:16,480
animals through bugs

2308
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:18,400
and we get a more bioavailable closer to

2309
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:20,079
a plant form of food

2310
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:21,759
and that is faster to work through the

2311
01:11:20,079 --> 01:11:23,840
soil food web so

2312
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:25,039
insect frass has total viability in fact

2313
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,760
one of the places we're looking at right

2314
01:11:25,039 --> 01:11:27,359
now is

2315
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:29,280
we found a place in canada it's pretty

2316
01:11:27,359 --> 01:11:31,359
far away but the size of their facility

2317
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:33,920
and their ability to create a product

2318
01:11:31,359 --> 01:11:35,920
from a waste makes it still lower cost

2319
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:37,199
than what we can find locally

2320
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:39,440
and the frass they produce is from

2321
01:11:37,198 --> 01:11:41,279
soldier flies and they actually recycle

2322
01:11:39,439 --> 01:11:43,119
a ton of organic waste just tons of

2323
01:11:41,279 --> 01:11:44,238
produce and bad lettuce and vegetables

2324
01:11:43,119 --> 01:11:45,679
and everything else

2325
01:11:44,238 --> 01:11:47,678
and it gets worked by these soldier

2326
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:48,880
flies our soldier fly larva are

2327
01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:51,199
you know very unfamiliar with the

2328
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:52,480
process it turns it into a frass we just

2329
01:11:51,198 --> 01:11:52,879
got our first sample and we're looking

2330
01:11:52,479 --> 01:11:54,959
at it

2331
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:56,079
so i think that instead of just paying a

2332
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:59,840
top dollar for

2333
01:11:56,079 --> 01:12:01,039
a a new bandwagon type product

2334
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:02,719
i think that'd be more important if

2335
01:12:01,039 --> 01:12:04,238
we're after kite get a chitin product if

2336
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:07,600
we just want a

2337
01:12:04,238 --> 01:12:09,519
kind of a vegan waste product because

2338
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:11,199
these insects are feeding on vegetables

2339
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:12,960
instead of animal material

2340
01:12:11,198 --> 01:12:14,639
it probably has some value but if it's

2341
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:16,079
super expensive it's

2342
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:17,760
it would be better if it was recycling

2343
01:12:16,079 --> 01:12:19,359
or waste locally and you can get it at a

2344
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:21,199
cost effective price

2345
01:12:19,359 --> 01:12:23,599
and so we didn't add frass to any of our

2346
01:12:21,198 --> 01:12:25,839
new recipes it's kept as

2347
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:27,039
kind of a side product that we use and

2348
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:29,119
recommendation to

2349
01:12:27,039 --> 01:12:30,719
get an ecosystem so what i mean by that

2350
01:12:29,119 --> 01:12:32,640
is when you're top dressing you're

2351
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:34,079
putting worms in you get an ecosystem

2352
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:36,640
going to me it would make sense to put

2353
01:12:34,079 --> 01:12:38,079
some dead bugs and some insect waste and

2354
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:39,440
and all of these things that might build

2355
01:12:38,079 --> 01:12:41,840
the ecosystem without actually

2356
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:42,960
introducing live bugs and problems for

2357
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:45,039
our type of growing

2358
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:45,039
so

2359
01:12:46,399 --> 01:12:50,000
so you mentioned canada just there are

2360
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:52,560
you gonna look

2361
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:54,800
to expand to possibly worldwide shipping

2362
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:55,600
now that you guys have got canada sorted

2363
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:57,279
because i've

2364
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:59,199
had a few questions from people who

2365
01:12:57,279 --> 01:13:01,920
would consider getting some stuff even

2366
01:12:59,198 --> 01:13:03,359
here in australia

2367
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:05,279
um yeah we're actually working on that

2368
01:13:03,359 --> 01:13:07,920
right now we've got um

2369
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:09,679
our logistics team is we're growing as a

2370
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:11,119
company and so that allows us to focus

2371
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:12,640
on projects that would have taken too

2372
01:13:11,119 --> 01:13:14,800
much time away from the day

2373
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:16,480
to day and so as we go through each

2374
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:18,400
winter which is slightly slower than the

2375
01:13:16,479 --> 01:13:20,319
chaos of the springtime

2376
01:13:18,399 --> 01:13:22,399
it allows us to grow and expand and so

2377
01:13:20,319 --> 01:13:23,439
we're looking at worldwide shipping

2378
01:13:22,399 --> 01:13:24,960
i don't know how soon it'll become

2379
01:13:23,439 --> 01:13:26,399
available and it'll be on key products

2380
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:28,399
that make sense that are lightweight

2381
01:13:26,399 --> 01:13:30,079
that may have some viability

2382
01:13:28,399 --> 01:13:31,519
and i want to be careful not to just

2383
01:13:30,079 --> 01:13:32,000
start shipping stuff all over the world

2384
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:35,280
for

2385
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,719
you know no purpose but it's interesting

2386
01:13:35,279 --> 01:13:38,079
you start working as a cust

2387
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:40,000
as a company and someone calls you and

2388
01:13:38,079 --> 01:13:40,479
says look it i just want to play with

2389
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,640
this

2390
01:13:40,479 --> 01:13:44,079
titan product i have no way to get it

2391
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:45,119
locally no one's ever going to make it

2392
01:13:44,079 --> 01:13:47,840
here there's no

2393
01:13:45,119 --> 01:13:49,279
reason to yet um without waiting 10

2394
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:51,039
years for someone to do it can you just

2395
01:13:49,279 --> 01:13:52,800
ship me a small amount so i can satisfy

2396
01:13:51,039 --> 01:13:53,439
my curiosity and i'm like yeah i'd love

2397
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:55,760
to do that

2398
01:13:53,439 --> 01:13:58,079
and it makes sense but there's tariff

2399
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:59,360
codes and there's import fees and taxes

2400
01:13:58,079 --> 01:14:00,000
and there's all these hoops to jump

2401
01:13:59,359 --> 01:14:01,519
through so

2402
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,359
we're getting very close we've been able

2403
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:05,360
to ship to canada recently and very

2404
01:14:03,359 --> 01:14:07,759
accurately predict the fees and make it

2405
01:14:05,359 --> 01:14:09,198
a good experience for our customer so as

2406
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:10,320
we're more confident that we're not

2407
01:14:09,198 --> 01:14:12,319
going to just

2408
01:14:10,319 --> 01:14:13,840
cause customer service nightmares we're

2409
01:14:12,319 --> 01:14:15,439
going to start rolling that out and i'd

2410
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:16,560
love to look at australia

2411
01:14:15,439 --> 01:14:18,000
as you and i both know the shipping

2412
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:19,440
costs are just outrageous but i think

2413
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,158
that for the hobbyist and for the

2414
01:14:19,439 --> 01:14:22,319
enthusiast

2415
01:14:20,158 --> 01:14:24,079
a couple of products um it actually

2416
01:14:22,319 --> 01:14:25,279
might it might work and

2417
01:14:24,079 --> 01:14:27,439
i know there's products in other

2418
01:14:25,279 --> 01:14:29,759
countries that i'd love to play with and

2419
01:14:27,439 --> 01:14:31,919
maybe as a cool gift idea even and maybe

2420
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:33,360
not as like a sustainable practice so

2421
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:35,199
we'll see

2422
01:14:33,359 --> 01:14:36,399
just as like an overarching question

2423
01:14:35,198 --> 01:14:37,678
because this one you could probably

2424
01:14:36,399 --> 01:14:39,439
answer it forever

2425
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:41,600
do you feel as though we're slowly

2426
01:14:39,439 --> 01:14:44,559
moving towards like how should we say

2427
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:44,880
like a homogenized growing style that

2428
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:46,719
will

2429
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:48,079
be eventually quite specific for

2430
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:49,039
cannabis in that you know at the moment

2431
01:14:48,079 --> 01:14:50,800
it feels like

2432
01:14:49,039 --> 01:14:53,679
people are incorporating you know bits

2433
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:54,800
of knf you know coot's recipe

2434
01:14:53,679 --> 01:14:56,640
a whole bunch of other little

2435
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:58,400
supplements here and there do you think

2436
01:14:56,640 --> 01:15:01,039
after a long enough period of time

2437
01:14:58,399 --> 01:15:02,719
we might have our own kind of growth

2438
01:15:01,039 --> 01:15:04,238
style you know like the canadial

2439
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:05,600
type thing you know just some word like

2440
01:15:04,238 --> 01:15:06,959
that where it's yeah it's just you know

2441
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:08,719
borrowing principles from a whole bunch

2442
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:11,840
of other things to the point where

2443
01:15:08,719 --> 01:15:11,840
it's almost its own thing

2444
01:15:12,238 --> 01:15:15,039
i don't know i think the reason why i

2445
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:16,560
don't think that that's necessarily

2446
01:15:15,039 --> 01:15:19,198
going to be coined is that

2447
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:21,120
um we've stolen from so many other

2448
01:15:19,198 --> 01:15:22,079
processes it seems like anybody at the

2449
01:15:21,119 --> 01:15:24,719
forefront of

2450
01:15:22,079 --> 01:15:26,559
production like any world record pumpkin

2451
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:28,079
grow or world record tomato grower or

2452
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:30,719
somebody who's into gardening

2453
01:15:28,079 --> 01:15:32,000
we've all come to the same answers

2454
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:33,840
taking a different path

2455
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,600
and same with cannabis growers i think

2456
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:37,039
the difference is the amount of time

2457
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:38,800
and money we're willing to invest in

2458
01:15:37,039 --> 01:15:41,679
this crop and so

2459
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:43,600
um where it may become coined is when we

2460
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:44,719
look at production

2461
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:46,239
if we were going to do acreage

2462
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:47,039
production and you were to call for

2463
01:15:46,238 --> 01:15:48,799
instance

2464
01:15:47,039 --> 01:15:50,960
for instance like a local co-op or a

2465
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:52,719
local farmer's outfit that would

2466
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:54,640
give you pricing on fertilizer for your

2467
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:56,079
corn or whatever's grown traditionally

2468
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:59,039
in your area

2469
01:15:56,079 --> 01:16:00,319
um i'd imagine we'll have a line drawn

2470
01:15:59,039 --> 01:16:00,960
in the sand where they say hey are you

2471
01:16:00,319 --> 01:16:02,319
grown

2472
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:04,158
you know cannabis style or are you

2473
01:16:02,319 --> 01:16:05,519
growing you know regular style and the

2474
01:16:04,158 --> 01:16:07,439
difference there would be

2475
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:09,440
you know the ability to spend thousand

2476
01:16:07,439 --> 01:16:11,119
dollars an acre versus 50 bucks an acre

2477
01:16:09,439 --> 01:16:12,079
because of the actual end use of the

2478
01:16:11,119 --> 01:16:14,158
product

2479
01:16:12,079 --> 01:16:15,679
so i feel like any time you have a

2480
01:16:14,158 --> 01:16:17,198
really high cash crop you're going to

2481
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:18,880
see similar practices where we're just

2482
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:19,599
trying to maximize the yield and the

2483
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:22,719
quality

2484
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:24,079
because those would be important um but

2485
01:16:22,719 --> 01:16:25,439
to me that's permaculture

2486
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:27,439
i don't really think we're gonna have to

2487
01:16:25,439 --> 01:16:29,119
coin something new

2488
01:16:27,439 --> 01:16:31,839
yeah i almost figure it'll probably just

2489
01:16:29,119 --> 01:16:34,000
be continually evolving anyway

2490
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:35,440
so something that i have noticed though

2491
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,719
which i'm not sure whether it actually

2492
01:16:35,439 --> 01:16:38,719
works i wanted to run it by

2493
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:40,560
i've seen people using like various

2494
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:42,719
dehydrating machines

2495
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:44,159
and using vegetable waste most notably

2496
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:45,359
banana skins

2497
01:16:44,158 --> 01:16:47,439
and so then they'll have like you know

2498
01:16:45,359 --> 01:16:49,759
these really dehydrated banana skin

2499
01:16:47,439 --> 01:16:51,519
they then grind it up mix it in the soil

2500
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:55,199
and i was like that's so simple and so

2501
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:57,040
brilliant but does it actually work

2502
01:16:55,198 --> 01:16:58,879
that's interesting i've never you know

2503
01:16:57,039 --> 01:17:00,479
considered doing that to me it fits one

2504
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:02,880
of the processes that we talked about

2505
01:17:00,479 --> 01:17:04,879
and so i like to think of things

2506
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:06,079
in groups and then it's easier to think

2507
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:07,760
about so we talk

2508
01:17:06,079 --> 01:17:09,600
you know the fulvic acid over here

2509
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:10,960
aminos over here these are all things

2510
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:12,079
that lower energy

2511
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:14,239
one of the steps that we talked about

2512
01:17:12,079 --> 01:17:14,640
was micronization so you take products

2513
01:17:14,238 --> 01:17:16,319
that are

2514
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:17,760
nutrient dense you micronize them and

2515
01:17:16,319 --> 01:17:20,559
they're more available

2516
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:21,520
to me in a no-till situation all of

2517
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:23,520
those micronized

2518
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:25,040
products are not available to the plant

2519
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:26,000
until they're processed through the soil

2520
01:17:25,039 --> 01:17:28,560
food web

2521
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:30,800
so similarly that we mix alfalfa meal

2522
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:32,960
the fact that we mix in neem seed meal

2523
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:34,960
all of those are just more affordable

2524
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:36,319
waste products that make sense to use as

2525
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:37,760
a fertilizer

2526
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:39,439
nobody says you can't do the same thing

2527
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:40,320
with freeze dried expensive high-end

2528
01:17:39,439 --> 01:17:42,639
products

2529
01:17:40,319 --> 01:17:44,079
or waste products of your own so it

2530
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:46,719
totally makes sense

2531
01:17:44,079 --> 01:17:48,079
um i think that um the difference would

2532
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:50,079
be i'd probably use some of those

2533
01:17:48,079 --> 01:17:52,079
amendments more like a worm food in my

2534
01:17:50,079 --> 01:17:53,920
mulch layer so they could then make them

2535
01:17:52,079 --> 01:17:58,000
available to the plant

2536
01:17:53,920 --> 01:18:00,319
and it i always find myself

2537
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:02,319
getting infatuated with wanting to learn

2538
01:18:00,319 --> 01:18:04,238
more about how to be in control

2539
01:18:02,319 --> 01:18:06,880
and give them nutrients when they need

2540
01:18:04,238 --> 01:18:09,198
it and really treat the plants

2541
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:10,319
really well through that soil by feeding

2542
01:18:09,198 --> 01:18:12,799
it the best

2543
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:14,639
stuff on earth whatever that may be

2544
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:16,480
purple barley and banana

2545
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:18,320
peeled freeze-dried and all this and

2546
01:18:16,479 --> 01:18:19,678
korean natural farming

2547
01:18:18,319 --> 01:18:22,238
but i feel like that's just because we

2548
01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:23,840
all love this end result we love the

2549
01:18:22,238 --> 01:18:25,519
process we love the plants we want to

2550
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:27,440
continually be working towards them and

2551
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:29,280
doing something for it

2552
01:18:27,439 --> 01:18:31,439
i don't i don't know if necessarily the

2553
01:18:29,279 --> 01:18:33,359
plant cares that it's banana peels or if

2554
01:18:31,439 --> 01:18:35,279
it's self alpha meal or if it's you know

2555
01:18:33,359 --> 01:18:36,639
some other source of that nutrient

2556
01:18:35,279 --> 01:18:38,479
and at a certain point we're getting

2557
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:40,480
away from the fact that

2558
01:18:38,479 --> 01:18:42,319
um keeping above that limiting factor

2559
01:18:40,479 --> 01:18:43,439
keeping the soil aerated keeping it

2560
01:18:42,319 --> 01:18:45,279
ability to

2561
01:18:43,439 --> 01:18:47,119
deliver nutrients keeping everything

2562
01:18:45,279 --> 01:18:48,639
watered properly the environment

2563
01:18:47,119 --> 01:18:50,158
at certain at a certain point all these

2564
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:50,800
things are much more important than the

2565
01:18:50,158 --> 01:18:54,719
exact

2566
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:56,000
source of the npk the micronutrients and

2567
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:56,960
all those things that will be delivered

2568
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,399
to the plant

2569
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:00,000
and that's why we had that discussion

2570
01:18:58,399 --> 01:19:01,198
about is it better that it's organic or

2571
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,640
is it more important that it doesn't

2572
01:19:01,198 --> 01:19:04,158
hurt the earth because

2573
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:07,119
at the end of the day it gets broken

2574
01:19:04,158 --> 01:19:08,960
down through the soil food web

2575
01:19:07,119 --> 01:19:10,960
into basically a chemical form of

2576
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:13,279
nutrient the difference is that delivery

2577
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:16,319
method being carbon

2578
01:19:13,279 --> 01:19:18,559
for organics and i think that cannabis

2579
01:19:16,319 --> 01:19:20,840
being a c4 plant it just makes so much

2580
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:22,400
sense that organics is the best way to

2581
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:24,560
go

2582
01:19:22,399 --> 01:19:25,439
so with that being said what do you

2583
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:27,920
think is

2584
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:29,759
the big difference between worm castings

2585
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:31,199
and say like a high quality compost are

2586
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:33,280
they are they equal or

2587
01:19:31,198 --> 01:19:35,039
you know i guess we've been alluding to

2588
01:19:33,279 --> 01:19:36,000
the idea that the castings is going to

2589
01:19:35,039 --> 01:19:38,719
be your best bet

2590
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,439
so you know what what makes it better

2591
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:41,600
ultimately

2592
01:19:39,439 --> 01:19:43,599
and for people out there who maybe don't

2593
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:45,440
have a good bulk supplier

2594
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:46,640
do you think it still justifies the cost

2595
01:19:45,439 --> 01:19:48,238
of because often it can be

2596
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:51,440
a fair bit more expensive you know than

2597
01:19:48,238 --> 01:19:53,678
just regular compost

2598
01:19:51,439 --> 01:19:55,359
uh no i think it's not worth the money i

2599
01:19:53,679 --> 01:19:56,880
think that they're worth the money if

2600
01:19:55,359 --> 01:19:58,000
you know the quality is there the

2601
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:00,159
problem is is that

2602
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:02,319
just like compost it can be made from

2603
01:20:00,158 --> 01:20:03,679
anything compost doesn't need anything

2604
01:20:02,319 --> 01:20:06,238
it's just a generic term

2605
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:07,920
worm castings doesn't mean anything

2606
01:20:06,238 --> 01:20:11,119
oftentimes you'll find people feeding

2607
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:12,319
uh really low end products and purina

2608
01:20:11,119 --> 01:20:13,760
worm chow and

2609
01:20:12,319 --> 01:20:15,599
just kind of the bare minimum to the

2610
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:17,280
worms or they're producing worms for

2611
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:17,679
fishing and the castings are a waste

2612
01:20:17,279 --> 01:20:20,158
they have

2613
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:21,119
no thought into what goes into it at

2614
01:20:20,158 --> 01:20:24,158
home you can

2615
01:20:21,119 --> 01:20:25,599
uh recycle waste like newspaper and

2616
01:20:24,158 --> 01:20:28,638
stuff or you could actually

2617
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:31,520
feed thermophilic compost with premium

2618
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:32,079
plant materials and be actually after

2619
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:34,080
creating

2620
01:20:32,079 --> 01:20:35,439
the perfect compost or for you the

2621
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:36,639
perfect compost

2622
01:20:35,439 --> 01:20:38,238
and so there's always going to be

2623
01:20:36,639 --> 01:20:39,679
quality differences the difference with

2624
01:20:38,238 --> 01:20:41,759
worm castings is they're always

2625
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:43,359
expensive and they're always

2626
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:44,639
and they're often not the same quality

2627
01:20:43,359 --> 01:20:46,238
and so if you find a good source you

2628
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:46,880
know what their feedstock is and you

2629
01:20:46,238 --> 01:20:48,399
like them

2630
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:50,000
they're probably worth the money but a

2631
01:20:48,399 --> 01:20:51,359
lot of times once you find that quality

2632
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,198
casting and they're produced in volume

2633
01:20:51,359 --> 01:20:55,519
they're not as expensive as the

2634
01:20:53,198 --> 01:20:56,319
the um the lower quality stuff that's

2635
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:58,400
bagged up

2636
01:20:56,319 --> 01:20:59,679
and produced in large scale and so at

2637
01:20:58,399 --> 01:21:00,638
your house i would really encourage you

2638
01:20:59,679 --> 01:21:02,000
to um

2639
01:21:00,639 --> 01:21:03,359
start set up your own warm bin i think

2640
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,319
it's the biggest difference maker in an

2641
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:06,479
organic garden

2642
01:21:04,319 --> 01:21:07,679
it allows you to get worms for a much

2643
01:21:06,479 --> 01:21:09,759
lower cost and put them in your

2644
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:12,800
containers from your own warm bin

2645
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:14,320
you breed this um consortium of predator

2646
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:15,679
mites and rogue beetles and all these

2647
01:21:14,319 --> 01:21:18,319
things start to come together and they

2648
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:21,279
help complete that no-till ecosystem

2649
01:21:18,319 --> 01:21:22,158
um but beyond that you also have some

2650
01:21:21,279 --> 01:21:24,238
extras so

2651
01:21:22,158 --> 01:21:26,638
if i was just gonna get high quality

2652
01:21:24,238 --> 01:21:28,238
compost or high quality castings

2653
01:21:26,639 --> 01:21:30,159
the difference to me is that castings

2654
01:21:28,238 --> 01:21:32,079
are typically a lot more

2655
01:21:30,158 --> 01:21:33,679
bang for the buck and you can make teas

2656
01:21:32,079 --> 01:21:36,399
from them that go further they're more

2657
01:21:33,679 --> 01:21:38,560
nutrient dense and so we learned a while

2658
01:21:36,399 --> 01:21:39,759
ago following coot's recipe of using you

2659
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:42,719
know one-third

2660
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:43,760
castings was just a recipe for failure

2661
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:46,639
when it came to

2662
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:48,320
the available castings on the market

2663
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:49,760
they're just too salty or they're too

2664
01:21:48,319 --> 01:21:51,519
rich in potassium or

2665
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:53,920
some ingredient based on how they're

2666
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:55,840
produced where using such a high volume

2667
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:58,079
produces a lot of issues at least in the

2668
01:21:55,840 --> 01:22:00,079
beginning his vermicompost is very

2669
01:21:58,079 --> 01:22:02,079
different it takes a long time to make

2670
01:22:00,079 --> 01:22:03,279
and it's it's produced from materials

2671
01:22:02,079 --> 01:22:04,158
that he has knowledge of and it's

2672
01:22:03,279 --> 01:22:05,840
balanced

2673
01:22:04,158 --> 01:22:07,759
and it's produced with the end result of

2674
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:08,560
of having that and so he can do it at

2675
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:10,320
the higher

2676
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:11,600
high volume that he does and have really

2677
01:22:10,319 --> 01:22:13,279
really good results

2678
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:15,280
and you'll experience that also at home

2679
01:22:13,279 --> 01:22:16,719
if you're able to make your own castings

2680
01:22:15,279 --> 01:22:18,319
also we keep going back to this thing

2681
01:22:16,719 --> 01:22:20,319
where we're talking about micronization

2682
01:22:18,319 --> 01:22:21,359
you take worms and you work with compost

2683
01:22:20,319 --> 01:22:23,519
it's going to be a

2684
01:22:21,359 --> 01:22:25,519
smaller end result the red wigglers that

2685
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:27,679
we prefer we'll break it down into very

2686
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:28,800
very small pieces of individual castings

2687
01:22:27,679 --> 01:22:30,719
each one of those

2688
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:32,320
coated in calcium carbonate which is

2689
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:33,279
part of that balance in the soil and

2690
01:22:32,319 --> 01:22:36,158
coated in

2691
01:22:33,279 --> 01:22:38,158
bacteria and enzymes and secondary

2692
01:22:36,158 --> 01:22:40,559
metabolites from the plants that we fed

2693
01:22:38,158 --> 01:22:41,920
through it and that is all richer a

2694
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:44,159
thermophilic compost which

2695
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:45,520
can destroy a lot of those benefits so

2696
01:22:44,158 --> 01:22:48,079
the two complement each other

2697
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:48,719
i think they're best used in combination

2698
01:22:48,079 --> 01:22:50,158
and

2699
01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:51,920
when you don't have the budget for the

2700
01:22:50,158 --> 01:22:53,359
castings it makes sense that if you just

2701
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:55,679
put worms in the container you're going

2702
01:22:53,359 --> 01:22:57,359
to make your own castings on demand

2703
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:59,359
and if you can set up your own worm bin

2704
01:22:57,359 --> 01:23:00,000
you can just work more affordable

2705
01:22:59,359 --> 01:23:03,039
compost

2706
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:05,279
into castings and so i think that

2707
01:23:03,039 --> 01:23:06,639
from a budget perspective when we work

2708
01:23:05,279 --> 01:23:08,479
with larger scale we just don't see

2709
01:23:06,639 --> 01:23:10,560
people buying twenty thousand dollars of

2710
01:23:08,479 --> 01:23:12,319
castings to do the luxury top dresses

2711
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:14,159
and teas non-stop

2712
01:23:12,319 --> 01:23:15,920
because uh you get very good results for

2713
01:23:14,158 --> 01:23:20,079
the quality compost and then you can put

2714
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:23,520
worms right in the container

2715
01:23:20,079 --> 01:23:24,880
so a question people have been asking me

2716
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:26,800
a lot and i don't have a very good

2717
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:29,600
answer for them is

2718
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:30,560
fabric pots versus those plastic smart

2719
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:32,400
pots

2720
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:33,920
i got some people who say to me they

2721
01:23:32,399 --> 01:23:35,519
think the plastic smart pots are better

2722
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:36,880
because it's like easy to use because

2723
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:38,960
a lot of the complaints around fabric

2724
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:40,639
pots are how you know like if you water

2725
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:42,079
them sometimes it comes out the side and

2726
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:43,279
it's not actually penetrating down as

2727
01:23:42,079 --> 01:23:45,600
well as you'd like

2728
01:23:43,279 --> 01:23:47,359
and i always reply to that saying to me

2729
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:48,960
that sounds like you just need to become

2730
01:23:47,359 --> 01:23:50,238
a little more familiar with how to use

2731
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:51,359
them i understand the problem you're

2732
01:23:50,238 --> 01:23:53,198
discussing but

2733
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:54,399
i think over time you'll learn to avoid

2734
01:23:53,198 --> 01:23:56,319
that and kind of

2735
01:23:54,399 --> 01:23:58,000
learn to water better within them

2736
01:23:56,319 --> 01:23:59,519
however the plastic pots they avoid that

2737
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:01,119
issue because

2738
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:03,120
there's all the holes on the outside of

2739
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:04,800
them but uh the top ones

2740
01:24:03,119 --> 01:24:06,238
there's no holes so the water has to

2741
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:07,279
penetrate down first before it even has

2742
01:24:06,238 --> 01:24:09,439
a chance to

2743
01:24:07,279 --> 01:24:10,960
leak out the sides have you got any

2744
01:24:09,439 --> 01:24:12,960
opinions on these ones like do you think

2745
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:15,279
fabric's better than plastic smart pots

2746
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:17,920
what's your thoughts

2747
01:24:15,279 --> 01:24:19,439
um yeah i i i definitely have an opinion

2748
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:22,319
there mine's similar to yours

2749
01:24:19,439 --> 01:24:24,000
to be clear i think so the plast out

2750
01:24:22,319 --> 01:24:26,158
here the smart pot is a brand from high

2751
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:28,158
caliber and they're a fabric pot

2752
01:24:26,158 --> 01:24:29,439
and so the plastic smart pot that you're

2753
01:24:28,158 --> 01:24:31,439
mentioning like a

2754
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:33,439
not a recycled plastic but like a hard

2755
01:24:31,439 --> 01:24:35,919
black nursery pot right

2756
01:24:33,439 --> 01:24:37,759
yeah it's got these like the the concave

2757
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:39,600
and convex ridges around the outside

2758
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:42,000
with the holes in them

2759
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:43,920
yeah i've used all sorts of things and

2760
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,479
i've used plastic pots and i don't think

2761
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:45,920
that there's a

2762
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:47,919
really an issue there but i'll highlight

2763
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:48,480
on a couple subjects um one of them

2764
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:50,639
being

2765
01:24:48,479 --> 01:24:52,718
agronomists i talked to and the top soil

2766
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:55,039
and that and the microbial life

2767
01:24:52,719 --> 01:24:56,399
and ingum and a lot of the stuff we've

2768
01:24:55,039 --> 01:24:58,399
talked about

2769
01:24:56,399 --> 01:25:00,000
that conversation revolves around uh

2770
01:24:58,399 --> 01:25:02,399
aerobic activity

2771
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,000
and that means more oxygen than than not

2772
01:25:02,399 --> 01:25:05,839
or air in the soil and so that can be

2773
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,319
done by having a highly aerated mix and

2774
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:08,719
having

2775
01:25:06,319 --> 01:25:09,759
soil texture that allows oxygen to stay

2776
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:11,600
in there and

2777
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:13,360
the porosity of the drainage or the

2778
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:15,520
aeration material

2779
01:25:13,359 --> 01:25:16,719
but to add to that when you're trying to

2780
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:18,639
create this

2781
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:20,079
larger soil which one of the problems

2782
01:25:18,639 --> 01:25:21,440
can be over watering

2783
01:25:20,079 --> 01:25:22,880
it makes sense to have a fabric

2784
01:25:21,439 --> 01:25:23,599
container that allows you to air prune

2785
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:25,679
the roots

2786
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:27,280
and create that benefit where it doesn't

2787
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:29,359
wrap around where it actually

2788
01:25:27,279 --> 01:25:31,039
air prunes and sin sends a signal for

2789
01:25:29,359 --> 01:25:33,519
new root root growth

2790
01:25:31,039 --> 01:25:35,039
but it also makes sense because um the

2791
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:36,960
air that it let in through the sides it

2792
01:25:35,039 --> 01:25:39,519
creates this diversity of moisture

2793
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:41,198
zones and like you mentioned once you

2794
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:41,760
start using either a wetting agent or

2795
01:25:41,198 --> 01:25:44,238
watering

2796
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:44,960
properly slowly more often whatever it

2797
01:25:44,238 --> 01:25:46,638
takes

2798
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:48,319
um you'll stop that running out the side

2799
01:25:46,639 --> 01:25:50,239
it won't be an issue whatsoever

2800
01:25:48,319 --> 01:25:52,000
and if it does happen it'll more

2801
01:25:50,238 --> 01:25:53,599
importantly highlight

2802
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,439
that you're actually getting dry pockets

2803
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:57,199
and there may be a bigger issue and it's

2804
01:25:55,439 --> 01:25:58,399
time that you slow down and water

2805
01:25:57,198 --> 01:26:00,319
properly because you're

2806
01:25:58,399 --> 01:26:01,519
cutting corners and now all of a sudden

2807
01:26:00,319 --> 01:26:03,198
it's running out of the side of your of

2808
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:05,199
your fabric pot

2809
01:26:03,198 --> 01:26:06,559
um when i have a really good grow and

2810
01:26:05,198 --> 01:26:07,839
things are going really well

2811
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:09,679
it seems that's never an issue because

2812
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:11,760
i've been tending to it so often

2813
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:13,440
that the slow watering the constant

2814
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:15,199
tension means that it's at an even

2815
01:26:13,439 --> 01:26:17,439
moisture level the whole time

2816
01:26:15,198 --> 01:26:18,559
and around the edges it's slightly drier

2817
01:26:17,439 --> 01:26:20,638
and there's this

2818
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:22,239
like root pruning that happens and i

2819
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:23,279
feel like that's why a larger container

2820
01:26:22,238 --> 01:26:26,479
does work

2821
01:26:23,279 --> 01:26:28,559
um and also when i'm

2822
01:26:26,479 --> 01:26:29,759
vermicomposting using that breathable

2823
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:31,199
container means the worms are going to

2824
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:33,039
be more alive

2825
01:26:31,198 --> 01:26:34,319
the biology is going to be more aerobic

2826
01:26:33,039 --> 01:26:36,399
and it's not going to ferment on

2827
01:26:34,319 --> 01:26:38,079
accident or kill all the worms

2828
01:26:36,399 --> 01:26:40,319
and so i feel like it gives you an

2829
01:26:38,079 --> 01:26:42,559
advantage it does have disadvantages you

2830
01:26:40,319 --> 01:26:44,639
know out here in colorado it's super dry

2831
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:46,080
and so outdoors if you're not able to

2832
01:26:44,639 --> 01:26:47,119
water consistently and you don't have a

2833
01:26:46,079 --> 01:26:48,639
big enough container

2834
01:26:47,119 --> 01:26:50,158
maybe something with solid sides would

2835
01:26:48,639 --> 01:26:52,880
be better

2836
01:26:50,158 --> 01:26:54,479
worms do just fine in a plastic warm bin

2837
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:56,079
as long as you don't over water and your

2838
01:26:54,479 --> 01:26:56,638
plants will do really good in a plastic

2839
01:26:56,079 --> 01:26:59,279
container

2840
01:26:56,639 --> 01:27:01,039
as long as you don't over water and if

2841
01:26:59,279 --> 01:27:02,639
you're someone who wants to water less

2842
01:27:01,039 --> 01:27:04,399
maybe that's important

2843
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:06,079
and maybe it'll work for you but i just

2844
01:27:04,399 --> 01:27:08,479
tend to use the fabric pots i think they

2845
01:27:06,079 --> 01:27:10,399
work really well for our style

2846
01:27:08,479 --> 01:27:11,759
and it's always what i've been taught

2847
01:27:10,399 --> 01:27:13,198
and i've tried um

2848
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:15,119
you know to go back and forth and i end

2849
01:27:13,198 --> 01:27:17,839
up using fabric pots

2850
01:27:15,119 --> 01:27:19,840
so i would just suggest if that you

2851
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:20,960
haven't tried a fabric one versus

2852
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:23,600
a plastic or if you haven't you're

2853
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:24,960
having issues talk to someone who has

2854
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:28,079
you want to make sure you're using it

2855
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:28,079
right just like you mentioned

2856
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:32,560
so i remember last time we spoke i think

2857
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:34,560
ultimately

2858
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:36,080
i kind of got the answer out of you that

2859
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,800
if you had to choose between having a

2860
01:27:36,079 --> 01:27:38,399
cover crop

2861
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:41,520
or top dressing if you could just do one

2862
01:27:38,399 --> 01:27:44,079
or the other you would take top dressing

2863
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:45,600
and in the recent um pictures i saw i

2864
01:27:44,079 --> 01:27:46,960
noticed you have a cover crop and so i

2865
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:48,480
was a bit surprised and then in like the

2866
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:50,079
very following video you just dumped a

2867
01:27:48,479 --> 01:27:51,919
bunch of soil on top of it

2868
01:27:50,079 --> 01:27:53,439
and so i was thinking have you changed

2869
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:55,600
have you changed your mind back

2870
01:27:53,439 --> 01:27:58,238
or maybe you think the two are good now

2871
01:27:55,600 --> 01:28:00,000
like where do you sit on that one now

2872
01:27:58,238 --> 01:28:02,000
i guess one of the habits that i've

2873
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,960
noticed that successful people have

2874
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:06,560
is they typically like to have both um

2875
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:09,760
and you'll always hear that phrase

2876
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:11,520
you can't have your cake and eat it too

2877
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:13,600
and everybody says now i can

2878
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:15,040
and it'd be better to have both the

2879
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:16,560
phrase is actually a little different so

2880
01:28:15,039 --> 01:28:17,920
you can't eat your cake and have it

2881
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:18,880
depending on how you say it it means

2882
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:20,639
something different

2883
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:22,079
and the same thing goes here i like to

2884
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:24,400
have cover crop i like the top dress i

2885
01:28:22,079 --> 01:28:27,039
think they're both really important

2886
01:28:24,399 --> 01:28:27,679
i like the cover crop because it's it's

2887
01:28:27,039 --> 01:28:30,000
fun to see

2888
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:30,880
more of a diverse crop growing in the

2889
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,479
soil

2890
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:34,079
the challenges that i mentioned before

2891
01:28:32,479 --> 01:28:35,198
were if i just told everybody to cover

2892
01:28:34,079 --> 01:28:37,600
crop

2893
01:28:35,198 --> 01:28:38,879
a lot of times there's a lot lost in in

2894
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:40,880
communication or

2895
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:42,719
lost in translation and all of a sudden

2896
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:43,679
they have six foot tall cover crop

2897
01:28:42,719 --> 01:28:45,359
growing out of their

2898
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:46,719
container and they have a five inch tall

2899
01:28:45,359 --> 01:28:48,880
cannabis plant

2900
01:28:46,719 --> 01:28:50,239
and it becomes competitive against the

2901
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:52,880
main crop and so

2902
01:28:50,238 --> 01:28:54,559
um i just recommended people if i was

2903
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:56,400
going to choose one to do top dressing

2904
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:58,560
it's going to be more effective

2905
01:28:56,399 --> 01:28:59,839
and then we look at you know large scale

2906
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:01,440
all of a sudden we're looking at an acre

2907
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:03,360
it doesn't make any sense at all the top

2908
01:29:01,439 --> 01:29:05,198
dress cover crop becomes the absolute

2909
01:29:03,359 --> 01:29:07,359
gold standard and it has to be done it

2910
01:29:05,198 --> 01:29:08,799
has to be managed over the long term

2911
01:29:07,359 --> 01:29:10,158
and then if you use animal husbandry

2912
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:11,199
that's kind of how you get that top

2913
01:29:10,158 --> 01:29:13,039
dressing

2914
01:29:11,198 --> 01:29:14,559
um and then depending on soil testing

2915
01:29:13,039 --> 01:29:15,679
you can always amend but it's just so

2916
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:17,120
expensive

2917
01:29:15,679 --> 01:29:19,279
so i feel like there's always room for

2918
01:29:17,119 --> 01:29:21,119
both um

2919
01:29:19,279 --> 01:29:22,719
i like that mindset whenever i can i

2920
01:29:21,119 --> 01:29:24,719
don't want to have to pick one thing

2921
01:29:22,719 --> 01:29:26,319
versus the other if they're both good

2922
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:28,158
but you can certainly abuse both those

2923
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:28,479
like i like i'm doing in this grow we're

2924
01:29:28,158 --> 01:29:31,279
doing

2925
01:29:28,479 --> 01:29:32,718
a lot of everything so it's been fun

2926
01:29:31,279 --> 01:29:35,279
just touching back on the

2927
01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:37,279
soil testing how important is it to soil

2928
01:29:35,279 --> 01:29:39,119
test in the sense of

2929
01:29:37,279 --> 01:29:41,279
do you think if you're you know

2930
01:29:39,119 --> 01:29:42,559
reasonably consistent in your inputs and

2931
01:29:41,279 --> 01:29:45,119
you know yeah

2932
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:47,199
how should i put this you you're not a

2933
01:29:45,119 --> 01:29:49,119
stupid person you know like you you read

2934
01:29:47,198 --> 01:29:50,399
the plans you try to keep a bit of an

2935
01:29:49,119 --> 01:29:51,760
idea of what's going on

2936
01:29:50,399 --> 01:29:53,439
do you think you can get away with not

2937
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:55,760
using a soil test and just getting your

2938
01:29:53,439 --> 01:29:57,678
pots to go time and time again with

2939
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:59,280
a bit of knowledge and you know some

2940
01:29:57,679 --> 01:30:00,639
research at times or

2941
01:29:59,279 --> 01:30:02,158
do you think at the end of the day you

2942
01:30:00,639 --> 01:30:03,679
do really need to get a soil test at

2943
01:30:02,158 --> 01:30:04,960
some point otherwise things will become

2944
01:30:03,679 --> 01:30:08,079
unmanageable and you're probably not

2945
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:10,560
going to be able to self-diagnose it

2946
01:30:08,079 --> 01:30:12,158
um i think the difference on who is who

2947
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:14,639
is asking the question

2948
01:30:12,158 --> 01:30:17,119
what i mean by that is that if you are

2949
01:30:14,639 --> 01:30:19,679
somebody who is depending on your crop

2950
01:30:17,119 --> 01:30:22,479
because of the production that's coming

2951
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:25,119
from it and you can't afford to have

2952
01:30:22,479 --> 01:30:26,079
variations in yield you can't afford to

2953
01:30:25,119 --> 01:30:29,119
have

2954
01:30:26,079 --> 01:30:30,639
things take time to balance or the

2955
01:30:29,119 --> 01:30:31,760
results that come from not having the

2956
01:30:30,639 --> 01:30:33,440
soil testing i think

2957
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:34,880
i think you can totally get away with it

2958
01:30:33,439 --> 01:30:36,879
the average gardener is

2959
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:38,239
not gonna benefit hugely from getting

2960
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:41,440
the soil test

2961
01:30:38,238 --> 01:30:43,359
um and here's the reason why we're

2962
01:30:41,439 --> 01:30:46,559
starting with recipes

2963
01:30:43,359 --> 01:30:48,079
where we know every input

2964
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:49,920
and it's different than testing your

2965
01:30:48,079 --> 01:30:52,000
native soil which may have some great

2966
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:54,239
disparities in it

2967
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:56,560
the the then difference becomes like you

2968
01:30:54,238 --> 01:30:58,638
said not messing it up or not being

2969
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:59,679
you know just not being stupid and

2970
01:30:58,639 --> 01:31:01,039
really

2971
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:02,560
and really pushing your soil one

2972
01:31:01,039 --> 01:31:04,639
direction or the other and using

2973
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:06,960
products that may not be acceptable or

2974
01:31:04,639 --> 01:31:08,159
or copious amounts of them i think that

2975
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:10,000
most gardeners will have tremendous

2976
01:31:08,158 --> 01:31:10,960
success never using a soil test it's

2977
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:13,600
just like they're not going to need a

2978
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:14,880
microscope to brew compost tea

2979
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:16,639
but as soon as you're relying on the

2980
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:19,440
budget i think soil testing will

2981
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:21,440
be the most affordable difference maker

2982
01:31:19,439 --> 01:31:23,359
because can highlight some things

2983
01:31:21,439 --> 01:31:24,638
that are important like all of a sudden

2984
01:31:23,359 --> 01:31:26,079
there's no yield and

2985
01:31:24,639 --> 01:31:27,760
you just keep trying all these different

2986
01:31:26,079 --> 01:31:29,600
things but none of it

2987
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:31,360
overcame the fact there's no boron in

2988
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:33,760
the soil and it's causing a major

2989
01:31:31,359 --> 01:31:36,000
deficiency that you weren't aware of

2990
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:38,159
and it's not very often that we see such

2991
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:40,960
an aha moment when we do a soil test

2992
01:31:38,158 --> 01:31:42,879
because soil testing is not

2993
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:44,000
super accurate there's still a lot

2994
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:45,600
lacking depending on

2995
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,119
how it's tested and we can go really

2996
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:48,639
deep into that i mean

2997
01:31:47,119 --> 01:31:50,238
you have to weigh the soil to get the

2998
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:51,520
results to be what you want most people

2999
01:31:50,238 --> 01:31:52,718
don't weigh it i mean there's so many

3000
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:55,760
different

3001
01:31:52,719 --> 01:31:58,560
considerations there a lot of times

3002
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:59,920
this test can sometimes start to provide

3003
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:02,480
some problems for the grower

3004
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:03,840
um depending on how they interpret that

3005
01:32:02,479 --> 01:32:05,039
and so i feel like most gardeners can

3006
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:07,279
just go without it

3007
01:32:05,039 --> 01:32:09,119
but um once you start to understand it

3008
01:32:07,279 --> 01:32:10,800
like once you read steve solomon's book

3009
01:32:09,119 --> 01:32:12,719
you go oh my goodness

3010
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:14,320
instead of me just doing as he says put

3011
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:16,079
some more on it have a little bit of

3012
01:32:14,319 --> 01:32:18,079
everything which does work in organics

3013
01:32:16,079 --> 01:32:19,439
you can have a lot of it

3014
01:32:18,079 --> 01:32:21,760
he just highlighted if you're missing

3015
01:32:19,439 --> 01:32:24,079
something that your everything doesn't

3016
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:25,520
have like boron or

3017
01:32:24,079 --> 01:32:27,039
manganese or whatever it may be

3018
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:29,600
deficient you're never gonna get there

3019
01:32:27,039 --> 01:32:31,600
by just adding a whole bunch of stuff

3020
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:32,960
um and that's changing a little bit when

3021
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:34,320
we look at no-till because some of the

3022
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:35,039
ingredients that we're using cover those

3023
01:32:34,319 --> 01:32:37,439
bases

3024
01:32:35,039 --> 01:32:38,880
so if you are using a little bit of kelp

3025
01:32:37,439 --> 01:32:40,238
if you are using some dynamic

3026
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:43,279
accumulators that are really

3027
01:32:40,238 --> 01:32:45,439
well-rounded like in the coot's mix it's

3028
01:32:43,279 --> 01:32:46,238
much harder to have an issue that a soil

3029
01:32:45,439 --> 01:32:49,599
test is going to

3030
01:32:46,238 --> 01:32:51,439
be required to fix and

3031
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:52,719
i guess to continue this long thought

3032
01:32:51,439 --> 01:32:55,599
when i

3033
01:32:52,719 --> 01:32:56,719
started testing our soil i was kind of

3034
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:58,079
holding my breath

3035
01:32:56,719 --> 01:32:59,840
because i was really scared to see what

3036
01:32:58,079 --> 01:33:01,279
the results were as far as what i read

3037
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:02,400
was good even though i knew our soil

3038
01:33:01,279 --> 01:33:04,158
worked

3039
01:33:02,399 --> 01:33:05,920
and it was funny to find that coot

3040
01:33:04,158 --> 01:33:07,599
although he's not a fan of soil testing

3041
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:10,639
and doesn't really advocate for it

3042
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:13,600
based on his requirements uh his recipe

3043
01:33:10,639 --> 01:33:14,239
follows the profile um and fits a soil

3044
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:16,719
test

3045
01:33:14,238 --> 01:33:17,678
perfectly when done with good compost so

3046
01:33:16,719 --> 01:33:19,439
either way

3047
01:33:17,679 --> 01:33:21,440
uh solomon and coot ended up at the same

3048
01:33:19,439 --> 01:33:22,000
place whether it was from the gut or

3049
01:33:21,439 --> 01:33:23,759
from a soil

3050
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:25,520
test i think the main difference is in

3051
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:27,360
those micronutrients which

3052
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:29,920
you know kelp meal can't necessarily

3053
01:33:27,359 --> 01:33:32,158
overcome them from scale and production

3054
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:33,600
as far as um you know in times and

3055
01:33:32,158 --> 01:33:34,799
having to produce your own food and

3056
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:36,400
actually live off of it

3057
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:38,719
and nutrient deficiencies would become

3058
01:33:36,399 --> 01:33:41,039
much more important

3059
01:33:38,719 --> 01:33:41,840
and so just as maybe a bit of a weird

3060
01:33:41,039 --> 01:33:44,639
question

3061
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:46,639
have you ever heard of anyone doing or i

3062
01:33:44,639 --> 01:33:49,520
guess in worst case scenario any

3063
01:33:46,639 --> 01:33:51,840
possible negative health effects of

3064
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:53,520
trying to bokachi pet waste i've noticed

3065
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:54,880
that's something a few of the bokashi

3066
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:56,560
companies are pushing now they've got

3067
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:58,319
like these kits where you can

3068
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:59,679
where you can put the pet manure into it

3069
01:33:58,319 --> 01:34:01,439
and um you know

3070
01:33:59,679 --> 01:34:02,880
bokashi i think they say you put it in

3071
01:34:01,439 --> 01:34:05,279
the ground and then

3072
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:05,920
it's like similar to the regular bokashi

3073
01:34:05,279 --> 01:34:07,198
when it's done

3074
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:08,960
have you ever heard of anyone doing that

3075
01:34:07,198 --> 01:34:12,079
or would you be apprehensive or

3076
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:14,158
no no i think it's a great idea

3077
01:34:12,079 --> 01:34:15,279
um i wouldn't use it for the garden just

3078
01:34:14,158 --> 01:34:16,719
like any

3079
01:34:15,279 --> 01:34:18,000
you know off the grid setup if you're

3080
01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:19,520
actually going to be using your own

3081
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:21,039
waste and it becomes valuable in your

3082
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:22,239
animal's waste you have to

3083
01:34:21,039 --> 01:34:23,760
understand whether it's something that

3084
01:34:22,238 --> 01:34:24,479
can be used on a food crop whether it's

3085
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:26,159
composted

3086
01:34:24,479 --> 01:34:28,479
whether it's you know gray water whether

3087
01:34:26,158 --> 01:34:30,638
it's raw and some of this stuff is

3088
01:34:28,479 --> 01:34:32,238
is not to be used on your you know your

3089
01:34:30,639 --> 01:34:33,600
main crop it would be

3090
01:34:32,238 --> 01:34:35,279
to grow something else that feeds

3091
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:36,239
something else and then is eventually

3092
01:34:35,279 --> 01:34:39,759
used

3093
01:34:36,238 --> 01:34:39,759
and so um

3094
01:34:40,079 --> 01:34:44,079
yeah i guess that's just kind of my

3095
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:46,000
thoughts on that okay

3096
01:34:44,079 --> 01:34:48,079
and so i wanted to know your opinion

3097
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:49,600
when you're doing like a top dress of a

3098
01:34:48,079 --> 01:34:50,719
whole bunch of amendments maybe at the

3099
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:52,239
end of the cycle you know you're

3100
01:34:50,719 --> 01:34:52,719
chucking a whole bunch of new goodies on

3101
01:34:52,238 --> 01:34:54,238
top

3102
01:34:52,719 --> 01:34:56,560
do you like to blend them all up if

3103
01:34:54,238 --> 01:34:59,519
possible because what i noticed is

3104
01:34:56,560 --> 01:35:01,039
i i seem to get like a crazy increase in

3105
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:02,400
bug numbers if you blend it up and

3106
01:35:01,039 --> 01:35:03,279
that's kind of a no-brainer you know

3107
01:35:02,399 --> 01:35:05,118
like it's all

3108
01:35:03,279 --> 01:35:06,880
the higher surface area more stuff

3109
01:35:05,118 --> 01:35:08,639
available for bugs to eat up

3110
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:10,159
but in one instance i noticed it almost

3111
01:35:08,639 --> 01:35:11,760
got too out of control and

3112
01:35:10,158 --> 01:35:13,920
it was just like full-on and i was

3113
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:14,719
getting a bit worried and so i almost

3114
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:16,079
started to think

3115
01:35:14,719 --> 01:35:17,279
maybe i shouldn't blend up the malt

3116
01:35:16,079 --> 01:35:18,319
barley and stuff because i think that

3117
01:35:17,279 --> 01:35:20,880
was the source of

3118
01:35:18,319 --> 01:35:22,319
the uh the issue anyway but long story

3119
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:23,840
short yeah do you have an opinion on

3120
01:35:22,319 --> 01:35:25,039
whether you should really try to like

3121
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:27,600
almost micronize

3122
01:35:25,039 --> 01:35:29,039
your top dress like we've mentioned or

3123
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:30,079
sorry micronized like we've mentioned

3124
01:35:29,039 --> 01:35:32,639
the top dress or

3125
01:35:30,079 --> 01:35:33,600
do you view it as more of like a a

3126
01:35:32,639 --> 01:35:36,079
longer

3127
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:39,039
longer lasting and kind of leeching the

3128
01:35:36,079 --> 01:35:40,800
nutrients out slowly

3129
01:35:39,039 --> 01:35:42,639
um i think it depends on what we're

3130
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:44,079
after if we know we're after like a

3131
01:35:42,639 --> 01:35:44,639
singular ingredient it's going to make a

3132
01:35:44,079 --> 01:35:47,198
difference

3133
01:35:44,639 --> 01:35:48,400
um if we're using a little bit more

3134
01:35:47,198 --> 01:35:50,719
intelligence to create a

3135
01:35:48,399 --> 01:35:52,238
product you know at home we can get away

3136
01:35:50,719 --> 01:35:53,600
by using a little bit extra of a raw

3137
01:35:52,238 --> 01:35:55,359
material but if i'm going to buy an

3138
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:57,280
amino acid product i wanted to be the

3139
01:35:55,359 --> 01:35:59,279
purest and the most available because

3140
01:35:57,279 --> 01:36:01,198
of the shipping and the cost that goes

3141
01:35:59,279 --> 01:36:02,639
into that um

3142
01:36:01,198 --> 01:36:04,399
but when you consider all things being

3143
01:36:02,639 --> 01:36:06,639
the same and you're gonna either blend

3144
01:36:04,399 --> 01:36:08,399
an ingredient or not at home

3145
01:36:06,639 --> 01:36:10,800
i tend to buy stuff like most of us

3146
01:36:08,399 --> 01:36:12,960
that's at least fairly broken down

3147
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:14,639
um and for the most part that that

3148
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:15,279
difference in texture to me provides a

3149
01:36:14,639 --> 01:36:16,639
little bit of

3150
01:36:15,279 --> 01:36:17,920
fast release a little bit of slow

3151
01:36:16,639 --> 01:36:19,118
release and a little bit of a really

3152
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:21,279
slow release depending on

3153
01:36:19,118 --> 01:36:23,118
the size of ingredient texture and i'm

3154
01:36:21,279 --> 01:36:25,198
okay with that so i never really blend

3155
01:36:23,118 --> 01:36:26,639
up like you i've done the malted barley

3156
01:36:25,198 --> 01:36:28,079
and ground it up really fine

3157
01:36:26,639 --> 01:36:29,359
and i find that you can use smaller

3158
01:36:28,079 --> 01:36:31,039
amounts like you noticed an increased

3159
01:36:29,359 --> 01:36:33,039
low level of activity

3160
01:36:31,039 --> 01:36:34,880
um and then we've also played with in

3161
01:36:33,039 --> 01:36:37,039
our new soil recipe that i've got in a

3162
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:39,760
4x4 geoplanter over

3163
01:36:37,039 --> 01:36:41,600
some grow stone as kind of a makeshift

3164
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:43,360
sub-irrigated planter

3165
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:44,880
we mixed multiple barley into that soil

3166
01:36:43,359 --> 01:36:49,198
recipe and it was

3167
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:51,199
milled which is kind of like a

3168
01:36:49,198 --> 01:36:53,118
chunky texture it's like taking each of

3169
01:36:51,198 --> 01:36:53,839
the barley seed breaking it into maybe

3170
01:36:53,118 --> 01:36:55,599
four or five

3171
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:57,199
pieces and mashing it it's not really a

3172
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:58,880
fine powder

3173
01:36:57,198 --> 01:37:01,198
and we find that that worked really well

3174
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:03,600
and we hope that you know the soil test

3175
01:37:01,198 --> 01:37:04,399
comes back on it and looks you know

3176
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:07,760
equally well

3177
01:37:04,399 --> 01:37:09,439
the plants in it are doing good um

3178
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:11,600
i think if i micronized it it may have

3179
01:37:09,439 --> 01:37:13,118
even increased the effect of how hot the

3180
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:14,239
soil temperature got and so that's

3181
01:37:13,118 --> 01:37:16,079
another thing to consider when you're

3182
01:37:14,238 --> 01:37:18,399
mixing soils if you micronize

3183
01:37:16,079 --> 01:37:19,519
everything besides just the top dressing

3184
01:37:18,399 --> 01:37:21,118
like you mentioned

3185
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:22,560
it can cause some effects where just

3186
01:37:21,118 --> 01:37:25,679
everything is released so fast

3187
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:27,280
it may not be advantageous so consider

3188
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:29,600
what you're using it for

3189
01:37:27,279 --> 01:37:32,000
and i guess factor that in when you're

3190
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:34,079
going to consider grinding something

3191
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:35,359
so one of the recent videos you put up

3192
01:37:34,079 --> 01:37:37,840
that really caught my eye

3193
01:37:35,359 --> 01:37:38,880
was one about spinosads and you said

3194
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:41,199
that uh

3195
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:42,159
people had had lab tests that were like

3196
01:37:41,198 --> 01:37:45,118
testing hot

3197
01:37:42,158 --> 01:37:46,960
when they had used it in your mind does

3198
01:37:45,118 --> 01:37:48,799
this kind of put it in like

3199
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:50,880
maybe not the same category but like a

3200
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:51,840
similar category is using like abamectin

3201
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:53,359
like are you like

3202
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:54,880
you know would you avoid smoking

3203
01:37:53,359 --> 01:37:56,238
something that's gonna test positive for

3204
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:58,079
spinosad or do you think it's like a

3205
01:37:56,238 --> 01:37:58,879
much more safer thing than the usual

3206
01:37:58,079 --> 01:38:00,840
things

3207
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:02,480
that you are not wanting to test

3208
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:04,719
positive

3209
01:38:02,479 --> 01:38:06,158
i'm not worried about the spinosad at

3210
01:38:04,719 --> 01:38:09,520
all um

3211
01:38:06,158 --> 01:38:10,000
and i just i just i guess maybe i should

3212
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:12,320
be

3213
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:13,359
um but for whatever reason i feel it's

3214
01:38:12,319 --> 01:38:15,920
natural enough

3215
01:38:13,359 --> 01:38:17,519
and and how they found it how it's been

3216
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:18,560
used for a long time

3217
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:19,679
i don't think there's any really

3218
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:21,199
negative effects and i think that

3219
01:38:19,679 --> 01:38:22,319
there's kind of some bandwagoning that

3220
01:38:21,198 --> 01:38:23,919
happens when people

3221
01:38:22,319 --> 01:38:26,000
hear something about it and jump on it

3222
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:27,279
and i heard

3223
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,039
through the grapevine that people were

3224
01:38:27,279 --> 01:38:30,000
testing hop for it i never really did a

3225
01:38:29,039 --> 01:38:31,439
lot of my own research

3226
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,800
and so i just kind of loosely mentioned

3227
01:38:31,439 --> 01:38:33,759
that that's the story that's going on

3228
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:36,000
right now

3229
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:37,360
but you'll notice deeper in that post we

3230
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,800
got another conversation

3231
01:38:37,359 --> 01:38:40,639
i was playing a little bit of a devil's

3232
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:42,239
advocate i wanted that post to

3233
01:38:40,639 --> 01:38:43,679
get some conversation and have people

3234
01:38:42,238 --> 01:38:44,959
talking because i knew someone would say

3235
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:46,000
it's going to kill bees and i knew

3236
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:47,359
someone would say that you're going to

3237
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:49,600
fail testing

3238
01:38:47,359 --> 01:38:50,960
i happen to know that since then people

3239
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:51,840
have been using that product out of

3240
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:53,359
curiosity

3241
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:54,800
and using it according to the directions

3242
01:38:53,359 --> 01:38:56,399
and they're not failing testing even

3243
01:38:54,800 --> 01:39:00,960
when using it in flower

3244
01:38:56,399 --> 01:39:02,238
and we also find people that are um

3245
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:04,079
saying that it doesn't hurt the bees so

3246
01:39:02,238 --> 01:39:06,000
i did some research and there's white

3247
01:39:04,079 --> 01:39:08,479
paper showing that when used properly

3248
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:11,840
for instance not spraying it on bees

3249
01:39:08,479 --> 01:39:13,439
um it doesn't hurt them and so i mean

3250
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:15,119
water would hurt bees

3251
01:39:13,439 --> 01:39:16,879
a stick with her if i go knock their

3252
01:39:15,118 --> 01:39:18,079
nests down and so i feel like

3253
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:19,440
you have to take everything with a

3254
01:39:18,079 --> 01:39:20,639
little bit of grain of salt i found it

3255
01:39:19,439 --> 01:39:22,000
funny some people were

3256
01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:23,840
recommending other products that were

3257
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:25,600
supposedly safe for bees

3258
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:27,520
and when i researched those products it

3259
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:29,280
said very clearly on the label not to

3260
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:32,000
use it around bees

3261
01:39:29,279 --> 01:39:34,479
and so bees has become kind of the new i

3262
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:36,079
i love these i absolutely want them to

3263
01:39:34,479 --> 01:39:37,839
be safe i want no issues with it but

3264
01:39:36,079 --> 01:39:39,439
it's become like a new hype word where

3265
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:40,000
everybody's scared about it and so i

3266
01:39:39,439 --> 01:39:42,238
feel like for

3267
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:43,118
a while got a little out of control and

3268
01:39:42,238 --> 01:39:44,479
i think that

3269
01:39:43,118 --> 01:39:46,399
the consensus in the scientific

3270
01:39:44,479 --> 01:39:47,519
community is the spinosad is safe and it

3271
01:39:46,399 --> 01:39:48,719
doesn't hurt the bees when used

3272
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:50,480
appropriately

3273
01:39:48,719 --> 01:39:51,760
and outdoors that means using it at

3274
01:39:50,479 --> 01:39:52,479
night when the bees aren't on your

3275
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:54,320
flowers

3276
01:39:52,479 --> 01:39:55,678
and that means probably not using it in

3277
01:39:54,319 --> 01:39:56,880
flour because you shouldn't need to if

3278
01:39:55,679 --> 01:39:59,118
it's used properly

3279
01:39:56,880 --> 01:40:00,800
and that would eliminate all of the

3280
01:39:59,118 --> 01:40:02,799
reason for concern

3281
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:04,239
um but avermectiv is a deworming agent

3282
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:05,600
and i think that i would be concerned

3283
01:40:04,238 --> 01:40:08,158
with that and so it's different

3284
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:09,920
when someone says it tests hot that

3285
01:40:08,158 --> 01:40:12,479
doesn't mean it's bad that means that

3286
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:15,118
they tested for it and it was there

3287
01:40:12,479 --> 01:40:18,559
um i feel like that also is indicative

3288
01:40:15,118 --> 01:40:22,158
of them using it probably incorrectly

3289
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:25,280
yeah okay and so

3290
01:40:22,158 --> 01:40:26,638
just as a bit of a general question how

3291
01:40:25,279 --> 01:40:28,399
do you feel about the

3292
01:40:26,639 --> 01:40:29,920
dragonfly earth medicine products and

3293
01:40:28,399 --> 01:40:31,920
would you guys ever consider stocking

3294
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:33,840
them

3295
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:35,359
um people have asked us that in the past

3296
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:36,400
there's not really been a huge reason to

3297
01:40:35,359 --> 01:40:38,000
as far as i

3298
01:40:36,399 --> 01:40:39,679
i'm concerned what i mean by that is

3299
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:42,399
everyone has their own style of growing

3300
01:40:39,679 --> 01:40:44,399
and i'm trying not to dictate that style

3301
01:40:42,399 --> 01:40:46,319
and so by doing so i carry products that

3302
01:40:44,399 --> 01:40:51,198
are a little bit more ubiquitous

3303
01:40:46,319 --> 01:40:53,118
um in use and aren't so uh

3304
01:40:51,198 --> 01:40:56,399
i guess their formulas a lot of the

3305
01:40:53,118 --> 01:40:59,359
stuff but when i look at an ingredient

3306
01:40:56,399 --> 01:41:00,879
list i oftentimes find myself not

3307
01:40:59,359 --> 01:41:02,799
wanting to purchase certain products

3308
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:04,400
because i want to have a more singular

3309
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:05,920
product available to my customer like

3310
01:41:04,399 --> 01:41:07,198
the amino acid where there's one

3311
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:08,880
ingredient

3312
01:41:07,198 --> 01:41:10,960
the root wise i know a lot more about

3313
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:13,679
those microbial products

3314
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:15,679
the humic acid material that's used in

3315
01:41:13,679 --> 01:41:18,158
their product i don't like at all

3316
01:41:15,679 --> 01:41:20,239
and it's clearly labeled on there and so

3317
01:41:18,158 --> 01:41:22,079
the red flags went off right away

3318
01:41:20,238 --> 01:41:24,158
whether that's right or wrong how i was

3319
01:41:22,079 --> 01:41:26,719
taught to research ingredients

3320
01:41:24,158 --> 01:41:27,439
had told me that i a certain of the

3321
01:41:26,719 --> 01:41:29,679
products i

3322
01:41:27,439 --> 01:41:31,359
i didn't want to share with my customers

3323
01:41:29,679 --> 01:41:32,239
in the sense that i wasn't certain about

3324
01:41:31,359 --> 01:41:34,559
them

3325
01:41:32,238 --> 01:41:36,000
then i sense um found that a lot of our

3326
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:37,039
customers use their products and

3327
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:40,238
absolutely love them

3328
01:41:37,039 --> 01:41:41,600
and so i found myself in a position

3329
01:41:40,238 --> 01:41:43,039
where i was thinking okay well

3330
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:44,639
there obviously are products that are

3331
01:41:43,039 --> 01:41:46,319
being effective they are

3332
01:41:44,639 --> 01:41:48,560
in alignment with our customers core

3333
01:41:46,319 --> 01:41:49,920
beliefs and so what's in them

3334
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:52,080
and some of them have some interesting

3335
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:52,719
ingredients and so if i was to be

3336
01:41:52,079 --> 01:41:54,399
someone who

3337
01:41:52,719 --> 01:41:55,600
really wanted to get the product just

3338
01:41:54,399 --> 01:41:57,198
the type of person that i am would

3339
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:58,960
probably lead me to making my own buying

3340
01:41:57,198 --> 01:42:00,319
some of the source ingredients

3341
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:01,920
and i love that they're transparent

3342
01:42:00,319 --> 01:42:03,439
about it and if you don't want to go to

3343
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:05,118
all the work of making your own stuff

3344
01:42:03,439 --> 01:42:06,559
and you like their ingredients

3345
01:42:05,118 --> 01:42:08,238
you can go buy their products and use

3346
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:09,600
them and not only that there's a whole

3347
01:42:08,238 --> 01:42:10,158
community of people that can kind of

3348
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:12,639
tell you

3349
01:42:10,158 --> 01:42:14,479
how to work with it so it's been this

3350
01:42:12,639 --> 01:42:17,359
interesting thing um

3351
01:42:14,479 --> 01:42:17,678
but i have never carried them and i i

3352
01:42:17,359 --> 01:42:19,279
just

3353
01:42:17,679 --> 01:42:20,480
don't really have an interest and part

3354
01:42:19,279 --> 01:42:21,279
of it is i don't think i could really

3355
01:42:20,479 --> 01:42:23,118
help them

3356
01:42:21,279 --> 01:42:24,719
their brand at all anybody that buys

3357
01:42:23,118 --> 01:42:27,439
build the soil can certainly go get

3358
01:42:24,719 --> 01:42:28,639
the dragonfly directly from them or from

3359
01:42:27,439 --> 01:42:29,839
someone probably even closer they've

3360
01:42:28,639 --> 01:42:31,920
done a great job of getting their

3361
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:34,159
products out there in the market

3362
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:36,158
appropriate answers so we've got a few

3363
01:42:34,158 --> 01:42:37,679
questions on ipm here

3364
01:42:36,158 --> 01:42:40,158
an interesting one i've been thinking

3365
01:42:37,679 --> 01:42:43,359
about is have you ever noticed

3366
01:42:40,158 --> 01:42:46,559
a meaningful effect from the use of

3367
01:42:43,359 --> 01:42:49,118
diatomaceous earth in regards to ipm

3368
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:51,440
you know every time i see people use it

3369
01:42:49,118 --> 01:42:53,439
i i generally try to follow up and say

3370
01:42:51,439 --> 01:42:55,279
you know how did you find it to work

3371
01:42:53,439 --> 01:42:56,559
and most of them give the same answer

3372
01:42:55,279 --> 01:42:58,880
you know as soon as you water

3373
01:42:56,560 --> 01:43:00,159
gets clumpy don't think it has really

3374
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:01,920
any effect after that

3375
01:43:00,158 --> 01:43:03,679
it's just and also that it's just quite

3376
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:04,319
hard to manage and use in general you

3377
01:43:03,679 --> 01:43:06,800
know

3378
01:43:04,319 --> 01:43:07,679
do you find it works and if so how is

3379
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:11,360
what's the best

3380
01:43:07,679 --> 01:43:13,118
way to optimally use it

3381
01:43:11,359 --> 01:43:14,719
really good question you'll notice a

3382
01:43:13,118 --> 01:43:15,599
recent post that we put on instagram

3383
01:43:14,719 --> 01:43:18,079
highlights this

3384
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:20,079
and it's a little bit messy how we do it

3385
01:43:18,079 --> 01:43:21,439
and it may not be the ideal approach but

3386
01:43:20,079 --> 01:43:23,198
it's the only way that i've found to

3387
01:43:21,439 --> 01:43:24,399
work and i'll share that methodology

3388
01:43:23,198 --> 01:43:26,000
with you

3389
01:43:24,399 --> 01:43:28,079
at work we have a warm bin it's a

3390
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,880
hanging warm end it is a breathable

3391
01:43:28,079 --> 01:43:32,319
fabric but

3392
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:34,079
very similar to a backpack and it allows

3393
01:43:32,319 --> 01:43:35,840
it to hold about four cubic feet of

3394
01:43:34,079 --> 01:43:38,079
heavy compost with worms in it up on

3395
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:39,279
this 2x4 stand that we built

3396
01:43:38,079 --> 01:43:41,519
and we have a bucket underneath it to

3397
01:43:39,279 --> 01:43:43,279
pull the worm castings out and the top

3398
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:45,600
um that it's got a zipper net that keeps

3399
01:43:43,279 --> 01:43:47,039
most of the flies in but

3400
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:48,480
typically there's none the verbal

3401
01:43:47,039 --> 01:43:48,960
composting is really clean when done

3402
01:43:48,479 --> 01:43:51,919
right

3403
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:53,600
we top dress from an outside container

3404
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:56,560
that had sunflowers and a whole bunch of

3405
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:57,199
soil and compost tea scraps and stuff in

3406
01:43:56,560 --> 01:43:59,920
it

3407
01:43:57,198 --> 01:44:02,399
and it brought in a ton of fungus gnat

3408
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:04,639
and fly larva and all sorts of stuff

3409
01:44:02,399 --> 01:44:06,158
and so it was just full underneath this

3410
01:44:04,639 --> 01:44:07,600
net and a lot of them were flying

3411
01:44:06,158 --> 01:44:10,399
through because they were so small

3412
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:12,239
and so we put about an inch layer all

3413
01:44:10,399 --> 01:44:12,879
the way across with diatomaceous earth

3414
01:44:12,238 --> 01:44:14,158
just

3415
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:15,920
because we're not growing a plant we

3416
01:44:14,158 --> 01:44:17,439
just wanted to see if it would really

3417
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:19,279
work because in the past

3418
01:44:17,439 --> 01:44:20,960
i would just dust a little bit and i

3419
01:44:19,279 --> 01:44:22,719
never had any good results if i used too

3420
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:25,198
much it would clump up

3421
01:44:22,719 --> 01:44:26,560
and um man i gotta tell you the nats

3422
01:44:25,198 --> 01:44:28,000
were instantly gone the flies were

3423
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:30,320
instantly gone it had such a

3424
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:31,600
dramatic effect within 48 hours that i

3425
01:44:30,319 --> 01:44:34,238
thought man i've been missing

3426
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:36,000
the boat on this stuff part of it is

3427
01:44:34,238 --> 01:44:38,000
just any barrier will work

3428
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:39,840
so i don't want to say that diatomaceous

3429
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:43,118
earth is necessarily

3430
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:44,800
the most important way to go but i like

3431
01:44:43,118 --> 01:44:46,079
most of my tools to be multifunction and

3432
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:48,079
it just so happens that if you're going

3433
01:44:46,079 --> 01:44:49,920
to make a barrier diatomaceous earth is

3434
01:44:48,079 --> 01:44:51,198
a very good way to do that

3435
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:52,960
and so what we did to get around the

3436
01:44:51,198 --> 01:44:54,960
problems with this we top dressed with

3437
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:56,079
about a half pound of diatomaceous earth

3438
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:58,239
food grade

3439
01:44:56,079 --> 01:44:59,840
per 15 gallon plant it created like a

3440
01:44:58,238 --> 01:45:02,000
half inch layer all the way across the

3441
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:04,000
entire top dress surface area

3442
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:05,679
and it immediately suffocated any

3443
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:07,279
attempt at fungus gnats to live in there

3444
01:45:05,679 --> 01:45:09,039
the larva that would have hatched come

3445
01:45:07,279 --> 01:45:11,279
through and die the

3446
01:45:09,039 --> 01:45:13,279
flyers can't lay eggs in it because it's

3447
01:45:11,279 --> 01:45:14,639
so thick and dry and powdery and they

3448
01:45:13,279 --> 01:45:16,719
just die when they land in it

3449
01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:18,880
and they can't fly away and it causes

3450
01:45:16,719 --> 01:45:20,158
problems it just interrupts everything

3451
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:21,600
and then we also did it because we had

3452
01:45:20,158 --> 01:45:22,960
thrips and they have part of the life

3453
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:24,960
cycle in the soil

3454
01:45:22,960 --> 01:45:26,079
and so within 48 hours same effect there

3455
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:28,560
was nothing moving

3456
01:45:26,079 --> 01:45:29,600
in that tent as far as flying around

3457
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:32,000
flies gnats

3458
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:33,520
and so i'm hoping has the same effect on

3459
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:35,198
the thrip larva

3460
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:36,560
and then instead of trying to water

3461
01:45:35,198 --> 01:45:37,678
through it because we did a half inch

3462
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:40,800
thick layer

3463
01:45:37,679 --> 01:45:42,319
um just decided hey you know what the

3464
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:44,000
i think two pounds that we ended up

3465
01:45:42,319 --> 01:45:45,198
using were like a dollar worth of

3466
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,560
material

3467
01:45:45,198 --> 01:45:48,238
maybe less than that depending on the

3468
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:49,520
quantity you buy it in so i took the

3469
01:45:48,238 --> 01:45:51,439
shop back and just sucked it right off

3470
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:51,679
the top it was so light and that it came

3471
01:45:51,439 --> 01:45:55,118
off

3472
01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:56,880
all the top dress stayed and since the

3473
01:45:55,118 --> 01:45:58,559
problem has been completely eliminated

3474
01:45:56,880 --> 01:45:59,359
as far as anything flying around in

3475
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:01,360
there

3476
01:45:59,359 --> 01:46:02,719
and i think if you do that same process

3477
01:46:01,359 --> 01:46:04,079
you'll have the same results and then

3478
01:46:02,719 --> 01:46:04,960
you won't have to try and water through

3479
01:46:04,079 --> 01:46:06,319
it

3480
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:08,000
that being said it's still dusty and

3481
01:46:06,319 --> 01:46:10,880
it's a mess and so

3482
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:12,479
there are other ways to do it but it's

3483
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:13,920
as far as i can tell it's it's basically

3484
01:46:12,479 --> 01:46:16,959
100 effective

3485
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:16,960
and it's pretty affordable

3486
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:22,960
fantastic i'll have to give that a go so

3487
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:25,279
one question i get asked in regards to

3488
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:26,719
kind of ipm or like at the extreme end

3489
01:46:25,279 --> 01:46:27,920
of it and i just really don't have a

3490
01:46:26,719 --> 01:46:29,279
good answer i haven't been able to get

3491
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:30,719
one either is

3492
01:46:29,279 --> 01:46:32,079
uh let's just say you're a first-time

3493
01:46:30,719 --> 01:46:33,920
grower because normally it's the first

3494
01:46:32,079 --> 01:46:35,519
time girls who have this issue

3495
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:37,279
if you're a first-time grower and you're

3496
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:38,719
worried about getting you know spider

3497
01:46:37,279 --> 01:46:41,439
mites or like you know one of the more

3498
01:46:38,719 --> 01:46:44,079
nasty things in in flower

3499
01:46:41,439 --> 01:46:45,919
do you have any real options to get rid

3500
01:46:44,079 --> 01:46:47,760
of them once you're in

3501
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:49,359
flowers so to speak you know like let's

3502
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:51,039
just say you're at week four so there's

3503
01:46:49,359 --> 01:46:53,599
definitely buds there you know

3504
01:46:51,039 --> 01:46:56,639
what are your options realistically for

3505
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:58,000
for mites are there any

3506
01:46:56,639 --> 01:46:59,679
yeah i think there's a lot more options

3507
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:01,039
than people give credit for i think that

3508
01:46:59,679 --> 01:47:03,199
the community of

3509
01:47:01,039 --> 01:47:05,760
cannabis cultivators end up creating

3510
01:47:03,198 --> 01:47:07,759
this conversation that's taboo

3511
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:09,280
and it's spraying anything on a flower

3512
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:10,800
as if it's just going to melt your buds

3513
01:47:09,279 --> 01:47:13,118
and it's going to be in all the bud that

3514
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:15,119
you smoke that's just not how it works

3515
01:47:13,118 --> 01:47:16,639
um you can fold your spray and it will

3516
01:47:15,118 --> 01:47:18,799
not end up in the product

3517
01:47:16,639 --> 01:47:21,279
uh the very low dilution rates of things

3518
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:23,039
like essential oil or additives

3519
01:47:21,279 --> 01:47:25,198
will volatize and off gas and be

3520
01:47:23,039 --> 01:47:28,560
completely gone they will be

3521
01:47:25,198 --> 01:47:29,759
you know hit with the light and the air

3522
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:30,960
and everything else now

3523
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:32,079
here's something else to consider if

3524
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:33,760
you're not going to spray your plants

3525
01:47:32,079 --> 01:47:35,039
with something even your buds

3526
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:37,199
especially when growing outdoors or in a

3527
01:47:35,039 --> 01:47:39,439
greenhouse or even in your grow tent

3528
01:47:37,198 --> 01:47:40,638
um nature's gonna be spraying them

3529
01:47:39,439 --> 01:47:42,479
anyways there's gonna be

3530
01:47:40,639 --> 01:47:44,079
bacteria indigenous floating in the air

3531
01:47:42,479 --> 01:47:47,198
that's gonna land on there

3532
01:47:44,079 --> 01:47:48,880
and there's going to be dirt and debris

3533
01:47:47,198 --> 01:47:51,359
and other stuff floating around

3534
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:52,319
unless you have like a complete sterile

3535
01:47:51,359 --> 01:47:54,319
hepa filtered

3536
01:47:52,319 --> 01:47:55,439
everything room there's still some

3537
01:47:54,319 --> 01:47:55,759
chance of that because a lot of people

3538
01:47:55,439 --> 01:47:57,118
will

3539
01:47:55,760 --> 01:47:58,560
wash their buds some people aren't

3540
01:47:57,118 --> 01:48:00,079
terribly concerned with it some people

3541
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:01,920
make concentrates

3542
01:48:00,079 --> 01:48:03,279
um at the end of the day i think that

3543
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:04,880
foliar spring

3544
01:48:03,279 --> 01:48:06,238
really doesn't have a huge negative

3545
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:07,679
effect on the end result especially in

3546
01:48:06,238 --> 01:48:09,279
those first four weeks now as you get

3547
01:48:07,679 --> 01:48:10,239
closer to harvest it definitely can

3548
01:48:09,279 --> 01:48:12,319
cause a huge issue

3549
01:48:10,238 --> 01:48:15,198
especially when products are abused

3550
01:48:12,319 --> 01:48:17,519
we've seen really safe results using em1

3551
01:48:15,198 --> 01:48:18,799
mixed with treatment which is an enzyme

3552
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:20,719
cleaner

3553
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:22,239
or just using the treatment other

3554
01:48:20,719 --> 01:48:22,800
products on the market like it would be

3555
01:48:22,238 --> 01:48:25,118
like dr

3556
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:27,520
zymes and big time exterminator and some

3557
01:48:25,118 --> 01:48:29,118
of the other enzyme-based sprays

3558
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:30,960
i always recommend following like a

3559
01:48:29,118 --> 01:48:32,799
quarter dose or a half dose for any

3560
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:34,158
recommended anything that the

3561
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:36,480
manufacturer says and that way you're

3562
01:48:34,158 --> 01:48:38,638
gonna be safe especially in flour

3563
01:48:36,479 --> 01:48:40,158
um and then also make sure that you have

3564
01:48:38,639 --> 01:48:40,880
air flow make sure that you're not gonna

3565
01:48:40,158 --> 01:48:42,479
harvest

3566
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:43,679
you know the next week certainly if

3567
01:48:42,479 --> 01:48:45,439
you're at week four and you've got

3568
01:48:43,679 --> 01:48:46,239
spider mites or if you notice a little

3569
01:48:45,439 --> 01:48:47,678
bit

3570
01:48:46,238 --> 01:48:49,279
i would much rather see you spray

3571
01:48:47,679 --> 01:48:52,000
something

3572
01:48:49,279 --> 01:48:53,920
very natural like maybe a homemade em5

3573
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:55,118
you can go to terraganix.com and look up

3574
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:57,359
that

3575
01:48:55,118 --> 01:48:58,319
you can use essential oil you can use

3576
01:48:57,359 --> 01:49:00,880
enzyme sprays

3577
01:48:58,319 --> 01:49:03,359
heck i think people even using low

3578
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:05,199
dilutions of neem oils and stuff

3579
01:49:03,359 --> 01:49:06,639
would probably be even safe on certain

3580
01:49:05,198 --> 01:49:08,399
genetics at that point now

3581
01:49:06,639 --> 01:49:09,440
i don't do that some people say they do

3582
01:49:08,399 --> 01:49:10,479
i'm not sure if it affects their

3583
01:49:09,439 --> 01:49:12,319
concentrates

3584
01:49:10,479 --> 01:49:13,598
but certainly the enzyme products don't

3585
01:49:12,319 --> 01:49:15,359
and some of the homemade products and

3586
01:49:13,599 --> 01:49:16,960
the essential oils don't

3587
01:49:15,359 --> 01:49:18,960
and so i'd be comfortable recommending

3588
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:19,760
that as long as they used an emulsifier

3589
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:22,319
and

3590
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:25,520
you know it was no later than say week

3591
01:49:22,319 --> 01:49:28,079
six at the latest

3592
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:29,679
so have you heard the idea being thrown

3593
01:49:28,079 --> 01:49:30,238
around at all and i'll just preface this

3594
01:49:29,679 --> 01:49:33,440
by saying

3595
01:49:30,238 --> 01:49:35,678
you certainly didn't advocate this but

3596
01:49:33,439 --> 01:49:37,919
some people have thrown around the idea

3597
01:49:35,679 --> 01:49:41,520
that cannabis hyper anemias

3598
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:43,520
is possibly just actually a code name

3599
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:46,639
for azure doctrine poisoning aka

3600
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:47,040
neem poisoning so if that were true it

3601
01:49:46,639 --> 01:49:49,440
could

3602
01:49:47,039 --> 01:49:51,599
you know give credence to the idea that

3603
01:49:49,439 --> 01:49:53,678
people who do experiences have maybe

3604
01:49:51,599 --> 01:49:56,079
just actually ingested some weed that

3605
01:49:53,679 --> 01:49:57,279
was sprayed with neem laid in flower

3606
01:49:56,079 --> 01:50:00,399
have you heard anything along those

3607
01:49:57,279 --> 01:50:01,198
lines i have and i think it's grasping

3608
01:50:00,399 --> 01:50:03,598
for straws

3609
01:50:01,198 --> 01:50:04,799
um i don't see any correlation i think

3610
01:50:03,599 --> 01:50:06,000
that it makes a lot of sense when you

3611
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:07,920
start thinking about it and you're like

3612
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:10,238
yeah people spray stuff that's gotta be

3613
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:11,440
what it is not our beloved plant

3614
01:50:10,238 --> 01:50:12,799
but you know there's people out there

3615
01:50:11,439 --> 01:50:14,559
that react differently to everything

3616
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:16,000
good and bad and these are natural

3617
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:18,639
products that are quite potent

3618
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:20,560
and you know i've certainly used quite a

3619
01:50:18,639 --> 01:50:23,440
bit of it and so i wouldn't be surprised

3620
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:24,800
if there are different times in my life

3621
01:50:23,439 --> 01:50:26,319
where the plant treats me differently

3622
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:27,679
based on what my needs are

3623
01:50:26,319 --> 01:50:29,198
and i've had some people close to me in

3624
01:50:27,679 --> 01:50:31,520
my life that went through a potential

3625
01:50:29,198 --> 01:50:33,118
cannabis hypermices or whatever the

3626
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:34,560
doctor wanted to call it and what's

3627
01:50:33,118 --> 01:50:35,519
really frustrating for most people to go

3628
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:36,880
through this is

3629
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:38,800
they feel they're being written off with

3630
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:40,079
some random word that's

3631
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:42,079
and they're just being told that they

3632
01:50:40,079 --> 01:50:43,760
smoked too much to go back home

3633
01:50:42,079 --> 01:50:45,439
and i think there's a really underlying

3634
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:47,199
medical cause for concern there and it's

3635
01:50:45,439 --> 01:50:49,039
something that may not be

3636
01:50:47,198 --> 01:50:51,598
caused by cannabis but maybe during that

3637
01:50:49,039 --> 01:50:54,079
time accentuated by it or highlighted

3638
01:50:51,599 --> 01:50:55,360
and um it's real it certainly is and

3639
01:50:54,079 --> 01:50:56,639
i've seen that it's not directly

3640
01:50:55,359 --> 01:50:59,279
correlated to

3641
01:50:56,639 --> 01:51:00,480
the azidoracton and if that's the case i

3642
01:50:59,279 --> 01:51:02,559
would say that the only way it's

3643
01:51:00,479 --> 01:51:02,959
possible is from azerbaijan extracts

3644
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:05,280
which

3645
01:51:02,960 --> 01:51:06,079
are in my opinion abused because of

3646
01:51:05,279 --> 01:51:07,920
these you know

3647
01:51:06,079 --> 01:51:09,118
high amounts of parts per million a

3648
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:11,840
percentage of this one

3649
01:51:09,118 --> 01:51:12,960
singular plant constituent which to me

3650
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:14,560
is

3651
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:16,800
doesn't have that synergistic effect

3652
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:19,360
that natural safe effect like a

3653
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:21,199
like a plant based neem oil would have

3654
01:51:19,359 --> 01:51:22,880
that you can use topically internally

3655
01:51:21,198 --> 01:51:24,158
and has been used for thousands of years

3656
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:27,599
without any sort of

3657
01:51:24,158 --> 01:51:28,238
hypervisor syndrome something i've

3658
01:51:27,599 --> 01:51:30,000
noticed

3659
01:51:28,238 --> 01:51:32,319
is really trending at the moment you

3660
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:34,000
know lactobacillus it's the at the

3661
01:51:32,319 --> 01:51:36,319
moment you know everyone's talking about

3662
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:37,679
it what do you think about it you know

3663
01:51:36,319 --> 01:51:38,559
it's one of those ones where it's super

3664
01:51:37,679 --> 01:51:40,560
easy to make

3665
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:42,159
so i think that probably adds to why

3666
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:44,080
it's gaining so much momentum but the

3667
01:51:42,158 --> 01:51:46,158
thing i've heard from some friends who i

3668
01:51:44,079 --> 01:51:48,319
trust their opinions greatly is they

3669
01:51:46,158 --> 01:51:50,158
reckon that using it to flush your

3670
01:51:48,319 --> 01:51:52,639
plants is amazing have you heard

3671
01:51:50,158 --> 01:51:54,000
anything along those lines

3672
01:51:52,639 --> 01:51:55,679
i've heard things like that kind of like

3673
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,639
a bacterial flush where you put it

3674
01:51:55,679 --> 01:51:58,639
through in a

3675
01:51:56,639 --> 01:52:00,480
lactobacillus which is really good at

3676
01:51:58,639 --> 01:52:00,960
breaking down organic material goes

3677
01:52:00,479 --> 01:52:02,638
through and

3678
01:52:00,960 --> 01:52:04,239
supposedly flushes your plants or eats

3679
01:52:02,639 --> 01:52:05,840
the salts out or whatever

3680
01:52:04,238 --> 01:52:07,919
i don't really mess around with that too

3681
01:52:05,840 --> 01:52:10,000
much um in the sense that

3682
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:11,199
um i don't have a reason to flush i'm

3683
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:13,679
not growing in that style

3684
01:52:11,198 --> 01:52:14,879
where i'd use it for that purpose

3685
01:52:13,679 --> 01:52:16,880
another reason i think is a lot of

3686
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:18,400
people mix it with molasses to stabilize

3687
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:20,079
and so the idea that molasses

3688
01:52:18,399 --> 01:52:22,319
uses the end of the flush kind of goes

3689
01:52:20,079 --> 01:52:26,800
along with that thought methodology

3690
01:52:22,319 --> 01:52:28,960
and lends itself to it um so the

3691
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:30,159
molasses thing that i just mentioned um

3692
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:31,520
oftentimes

3693
01:52:30,158 --> 01:52:32,799
if you look in the past people would use

3694
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:34,480
molasses at the end of their growth

3695
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:36,400
cycle to kind of flush

3696
01:52:34,479 --> 01:52:38,399
and flush with sugars or whatever meant

3697
01:52:36,399 --> 01:52:40,638
to kind of sweeten the buds up

3698
01:52:38,399 --> 01:52:42,638
um and so i don't really follow any of

3699
01:52:40,639 --> 01:52:44,239
those practices but i see lactobacillus

3700
01:52:42,639 --> 01:52:46,960
becoming a trend because

3701
01:52:44,238 --> 01:52:47,759
of a couple reasons it really does work

3702
01:52:46,960 --> 01:52:50,960
it provides

3703
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:53,039
some nitrogen amino amino acids it is a

3704
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:55,520
soluble organic nutrient

3705
01:52:53,039 --> 01:52:56,238
it's got some probiotic advantages to it

3706
01:52:55,520 --> 01:52:58,480
and so

3707
01:52:56,238 --> 01:53:00,319
it makes a lot of sense to me i get it

3708
01:52:58,479 --> 01:53:00,638
um challenges that i have you know i

3709
01:53:00,319 --> 01:53:02,000
don't

3710
01:53:00,639 --> 01:53:03,440
buy a lot of milk and so now all of a

3711
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,560
sudden i'm gonna buy a jug of milk just

3712
01:53:03,439 --> 01:53:06,479
for this

3713
01:53:04,560 --> 01:53:07,679
and it's coming from a cow that was fed

3714
01:53:06,479 --> 01:53:09,919
gmo corn

3715
01:53:07,679 --> 01:53:11,199
or you know fat up or maybe instead of

3716
01:53:09,920 --> 01:53:12,399
dairy and it's eating good grass i don't

3717
01:53:11,198 --> 01:53:14,158
know but a lot of times

3718
01:53:12,399 --> 01:53:15,598
the whole process isn't a huge industry

3719
01:53:14,158 --> 01:53:17,920
i want to support and start making tons

3720
01:53:15,599 --> 01:53:19,119
of fertilizer off of purchased milk

3721
01:53:17,920 --> 01:53:20,960
and so if i happen to have milk on the

3722
01:53:19,118 --> 01:53:22,479
farm or it's a waste or the milk goes

3723
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:25,279
bad and i can make it i think it's great

3724
01:53:22,479 --> 01:53:26,559
i like to have lacto around

3725
01:53:25,279 --> 01:53:28,079
but i've got other products like this

3726
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:29,599
amino acid product that i think works a

3727
01:53:28,079 --> 01:53:32,880
lot better

3728
01:53:29,599 --> 01:53:33,920
um and that's just me um but lactose

3729
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:35,440
cheap to make

3730
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:37,039
it's one of those products that works it

3731
01:53:35,439 --> 01:53:38,479
has a cool factor so i think it's going

3732
01:53:37,039 --> 01:53:40,079
to be here to stay and people will be

3733
01:53:38,479 --> 01:53:43,439
using it for a long time

3734
01:53:40,079 --> 01:53:47,439
um you know

3735
01:53:43,439 --> 01:53:48,960
beyond that i just i think that people

3736
01:53:47,439 --> 01:53:50,479
most people that i know when they make

3737
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:51,920
it for a long time they get to the point

3738
01:53:50,479 --> 01:53:53,279
where it's just kind of like okay am i

3739
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:54,639
gonna

3740
01:53:53,279 --> 01:53:56,880
make a routine where i make this every

3741
01:53:54,639 --> 01:53:58,560
so often make a ton of it do i activate

3742
01:53:56,880 --> 01:54:00,800
it do i do it once a year do i do it all

3743
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:02,880
often it just becomes kind of a

3744
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:04,320
an unnecessary process at least in a

3745
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:05,599
no-till environment

3746
01:54:04,319 --> 01:54:07,118
especially when i've got like this

3747
01:54:05,599 --> 01:54:08,719
pattern of vino that i think just is so

3748
01:54:07,118 --> 01:54:11,118
much more effective and easier for me to

3749
01:54:08,719 --> 01:54:12,560
use um but if i didn't have that and i

3750
01:54:11,118 --> 01:54:15,118
didn't want to buy a product

3751
01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:16,639
i think this would be the go-to first

3752
01:54:15,118 --> 01:54:18,639
thing that people would want to make as

3753
01:54:16,639 --> 01:54:22,880
far as a

3754
01:54:18,639 --> 01:54:26,480
a do-it-yourself plant fertilizer

3755
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:28,159
so we haven't really seen any major

3756
01:54:26,479 --> 01:54:31,519
major breakthroughs in terms of

3757
01:54:28,158 --> 01:54:33,598
extremely effective organic methods of

3758
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:35,040
killing pests and bugs we you know i

3759
01:54:33,599 --> 01:54:35,520
mean there's been developments in you

3760
01:54:35,039 --> 01:54:37,439
know

3761
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:38,800
the use of the essential oils with the

3762
01:54:37,439 --> 01:54:40,000
neems and with the silicas you know so

3763
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:41,679
the combination of all those is

3764
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:43,760
certainly effective but

3765
01:54:41,679 --> 01:54:45,359
i'm talking about things on the level of

3766
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:47,599
like chemicals where you know like

3767
01:54:45,359 --> 01:54:50,000
you're using the product and it's it's

3768
01:54:47,599 --> 01:54:52,000
really wiping everything out pretty much

3769
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:54,000
quickly or instantly almost

3770
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:55,118
and i thought about it and it's seems

3771
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:58,560
like using

3772
01:54:55,118 --> 01:55:00,399
biological agents like predators or

3773
01:54:58,560 --> 01:55:02,719
you know maybe like enzymes that are

3774
01:55:00,399 --> 01:55:04,158
just so powerful and specific that like

3775
01:55:02,719 --> 01:55:05,920
you know they literally just rip things

3776
01:55:04,158 --> 01:55:07,598
apart similar to the way like a really

3777
01:55:05,920 --> 01:55:09,118
chemically based one would

3778
01:55:07,599 --> 01:55:10,800
do you think that's possibly like a

3779
01:55:09,118 --> 01:55:11,439
future we could come to or do you think

3780
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:14,480
like

3781
01:55:11,439 --> 01:55:16,000
it's not really technically viable or do

3782
01:55:14,479 --> 01:55:18,238
you think the demand would need to be

3783
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:20,158
right to develop such products

3784
01:55:18,238 --> 01:55:21,519
seems like the californian market is big

3785
01:55:20,158 --> 01:55:22,960
enough that the demand would be there

3786
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:25,119
for like you know like really good

3787
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:28,639
organic pest killers that are

3788
01:55:25,118 --> 01:55:29,759
really effective consistently

3789
01:55:28,639 --> 01:55:31,199
yeah i think you're right i think the

3790
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:32,000
markets there i think the demands there

3791
01:55:31,198 --> 01:55:33,759
i think we're going to see

3792
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:35,039
products like that and they will work

3793
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:36,800
and he read um

3794
01:55:35,039 --> 01:55:39,198
paul stamet's mycelium running and

3795
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:40,800
looked down the rabbit hole of a fungus

3796
01:55:39,198 --> 01:55:41,839
you'll see that he's worked on a number

3797
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:44,800
of different

3798
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:45,279
effective ways to utilize fungus to kill

3799
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:46,960
pests

3800
01:55:45,279 --> 01:55:48,880
and so one of the things he talks about

3801
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:52,319
in the book is i believe termites

3802
01:55:48,880 --> 01:55:53,760
and using creating like for instance i

3803
01:55:52,319 --> 01:55:54,960
think it was ants or termites i can't

3804
01:55:53,760 --> 01:55:57,520
remember which one this one

3805
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:59,198
is relative to but they were smart they

3806
01:55:57,520 --> 01:56:00,560
would sense the material that was

3807
01:55:59,198 --> 01:56:02,319
poisoned to him in the fungus

3808
01:56:00,560 --> 01:56:03,599
and it was an odor or something like

3809
01:56:02,319 --> 01:56:05,439
that they wouldn't bring it they

3810
01:56:03,599 --> 01:56:07,679
wouldn't bring it back

3811
01:56:05,439 --> 01:56:08,879
to the nest and even if they did they

3812
01:56:07,679 --> 01:56:10,960
had guards that would

3813
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:12,319
then dispose of the product before it

3814
01:56:10,960 --> 01:56:13,679
got back to the queen which is really

3815
01:56:12,319 --> 01:56:15,599
what you want to infect to kill the

3816
01:56:13,679 --> 01:56:18,079
colony i guess in this case

3817
01:56:15,599 --> 01:56:18,960
and so they were able to produce

3818
01:56:18,079 --> 01:56:21,840
mushrooms

3819
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:22,560
that didn't either spore or created a

3820
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:25,039
different result

3821
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:26,480
how they were grown so that it lacked

3822
01:56:25,039 --> 01:56:28,800
the property that

3823
01:56:26,479 --> 01:56:30,158
tipped the ants off and so all of a

3824
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:32,320
sudden they would just go

3825
01:56:30,158 --> 01:56:33,759
harvest this stuff as if it was the best

3826
01:56:32,319 --> 01:56:34,799
food they could find and bring it back

3827
01:56:33,760 --> 01:56:36,320
to the queen

3828
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:37,679
and everybody would give it to her and

3829
01:56:36,319 --> 01:56:38,319
everybody'd share it and then it would

3830
01:56:37,679 --> 01:56:39,840
all die

3831
01:56:38,319 --> 01:56:41,439
very quickly because the fungus would

3832
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:43,119
completely take him over from the inside

3833
01:56:41,439 --> 01:56:44,719
out so i feel like there's going to be

3834
01:56:43,118 --> 01:56:45,359
opportunity where it's very specific the

3835
01:56:44,719 --> 01:56:47,279
problem is

3836
01:56:45,359 --> 01:56:48,639
is that most the time when you think of

3837
01:56:47,279 --> 01:56:49,759
a overall blanket

3838
01:56:48,639 --> 01:56:51,760
targeting effect where it just

3839
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:53,199
eradicates pests

3840
01:56:51,760 --> 01:56:54,800
it doesn't necessarily fit nature's

3841
01:56:53,198 --> 01:56:55,198
profile because they'll kill good and

3842
01:56:54,800 --> 01:56:57,279
bad

3843
01:56:55,198 --> 01:56:59,359
and neem oil is fantastic because it

3844
01:56:57,279 --> 01:57:00,719
typically only kills the herbivores that

3845
01:56:59,359 --> 01:57:03,359
are eating the plant

3846
01:57:00,719 --> 01:57:04,880
not the pest eating beneficials that we

3847
01:57:03,359 --> 01:57:07,118
want to stay alive

3848
01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:09,359
and we will look at um you know other

3849
01:57:07,118 --> 01:57:10,079
products like the spinosad and other

3850
01:57:09,359 --> 01:57:11,439
things like that

3851
01:57:10,079 --> 01:57:14,000
it doesn't just blanket target

3852
01:57:11,439 --> 01:57:16,960
everything and eradicate every stage

3853
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:18,560
from uh adult to larva to them i mean it

3854
01:57:16,960 --> 01:57:20,960
affects them all differently

3855
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:22,480
and i think that in nature at least it

3856
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:23,520
makes sense that you don't want to have

3857
01:57:22,479 --> 01:57:25,519
such a clear

3858
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:27,040
cut killer because it breaks some of the

3859
01:57:25,520 --> 01:57:28,480
rules of making

3860
01:57:27,039 --> 01:57:29,920
it possible for something dramatically

3861
01:57:28,479 --> 01:57:31,439
bad to happen out there where everything

3862
01:57:29,920 --> 01:57:32,719
just gets wiped out

3863
01:57:31,439 --> 01:57:34,158
and so one of the stories that i

3864
01:57:32,719 --> 01:57:35,118
remember reading about and i think it

3865
01:57:34,158 --> 01:57:36,799
was like 40

3866
01:57:35,118 --> 01:57:38,719
000 you know some agricultural book

3867
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:40,480
about the asian

3868
01:57:38,719 --> 01:57:43,359
horticultural practices and farming

3869
01:57:40,479 --> 01:57:44,718
practices and one of the stories about

3870
01:57:43,359 --> 01:57:47,679
you know a long long time ago a king

3871
01:57:44,719 --> 01:57:49,039
that wanted to be great told

3872
01:57:47,679 --> 01:57:50,319
his people that there was a few

3873
01:57:49,039 --> 01:57:51,679
different things that were causing major

3874
01:57:50,319 --> 01:57:52,399
problems for them and if they got rid of

3875
01:57:51,679 --> 01:57:54,319
them they would be

3876
01:57:52,399 --> 01:57:56,559
you know just if they got rid of all of

3877
01:57:54,319 --> 01:57:58,639
them 100 they would be

3878
01:57:56,560 --> 01:58:00,320
uh rich and it was a bird that was

3879
01:57:58,639 --> 01:58:01,840
eating their grain and it was like a bug

3880
01:58:00,319 --> 01:58:04,719
that was causing problems

3881
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:05,039
and you know whatever the pests were and

3882
01:58:04,719 --> 01:58:06,880
so

3883
01:58:05,039 --> 01:58:08,319
they went and they killed all of the

3884
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:09,359
maestro they killed all the birds and

3885
01:58:08,319 --> 01:58:10,880
they killed all of

3886
01:58:09,359 --> 01:58:12,880
those bugs and it was basically like

3887
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:14,800
called upon by the nation to do so and

3888
01:58:12,880 --> 01:58:16,960
everyone had to work endlessly to do it

3889
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:18,719
and had the worst season ever because

3890
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:20,399
unbeknownst to them the bird ate a bug

3891
01:58:18,719 --> 01:58:21,599
that actually ate the crop and kept it

3892
01:58:20,399 --> 01:58:22,799
in balance even though they did take

3893
01:58:21,599 --> 01:58:25,599
some grain

3894
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:26,480
and unbeknownst to them the mice or

3895
01:58:25,599 --> 01:58:28,159
whatever it was

3896
01:58:26,479 --> 01:58:30,079
caused some other function was integral

3897
01:58:28,158 --> 01:58:32,479
to the ecosystem and its function

3898
01:58:30,079 --> 01:58:33,519
and so i don't pretend to know why all

3899
01:58:32,479 --> 01:58:35,439
these bugs are there

3900
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:37,440
but i know that masanobo fukuoko

3901
01:58:35,439 --> 01:58:41,039
mentioned that every year

3902
01:58:37,439 --> 01:58:41,919
the bug life from an entomology

3903
01:58:41,039 --> 01:58:43,439
perspective was

3904
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:44,960
different and the predators were

3905
01:58:43,439 --> 01:58:46,158
different and the bugs that flourish

3906
01:58:44,960 --> 01:58:47,920
were different

3907
01:58:46,158 --> 01:58:49,598
and so if you just wiped one of them out

3908
01:58:47,920 --> 01:58:50,719
it may cause something else to come in

3909
01:58:49,599 --> 01:58:53,840
and wipe you out

3910
01:58:50,719 --> 01:58:55,279
and and so it's interesting that

3911
01:58:53,840 --> 01:58:56,800
i feel like we're gonna have tools like

3912
01:58:55,279 --> 01:58:58,719
the fungus stuff we'll have stuff that

3913
01:58:56,800 --> 01:59:00,560
kills it but it should be more selective

3914
01:58:58,719 --> 01:59:02,079
in organics and i feel like we're always

3915
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:04,480
gonna have to use multiple tools

3916
01:59:02,079 --> 01:59:05,279
to avoid that problem of eradicating

3917
01:59:04,479 --> 01:59:07,759
everything

3918
01:59:05,279 --> 01:59:09,198
and causing your own problem does that

3919
01:59:07,760 --> 01:59:11,360
make sense i kind of beat around the

3920
01:59:09,198 --> 01:59:14,079
bush a lot but it's just

3921
01:59:11,359 --> 01:59:16,000
i think that's good response okay so

3922
01:59:14,079 --> 01:59:19,439
something i wanted to delve more into

3923
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:20,079
was the sar response that's another kind

3924
01:59:19,439 --> 01:59:22,479
of little

3925
01:59:20,079 --> 01:59:23,359
hot topic at the moment something i'm

3926
01:59:22,479 --> 01:59:25,039
not sure

3927
01:59:23,359 --> 01:59:26,799
if it's been specifically said and i

3928
01:59:25,039 --> 01:59:29,599
think people are kind of interested is

3929
01:59:26,800 --> 01:59:30,159
do you think by activating the sar

3930
01:59:29,599 --> 01:59:32,960
response

3931
01:59:30,158 --> 01:59:35,279
in a plant you do increase terpene and

3932
01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:36,319
resin or like there's a chance it would

3933
01:59:35,279 --> 01:59:38,238
because that's what i'm interested in

3934
01:59:36,319 --> 01:59:39,920
knowing is it is it like a direct

3935
01:59:38,238 --> 01:59:43,519
response or like there's a chance it'll

3936
01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:43,520
increase terpenes as a result of that

3937
01:59:43,679 --> 01:59:47,840
i think that there is going to at some

3938
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:49,199
point be for sure direct response and i

3939
01:59:47,840 --> 01:59:50,159
think we're already there where we can

3940
01:59:49,198 --> 01:59:52,238
say

3941
01:59:50,158 --> 01:59:54,319
that when we look at the salicylic acid

3942
01:59:52,238 --> 01:59:55,839
jasminic acid pathway which a lot of

3943
01:59:54,319 --> 01:59:57,359
times what we're keying into when we

3944
01:59:55,840 --> 01:59:58,719
talk about the systemic acquired

3945
01:59:57,359 --> 02:00:00,880
resistance

3946
01:59:58,719 --> 02:00:02,880
it plugs into this network the plant

3947
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:03,520
uses to communicate to other plants and

3948
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:06,079
to

3949
02:00:03,520 --> 02:00:07,119
more accurately prepare for adverse

3950
02:00:06,079 --> 02:00:09,039
conditions

3951
02:00:07,118 --> 02:00:10,399
so a plant a plant can't just get up and

3952
02:00:09,039 --> 02:00:11,760
run away from a storm

3953
02:00:10,399 --> 02:00:12,879
and so it has to weather through it it

3954
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:14,480
can't just get up and run away from

3955
02:00:12,880 --> 02:00:17,520
pests it has to defend itself

3956
02:00:14,479 --> 02:00:18,959
and stay right there so this sar

3957
02:00:17,520 --> 02:00:20,880
response the idea is

3958
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:23,599
is that in nature we can witness where

3959
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:25,599
one plant is infested

3960
02:00:23,599 --> 02:00:27,199
and it sends out a hormone that

3961
02:00:25,599 --> 02:00:29,520
activates the other plant's

3962
02:00:27,198 --> 02:00:31,759
sar response and now they start

3963
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:33,280
preparing their defenses

3964
02:00:31,760 --> 02:00:35,039
and what's interesting is typically

3965
02:00:33,279 --> 02:00:36,639
those defenses are medicinal the

3966
02:00:35,039 --> 02:00:40,158
alkaloids the

3967
02:00:36,639 --> 02:00:41,920
properties that they create are the

3968
02:00:40,158 --> 02:00:43,920
secondary metabolites that are not

3969
02:00:41,920 --> 02:00:44,960
primary to normal growth function like a

3970
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:47,279
leaf

3971
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:48,880
um or a stem and so these secondary

3972
02:00:47,279 --> 02:00:49,920
properties are then increased to be a

3973
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:52,880
pesticide or

3974
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:54,480
whatever that sar response triggered so

3975
02:00:52,880 --> 02:00:56,800
in our planet we're thinking that

3976
02:00:54,479 --> 02:00:58,559
triggering the sar defense response

3977
02:00:56,800 --> 02:01:00,239
without actually hurting the plant will

3978
02:00:58,560 --> 02:01:02,639
give us a benefit of

3979
02:01:00,238 --> 02:01:04,638
turning on more thc increasing terpene

3980
02:01:02,639 --> 02:01:06,480
and terpenoid that might be the actual

3981
02:01:04,639 --> 02:01:07,920
plant defense system and there's

3982
02:01:06,479 --> 02:01:09,678
evidence that leads directly to that it

3983
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:11,520
makes a lot of sense then from

3984
02:01:09,679 --> 02:01:13,359
a plant constituent standpoint that's

3985
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:14,960
what the plant's going to do

3986
02:01:13,359 --> 02:01:16,399
and so then there's correlating studies

3987
02:01:14,960 --> 02:01:18,480
which you can google after this

3988
02:01:16,399 --> 02:01:19,920
and find that there's been studies on

3989
02:01:18,479 --> 02:01:23,279
tobacco and i think on

3990
02:01:19,920 --> 02:01:24,639
tomato both that have um trichomes

3991
02:01:23,279 --> 02:01:26,079
and if you were to scope it they look

3992
02:01:24,639 --> 02:01:27,279
you know like trichomes on a cannabis

3993
02:01:26,079 --> 02:01:29,279
plant

3994
02:01:27,279 --> 02:01:30,800
they were dramatically increased when

3995
02:01:29,279 --> 02:01:32,639
the big

3996
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:34,960
like the wild sage plant that's all

3997
02:01:32,639 --> 02:01:37,440
across the united states

3998
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:39,279
when that plant was intact by pests near

3999
02:01:37,439 --> 02:01:41,759
the growing tobacco or tomato

4000
02:01:39,279 --> 02:01:42,719
and so they then did tests where they

4001
02:01:41,760 --> 02:01:45,760
would relief

4002
02:01:42,719 --> 02:01:49,198
release the methyl jasminate from the

4003
02:01:45,760 --> 02:01:51,520
sage plant and it would activate the sar

4004
02:01:49,198 --> 02:01:53,198
and activate the actual jasminic

4005
02:01:51,520 --> 02:01:56,000
response system in the plants

4006
02:01:53,198 --> 02:01:58,638
and it seems like the jasmine side of it

4007
02:01:56,000 --> 02:02:00,079
is towards finishing our senescence

4008
02:01:58,639 --> 02:02:01,840
and so that's where you'll see products

4009
02:02:00,079 --> 02:02:03,279
like terpinator and other ones

4010
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:05,440
a lot of people think that they're

4011
02:02:03,279 --> 02:02:06,479
playing with jasminic acid to induce

4012
02:02:05,439 --> 02:02:09,118
these responses

4013
02:02:06,479 --> 02:02:11,118
above and beyond just the sulfur then

4014
02:02:09,118 --> 02:02:12,799
they lend itself to the process

4015
02:02:11,118 --> 02:02:14,399
and so if you start looking at jasminic

4016
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:16,079
acid i think you'll be excited about it

4017
02:02:14,399 --> 02:02:18,079
uh we've been wanting to just top dress

4018
02:02:16,079 --> 02:02:20,880
with some sage i actually bought some

4019
02:02:18,079 --> 02:02:22,639
jasmine oil as a way to maybe spray on

4020
02:02:20,880 --> 02:02:24,960
the top dress but i haven't

4021
02:02:22,639 --> 02:02:25,920
had time to do a real side-by-side and

4022
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:27,840
haven't found a way to

4023
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:29,039
maybe send it to a lab and differentiate

4024
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:31,520
accurately um

4025
02:02:29,039 --> 02:02:33,118
what the results are but i do want to do

4026
02:02:31,520 --> 02:02:36,639
that and we'll see if it works

4027
02:02:33,118 --> 02:02:37,359
um and so i guess that's that's my

4028
02:02:36,639 --> 02:02:40,319
thoughts on

4029
02:02:37,359 --> 02:02:41,679
some of these products that might

4030
02:02:40,319 --> 02:02:43,519
stimulate the sar

4031
02:02:41,679 --> 02:02:45,520
i think it's for sure going to get us

4032
02:02:43,520 --> 02:02:46,560
more terpenes more thc but it's just a

4033
02:02:45,520 --> 02:02:48,239
matter of

4034
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:49,760
how much which product how does it

4035
02:02:48,238 --> 02:02:52,158
actually work i don't think we're really

4036
02:02:49,760 --> 02:02:55,199
there yet at least on a scalable

4037
02:02:52,158 --> 02:02:55,920
level an interesting point you brought

4038
02:02:55,198 --> 02:02:57,598
up was

4039
02:02:55,920 --> 02:02:59,599
the terpinator i've heard a lot of

4040
02:02:57,599 --> 02:03:01,440
people talk about this one and the most

4041
02:02:59,599 --> 02:03:04,159
common thing i hear is

4042
02:03:01,439 --> 02:03:06,319
it increases terpene productions but it

4043
02:03:04,158 --> 02:03:07,439
causes everything to kind of smell a bit

4044
02:03:06,319 --> 02:03:10,000
the same

4045
02:03:07,439 --> 02:03:11,519
and i'm thinking yes yeah if that is

4046
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:14,679
jasminic

4047
02:03:11,520 --> 02:03:16,880
acid do you think like that's like

4048
02:03:14,679 --> 02:03:18,239
oversaturation of the receptor and then

4049
02:03:16,880 --> 02:03:20,079
that's what causes everything to be a

4050
02:03:18,238 --> 02:03:22,158
bit the same or do you think like

4051
02:03:20,079 --> 02:03:23,198
i don't know i almost tend to think that

4052
02:03:22,158 --> 02:03:25,198
maybe it's not

4053
02:03:23,198 --> 02:03:26,319
because if everything comes out the same

4054
02:03:25,198 --> 02:03:28,158
maybe there's just

4055
02:03:26,319 --> 02:03:30,000
something in there which is then being

4056
02:03:28,158 --> 02:03:32,638
uptaken and you know what i mean i don't

4057
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:34,319
know what do you think

4058
02:03:32,639 --> 02:03:35,920
yeah i don't know this is so confusing

4059
02:03:34,319 --> 02:03:37,279
to me and i'm this is

4060
02:03:35,920 --> 02:03:39,279
these are the type of conversations that

4061
02:03:37,279 --> 02:03:41,359
i like to have as far as

4062
02:03:39,279 --> 02:03:42,880
the unknown territory when you really

4063
02:03:41,359 --> 02:03:44,399
get into it and being in the industry

4064
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:46,000
and talking about this stuff every day a

4065
02:03:44,399 --> 02:03:47,519
lot of it is just the same conversation

4066
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:49,039
over and over again but when you start

4067
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:50,639
talking about this stuff

4068
02:03:49,039 --> 02:03:52,078
it's exciting because it to me it's like

4069
02:03:50,639 --> 02:03:54,159
well the terpinator

4070
02:03:52,078 --> 02:03:56,000
across the board we've heard people the

4071
02:03:54,158 --> 02:03:58,719
consensus is like you said that

4072
02:03:56,000 --> 02:04:00,000
it creates this blandom and i don't know

4073
02:03:58,719 --> 02:04:01,520
if it's just the people that tend to use

4074
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
those products that are attracted to

4075
02:04:01,520 --> 02:04:04,639
them

4076
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:06,319
and the genetics they're using maybe

4077
02:04:04,639 --> 02:04:08,159
maybe it's not fair maybe that's just

4078
02:04:06,319 --> 02:04:10,559
a judgment that's coming across and the

4079
02:04:08,158 --> 02:04:12,000
style of cultivation but i feel like

4080
02:04:10,560 --> 02:04:13,840
some of the girls i've heard that from

4081
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:15,118
um i trust and respect what they're

4082
02:04:13,840 --> 02:04:16,719
saying and so

4083
02:04:15,118 --> 02:04:18,799
without having used it personally i'm

4084
02:04:16,719 --> 02:04:20,319
just going to say that let's say

4085
02:04:18,800 --> 02:04:22,159
for argument's sake it does make

4086
02:04:20,319 --> 02:04:24,078
everything taste the same

4087
02:04:22,158 --> 02:04:26,078
and now we're looking at jasminic acid

4088
02:04:24,078 --> 02:04:27,359
as potential for one of the reasons why

4089
02:04:26,078 --> 02:04:29,198
and so increasing that

4090
02:04:27,359 --> 02:04:31,519
artificially stimulating that sar

4091
02:04:29,198 --> 02:04:33,439
through the jasminic acid profile

4092
02:04:31,520 --> 02:04:34,960
potentially it only stimulates certain

4093
02:04:33,439 --> 02:04:37,598
ones um

4094
02:04:34,960 --> 02:04:39,679
that the plant can maybe focus on with

4095
02:04:37,599 --> 02:04:41,760
less energy or whatever that

4096
02:04:39,679 --> 02:04:42,960
symptom is but i don't know maybe it

4097
02:04:41,760 --> 02:04:44,719
lends itself to the fact that that

4098
02:04:42,960 --> 02:04:46,399
product terpinator is not necessarily

4099
02:04:44,719 --> 02:04:48,158
just using jasminic acid maybe we're

4100
02:04:46,399 --> 02:04:49,679
completely off base totally wrong and

4101
02:04:48,158 --> 02:04:51,039
that's something completely different

4102
02:04:49,679 --> 02:04:52,800
and that's why it's leading things to

4103
02:04:51,039 --> 02:04:54,639
stay the same so i'd love to do a

4104
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:56,320
product where we have a test where we

4105
02:04:54,639 --> 02:04:57,920
actually compare the jasminic acid see

4106
02:04:56,319 --> 02:04:59,359
if there's a difference if there is a

4107
02:04:57,920 --> 02:05:00,960
difference then now run that against

4108
02:04:59,359 --> 02:05:03,279
terpinator and see if we can correlate

4109
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:05,118
those differences to be similar or not

4110
02:05:03,279 --> 02:05:08,319
because i'd like to think there's a way

4111
02:05:05,118 --> 02:05:10,799
to increase production without actually

4112
02:05:08,319 --> 02:05:12,399
taking that uh you know making

4113
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:14,480
everything bland or making everything

4114
02:05:12,399 --> 02:05:16,879
similar if that makes sense because

4115
02:05:14,479 --> 02:05:17,759
um that's what we want to do in organics

4116
02:05:16,880 --> 02:05:20,400
we want to take

4117
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:21,840
the biggest yield without ever crossing

4118
02:05:20,399 --> 02:05:24,399
the line

4119
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:26,159
of ruining those terpene profiles and

4120
02:05:24,399 --> 02:05:28,000
lowering the quality of the result

4121
02:05:26,158 --> 02:05:29,679
and so if we can find a way to increase

4122
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:31,679
those expressions that means that maybe

4123
02:05:29,679 --> 02:05:34,480
we can follow that with yield

4124
02:05:31,679 --> 02:05:35,359
as well as quality and so um it's

4125
02:05:34,479 --> 02:05:37,039
definitely worth

4126
02:05:35,359 --> 02:05:38,639
talking about um have you played with

4127
02:05:37,039 --> 02:05:40,960
any salicylic acid or anything like that

4128
02:05:38,639 --> 02:05:43,279
or i mean jasminic acid

4129
02:05:40,960 --> 02:05:44,560
no i haven't i've i've tried crazy

4130
02:05:43,279 --> 02:05:47,198
levels of

4131
02:05:44,560 --> 02:05:48,880
salicylic just through uh lots of aloe

4132
02:05:47,198 --> 02:05:50,319
but um have never noticed any

4133
02:05:48,880 --> 02:05:53,840
detrimental effects through that

4134
02:05:50,319 --> 02:05:56,238
thankfully yep me either um

4135
02:05:53,840 --> 02:05:58,000
the consensus out there based on the

4136
02:05:56,238 --> 02:05:59,839
research is that we should avoid using

4137
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:01,599
the salicylic acid as we go into flour

4138
02:05:59,840 --> 02:06:03,119
based on the fact the plant

4139
02:06:01,599 --> 02:06:05,039
kind of sees it like a light switch it's

4140
02:06:03,118 --> 02:06:07,039
either on the salicylic acid side or the

4141
02:06:05,039 --> 02:06:08,560
jasminic acid side and using the

4142
02:06:07,039 --> 02:06:10,319
salicylic acid may

4143
02:06:08,560 --> 02:06:12,320
potentially delay senescence create a

4144
02:06:10,319 --> 02:06:13,840
longer flowering period

4145
02:06:12,319 --> 02:06:15,679
which can be beneficial in some cases

4146
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:17,760
but not others and so

4147
02:06:15,679 --> 02:06:19,440
um i'm intrigued by that and i started

4148
02:06:17,760 --> 02:06:21,039
using aloe all the way through the cycle

4149
02:06:19,439 --> 02:06:23,759
i started using lots of it i didn't

4150
02:06:21,039 --> 02:06:25,118
notice this delayed senescence or this

4151
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:27,360
negative effect

4152
02:06:25,118 --> 02:06:28,319
so that led me to next postulation is it

4153
02:06:27,359 --> 02:06:30,559
that there is

4154
02:06:28,319 --> 02:06:32,238
not enough salicylic acid in the aloe to

4155
02:06:30,560 --> 02:06:34,320
ever be in concern

4156
02:06:32,238 --> 02:06:36,238
and that using just like aspirin or

4157
02:06:34,319 --> 02:06:36,719
maybe a salicylic acid extract would

4158
02:06:36,238 --> 02:06:40,399
actually

4159
02:06:36,719 --> 02:06:41,359
cause these negative effects or if maybe

4160
02:06:40,399 --> 02:06:43,039
it's just

4161
02:06:41,359 --> 02:06:44,479
too much of a direct interpretation of

4162
02:06:43,039 --> 02:06:46,238
the latest research on on these

4163
02:06:44,479 --> 02:06:46,718
components maybe it's more complicated

4164
02:06:46,238 --> 02:06:49,359
than that

4165
02:06:46,719 --> 02:06:50,719
so um i think in time we'll find out but

4166
02:06:49,359 --> 02:06:53,679
i need to do a lot more testing and i

4167
02:06:50,719 --> 02:06:55,520
think the community does too

4168
02:06:53,679 --> 02:06:57,440
so do you think maybe ultimately the

4169
02:06:55,520 --> 02:06:59,520
only safe products to use

4170
02:06:57,439 --> 02:07:02,479
increased terpene content as stuff with

4171
02:06:59,520 --> 02:07:04,079
known sulfur in it

4172
02:07:02,479 --> 02:07:05,678
um sulfur certainly works it's

4173
02:07:04,078 --> 02:07:07,039
definitely a huge part of the process

4174
02:07:05,679 --> 02:07:08,719
and i think the biggest difference is

4175
02:07:07,039 --> 02:07:09,920
going to be if you're low on sulfur

4176
02:07:08,719 --> 02:07:11,118
and one of the things that i noticed

4177
02:07:09,920 --> 02:07:12,078
right away when we were making our

4178
02:07:11,118 --> 02:07:15,118
potting soils

4179
02:07:12,078 --> 02:07:16,399
is that um luxury amounts of sulfur

4180
02:07:15,118 --> 02:07:19,439
didn't cause a problem on the

4181
02:07:16,399 --> 02:07:20,559
on the plant growth

4182
02:07:19,439 --> 02:07:22,078
i think one of the reasons why this

4183
02:07:20,560 --> 02:07:23,520
happened is when i first made a coots

4184
02:07:22,078 --> 02:07:24,000
mix at the beginning i actually made it

4185
02:07:23,520 --> 02:07:26,079
twice

4186
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:27,760
because i could probably find a

4187
02:07:26,078 --> 02:07:30,639
conversation but

4188
02:07:27,760 --> 02:07:32,560
told me to get rock dust and because

4189
02:07:30,639 --> 02:07:35,520
like you said it's it's more of a

4190
02:07:32,560 --> 02:07:37,199
methodology than an exact list at least

4191
02:07:35,520 --> 02:07:39,040
over time how it's evolved

4192
02:07:37,198 --> 02:07:40,559
um i called them and said well i found

4193
02:07:39,039 --> 02:07:42,000
this gypsy that work he goes sure that's

4194
02:07:40,560 --> 02:07:44,159
rock dust that'll work

4195
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:46,960
and so i use four cups per cubic foot of

4196
02:07:44,158 --> 02:07:48,158
just gypsum in the soil recipe

4197
02:07:46,960 --> 02:07:50,399
you know come to find out it's very

4198
02:07:48,158 --> 02:07:52,000
different than rock dust and i i think

4199
02:07:50,399 --> 02:07:52,319
that i finished that conversation with

4200
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,238
him

4201
02:07:52,319 --> 02:07:56,158
and had a laugh about it but i had

4202
02:07:54,238 --> 02:07:56,559
really good results with that grow i

4203
02:07:56,158 --> 02:07:58,638
mean

4204
02:07:56,560 --> 02:08:00,320
really good results and so whether it

4205
02:07:58,639 --> 02:08:02,000
was the calcium or other was the sulfur

4206
02:08:00,319 --> 02:08:03,519
i knew that having luxury levels of

4207
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:05,679
those wasn't going to be a problem

4208
02:08:03,520 --> 02:08:07,199
and since then on soil testing i'll

4209
02:08:05,679 --> 02:08:09,118
notice all of our potting soils that we

4210
02:08:07,198 --> 02:08:10,799
like usually have a lot more sulfur

4211
02:08:09,118 --> 02:08:12,960
than for instance solomon or some of the

4212
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:16,079
others might recommend on a soil test

4213
02:08:12,960 --> 02:08:17,279
so i think that's important um but

4214
02:08:16,078 --> 02:08:21,118
beyond that i feel like

4215
02:08:17,279 --> 02:08:23,599
peak plant health the lighting

4216
02:08:21,118 --> 02:08:24,319
the environment are very play key roles

4217
02:08:23,599 --> 02:08:26,639
and then

4218
02:08:24,319 --> 02:08:28,559
you know obviously secondary from that

4219
02:08:26,639 --> 02:08:30,480
once you get that harvest where there's

4220
02:08:28,560 --> 02:08:32,159
maximum amount of production of terpenes

4221
02:08:30,479 --> 02:08:34,479
and flavors it's it's that

4222
02:08:32,158 --> 02:08:35,920
slow two week dry it's making sure

4223
02:08:34,479 --> 02:08:38,319
everything's taken care of for these

4224
02:08:35,920 --> 02:08:39,760
volatile terps to not disappear on you

4225
02:08:38,319 --> 02:08:41,198
and for the chlorophyll to go away and

4226
02:08:39,760 --> 02:08:42,480
all those other processes that happen

4227
02:08:41,198 --> 02:08:45,198
during the finish

4228
02:08:42,479 --> 02:08:46,559
um but really none of that matters if

4229
02:08:45,198 --> 02:08:48,000
you don't have the right genetics and i

4230
02:08:46,560 --> 02:08:49,440
feel like we can look at every terpene

4231
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,880
enhancer you want if you get the right

4232
02:08:49,439 --> 02:08:52,719
cut it'll change your life

4233
02:08:50,880 --> 02:08:54,639
as far as terpenes and as far as odor

4234
02:08:52,719 --> 02:08:55,920
goes from there

4235
02:08:54,639 --> 02:08:57,920
getting a little bit more motor out of

4236
02:08:55,920 --> 02:08:59,359
the same cut sometimes almost seems

4237
02:08:57,920 --> 02:09:00,480
ridiculous when you find something that

4238
02:08:59,359 --> 02:09:02,319
is that strong

4239
02:09:00,479 --> 02:09:04,399
and in organics it just seems to be at

4240
02:09:02,319 --> 02:09:08,960
the peak production

4241
02:09:04,399 --> 02:09:10,799
of that on a sequoia just seems to be

4242
02:09:08,960 --> 02:09:12,158
fully there in organics so to push it

4243
02:09:10,800 --> 02:09:13,599
one way or another

4244
02:09:12,158 --> 02:09:15,198
it doesn't surprise me to find that

4245
02:09:13,599 --> 02:09:16,880
we're finding more bland taste when we

4246
02:09:15,198 --> 02:09:18,960
push it one direction or more uniform

4247
02:09:16,880 --> 02:09:20,560
flavors i'm just holding out hope that

4248
02:09:18,960 --> 02:09:22,319
we can maybe squeeze more out of it and

4249
02:09:20,560 --> 02:09:24,000
to me that circles back around looking

4250
02:09:22,319 --> 02:09:25,359
at wine

4251
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,719
they haven't been able to squeeze more

4252
02:09:25,359 --> 02:09:27,359
out of it in fact to get more flavor

4253
02:09:26,719 --> 02:09:29,279
they actually

4254
02:09:27,359 --> 02:09:31,198
have less yield and more drought seasons

4255
02:09:29,279 --> 02:09:32,319
and more harsh conditions kind of

4256
02:09:31,198 --> 02:09:35,519
activating that

4257
02:09:32,319 --> 02:09:38,960
sar so um i guess i don't know the

4258
02:09:35,520 --> 02:09:38,960
answer but i'm excited about the topic

4259
02:09:39,679 --> 02:09:43,359
so to jump to something which i think

4260
02:09:41,520 --> 02:09:45,760
people have a bit more faith in its

4261
02:09:43,359 --> 02:09:46,799
actual ability to increase and terpene

4262
02:09:45,760 --> 02:09:49,599
content

4263
02:09:46,800 --> 02:09:51,599
we've seen the rise of ceramic metal

4264
02:09:49,599 --> 02:09:53,920
halides and the lec

4265
02:09:51,599 --> 02:09:55,840
lights which are kind of how shall we

4266
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:56,719
say overtake and just general metal

4267
02:09:55,840 --> 02:09:59,520
halides in

4268
02:09:56,719 --> 02:10:00,960
people's usage nowadays do you believe

4269
02:09:59,520 --> 02:10:03,040
that these ones do

4270
02:10:00,960 --> 02:10:04,560
likewise increase the resin content it's

4271
02:10:03,039 --> 02:10:06,158
really commonly quoted and

4272
02:10:04,560 --> 02:10:08,639
i think i probably believe a little bit

4273
02:10:06,158 --> 02:10:09,759
myself if not if not it just gives a

4274
02:10:08,639 --> 02:10:11,920
more favorable

4275
02:10:09,760 --> 02:10:13,360
flavor profile in my opinion how do you

4276
02:10:11,920 --> 02:10:15,679
feel about them and if so

4277
02:10:13,359 --> 02:10:17,198
do you feel like it's kind of a game of

4278
02:10:15,679 --> 02:10:18,480
trying to stack all these things

4279
02:10:17,198 --> 02:10:20,559
together which

4280
02:10:18,479 --> 02:10:22,559
maybe do you know cumulatively

4281
02:10:20,560 --> 02:10:25,760
cumulative cumulatively

4282
02:10:22,560 --> 02:10:27,840
sorry add uh you know little bits of

4283
02:10:25,760 --> 02:10:31,280
extra production here and there to

4284
02:10:27,840 --> 02:10:31,279
result in a better end product

4285
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:35,359
um yeah i feel that the ceramic metal

4286
02:10:34,238 --> 02:10:36,638
halide

4287
02:10:35,359 --> 02:10:40,000
you know we carry a product called

4288
02:10:36,639 --> 02:10:42,239
indomax made in colorado

4289
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:44,078
and i really like it um let's start off

4290
02:10:42,238 --> 02:10:44,399
with leds we noticed a difference over

4291
02:10:44,078 --> 02:10:47,759
the

4292
02:10:44,399 --> 02:10:50,319
typical um high pressure sodium

4293
02:10:47,760 --> 02:10:52,320
or typical metal halide and previous to

4294
02:10:50,319 --> 02:10:54,319
that i'd often use two six hundreds

4295
02:10:52,319 --> 02:10:56,078
over a four by four area one you know

4296
02:10:54,319 --> 02:10:58,078
metal halide one hps and i got really

4297
02:10:56,078 --> 02:10:59,439
good results mixing the spectrums

4298
02:10:58,078 --> 02:11:01,039
i've also played with flowering with

4299
02:10:59,439 --> 02:11:02,879
both bulbs and i've noticed that i can

4300
02:11:01,039 --> 02:11:04,560
get similar results under metal halide

4301
02:11:02,880 --> 02:11:06,078
as i could high pressure sodium maybe

4302
02:11:04,560 --> 02:11:07,440
just different maybe a little more frost

4303
02:11:06,078 --> 02:11:10,639
maybe a little less yield but

4304
02:11:07,439 --> 02:11:12,238
ballpark same numbers and so uh when

4305
02:11:10,639 --> 02:11:13,279
ceramic metal halide came out i kind of

4306
02:11:12,238 --> 02:11:15,598
wrote it off

4307
02:11:13,279 --> 02:11:17,039
and i wanted to use it in veg and still

4308
02:11:15,599 --> 02:11:19,199
playing around with flour but i feel

4309
02:11:17,039 --> 02:11:20,078
like the results were just staggering

4310
02:11:19,198 --> 02:11:22,638
and veg the

4311
02:11:20,078 --> 02:11:24,559
health of the growth is just phenomenal

4312
02:11:22,639 --> 02:11:25,279
and the power behind the lower wattage

4313
02:11:24,560 --> 02:11:27,440
was

4314
02:11:25,279 --> 02:11:28,559
really um intriguing to me so we're

4315
02:11:27,439 --> 02:11:29,759
still playing with them we're still

4316
02:11:28,560 --> 02:11:30,800
learning how to use them properly i

4317
02:11:29,760 --> 02:11:33,920
think

4318
02:11:30,800 --> 02:11:36,159
um i i played around with using one 315

4319
02:11:33,920 --> 02:11:37,440
and a 4x4 and while it works i really

4320
02:11:36,158 --> 02:11:38,638
think that using two of them is going to

4321
02:11:37,439 --> 02:11:40,238
be key

4322
02:11:38,639 --> 02:11:41,679
and a lot of people will say the same

4323
02:11:40,238 --> 02:11:43,519
thing but even then

4324
02:11:41,679 --> 02:11:45,118
efficiency wise they work better and so

4325
02:11:43,520 --> 02:11:45,520
i'll circle back around we talked about

4326
02:11:45,118 --> 02:11:48,799
the new

4327
02:11:45,520 --> 02:11:50,239
the the uh terpene content and the frost

4328
02:11:48,800 --> 02:11:52,639
i definitely notice a better outcome

4329
02:11:50,238 --> 02:11:54,638
when using a more full spectrum light

4330
02:11:52,639 --> 02:11:56,159
whether that's led or cmh i don't think

4331
02:11:54,639 --> 02:11:57,279
it matters all that matters is that

4332
02:11:56,158 --> 02:11:58,960
you're comparing

4333
02:11:57,279 --> 02:12:01,118
not the technology but you're actually

4334
02:11:58,960 --> 02:12:02,319
comparing the spectrum of output

4335
02:12:01,118 --> 02:12:04,158
and there's been so much further

4336
02:12:02,319 --> 02:12:06,319
research indicating that green light

4337
02:12:04,158 --> 02:12:07,519
is such a powerful driver in this

4338
02:12:06,319 --> 02:12:10,479
conversation

4339
02:12:07,520 --> 02:12:12,000
that's been cut out of most grove lights

4340
02:12:10,479 --> 02:12:12,799
the way i've been heard it put is it's

4341
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,639
like

4342
02:12:12,800 --> 02:12:16,560
the grow lights we used before worked

4343
02:12:14,639 --> 02:12:19,039
really well but it's almost like

4344
02:12:16,560 --> 02:12:20,239
junk food for the plants where the

4345
02:12:19,039 --> 02:12:22,960
lights we're using now

4346
02:12:20,238 --> 02:12:23,678
is like a full spectrum health food diet

4347
02:12:22,960 --> 02:12:27,118
of

4348
02:12:23,679 --> 02:12:28,639
more finished more complete spectrum

4349
02:12:27,118 --> 02:12:30,479
that the plants are able to show you

4350
02:12:28,639 --> 02:12:31,679
their genetic potential and fully

4351
02:12:30,479 --> 02:12:33,678
complete their process

4352
02:12:31,679 --> 02:12:34,800
better and so it makes sense and i think

4353
02:12:33,679 --> 02:12:36,239
we're going to continue to get better

4354
02:12:34,800 --> 02:12:37,920
but we're still been making the sun i

4355
02:12:36,238 --> 02:12:39,759
feel like the sun does the best job it's

4356
02:12:37,920 --> 02:12:40,800
really amazing to see how powerful these

4357
02:12:39,760 --> 02:12:43,840
plants grow out

4358
02:12:40,800 --> 02:12:47,679
outdoors in the sun or in a greenhouse

4359
02:12:43,840 --> 02:12:51,520
and um i think there's more behind it

4360
02:12:47,679 --> 02:12:53,199
you know than just the um

4361
02:12:51,520 --> 02:12:54,880
type of light like i mentioned it's all

4362
02:12:53,198 --> 02:12:57,439
about that spectrum but

4363
02:12:54,880 --> 02:12:59,599
i will say for sure more terpenes more

4364
02:12:57,439 --> 02:13:02,158
frost and stuff out of a more

4365
02:12:59,599 --> 02:13:04,719
quality full spectrum light whatever the

4366
02:13:02,158 --> 02:13:07,198
uh type of light it is

4367
02:13:04,719 --> 02:13:09,279
definitely agree with you on that one so

4368
02:13:07,198 --> 02:13:11,519
here's an interesting idea i've had

4369
02:13:09,279 --> 02:13:13,359
i've seen plants before grown with just

4370
02:13:11,520 --> 02:13:15,679
water in a well-built soil

4371
02:13:13,359 --> 02:13:16,719
and they look great and then i've seen

4372
02:13:15,679 --> 02:13:19,920
other plants

4373
02:13:16,719 --> 02:13:21,439
looking similar and in a well-built soil

4374
02:13:19,920 --> 02:13:22,880
just been giving water only and then

4375
02:13:21,439 --> 02:13:24,238
maybe they're given a tea

4376
02:13:22,880 --> 02:13:26,078
so they're giving you know a bit more

4377
02:13:24,238 --> 02:13:27,039
nutrients than the other one got for

4378
02:13:26,078 --> 02:13:28,479
example

4379
02:13:27,039 --> 02:13:30,158
and they weren't showing any signs of

4380
02:13:28,479 --> 02:13:30,879
deficiency they look very healthy in

4381
02:13:30,158 --> 02:13:32,319
fact

4382
02:13:30,880 --> 02:13:34,719
but then they have this like you know

4383
02:13:32,319 --> 02:13:35,920
this bloom of growth and so it makes you

4384
02:13:34,719 --> 02:13:37,920
realize well

4385
02:13:35,920 --> 02:13:39,199
maybe there are times when the plants

4386
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:40,960
could be

4387
02:13:39,198 --> 02:13:43,198
so to speak eating more than what's at

4388
02:13:40,960 --> 02:13:44,078
the table but it still looks reasonably

4389
02:13:43,198 --> 02:13:46,319
happy

4390
02:13:44,078 --> 02:13:48,158
do you kind of agree with that analysis

4391
02:13:46,319 --> 02:13:50,319
and if so would that not lend to the

4392
02:13:48,158 --> 02:13:52,238
idea of like even with a well-built soil

4393
02:13:50,319 --> 02:13:54,399
maybe giving an additional

4394
02:13:52,238 --> 02:13:57,678
you know amino acid fertilizer here or

4395
02:13:54,399 --> 02:13:59,598
there is not a bad idea

4396
02:13:57,679 --> 02:14:01,359
yeah i agree with you 100 and i've

4397
02:13:59,599 --> 02:14:04,880
wrestled with this as far as the

4398
02:14:01,359 --> 02:14:06,078
romancing the idea of water only and

4399
02:14:04,880 --> 02:14:07,679
you know water only was something you

4400
02:14:06,078 --> 02:14:08,319
heard for so long in the no-till

4401
02:14:07,679 --> 02:14:11,440
community

4402
02:14:08,319 --> 02:14:13,920
and i feel like it was because

4403
02:14:11,439 --> 02:14:15,759
if we were really to show the hydro

4404
02:14:13,920 --> 02:14:17,359
community how kind of crazy we were and

4405
02:14:15,760 --> 02:14:18,880
how much stuff we wanted to do to try

4406
02:14:17,359 --> 02:14:20,399
and do this organically

4407
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:22,078
they'd just write us off as ladies like

4408
02:14:20,399 --> 02:14:23,439
they already did and so now

4409
02:14:22,078 --> 02:14:25,279
coming around full circle if we could

4410
02:14:23,439 --> 02:14:26,319
just build a soil and water only and

4411
02:14:25,279 --> 02:14:28,800
actually do better than them

4412
02:14:26,319 --> 02:14:29,599
it would who's laughing now and it's

4413
02:14:28,800 --> 02:14:31,039
proven to work

4414
02:14:29,599 --> 02:14:33,039
but here's the difference i think that

4415
02:14:31,039 --> 02:14:34,960
you have to use a larger volume of soil

4416
02:14:33,039 --> 02:14:36,399
you want to have a very quality soil and

4417
02:14:34,960 --> 02:14:37,679
not everybody can start off with that

4418
02:14:36,399 --> 02:14:40,319
exact

4419
02:14:37,679 --> 02:14:41,760
high quality very balanced soil so

4420
02:14:40,319 --> 02:14:44,158
taking from that

4421
02:14:41,760 --> 02:14:45,920
perfect effect everybody's soil might be

4422
02:14:44,158 --> 02:14:47,519
you know however many steps removed from

4423
02:14:45,920 --> 02:14:49,039
that perfect soil

4424
02:14:47,520 --> 02:14:51,840
i found that even when you have the

4425
02:14:49,039 --> 02:14:54,560
perfect soil as you mentioned

4426
02:14:51,840 --> 02:14:55,360
giving the plant an easier way to go and

4427
02:14:54,560 --> 02:14:57,840
not

4428
02:14:55,359 --> 02:14:58,960
not necessarily bypassing the soil food

4429
02:14:57,840 --> 02:15:01,599
web but

4430
02:14:58,960 --> 02:15:03,279
making the work the soil food web has to

4431
02:15:01,599 --> 02:15:06,480
do easier

4432
02:15:03,279 --> 02:15:09,198
and somehow more efficient seems to give

4433
02:15:06,479 --> 02:15:12,238
the plant

4434
02:15:09,198 --> 02:15:13,039
a faster speed of growth that suits us

4435
02:15:12,238 --> 02:15:15,678
well for our

4436
02:15:13,039 --> 02:15:17,039
time frame and now one of the things

4437
02:15:15,679 --> 02:15:18,000
that i'll consider though is that when i

4438
02:15:17,039 --> 02:15:21,118
started no-till

4439
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:23,039
i was perpetually growing and for my own

4440
02:15:21,118 --> 02:15:24,559
needs i would have a tent where i had

4441
02:15:23,039 --> 02:15:25,359
several plants in there and the plant in

4442
02:15:24,560 --> 02:15:27,280
the left corner

4443
02:15:25,359 --> 02:15:29,118
might be about to finish the plant next

4444
02:15:27,279 --> 02:15:30,319
to it might be one week behind and the

4445
02:15:29,118 --> 02:15:32,479
plant next to that

4446
02:15:30,319 --> 02:15:34,399
one week behind that and i got to tell

4447
02:15:32,479 --> 02:15:35,519
you in living soil that made my life

4448
02:15:34,399 --> 02:15:36,960
easy i'd water them all

4449
02:15:35,520 --> 02:15:38,079
just water and they all did great and i

4450
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:39,920
could harvest them all at different

4451
02:15:38,078 --> 02:15:41,759
times and keep it perpetual

4452
02:15:39,920 --> 02:15:43,760
but i'll tell you that the reason why it

4453
02:15:41,760 --> 02:15:46,560
worked for me is because i was perpetual

4454
02:15:43,760 --> 02:15:48,800
the speed of the vegetative growth

4455
02:15:46,560 --> 02:15:50,480
was completely irrelevant to me as long

4456
02:15:48,800 --> 02:15:51,520
as i had healthy plants of the

4457
02:15:50,479 --> 02:15:53,519
appropriate size

4458
02:15:51,520 --> 02:15:54,719
on deck to go into flower when i needed

4459
02:15:53,520 --> 02:15:56,320
them to

4460
02:15:54,719 --> 02:15:57,599
and then from there i didn't necessarily

4461
02:15:56,319 --> 02:15:59,599
need to get the biggest yield as long as

4462
02:15:57,599 --> 02:16:01,360
the best quality so adding extra things

4463
02:15:59,599 --> 02:16:03,360
would only take away from my budget and

4464
02:16:01,359 --> 02:16:06,399
not necessarily add a dramatic

4465
02:16:03,359 --> 02:16:07,920
increase on my life for the effort

4466
02:16:06,399 --> 02:16:09,920
and so i think everybody needs to filter

4467
02:16:07,920 --> 02:16:11,279
it through the process that way you know

4468
02:16:09,920 --> 02:16:13,199
if you're busy and you just need some

4469
02:16:11,279 --> 02:16:15,039
herb and you want it to be very good

4470
02:16:13,198 --> 02:16:17,759
build the soil water it have a great

4471
02:16:15,039 --> 02:16:19,439
time do not overthink this i do not want

4472
02:16:17,760 --> 02:16:20,800
someone to get into gardening and go i

4473
02:16:19,439 --> 02:16:23,359
can't do that i can

4474
02:16:20,800 --> 02:16:25,119
tease my wife it's gonna smell i don't

4475
02:16:23,359 --> 02:16:27,039
want to have any of these amendments

4476
02:16:25,118 --> 02:16:28,639
stop it at build a soil we have a basic

4477
02:16:27,039 --> 02:16:30,479
amendment chart you can use purchase

4478
02:16:28,639 --> 02:16:32,159
products and go through a kind of a

4479
02:16:30,479 --> 02:16:33,279
no-till grow with some additives

4480
02:16:32,159 --> 02:16:35,920
that'll make it easier for you

4481
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:37,920
especially in a smaller container

4482
02:16:35,920 --> 02:16:40,478
but from there um instead of just doing

4483
02:16:37,920 --> 02:16:42,000
the water only like we talked about

4484
02:16:40,478 --> 02:16:43,599
there are so many things you can do to

4485
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:45,040
speed up the process so it can fit your

4486
02:16:43,599 --> 02:16:46,079
time frame a little bit i think you can

4487
02:16:45,040 --> 02:16:47,599
increase the yield

4488
02:16:46,079 --> 02:16:49,280
i think you can play around with the

4489
02:16:47,599 --> 02:16:52,000
phenotypic expressions

4490
02:16:49,280 --> 02:16:52,719
based on the inputs we're playing with

4491
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,879
and so

4492
02:16:52,718 --> 02:16:56,398
i mean what enthusiasts wouldn't want to

4493
02:16:54,879 --> 02:16:57,199
have a little bit of say in what's going

4494
02:16:56,398 --> 02:16:59,279
on and so i

4495
02:16:57,200 --> 02:17:00,800
found that overwhelmingly most of us

4496
02:16:59,280 --> 02:17:02,319
know till growers we're wanting to do

4497
02:17:00,799 --> 02:17:04,478
more than just water

4498
02:17:02,318 --> 02:17:05,359
whether it's a sprouted ct an amino acid

4499
02:17:04,478 --> 02:17:07,760
here

4500
02:17:05,359 --> 02:17:09,920
the consensus across the board is while

4501
02:17:07,760 --> 02:17:11,359
you may not need to

4502
02:17:09,920 --> 02:17:13,359
depending on what you do there's a

4503
02:17:11,359 --> 02:17:13,840
definite increased return on investment

4504
02:17:13,359 --> 02:17:16,559
from

4505
02:17:13,840 --> 02:17:17,439
doing a little bit of extra effort um

4506
02:17:16,558 --> 02:17:18,718
and i think

4507
02:17:17,439 --> 02:17:20,639
you probably found the same thing you

4508
02:17:18,718 --> 02:17:23,759
alluded to it um

4509
02:17:20,638 --> 02:17:23,759
has that been your experience

4510
02:17:23,920 --> 02:17:28,079
yeah jeff yeah so what i found is i've

4511
02:17:26,879 --> 02:17:32,318
got this awesome

4512
02:17:28,079 --> 02:17:35,519
um liquid aloe ferment from my homie

4513
02:17:32,318 --> 02:17:36,239
and basically it's amazing but the the

4514
02:17:35,519 --> 02:17:37,519
overall

4515
02:17:36,239 --> 02:17:39,039
thing i wanted to quickly mention is

4516
02:17:37,519 --> 02:17:40,880
what i've found through my own

4517
02:17:39,040 --> 02:17:44,319
experience is that

4518
02:17:40,879 --> 02:17:46,000
the the quality is always superior

4519
02:17:44,318 --> 02:17:47,599
the less you give it so i've

4520
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:50,398
consistently had like

4521
02:17:47,599 --> 02:17:51,840
the highest quality in my opinion when

4522
02:17:50,398 --> 02:17:53,599
it's just water only

4523
02:17:51,840 --> 02:17:55,679
and and in my opinion i've almost found

4524
02:17:53,599 --> 02:17:57,040
the more you add a tea the more you add

4525
02:17:55,679 --> 02:17:58,638
these other things

4526
02:17:57,040 --> 02:17:59,920
it's almost it almost changes it a

4527
02:17:58,638 --> 02:18:01,598
little bit and it's all you know the

4528
02:17:59,920 --> 02:18:03,599
terroir has always been like

4529
02:18:01,599 --> 02:18:05,519
the best when it was just pure water

4530
02:18:03,599 --> 02:18:06,799
only and so it was interesting to me to

4531
02:18:05,519 --> 02:18:08,840
see that and i think

4532
02:18:06,799 --> 02:18:10,638
i'm going to give that a go in the

4533
02:18:08,840 --> 02:18:13,200
future

4534
02:18:10,638 --> 02:18:14,398
yes if you could resist the temptation

4535
02:18:13,200 --> 02:18:17,359
to add other stuff

4536
02:18:14,398 --> 02:18:19,199
which let's face it the nature of build

4537
02:18:17,359 --> 02:18:19,760
a soil working with a lot of people that

4538
02:18:19,200 --> 02:18:22,319
if they're

4539
02:18:19,760 --> 02:18:23,359
contacting me and asking me questions

4540
02:18:22,318 --> 02:18:25,119
sometimes it's to have

4541
02:18:23,359 --> 02:18:26,079
conversations like this but more often

4542
02:18:25,120 --> 02:18:27,439
than not it's because they're trying to

4543
02:18:26,079 --> 02:18:29,039
learn the basics

4544
02:18:27,439 --> 02:18:30,479
and a lot of times they're in a five

4545
02:18:29,040 --> 02:18:31,920
gallon container they haven't followed

4546
02:18:30,478 --> 02:18:32,959
the rules right they don't have a mulch

4547
02:18:31,920 --> 02:18:34,879
layer and so

4548
02:18:32,959 --> 02:18:36,079
you using a lot of these secondary

4549
02:18:34,879 --> 02:18:37,358
products will produce really good

4550
02:18:36,079 --> 02:18:39,039
results for them

4551
02:18:37,359 --> 02:18:41,040
but like you i've noticed that when the

4552
02:18:39,040 --> 02:18:43,280
plant is maybe

4553
02:18:41,040 --> 02:18:46,000
forced to work as hard as possible to

4554
02:18:43,280 --> 02:18:47,920
get all of its nutrients

4555
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:49,120
you may not get that biggest yield but

4556
02:18:47,920 --> 02:18:51,920
the quality is

4557
02:18:49,120 --> 02:18:54,000
absolutely undeniable and one of the

4558
02:18:51,920 --> 02:18:55,519
things that i will add to that is that

4559
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,959
when i notice dispensaries that come

4560
02:18:55,519 --> 02:18:58,639
online get a whole bunch like a

4561
02:18:56,959 --> 02:18:59,039
truckload of our soil they fill up the

4562
02:18:58,638 --> 02:19:00,718
room

4563
02:18:59,040 --> 02:19:02,080
they got a grower that knows how to do

4564
02:19:00,718 --> 02:19:04,638
the no-till

4565
02:19:02,079 --> 02:19:07,599
they usually just crush their first

4566
02:19:04,638 --> 02:19:09,679
round they love it they do a great job

4567
02:19:07,599 --> 02:19:11,200
it's after that that it becomes

4568
02:19:09,679 --> 02:19:13,280
interesting when they're in containers

4569
02:19:11,200 --> 02:19:14,639
to see if they keep the habits that will

4570
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:16,079
keep yield up

4571
02:19:14,638 --> 02:19:17,598
or whether they're going to have to grab

4572
02:19:16,079 --> 02:19:18,799
some of these products like aminos and

4573
02:19:17,599 --> 02:19:20,799
all the other stuff

4574
02:19:18,799 --> 02:19:21,920
or whether you continue to just do water

4575
02:19:20,799 --> 02:19:24,239
only and so

4576
02:19:21,920 --> 02:19:26,239
the home grower i think you've got kind

4577
02:19:24,239 --> 02:19:28,239
of a luxury of having a small garden

4578
02:19:26,239 --> 02:19:29,519
and you can do just water only and the

4579
02:19:28,239 --> 02:19:31,760
results really are

4580
02:19:29,519 --> 02:19:32,719
pretty astounding in fact i'd like to do

4581
02:19:31,760 --> 02:19:34,398
it side by side

4582
02:19:32,718 --> 02:19:35,839
as far as like back back rounds once we

4583
02:19:34,398 --> 02:19:36,478
start running the same cut over and over

4584
02:19:35,840 --> 02:19:38,880
again

4585
02:19:36,478 --> 02:19:40,558
and we'll do the full system against

4586
02:19:38,879 --> 02:19:43,279
water only and we'll compare terpene

4587
02:19:40,558 --> 02:19:44,718
profile yield and all that stuff

4588
02:19:43,280 --> 02:19:47,200
that'll be very interesting to see the

4589
02:19:44,718 --> 02:19:48,239
results so with that same kind of topic

4590
02:19:47,200 --> 02:19:50,159
in mind

4591
02:19:48,239 --> 02:19:51,840
do you think it's possible to overdo it

4592
02:19:50,159 --> 02:19:53,920
with teas or are you just

4593
02:19:51,840 --> 02:19:55,920
wasting tea at a certain point like do

4594
02:19:53,920 --> 02:19:59,200
you get negative effects from tea

4595
02:19:55,920 --> 02:20:00,559
at some point or is it just wasting it

4596
02:19:59,200 --> 02:20:02,240
i think that depends on your definition

4597
02:20:00,559 --> 02:20:03,760
of tea i feel like for the most part if

4598
02:20:02,239 --> 02:20:04,799
you're doing something very diluted or

4599
02:20:03,760 --> 02:20:07,520
just microbial

4600
02:20:04,799 --> 02:20:08,959
in nature pretty much just waste an

4601
02:20:07,520 --> 02:20:10,159
effort at a certain point

4602
02:20:08,959 --> 02:20:11,358
there's just going to be a diminishing

4603
02:20:10,159 --> 02:20:13,119
point of return where you don't see

4604
02:20:11,359 --> 02:20:15,520
really increased plant growth

4605
02:20:13,120 --> 02:20:16,880
and for the most part you could have

4606
02:20:15,520 --> 02:20:18,079
probably just used water i mean plants

4607
02:20:16,879 --> 02:20:19,039
like water you know

4608
02:20:18,079 --> 02:20:21,680
you don't always have to give them

4609
02:20:19,040 --> 02:20:23,040
something um and then the other

4610
02:20:21,680 --> 02:20:24,398
consideration is if you're making a

4611
02:20:23,040 --> 02:20:26,000
nutrient tea and you're doing it all the

4612
02:20:24,398 --> 02:20:27,279
time you can certainly overdo it there's

4613
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:30,000
a point where you're putting just so

4614
02:20:27,280 --> 02:20:31,120
many soluble nutrients in there of one

4615
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,559
of one type or another that it's

4616
02:20:31,120 --> 02:20:34,079
starting to skew the balance that we

4617
02:20:32,559 --> 02:20:35,680
worked so hard to get

4618
02:20:34,079 --> 02:20:38,079
in a living soil and what's great about

4619
02:20:35,680 --> 02:20:39,200
living soil is it can exchange nutrients

4620
02:20:38,079 --> 02:20:41,039
positive or negatively

4621
02:20:39,200 --> 02:20:42,800
it can change the ph around the

4622
02:20:41,040 --> 02:20:44,000
rhizosphere and i think a lot of that is

4623
02:20:42,799 --> 02:20:46,398
predicated upon the fact

4624
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:48,719
that there's not some consistent outside

4625
02:20:46,398 --> 02:20:51,519
source constantly changing

4626
02:20:48,719 --> 02:20:53,358
what that soil actually is to the plant

4627
02:20:51,520 --> 02:20:55,359
and so you can overdo it when you do a

4628
02:20:53,359 --> 02:20:58,159
lot of nutrients

4629
02:20:55,359 --> 02:20:59,520
conversely if you do top dressing though

4630
02:20:58,159 --> 02:21:00,879
it's a little harder to overdo it i mean

4631
02:20:59,520 --> 02:21:01,359
you're going to be limited by the space

4632
02:21:00,879 --> 02:21:04,318
you have

4633
02:21:01,359 --> 02:21:06,318
on top and it's not necessarily directly

4634
02:21:04,318 --> 02:21:07,279
interacting with the rhizosphere so

4635
02:21:06,318 --> 02:21:08,799
directly

4636
02:21:07,280 --> 02:21:10,399
and a lot of times it's not so

4637
02:21:08,799 --> 02:21:11,679
micronized where it's carried right into

4638
02:21:10,398 --> 02:21:14,000
that root zone

4639
02:21:11,680 --> 02:21:15,200
so top dressing a little more forgiving

4640
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:17,120
and i feel like that's why a lot of

4641
02:21:15,200 --> 02:21:19,120
no-till people that are doing water only

4642
02:21:17,120 --> 02:21:21,439
will still do some top dressing because

4643
02:21:19,120 --> 02:21:22,319
we're removing biomass each cycle and

4644
02:21:21,439 --> 02:21:23,680
unless we're adding

4645
02:21:22,318 --> 02:21:26,799
something back to the soil we're

4646
02:21:23,680 --> 02:21:28,960
eventually going to have deficiencies

4647
02:21:26,799 --> 02:21:30,799
exactly so one idea i wanted to run by

4648
02:21:28,959 --> 02:21:33,119
you though is a few people had expressed

4649
02:21:30,799 --> 02:21:34,879
this idea to me and i wanted to

4650
02:21:33,120 --> 02:21:37,520
see if you think there's any major flaw

4651
02:21:34,879 --> 02:21:39,759
in it i kind of was asking people like

4652
02:21:37,520 --> 02:21:40,800
what they thought a tea was actually

4653
02:21:39,760 --> 02:21:42,800
doing

4654
02:21:40,799 --> 02:21:44,559
for the microlife and the nutrients in

4655
02:21:42,799 --> 02:21:45,279
their pot and the general answer i got

4656
02:21:44,559 --> 02:21:47,439
was

4657
02:21:45,280 --> 02:21:49,600
it's kind of a way of like artificially

4658
02:21:47,439 --> 02:21:50,239
injecting nutrients and microbes into

4659
02:21:49,600 --> 02:21:51,920
the pot

4660
02:21:50,239 --> 02:21:53,840
and over a few days it's going to kind

4661
02:21:51,920 --> 02:21:56,799
of

4662
02:21:53,840 --> 02:21:59,040
re-establish the new levels and then

4663
02:21:56,799 --> 02:22:00,799
maybe that's when you'd apply another t

4664
02:21:59,040 --> 02:22:02,960
do you think that's kind of the way it

4665
02:22:00,799 --> 02:22:04,959
works or it's that's like too simplistic

4666
02:22:02,959 --> 02:22:06,318
of a view

4667
02:22:04,959 --> 02:22:09,279
no i think that's the way it works i

4668
02:22:06,318 --> 02:22:11,439
mean we're all creating this picture in

4669
02:22:09,280 --> 02:22:13,040
our mind of what happens when we pour a

4670
02:22:11,439 --> 02:22:13,439
tea on there we can look at a microscope

4671
02:22:13,040 --> 02:22:16,640
and see

4672
02:22:13,439 --> 02:22:17,040
all the biology that's in the tea we can

4673
02:22:16,639 --> 02:22:19,840
take

4674
02:22:17,040 --> 02:22:21,280
a bit of our soil and do a paste like do

4675
02:22:19,840 --> 02:22:23,120
a liquid extract

4676
02:22:21,280 --> 02:22:24,960
of that throw that under the scope and

4677
02:22:23,120 --> 02:22:26,399
see the biology that's in there

4678
02:22:24,959 --> 02:22:28,239
and as close as we can tell a lot of it

4679
02:22:26,398 --> 02:22:30,559
looks pretty similar but you know

4680
02:22:28,239 --> 02:22:32,079
coot he didn't do any compost teas when

4681
02:22:30,559 --> 02:22:33,279
he teaches me he goes how the hell am i

4682
02:22:32,079 --> 02:22:34,318
supposed to know of all that bacteria

4683
02:22:33,280 --> 02:22:35,840
we're growing in a

4684
02:22:34,318 --> 02:22:37,119
bucket of water anything like the

4685
02:22:35,840 --> 02:22:39,680
bacteria that should be growing in your

4686
02:22:37,120 --> 02:22:41,840
soil in totally different conditions

4687
02:22:39,680 --> 02:22:43,040
and so i think that's where we get the

4688
02:22:41,840 --> 02:22:44,559
people saying there has to be a certain

4689
02:22:43,040 --> 02:22:45,760
dissolved oxygen level and that's how

4690
02:22:44,559 --> 02:22:47,680
you know it's going to be anaerobic and

4691
02:22:45,760 --> 02:22:49,280
more like the soil conditions

4692
02:22:47,680 --> 02:22:51,040
and kuko is great but why don't you

4693
02:22:49,280 --> 02:22:52,880
throw a handful of castings on there and

4694
02:22:51,040 --> 02:22:54,560
i know it's just like the soil or put

4695
02:22:52,879 --> 02:22:56,000
worms in there and we know it's exactly

4696
02:22:54,559 --> 02:22:58,478
how it's supposed to be

4697
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:59,280
so i feel like you can kind of over

4698
02:22:58,478 --> 02:23:01,679
think

4699
02:22:59,280 --> 02:23:03,040
any of these things and as far as i

4700
02:23:01,680 --> 02:23:04,000
understand it just like everybody else

4701
02:23:03,040 --> 02:23:06,800
you brew up a tea

4702
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:09,600
and let's say it's a bacterial tea or

4703
02:23:06,799 --> 02:23:12,318
fungal whatever it's not a nutrient tea

4704
02:23:09,600 --> 02:23:13,600
and it's either completely your molasses

4705
02:23:12,318 --> 02:23:16,000
or fish and it's basically

4706
02:23:13,600 --> 02:23:17,760
just biology at this point you pour it

4707
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:19,840
into your soil

4708
02:23:17,760 --> 02:23:20,800
the idea is is that they will go in

4709
02:23:19,840 --> 02:23:23,760
there and

4710
02:23:20,799 --> 02:23:24,639
the bacteria is going to need food and

4711
02:23:23,760 --> 02:23:26,639
they're going to start to

4712
02:23:24,639 --> 02:23:28,239
eat some of the organic material and

4713
02:23:26,639 --> 02:23:30,719
start to release

4714
02:23:28,239 --> 02:23:32,719
some of the inorganic nutrients that our

4715
02:23:30,719 --> 02:23:34,478
plants can absorb

4716
02:23:32,719 --> 02:23:36,398
until they are released through the

4717
02:23:34,478 --> 02:23:38,079
cation exchange and they have to be done

4718
02:23:36,398 --> 02:23:39,358
through biology so you dump all this

4719
02:23:38,079 --> 02:23:41,039
biology on it just goes through and

4720
02:23:39,359 --> 02:23:42,559
releases nutrients the plant can then

4721
02:23:41,040 --> 02:23:45,280
get a release

4722
02:23:42,559 --> 02:23:47,359
and they get to grow and i feel like

4723
02:23:45,280 --> 02:23:49,680
it's this cycle where they get

4724
02:23:47,359 --> 02:23:50,399
to work on their own almost like a an

4725
02:23:49,680 --> 02:23:51,520
athlete

4726
02:23:50,398 --> 02:23:53,760
they get a protein shake or they don't

4727
02:23:51,520 --> 02:23:55,040
have to work so hard what i mean by that

4728
02:23:53,760 --> 02:23:56,960
is normally we have to like

4729
02:23:55,040 --> 02:23:58,240
digest our food we have to chew it first

4730
02:23:56,959 --> 02:23:59,519
we have to break it down in our stomach

4731
02:23:58,239 --> 02:24:00,239
but when you have a protein shake it's

4732
02:23:59,520 --> 02:24:02,560
just a quick

4733
02:24:00,239 --> 02:24:03,840
boost of energy while you can live off

4734
02:24:02,559 --> 02:24:05,199
protein chicks i don't think that it's

4735
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:06,639
going to be a good idea to do it for

4736
02:24:05,200 --> 02:24:08,479
every single meal all the time

4737
02:24:06,639 --> 02:24:09,920
maybe a couple of them a day maybe one a

4738
02:24:08,478 --> 02:24:11,840
day

4739
02:24:09,920 --> 02:24:13,280
and so much like that i feel like if you

4740
02:24:11,840 --> 02:24:15,040
were trying to grow

4741
02:24:13,280 --> 02:24:17,359
hydroponically with no soil medium and

4742
02:24:15,040 --> 02:24:20,080
just use compote compost teas

4743
02:24:17,359 --> 02:24:21,520
you would quickly see its limitation but

4744
02:24:20,079 --> 02:24:22,959
if you have a good foundation i think

4745
02:24:21,520 --> 02:24:24,000
that just biology is going to be hard to

4746
02:24:22,959 --> 02:24:26,478
overdo

4747
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:27,280
and when it goes in there and creates

4748
02:24:26,478 --> 02:24:28,959
these booms

4749
02:24:27,280 --> 02:24:30,880
one of the one of the thought processes

4750
02:24:28,959 --> 02:24:31,759
is if we're not adding more nutrients at

4751
02:24:30,879 --> 02:24:33,438
some point

4752
02:24:31,760 --> 02:24:35,680
are we just speeding up the release of

4753
02:24:33,439 --> 02:24:37,280
our nutrients and our soil only to cause

4754
02:24:35,680 --> 02:24:38,880
problems in the future where we now are

4755
02:24:37,280 --> 02:24:39,760
dependent on adding all these teas all

4756
02:24:38,879 --> 02:24:41,839
the time

4757
02:24:39,760 --> 02:24:43,520
and so which came first right did we

4758
02:24:41,840 --> 02:24:44,559
create our own problem

4759
02:24:43,520 --> 02:24:46,000
i think the answer to that is just

4760
02:24:44,559 --> 02:24:47,119
having a good mulch layer and using a

4761
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:49,120
lot of the above

4762
02:24:47,120 --> 02:24:51,040
and then when you like you mentioned use

4763
02:24:49,120 --> 02:24:52,640
a t t here or there you notice a

4764
02:24:51,040 --> 02:24:53,680
dramatic effect when you use them every

4765
02:24:52,639 --> 02:24:56,879
time

4766
02:24:53,680 --> 02:25:00,239
it it it just seems to lose its

4767
02:24:56,879 --> 02:25:02,719
dramatic effect and so just to

4768
02:25:00,239 --> 02:25:03,840
jump back to coot for one moment i found

4769
02:25:02,719 --> 02:25:06,478
a post from

4770
02:25:03,840 --> 02:25:08,318
a while ago saying that he doesn't use

4771
02:25:06,478 --> 02:25:09,840
any limiting source anymore

4772
02:25:08,318 --> 02:25:12,799
how do you feel about that and do you

4773
02:25:09,840 --> 02:25:15,359
still recommend a limiting source

4774
02:25:12,799 --> 02:25:17,039
um you know when you talk to him he does

4775
02:25:15,359 --> 02:25:19,040
and part of that is because he uses worm

4776
02:25:17,040 --> 02:25:19,760
castings where he works that into his

4777
02:25:19,040 --> 02:25:21,840
castings

4778
02:25:19,760 --> 02:25:23,600
and the castings are then having a lot

4779
02:25:21,840 --> 02:25:26,960
of calcium carbonate in them which

4780
02:25:23,600 --> 02:25:28,479
does affect the ph um and his castings

4781
02:25:26,959 --> 02:25:29,759
are probably fairly neutral

4782
02:25:28,478 --> 02:25:31,760
the other thing is when we talked to him

4783
02:25:29,760 --> 02:25:33,359
about our official coop mix

4784
02:25:31,760 --> 02:25:34,559
he very much said that keeping the

4785
02:25:33,359 --> 02:25:35,840
oyster shell flower in there was

4786
02:25:34,559 --> 02:25:37,600
acceptable

4787
02:25:35,840 --> 02:25:39,120
and part of that is we don't use 100 you

4788
02:25:37,600 --> 02:25:41,920
know as much castings in there

4789
02:25:39,120 --> 02:25:43,359
um in our new recipe we're adding some

4790
02:25:41,920 --> 02:25:45,120
and then the other thing is he does

4791
02:25:43,359 --> 02:25:46,880
use the calcium carbonate in the form of

4792
02:25:45,120 --> 02:25:48,800
the crustacean meal

4793
02:25:46,879 --> 02:25:50,799
and so that's another form where you'd

4794
02:25:48,799 --> 02:25:52,398
get the calcium carbonate

4795
02:25:50,799 --> 02:25:54,159
and then the gypsum that we use is the

4796
02:25:52,398 --> 02:25:55,920
calcium sulfate and so i think most

4797
02:25:54,159 --> 02:25:57,200
people consider the liming agent to be

4798
02:25:55,920 --> 02:25:58,000
the calcium carbonate because that's

4799
02:25:57,200 --> 02:26:01,120
what lime is

4800
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:03,359
considered to be um so he still does i

4801
02:26:01,120 --> 02:26:05,359
think that

4802
02:26:03,359 --> 02:26:07,200
it can it can be interpreted in many

4803
02:26:05,359 --> 02:26:08,479
ways cute has a thousand conversations

4804
02:26:07,200 --> 02:26:10,000
about this stuff

4805
02:26:08,478 --> 02:26:11,358
i'm sure he said many times sure you

4806
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,959
don't need it use the crustacean meal

4807
02:26:11,359 --> 02:26:14,640
sure you don't need to use this

4808
02:26:12,959 --> 02:26:16,478
he's very much not the type of person

4809
02:26:14,639 --> 02:26:18,639
that would say you have to have anything

4810
02:26:16,478 --> 02:26:20,000
and so mountain organics i think would

4811
02:26:18,639 --> 02:26:21,519
probably be the one that laid out the

4812
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:23,680
actual recipe

4813
02:26:21,520 --> 02:26:26,000
through the like alternating water tea

4814
02:26:23,680 --> 02:26:27,920
water top dress kind of

4815
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:29,200
basic methodology the no-till thread

4816
02:26:27,920 --> 02:26:31,680
revisited form

4817
02:26:29,200 --> 02:26:33,680
that he uh talked about that recipe just

4818
02:26:31,680 --> 02:26:35,200
included some basalt and no oyster

4819
02:26:33,680 --> 02:26:36,639
and that would be the line that people

4820
02:26:35,200 --> 02:26:39,680
were talking about but when i talked to

4821
02:26:36,639 --> 02:26:43,039
cute still recommends using oyster shell

4822
02:26:39,680 --> 02:26:44,800
i just think that depending on your

4823
02:26:43,040 --> 02:26:47,280
situation it may not be needed i

4824
02:26:44,799 --> 02:26:49,039
feel there's so much power in calcium

4825
02:26:47,280 --> 02:26:51,280
regardless of what food says i really

4826
02:26:49,040 --> 02:26:52,960
like to have a lot of calcium

4827
02:26:51,280 --> 02:26:54,000
and then the conversation now is getting

4828
02:26:52,959 --> 02:26:54,959
a little more advanced when we're

4829
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,719
working with the

4830
02:26:54,959 --> 02:26:58,639
agronomists that are actually looking at

4831
02:26:56,719 --> 02:26:59,920
our soils for our hemp farms

4832
02:26:58,639 --> 02:27:01,680
we're starting to get more insight in

4833
02:26:59,920 --> 02:27:03,520
working with real professionals with

4834
02:27:01,680 --> 02:27:05,040
degrees and finding out that the water

4835
02:27:03,520 --> 02:27:06,960
testing and the carbonate level there

4836
02:27:05,040 --> 02:27:08,880
can actually affect the desired input

4837
02:27:06,959 --> 02:27:11,119
that we might use in our soil

4838
02:27:08,879 --> 02:27:12,719
and so i just think that consistently

4839
02:27:11,120 --> 02:27:15,600
when we get back to it depending on

4840
02:27:12,719 --> 02:27:17,760
potting soil or agronomy there's no

4841
02:27:15,600 --> 02:27:19,600
all answer the koots mix is a great one

4842
02:27:17,760 --> 02:27:21,920
size fits all recipe

4843
02:27:19,600 --> 02:27:23,680
but it's predicated on quality compost

4844
02:27:21,920 --> 02:27:25,120
and at the end of the day there's no one

4845
02:27:23,680 --> 02:27:26,079
size fits all for any of this stuff

4846
02:27:25,120 --> 02:27:28,160
depending on where you live

4847
02:27:26,079 --> 02:27:30,000
[Music]

4848
02:27:28,159 --> 02:27:31,439
you mentioned mountain organics and

4849
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:34,079
here's someone who's

4850
02:27:31,439 --> 02:27:34,720
in my eyes very much popularized the use

4851
02:27:34,079 --> 02:27:36,639
of uh

4852
02:27:34,719 --> 02:27:38,239
these tinches especially the ones he

4853
02:27:36,639 --> 02:27:40,239
makes not not you know that there's

4854
02:27:38,239 --> 02:27:42,799
anything disingenuous about that

4855
02:27:40,239 --> 02:27:43,920
um do have you used them do you think

4856
02:27:42,799 --> 02:27:45,759
that they're going to

4857
02:27:43,920 --> 02:27:47,920
increase in popularity the use of

4858
02:27:45,760 --> 02:27:50,318
tinctures in general or what do you

4859
02:27:47,920 --> 02:27:53,200
reckon on the issue

4860
02:27:50,318 --> 02:27:54,318
um it's kind of a tough situation in the

4861
02:27:53,200 --> 02:27:55,680
sense that

4862
02:27:54,318 --> 02:27:58,159
kudus since told me he thinks they're

4863
02:27:55,680 --> 02:28:00,239
complete and a waste of time

4864
02:27:58,159 --> 02:28:01,359
and i take what he says with a grain of

4865
02:28:00,239 --> 02:28:03,680
salt because

4866
02:28:01,359 --> 02:28:05,120
he has human relationships just like all

4867
02:28:03,680 --> 02:28:06,079
of them that might play into that a

4868
02:28:05,120 --> 02:28:07,600
little bit

4869
02:28:06,079 --> 02:28:09,200
and he did speak highly of him for a

4870
02:28:07,600 --> 02:28:10,640
short period of time like a couple of

4871
02:28:09,200 --> 02:28:13,040
other products that he no longer

4872
02:28:10,639 --> 02:28:14,478
does and so i know that he goes through

4873
02:28:13,040 --> 02:28:16,080
these learning curves too where he gets

4874
02:28:14,478 --> 02:28:17,358
excited about something we talk about it

4875
02:28:16,079 --> 02:28:18,478
and it turns out it's just not what we

4876
02:28:17,359 --> 02:28:20,000
thought it was

4877
02:28:18,478 --> 02:28:21,438
and he's come since and said that these

4878
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,639
glycerin tinctures are just a total

4879
02:28:21,439 --> 02:28:24,639
waste of time

4880
02:28:22,639 --> 02:28:26,398
and that there's better ways to do it

4881
02:28:24,639 --> 02:28:28,000
and so i'm trying to stay out of the

4882
02:28:26,398 --> 02:28:30,478
middle of that i really

4883
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:31,680
um have not really had a relationship

4884
02:28:30,478 --> 02:28:32,799
with these people for a long time but

4885
02:28:31,680 --> 02:28:33,359
knowing them through the internet for a

4886
02:28:32,799 --> 02:28:35,199
long time

4887
02:28:33,359 --> 02:28:36,800
we've made some connections there and

4888
02:28:35,200 --> 02:28:38,240
mountain organics has done so much for

4889
02:28:36,799 --> 02:28:40,559
the community as far as helping them

4890
02:28:38,239 --> 02:28:42,239
keep this really simple process to

4891
02:28:40,559 --> 02:28:43,920
no-till gardening i mean he basically

4892
02:28:42,239 --> 02:28:45,359
invented no-till

4893
02:28:43,920 --> 02:28:47,120
i don't i would say he invented it but

4894
02:28:45,359 --> 02:28:48,399
it's like we were all in the forums

4895
02:28:47,120 --> 02:28:50,560
talking about

4896
02:28:48,398 --> 02:28:52,398
recycling soil and working towards

4897
02:28:50,559 --> 02:28:54,879
no-till but it was like man he's the guy

4898
02:28:52,398 --> 02:28:56,000
on the 15th cycle who's just doing it he

4899
02:28:54,879 --> 02:28:58,559
was sticking to that

4900
02:28:56,000 --> 02:29:00,079
basic philosophy and all of a sudden

4901
02:28:58,559 --> 02:29:00,959
there's a million different teachers

4902
02:29:00,079 --> 02:29:03,120
that you got to use now

4903
02:29:00,959 --> 02:29:04,639
all these different levels and we're not

4904
02:29:03,120 --> 02:29:06,000
seeing any dramatic results out there

4905
02:29:04,639 --> 02:29:07,519
the one that i feel like people are

4906
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,799
really using right now is the wreatha

4907
02:29:07,520 --> 02:29:11,359
nut tincture

4908
02:29:08,799 --> 02:29:12,799
but wreath and nut is by far way more

4909
02:29:11,359 --> 02:29:14,880
affordable to get use on your own

4910
02:29:12,799 --> 02:29:15,840
emulsifies oil and is so easy to use

4911
02:29:14,879 --> 02:29:17,199
we're going to release a couple

4912
02:29:15,840 --> 02:29:18,719
different products

4913
02:29:17,200 --> 02:29:20,720
one of them is just the powder we're

4914
02:29:18,719 --> 02:29:22,398
going to get it from usha neem resource

4915
02:29:20,719 --> 02:29:24,159
i really like working with her heck you

4916
02:29:22,398 --> 02:29:25,680
can go buy it from her right now

4917
02:29:24,159 --> 02:29:28,478
when i get back in the office next week

4918
02:29:25,680 --> 02:29:30,960
we'll have it and we have the whole seed

4919
02:29:28,478 --> 02:29:32,318
and it's really quality you can grind it

4920
02:29:30,959 --> 02:29:33,519
up you just mix in a little bit of water

4921
02:29:32,318 --> 02:29:35,279
we'll have the exact ratios

4922
02:29:33,520 --> 02:29:36,720
instead of like going crazy with it and

4923
02:29:35,280 --> 02:29:39,520
screening it out you just let the

4924
02:29:36,719 --> 02:29:40,000
dust settle take about 15 milliliters of

4925
02:29:39,520 --> 02:29:42,960
this

4926
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:44,639
of this sap it in water and put it in

4927
02:29:42,959 --> 02:29:46,559
your neem oil and it'll emulsify it

4928
02:29:44,639 --> 02:29:48,239
per gallon of water and so there's some

4929
02:29:46,559 --> 02:29:49,519
really easy processes that

4930
02:29:48,239 --> 02:29:51,840
when i'm looking at recommending a

4931
02:29:49,520 --> 02:29:54,079
product to you know

4932
02:29:51,840 --> 02:29:55,040
a facility that has a thousand plants

4933
02:29:54,079 --> 02:29:56,478
and a greenhouse

4934
02:29:55,040 --> 02:29:58,800
i want to make sure that not only is it

4935
02:29:56,478 --> 02:30:00,159
effective but it's cost effective

4936
02:29:58,799 --> 02:30:01,599
and so that's the reason why i haven't

4937
02:30:00,159 --> 02:30:03,200
necessarily started recommending his

4938
02:30:01,600 --> 02:30:04,720
products across the board

4939
02:30:03,200 --> 02:30:06,399
that and you know he was the original

4940
02:30:04,719 --> 02:30:07,679
get off the bottle guy and so we were

4941
02:30:06,398 --> 02:30:09,199
always talking about this

4942
02:30:07,680 --> 02:30:10,720
and getting out of the bottle and i feel

4943
02:30:09,200 --> 02:30:12,000
like i'm i'm backpedaling a little bit

4944
02:30:10,719 --> 02:30:15,119
by doing amino acids

4945
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:16,799
these microbial products i've since

4946
02:30:15,120 --> 02:30:18,640
come to learn that there's a place for

4947
02:30:16,799 --> 02:30:20,559
all of these tools so i will not write

4948
02:30:18,639 --> 02:30:23,519
off the glacier and tinctures but

4949
02:30:20,559 --> 02:30:24,159
um you know i can use aloe i can use

4950
02:30:23,520 --> 02:30:25,680
barley i

4951
02:30:24,159 --> 02:30:27,520
i can use soap nut without putting it

4952
02:30:25,680 --> 02:30:29,600
through glycerin and i don't see any

4953
02:30:27,520 --> 02:30:31,280
real benefit to doing that and

4954
02:30:29,600 --> 02:30:33,439
and i have used these products i've

4955
02:30:31,280 --> 02:30:35,120
ordered them from him i've also ordered

4956
02:30:33,439 --> 02:30:36,960
the book on no-till that he offers at

4957
02:30:35,120 --> 02:30:38,479
his website and i think that i've had a

4958
02:30:36,959 --> 02:30:40,318
good experience as far as customer

4959
02:30:38,478 --> 02:30:44,879
service i got the products

4960
02:30:40,318 --> 02:30:46,159
um i just i haven't used them and

4961
02:30:44,879 --> 02:30:48,079
you know behind the scenes i've had this

4962
02:30:46,159 --> 02:30:49,840
conversation a couple times but

4963
02:30:48,079 --> 02:30:52,478
politically i try not to just you know

4964
02:30:49,840 --> 02:30:54,559
go out there and

4965
02:30:52,478 --> 02:30:55,679
talk about other products just because i

4966
02:30:54,559 --> 02:30:58,239
don't use them

4967
02:30:55,680 --> 02:30:59,680
and so um when someone asks me point

4968
02:30:58,239 --> 02:31:01,600
blank though i just don't think that's

4969
02:30:59,680 --> 02:31:04,960
the future of cannabis gardening

4970
02:31:01,600 --> 02:31:07,040
uh at all i don't think it's gonna last

4971
02:31:04,959 --> 02:31:08,799
okay and so just to hit on saponins a

4972
02:31:07,040 --> 02:31:10,800
bit harder they definitely seem to be a

4973
02:31:08,799 --> 02:31:12,840
bit of a trending topic and

4974
02:31:10,799 --> 02:31:14,719
you know just the general use of

4975
02:31:12,840 --> 02:31:16,398
emulsifying properties

4976
02:31:14,719 --> 02:31:18,000
do you think it's really something

4977
02:31:16,398 --> 02:31:21,358
that'll stick around

4978
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:22,478
or it's maybe you know i think last time

4979
02:31:21,359 --> 02:31:25,280
we called it

4980
02:31:22,478 --> 02:31:26,398
the trending non-purple sulfur bacteria

4981
02:31:25,280 --> 02:31:28,000
what do you think on it you think good

4982
02:31:26,398 --> 02:31:29,680
enough to hang around

4983
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:31,200
uh yeah because it's hung around forever

4984
02:31:29,680 --> 02:31:32,720
it's nothing to do and it's just people

4985
02:31:31,200 --> 02:31:34,079
get excited about learning about these

4986
02:31:32,719 --> 02:31:37,119
things as if it's new

4987
02:31:34,079 --> 02:31:39,359
um and you know there's an ipm report

4988
02:31:37,120 --> 02:31:42,560
that i really encourage

4989
02:31:39,359 --> 02:31:44,000
listeners to go download you can

4990
02:31:42,559 --> 02:31:45,519
the quickest way i can tell you to do it

4991
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,879
is through a build a soil link but you

4992
02:31:45,520 --> 02:31:48,560
don't have to get it through us you can

4993
02:31:46,879 --> 02:31:51,039
get it through the treatment people

4994
02:31:48,559 --> 02:31:53,359
um the guy that made the product like 40

4995
02:31:51,040 --> 02:31:56,240
years ago he owns the patent on enzyme

4996
02:31:53,359 --> 02:31:57,600
action on pests and he's an um

4997
02:31:56,239 --> 02:31:59,199
entomologist or an

4998
02:31:57,600 --> 02:32:01,200
integrated pest management specialist i

4999
02:31:59,200 --> 02:32:03,439
mean he has some background in this

5000
02:32:01,200 --> 02:32:04,720
and he wrote an ipm report through build

5001
02:32:03,439 --> 02:32:06,800
soil if you go to the product

5002
02:32:04,719 --> 02:32:08,239
treatment there's a link in there for

5003
02:32:06,799 --> 02:32:10,639
like useful info

5004
02:32:08,239 --> 02:32:11,359
and if you download it it's a organic

5005
02:32:10,639 --> 02:32:14,719
ipm

5006
02:32:11,359 --> 02:32:15,359
um routine and it goes through so many

5007
02:32:14,719 --> 02:32:17,760
different

5008
02:32:15,359 --> 02:32:19,200
processes talking about all this stuff

5009
02:32:17,760 --> 02:32:20,880
and it's all free

5010
02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:23,600
and one of the things you'll find in

5011
02:32:20,879 --> 02:32:26,639
there is the seminance and mixing in

5012
02:32:23,600 --> 02:32:30,079
uh cuhila extract i can't say that word

5013
02:32:26,639 --> 02:32:32,239
um soap nut and yucca and we're just

5014
02:32:30,079 --> 02:32:34,079
talking about yucca and soap nut now and

5015
02:32:32,239 --> 02:32:34,799
this was you know an old report and

5016
02:32:34,079 --> 02:32:36,239
there's

5017
02:32:34,799 --> 02:32:38,559
all the books you'll find we'll talk

5018
02:32:36,239 --> 02:32:39,920
about the benefits of this now his story

5019
02:32:38,559 --> 02:32:41,199
with the treatment is that he knew a lot

5020
02:32:39,920 --> 02:32:42,719
of people that were farmers and they

5021
02:32:41,200 --> 02:32:43,840
were all dying from cancer and he found

5022
02:32:42,719 --> 02:32:45,519
out they were all applying a lot of

5023
02:32:43,840 --> 02:32:47,680
pesticides as the family way

5024
02:32:45,520 --> 02:32:49,040
they all had to support the business and

5025
02:32:47,680 --> 02:32:50,559
he noticed that he could just take the

5026
02:32:49,040 --> 02:32:51,920
pesticide out and just alternate

5027
02:32:50,559 --> 02:32:53,680
different surfactants and different

5028
02:32:51,920 --> 02:32:54,159
levels of saponin and get really good

5029
02:32:53,680 --> 02:32:55,760
results

5030
02:32:54,159 --> 02:32:57,200
similarly to using these expensive

5031
02:32:55,760 --> 02:32:58,880
pesticides

5032
02:32:57,200 --> 02:33:00,960
so it was almost as if they were being

5033
02:32:58,879 --> 02:33:02,879
sold and he could just use

5034
02:33:00,959 --> 02:33:03,599
these saponins and use these surfactants

5035
02:33:02,879 --> 02:33:05,199
and use

5036
02:33:03,600 --> 02:33:07,280
you know different modes of action like

5037
02:33:05,200 --> 02:33:08,880
that and so full circle we come around

5038
02:33:07,280 --> 02:33:10,239
and we're talking about sap and as if

5039
02:33:08,879 --> 02:33:12,239
it's magic but

5040
02:33:10,239 --> 02:33:14,159
it really is we look into it and there

5041
02:33:12,239 --> 02:33:15,600
are so many different types of sapin and

5042
02:33:14,159 --> 02:33:17,600
they have different effects

5043
02:33:15,600 --> 02:33:19,920
you can even google uh this string of

5044
02:33:17,600 --> 02:33:22,000
words set happening as a plant growth

5045
02:33:19,920 --> 02:33:24,079
stimulant and see that there are results

5046
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,639
indicating that saponin actually helps

5047
02:33:24,079 --> 02:33:26,879
and

5048
02:33:24,639 --> 02:33:28,000
we're thinking that it almost like

5049
02:33:26,879 --> 02:33:31,438
creates a

5050
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:33,680
goop like a like as a surfactant like a

5051
02:33:31,439 --> 02:33:35,600
modality of travel for the microbes in

5052
02:33:33,680 --> 02:33:37,439
the soil by creating this level of

5053
02:33:35,600 --> 02:33:39,200
viscosity in there and

5054
02:33:37,439 --> 02:33:40,880
the fact that it has these fungal

5055
02:33:39,200 --> 02:33:42,319
properties of these i mean

5056
02:33:40,879 --> 02:33:43,519
it's not going to be like a beam gate

5057
02:33:42,318 --> 02:33:44,799
you know putting soap in your soil is

5058
02:33:43,520 --> 02:33:46,319
not going to kill all the fungus but it

5059
02:33:44,799 --> 02:33:48,559
could have some effects

5060
02:33:46,318 --> 02:33:50,000
related to the biology and we're seeing

5061
02:33:48,559 --> 02:33:52,000
positive effects

5062
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:53,680
watering soap nut and saponins in the

5063
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,959
soil let alone using it as part of

5064
02:33:53,680 --> 02:33:56,239
foliar sprays

5065
02:33:54,959 --> 02:33:58,000
so now i think that's why we're going to

5066
02:33:56,239 --> 02:34:01,359
see it be talked about more is

5067
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:03,200
i think the benefits are

5068
02:34:01,359 --> 02:34:04,559
undervalued at this point and so we're

5069
02:34:03,200 --> 02:34:06,000
going to start talking about using yucca

5070
02:34:04,559 --> 02:34:07,519
and soap nuts and stuff a lot more

5071
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:09,200
because we see tremendous benefit

5072
02:34:07,520 --> 02:34:10,880
especially in peat based soils to

5073
02:34:09,200 --> 02:34:13,920
keeping everything sponge-like

5074
02:34:10,879 --> 02:34:15,759
keeping the moisture even and then on

5075
02:34:13,920 --> 02:34:18,159
top of that these saponin itself when

5076
02:34:15,760 --> 02:34:19,840
you look into its structure

5077
02:34:18,159 --> 02:34:21,439
there are some indications that it has

5078
02:34:19,840 --> 02:34:24,079
some plant growth benefits which is

5079
02:34:21,439 --> 02:34:24,079
really interesting

5080
02:34:24,639 --> 02:34:28,159
we jump over to aloe vera which is you

5081
02:34:26,639 --> 02:34:31,599
know kind of like the

5082
02:34:28,159 --> 02:34:34,559
step back from saponins in some regards

5083
02:34:31,600 --> 02:34:35,520
how do you think um the difference in

5084
02:34:34,559 --> 02:34:38,079
quality

5085
02:34:35,520 --> 02:34:39,280
affects the difference in you know like

5086
02:34:38,079 --> 02:34:40,318
what you're going to get from the plant

5087
02:34:39,280 --> 02:34:42,159
because i've noticed

5088
02:34:40,318 --> 02:34:44,559
at the lower end of the spectrum you can

5089
02:34:42,159 --> 02:34:45,920
get like aloe vera powder which is

5090
02:34:44,559 --> 02:34:48,478
just doesn't have any label of the

5091
02:34:45,920 --> 02:34:50,079
concentration and then you got the 100x

5092
02:34:48,478 --> 02:34:51,840
the 200x

5093
02:34:50,079 --> 02:34:53,920
is it the case that you know like the

5094
02:34:51,840 --> 02:34:55,200
the higher the number in concentration

5095
02:34:53,920 --> 02:34:57,280
the better and what does that number

5096
02:34:55,200 --> 02:35:00,079
even refer to is it like

5097
02:34:57,280 --> 02:35:00,399
content of saponins or salicylic acid

5098
02:35:00,079 --> 02:35:01,600
and

5099
02:35:00,398 --> 02:35:03,039
is it worth the money because they

5100
02:35:01,600 --> 02:35:05,439
definitely get more expensive as you

5101
02:35:03,040 --> 02:35:07,680
move up the line

5102
02:35:05,439 --> 02:35:10,239
yeah so i'll tell you exactly what the

5103
02:35:07,680 --> 02:35:13,040
x's mean that's the concentration

5104
02:35:10,239 --> 02:35:15,039
so 200x is the most affordable because

5105
02:35:13,040 --> 02:35:15,520
it takes the smallest amount of that

5106
02:35:15,040 --> 02:35:18,080
powder

5107
02:35:15,520 --> 02:35:19,280
to create the most amount of actual aloe

5108
02:35:18,079 --> 02:35:21,920
vera liquid

5109
02:35:19,280 --> 02:35:22,520
and so 200x what that means specifically

5110
02:35:21,920 --> 02:35:25,600
is that

5111
02:35:22,520 --> 02:35:26,000
199 grams of water and one gram of this

5112
02:35:25,600 --> 02:35:28,399
powder

5113
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:29,280
would create 200 grams of actual

5114
02:35:28,398 --> 02:35:30,959
concentrate

5115
02:35:29,280 --> 02:35:32,800
just like you get from the aloe vera

5116
02:35:30,959 --> 02:35:35,759
plant and so

5117
02:35:32,799 --> 02:35:36,879
that one gram to 199 or that 200x

5118
02:35:35,760 --> 02:35:39,680
concentrate

5119
02:35:36,879 --> 02:35:40,799
is half as strong if you get the 100 x

5120
02:35:39,680 --> 02:35:43,120
it's gonna take

5121
02:35:40,799 --> 02:35:45,679
two grams or it's going to only take one

5122
02:35:43,120 --> 02:35:48,160
gram against 99 grams of water

5123
02:35:45,680 --> 02:35:49,520
instead of one gram against 199 and so

5124
02:35:48,159 --> 02:35:51,920
that's a big difference that's

5125
02:35:49,520 --> 02:35:54,000
twice as effective when you get 200x and

5126
02:35:51,920 --> 02:35:55,680
i guarantee you it's not twice as much

5127
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:57,680
money and then you get to the

5128
02:35:55,680 --> 02:35:59,680
non-measured levels and you start to get

5129
02:35:57,680 --> 02:36:01,439
all sorts of adulterants and we we

5130
02:35:59,680 --> 02:36:03,040
really care about the aloe and

5131
02:36:01,439 --> 02:36:04,720
it's a pain in the butt because

5132
02:36:03,040 --> 02:36:05,200
sometimes we run into supply issues

5133
02:36:04,719 --> 02:36:08,318
based on

5134
02:36:05,200 --> 02:36:10,240
weather or seasonal or the demand

5135
02:36:08,318 --> 02:36:11,840
we spend twenty thirty thousand dollars

5136
02:36:10,239 --> 02:36:14,318
at a time on aloe and it's

5137
02:36:11,840 --> 02:36:16,639
scary but it's it's a popular product

5138
02:36:14,318 --> 02:36:18,239
for us because of how effective it is

5139
02:36:16,639 --> 02:36:19,680
um you can grow your own aloe i think

5140
02:36:18,239 --> 02:36:20,719
it's the best way it just becomes a

5141
02:36:19,680 --> 02:36:23,200
problem on scale

5142
02:36:20,719 --> 02:36:24,959
so we sell a lot of it but in this

5143
02:36:23,200 --> 02:36:25,520
shopping period where we had supply

5144
02:36:24,959 --> 02:36:26,719
issues

5145
02:36:25,520 --> 02:36:28,960
one of the things we love about our

5146
02:36:26,719 --> 02:36:31,438
suppliers they actually were willing to

5147
02:36:28,959 --> 02:36:33,919
test the products we were going to get

5148
02:36:31,439 --> 02:36:36,159
when they couldn't provide for us

5149
02:36:33,920 --> 02:36:37,600
and in testing we found that these other

5150
02:36:36,159 --> 02:36:40,639
companies were guaranteeing

5151
02:36:37,600 --> 02:36:41,760
inner aloe fillet but they were hitting

5152
02:36:40,639 --> 02:36:44,000
markers

5153
02:36:41,760 --> 02:36:46,000
for non-inner aloe fillet and that means

5154
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,719
that there's a lot of lying in the

5155
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,239
industry

5156
02:36:46,719 --> 02:36:50,159
and they were just squeezing it instead

5157
02:36:48,239 --> 02:36:51,840
of cutting it or whatever their shortcut

5158
02:36:50,159 --> 02:36:53,200
was and it created a very adulterated

5159
02:36:51,840 --> 02:36:54,639
product especially on the chemical

5160
02:36:53,200 --> 02:36:56,079
constituent level

5161
02:36:54,639 --> 02:36:57,519
and so much like everything else there's

5162
02:36:56,079 --> 02:36:59,280
a lot of out there and when you

5163
02:36:57,520 --> 02:37:01,600
go to a company that's providing

5164
02:36:59,280 --> 02:37:02,479
all of the data behind it and can back

5165
02:37:01,600 --> 02:37:04,640
it up

5166
02:37:02,478 --> 02:37:06,159
it means a lot and so it's worth paying

5167
02:37:04,639 --> 02:37:07,760
for a product that's that's actually

5168
02:37:06,159 --> 02:37:10,159
what it is especially when you're

5169
02:37:07,760 --> 02:37:11,840
having to go around growing yourself

5170
02:37:10,159 --> 02:37:14,239
which would obviously be the best way

5171
02:37:11,840 --> 02:37:15,280
most cost effective but then from there

5172
02:37:14,239 --> 02:37:17,760
if you're going to ship it in an

5173
02:37:15,280 --> 02:37:19,439
ounce of 200x will go significantly

5174
02:37:17,760 --> 02:37:21,680
further than an ounce of unlabeled or

5175
02:37:19,439 --> 02:37:25,040
100x concentrate

5176
02:37:21,680 --> 02:37:27,200
so a lot of people are talking about

5177
02:37:25,040 --> 02:37:29,200
the use of plant ferments to increase

5178
02:37:27,200 --> 02:37:30,399
terpene production the one i see getting

5179
02:37:29,200 --> 02:37:33,920
flung around the most

5180
02:37:30,398 --> 02:37:35,599
is like banana and mango ferments and

5181
02:37:33,920 --> 02:37:37,359
there seems to be like a growing group

5182
02:37:35,600 --> 02:37:39,760
of people who really do think it

5183
02:37:37,359 --> 02:37:40,880
you know increases the plants terpenes

5184
02:37:39,760 --> 02:37:42,639
if that's true

5185
02:37:40,879 --> 02:37:44,719
you know does it not imply that there's

5186
02:37:42,639 --> 02:37:47,039
some kind of hormone or chemical

5187
02:37:44,719 --> 02:37:49,279
specifically in mangoes or bananas that

5188
02:37:47,040 --> 02:37:50,479
are you know key in triggering increase

5189
02:37:49,280 --> 02:37:52,319
in terpenes or do you think it's all

5190
02:37:50,478 --> 02:37:54,559
just too anecdotal to give any credence

5191
02:37:52,318 --> 02:37:54,559
to

5192
02:37:55,120 --> 02:38:00,399
i don't know um it seems like

5193
02:37:58,398 --> 02:38:02,478
stuff with sugars in it has always come

5194
02:38:00,398 --> 02:38:03,680
back to people thinking it increases

5195
02:38:02,478 --> 02:38:05,438
flavor and

5196
02:38:03,680 --> 02:38:08,398
i'm sure there's carbohydrate there's

5197
02:38:05,439 --> 02:38:10,398
some sort of correlative data there but

5198
02:38:08,398 --> 02:38:11,920
um i think from a ferment level you're

5199
02:38:10,398 --> 02:38:13,680
also

5200
02:38:11,920 --> 02:38:15,280
you're getting that organic addition and

5201
02:38:13,680 --> 02:38:17,840
so if somebody's using ferments

5202
02:38:15,280 --> 02:38:19,520
and they weren't before i think that at

5203
02:38:17,840 --> 02:38:20,719
some level these ferments do increase

5204
02:38:19,520 --> 02:38:22,479
the terpene level there

5205
02:38:20,719 --> 02:38:24,239
there's something about it that does

5206
02:38:22,478 --> 02:38:25,279
help maybe it's just adding organics to

5207
02:38:24,239 --> 02:38:28,639
maybe a system that

5208
02:38:25,280 --> 02:38:30,399
otherwise wouldn't have that um but the

5209
02:38:28,639 --> 02:38:32,079
mango specifically the fruit ones we've

5210
02:38:30,398 --> 02:38:33,519
always talked about the

5211
02:38:32,079 --> 02:38:35,439
benefits so if you were to go buy

5212
02:38:33,520 --> 02:38:37,120
enzymes for digestion a lot of times

5213
02:38:35,439 --> 02:38:38,720
they're based on these tropical fruits

5214
02:38:37,120 --> 02:38:40,319
because they have extract like enzymes

5215
02:38:38,719 --> 02:38:42,879
like papaya

5216
02:38:40,318 --> 02:38:43,760
and from papaya and other ones that are

5217
02:38:42,879 --> 02:38:47,279
very very

5218
02:38:43,760 --> 02:38:48,559
strong enzymes so i feel like maybe

5219
02:38:47,280 --> 02:38:50,479
that's what's going on as we're getting

5220
02:38:48,559 --> 02:38:52,000
some of these beneficial enzymes that

5221
02:38:50,478 --> 02:38:55,039
are really increasing the ability

5222
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:57,040
and that is being by secondary nature

5223
02:38:55,040 --> 02:38:58,640
increasing the terpenes maybe not the

5224
02:38:57,040 --> 02:39:00,399
fact that it's just a mango

5225
02:38:58,639 --> 02:39:02,079
then you complicate it by the fact that

5226
02:39:00,398 --> 02:39:04,159
mangoes have already been told

5227
02:39:02,079 --> 02:39:06,239
to increase the um you know there's

5228
02:39:04,159 --> 02:39:06,879
murky or something or mercy sorry i

5229
02:39:06,239 --> 02:39:08,398
always

5230
02:39:06,879 --> 02:39:10,639
say all these words wrong when you when

5231
02:39:08,398 --> 02:39:13,680
you read them and say it to yourself

5232
02:39:10,639 --> 02:39:15,199
um but but eventually you get these

5233
02:39:13,680 --> 02:39:16,559
stories a lot a lot of times they're

5234
02:39:15,200 --> 02:39:17,280
relative like mangoes are going to

5235
02:39:16,559 --> 02:39:19,039
increase your high

5236
02:39:17,280 --> 02:39:21,439
mango fermented is going to increase the

5237
02:39:19,040 --> 02:39:23,280
thc you can't help but to think maybe

5238
02:39:21,439 --> 02:39:25,359
there's a little bit of folklore there

5239
02:39:23,280 --> 02:39:27,520
um

5240
02:39:25,359 --> 02:39:28,800
but it seems like i just like you people

5241
02:39:27,520 --> 02:39:32,800
that i respect the people that i know

5242
02:39:28,799 --> 02:39:32,799
are saying these fruit ferments these

5243
02:39:33,040 --> 02:39:36,800
are increasing their quality somehow and

5244
02:39:35,359 --> 02:39:38,000
so um

5245
02:39:36,799 --> 02:39:39,920
i'll probably do some playing around

5246
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:42,318
with that i have in the past and

5247
02:39:39,920 --> 02:39:43,600
it didn't really make a noticeable

5248
02:39:42,318 --> 02:39:45,359
enough difference but

5249
02:39:43,600 --> 02:39:47,760
i'd be willing to admit that maybe i was

5250
02:39:45,359 --> 02:39:50,960
doing wrong you know

5251
02:39:47,760 --> 02:39:54,318
so second last question how do you

5252
02:39:50,959 --> 02:39:56,879
feel social media affects the landscapes

5253
02:39:54,318 --> 02:39:58,799
of kind of growers and their view on

5254
02:39:56,879 --> 02:40:00,478
organics and what i mean by this is i've

5255
02:39:58,799 --> 02:40:02,159
noticed that time and time again

5256
02:40:00,478 --> 02:40:04,559
people on both sides of the fence will

5257
02:40:02,159 --> 02:40:06,879
point to very specifically

5258
02:40:04,559 --> 02:40:08,239
maybe one or two people who uses their

5259
02:40:06,879 --> 02:40:10,159
style of growing

5260
02:40:08,239 --> 02:40:12,398
to give like huge credibility to their

5261
02:40:10,159 --> 02:40:13,520
arguments and what has made me think is

5262
02:40:12,398 --> 02:40:15,680
do you think it's gotten to the point

5263
02:40:13,520 --> 02:40:18,159
where it like muddies

5264
02:40:15,680 --> 02:40:18,880
people's views on which grow style is

5265
02:40:18,159 --> 02:40:21,119
maybe

5266
02:40:18,879 --> 02:40:22,318
the best for them or just the best in

5267
02:40:21,120 --> 02:40:24,160
general because it seems like you know

5268
02:40:22,318 --> 02:40:27,039
you can always find someone to validate

5269
02:40:24,159 --> 02:40:28,639
your argument on instagram

5270
02:40:27,040 --> 02:40:29,840
yeah and it's tough too because what you

5271
02:40:28,639 --> 02:40:30,879
see on instagram is not always what's

5272
02:40:29,840 --> 02:40:32,559
real and when you start to meet a whole

5273
02:40:30,879 --> 02:40:32,959
bunch of growers i mean even me probably

5274
02:40:32,559 --> 02:40:34,318
people

5275
02:40:32,959 --> 02:40:36,639
probably think build a soil is some

5276
02:40:34,318 --> 02:40:38,398
crazy you know amazing grower and

5277
02:40:36,639 --> 02:40:39,680
the harvest i had last time was fine but

5278
02:40:38,398 --> 02:40:40,879
i didn't even know the genetics we grew

5279
02:40:39,680 --> 02:40:42,800
weren't that great and i wish i would

5280
02:40:40,879 --> 02:40:46,478
have grown something else and so

5281
02:40:42,799 --> 02:40:49,519
um it's not always this just like

5282
02:40:46,478 --> 02:40:51,519
perfect grow and and um

5283
02:40:49,520 --> 02:40:53,279
when you start to look at like these

5284
02:40:51,520 --> 02:40:55,120
synthetic growers that have crazy yields

5285
02:40:53,279 --> 02:40:56,720
and tons of photos and always the newest

5286
02:40:55,120 --> 02:40:58,319
genetic and they have a huge social

5287
02:40:56,719 --> 02:41:00,478
media following or you have this organic

5288
02:40:58,318 --> 02:41:02,239
grower that's always updating and people

5289
02:41:00,478 --> 02:41:03,840
say that they've got the best plants

5290
02:41:02,239 --> 02:41:06,079
i think the one thing is the same across

5291
02:41:03,840 --> 02:41:08,159
the board you have good

5292
02:41:06,079 --> 02:41:09,840
dedicated gardeners regardless of what

5293
02:41:08,159 --> 02:41:11,039
their methodology is

5294
02:41:09,840 --> 02:41:12,239
and at the end of the day that's what it

5295
02:41:11,040 --> 02:41:13,680
takes is it's going to take a lot of

5296
02:41:12,239 --> 02:41:16,318
work and it's going to take dedication

5297
02:41:13,680 --> 02:41:18,239
and discipline and gardening has forever

5298
02:41:16,318 --> 02:41:22,079
been the teacher a man to get

5299
02:41:18,239 --> 02:41:23,439
a lot of these things um

5300
02:41:22,079 --> 02:41:26,239
put together in their life from having

5301
02:41:23,439 --> 02:41:27,600
patience and plan and organization

5302
02:41:26,239 --> 02:41:29,039
that's constantly teaching me i'm trying

5303
02:41:27,600 --> 02:41:30,000
to get better in so many different areas

5304
02:41:29,040 --> 02:41:32,000
of my life

5305
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:33,920
it can feel like um you know there's so

5306
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:37,040
much to work on in the garden and

5307
02:41:33,920 --> 02:41:38,478
in other places but um when you're on

5308
02:41:37,040 --> 02:41:39,840
social media and you start seeing

5309
02:41:38,478 --> 02:41:41,679
everybody and all they show you is just

5310
02:41:39,840 --> 02:41:43,680
like their facebook them on vacation

5311
02:41:41,680 --> 02:41:44,960
the biggest buds they've ever seen it

5312
02:41:43,680 --> 02:41:45,520
starts to become this kind of false

5313
02:41:44,959 --> 02:41:47,358
reality

5314
02:41:45,520 --> 02:41:48,960
and so i like to highlight like on

5315
02:41:47,359 --> 02:41:50,479
instagram see the thrips that we had in

5316
02:41:48,959 --> 02:41:51,039
our tent and us trying to get rid of

5317
02:41:50,478 --> 02:41:52,478
them

5318
02:41:51,040 --> 02:41:54,080
um i like to highlight the bad stuff

5319
02:41:52,478 --> 02:41:55,358
that happens too so that people can kind

5320
02:41:54,079 --> 02:41:57,120
of see that reality and i think the

5321
02:41:55,359 --> 02:41:58,239
reality is no matter what style of grill

5322
02:41:57,120 --> 02:42:01,600
you do you're going to go through

5323
02:41:58,239 --> 02:42:04,478
learning curves problems ups downs um

5324
02:42:01,600 --> 02:42:07,200
for me it it just made no sense to grow

5325
02:42:04,478 --> 02:42:08,639
any other way than organic

5326
02:42:07,200 --> 02:42:11,040
especially when i wanted to eat that way

5327
02:42:08,639 --> 02:42:12,398
i knew how the jeans

5328
02:42:11,040 --> 02:42:14,800
and the pesticides and everything were

5329
02:42:12,398 --> 02:42:15,519
affecting um not just our grow but

5330
02:42:14,799 --> 02:42:18,000
actually

5331
02:42:15,520 --> 02:42:18,880
the soil and the earth and and

5332
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:21,279
everything else so

5333
02:42:18,879 --> 02:42:22,159
it's like a no-brainer but for a lot of

5334
02:42:21,279 --> 02:42:23,439
other people it's not

5335
02:42:22,159 --> 02:42:25,119
they're on the fence they don't care

5336
02:42:23,439 --> 02:42:26,159
they don't have any education and

5337
02:42:25,120 --> 02:42:27,359
they're just looking at what grows the

5338
02:42:26,159 --> 02:42:28,559
best wheat they want to grow organic

5339
02:42:27,359 --> 02:42:30,720
they want to go hydro with no other

5340
02:42:28,559 --> 02:42:32,000
consequences to the planet earth

5341
02:42:30,719 --> 02:42:33,119
and so then they start pointing at all

5342
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:34,239
these different arguments on social

5343
02:42:33,120 --> 02:42:35,920
media about what's going to yield the

5344
02:42:34,239 --> 02:42:37,119
best or what does this

5345
02:42:35,920 --> 02:42:38,639
and nine times out of ten they're not

5346
02:42:37,120 --> 02:42:40,720
comparing the same genetics same growth

5347
02:42:38,639 --> 02:42:43,358
style the same setup the same lights

5348
02:42:40,719 --> 02:42:43,920
and so so much is missed that it's so

5349
02:42:43,359 --> 02:42:45,520
important

5350
02:42:43,920 --> 02:42:47,600
that you have somebody trusted that you

5351
02:42:45,520 --> 02:42:49,040
can maybe level with and tell you the

5352
02:42:47,600 --> 02:42:51,120
truth or maybe a resource like the

5353
02:42:49,040 --> 02:42:54,160
podcast that can interview people that

5354
02:42:51,120 --> 02:42:56,079
have more experience breeders growers

5355
02:42:54,159 --> 02:42:57,359
and for the most part there's no product

5356
02:42:56,079 --> 02:42:58,719
that's going to double you double your

5357
02:42:57,359 --> 02:43:00,479
yield and there's no

5358
02:42:58,719 --> 02:43:01,920
system that's going to guarantee you any

5359
02:43:00,478 --> 02:43:03,760
sort of result it's all going to come

5360
02:43:01,920 --> 02:43:06,639
down to your ethics and your work

5361
02:43:03,760 --> 02:43:08,000
and your principles lucky last question

5362
02:43:06,639 --> 02:43:09,760
for this one

5363
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:11,120
if you could only pick one additive and

5364
02:43:09,760 --> 02:43:12,159
i use the word additive because you know

5365
02:43:11,120 --> 02:43:14,319
it could be like a

5366
02:43:12,159 --> 02:43:16,079
dry additive it could be a liquid could

5367
02:43:14,318 --> 02:43:17,039
be a you know in a bottle it could be

5368
02:43:16,079 --> 02:43:19,760
whatever

5369
02:43:17,040 --> 02:43:21,120
um to use on top of what you would

5370
02:43:19,760 --> 02:43:22,719
consider to be you know like a pretty

5371
02:43:21,120 --> 02:43:24,000
well balanced soil

5372
02:43:22,719 --> 02:43:26,318
what would it be you know would it be

5373
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:28,159
your aminos or even like a big handful

5374
02:43:26,318 --> 02:43:32,318
of neem

5375
02:43:28,159 --> 02:43:34,959
ah that one's tough um

5376
02:43:32,318 --> 02:43:35,519
i don't know it really is tough i think

5377
02:43:34,959 --> 02:43:37,839
if you have a

5378
02:43:35,520 --> 02:43:39,279
really well balanced soil right because

5379
02:43:37,840 --> 02:43:40,559
i i kind of want to stay on a brand new

5380
02:43:39,279 --> 02:43:42,399
soil with most

5381
02:43:40,559 --> 02:43:43,840
growers that start with their products i

5382
02:43:42,398 --> 02:43:47,920
feel like if they have

5383
02:43:43,840 --> 02:43:51,040
at the very minimal a microbial product

5384
02:43:47,920 --> 02:43:51,920
and an amino acid product they're going

5385
02:43:51,040 --> 02:43:53,439
to make it through the grow they're

5386
02:43:51,920 --> 02:43:54,879
going to do really good and they'll have

5387
02:43:53,439 --> 02:43:56,800
you know the best chance of doing that

5388
02:43:54,879 --> 02:43:59,119
so i feel like those two are kind of the

5389
02:43:56,799 --> 02:44:00,959
what i would have if i had to just pick

5390
02:43:59,120 --> 02:44:02,240
one of those i feel like if my soil was

5391
02:44:00,959 --> 02:44:05,119
already really good

5392
02:44:02,239 --> 02:44:05,680
my biology should be awesome already and

5393
02:44:05,120 --> 02:44:08,720
the

5394
02:44:05,680 --> 02:44:08,720
ability to

5395
02:44:08,959 --> 02:44:12,879
bypass that limiting factor with the

5396
02:44:10,799 --> 02:44:14,559
amino acids and help them build with all

5397
02:44:12,879 --> 02:44:17,199
the other stuff that's in the soil

5398
02:44:14,559 --> 02:44:18,398
um that probably be the one go-to

5399
02:44:17,200 --> 02:44:19,760
additive

5400
02:44:18,398 --> 02:44:21,680
and if i had to switch the question a

5401
02:44:19,760 --> 02:44:23,840
little bit and be what do-it-yourself

5402
02:44:21,680 --> 02:44:24,720
item could you just you know be the one

5403
02:44:23,840 --> 02:44:26,880
thing

5404
02:44:24,719 --> 02:44:28,639
i feel like compost tea just beats them

5405
02:44:26,879 --> 02:44:30,239
all because it's so easy to make it's

5406
02:44:28,639 --> 02:44:32,079
cost-effective you don't have to do it

5407
02:44:30,239 --> 02:44:33,279
for a couple days like labs and all that

5408
02:44:32,079 --> 02:44:35,840
stuff

5409
02:44:33,279 --> 02:44:36,720
but um probably the amino acid powder

5410
02:44:35,840 --> 02:44:40,000
that thriving stuff

5411
02:44:36,719 --> 02:44:42,000
just really works yeah awesome

5412
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:44,478
did you have any comments or shout outs

5413
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:44,478
you want to make

5414
02:44:44,840 --> 02:44:49,200
um no all right now i mean

5415
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:51,120
we've got so many things coming down the

5416
02:44:49,200 --> 02:44:52,640
pipe we've got um

5417
02:44:51,120 --> 02:44:54,960
i guess i'll do a couple basic updates

5418
02:44:52,639 --> 02:44:57,278
