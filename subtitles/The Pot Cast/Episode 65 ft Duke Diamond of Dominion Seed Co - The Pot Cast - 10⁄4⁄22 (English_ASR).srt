I when it sometimes when you talk to

104
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:08,818
people who don't smoke weed often they

105
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,799
say that they're like oh the next day

106
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:12,119

107

that right now

108
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:18,660
oh yeah tolerance is good and down but

109
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:21,780

110
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:24,060
right and how about yourself have you

111

been able to partake in anything or you

112
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:29,160
still need to abstain for a bit yeah

113
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:31,560
that's why I gotta gotta abstain for the

114
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,960
uh for the time being probably this time

115
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,759

thing you smoked was it something where

131

for this

133
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:20,399
um well I've done a uh I had an outdoor

134
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:22,739
and by the time I was chopped and ready

135
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:26,579
that was about the time when I was off

136
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:29,120
off the paper and it was uh [ __ ] some

137
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:32,819
outdoor Jack the Ripper

138
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:36,000
ah there you go shout out so cool

139
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:37,560
yeah man he uh I right when I got out he

140
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,600
was like yup you want some beans I was

141
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,978
like yep

142
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:44,340
so he said I'm on the send them on the

143
00:05:40,978 --> 00:05:47,699
way and back in 48 hours later they were

144
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:49,500
popped you know [ __ ] um ready to rate

145
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:51,538
a rock and roll man

146
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,519
beautiful stuff beautiful stuff and if

147
00:05:51,538 --> 00:05:56,159
we sort of fast forward now

148
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,959
is there anything that sort of front

149
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,060
runner in your mind where you're like

150
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:01,799
once I'm able to that's gonna be the one

151
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,139
I'm hitting first

152
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,538
yeah I've been thinking through it

153
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:08,340
through my mind and I think

154
00:06:06,538 --> 00:06:09,779
I think it's gonna be some Eagle some

155
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:11,579
Screaming Eagle

156
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:15,359
I was thinking like oh it should be some

157
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:15,359
free bird but yeah

158
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:23,159
there we go with the eagle though

159
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:25,439
yeah I I still so fondly remember that

160
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,819
eagle from years ago you I don't know if

161
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:28,680
they're all like this but the one I

162
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:31,199
tried from you it was like had that sort

163
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:35,459
of citrus vibe to it beautiful stuff

164
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:38,460
yeah it's like that rainbow candy lemony

165
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:40,620
citrusy type type [ __ ] going on yeah

166
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:42,719
that was the that's definitely a

167
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:45,120
dominant one amongst all the all the

168
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,460
olafinos you know

169
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,680
out of curiosity I thought about this

170
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:51,418
years ago and I was looking at the

171
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,220
genetics and I was like oh man where did

172
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:55,500
this flavor come from because in my mind

173
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,600
I was like I can't see the clear parent

174
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,000
where it's like oh it's from this what

175
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:03,419
was it in your mind

176
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,759
um that that purpley candy rainbow type

177
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:08,818
thing was coming from that from that 88

178
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:12,020
and then that that citrusy side that was

179
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:14,939
definitely how the how the Airborne

180
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:16,740
ah there you go that makes sense because

181
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:19,500
I don't know why but for the longest

182
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:21,978
time I thought is this Kandahar got like

183
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:25,500
something funky going on in it

184
00:07:21,978 --> 00:07:27,060
nah nah that was uh it was like I could

185
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,220
like distinctly face it you know

186
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:31,439
especially from blazing each one you

187
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,479
know individually I was like yeah you

188
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:35,519
can it's like the perfect little blend

189
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:37,918
of you know it's like Harmony symmetry

190
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:39,598
thing going on I was like wow that was

191
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:42,120
super cool because that doesn't happen

192
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:44,339
much where you get you know a good mix

193
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,079
of flavor you know that's very rare

194
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:47,519
thing and it worked out really good that

195
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:51,000
way

196
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:53,698
yeah beautiful stuff beautiful stuff

197
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,379
I guess the first thing to maybe clear

198
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:57,720
the air although probably everyone's

199
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:59,038
aware is you recently got out of jail

200
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,740
would you be able to tell us a little

201
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:03,120
bit more about that if you're willing to

202
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,319
yeah

203
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,019
um

204
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:09,240
yeah it was a star was down I was you

205
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:10,799
know it was in the jail for a while

206
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,460
while I was you know going through the

207
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,538
motions and you know fighting [ __ ] and

208
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:17,098
um

209
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:19,139
just waiting on them because like

210
00:08:17,098 --> 00:08:22,378
literally everything came to a screech

211
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:24,000
and halt normally the process like goes

212
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:25,080
through a whole lot quicker

213
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,759
um because the code that they were

214
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:29,399
shutting boards down and everything else

215
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:32,300
so amongst every other thing that was

216
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:36,299
you know [ __ ] up uh that was that so

217
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:38,338
stayed uh unusually long time uh there I

218
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:41,098
think it was

219
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:43,140
just over a year just just sitting there

220
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:45,360
in the in that [ __ ] jail

221
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:48,240
and then uh

222
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,879
once I did that and you know they they

223
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,580
come to you you know you can sign off

224
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:55,860
they you know whatever guilty so it's

225
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,120
like kind of an option it's like once

226
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,019
they got you there you're not getting

227
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,659
out

228
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:02,700
um you can either you know take the next

229
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:05,699
three to five years fighting up spend

230
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,200
[ __ ] tons of money and have your pride

231
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:10,980
and be like yeah let's see I was right

232
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:13,920
or you know it's like you're the chances

233
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:16,139
of winning are not good they have like a

234
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:18,599
99 conviction rate even if you're right

235
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:20,759
they're like no you're wrong because uh

236
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,399
we say so so

237
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:25,319
um you can either do that or you know

238
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:27,360
you can look at like the time and look

239
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,519
at the maximum that you're that you're

240
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,899
looking at losing so if you're looking

241
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:35,220
like say 24 to 30 months or something

242
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:37,620
like that you're like all right two and

243
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:39,959
a half years and I'm already you know

244
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,879
about a year into it with good timing

245
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:43,079
everything and I'll be about another

246
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:46,620
year

247
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:48,420
um do I do that or do I spend three to

248
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,480
five years on a [ __ ] ton of money stand

249
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:53,458
here just to lose you know and and that

250
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,220
ensures that hey you're definitely going

251
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:57,659
to get the high end either way so it's

252
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,160
like you know you got you gotta make

253
00:09:57,659 --> 00:10:00,958
that call you got to put up your fight

254
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:03,719
you know what I mean let them know like

255
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:05,639
you know you need business and [ __ ]

256
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,740
um but there comes a point where it's

257
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:09,838
just you know you're gonna you're gonna

258
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:13,320
you're not gonna get the fair shake at

259
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,700
it so once I sign off get truck and you

260
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,920
know plead guilty

261
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:19,320
get sentenced or whatever

262
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:21,360
um it's 29 months

263
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,519
um so I got like you know a year already

264
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,200
you know knocked off of it you know with

265
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,778
a good time and everything you know it's

266
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,640
like gonna be another year

267
00:10:27,778 --> 00:10:31,439
um so then it's like all right now you

268
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:33,778
can finally like start your journey at

269
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,660
getting done so I'm gonna throw you on

270
00:10:33,778 --> 00:10:37,980
Con Air you can go to the you know go to

271
00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:41,759
prison

272
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:44,159
um and there's like an intermediate step

273
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:46,259
um there's like a Transit Hub in

274
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:48,958
Oklahoma but they closed it down because

275
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:51,299
of covid so it was all Maximum Security

276
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:53,699
State joint that they had closed down

277
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:55,379
the private Corporation bought it out so

278
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,600
they were just sticking us all there we

279
00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:59,159
were we were doing normally in transit

280
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,519
you're doing like a day to three days

281
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:04,860
but this turned into many months and uh

282
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:08,700
that place was just [ __ ] Off the

283
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:09,899
Chain man and um so then uh once you're

284
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,940
getting shipped out of there you get

285
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:14,639
back on Conair and then you hit your uh

286
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:18,060
your final destination which was uh

287
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:19,500
Florence uh Florence Colorado and

288
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:23,278
um then you know just wrapped it up

289
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:24,240
there and uh yeah got out on the eye on

290
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:27,179
the second

291
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,700
and that was uh it was pretty awesome

292
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:32,519
pretty awesome and it was good to get to

293
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:35,519
be back and get a hold of everybody

294
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:37,919
you know see everybody's gun everybody

295
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,539
hitting you up you know because it's

296
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:41,759
real nice a lot of a lot of love out

297
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:43,919
there so it's pretty pretty awesome

298
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:46,559
thing

299
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:48,240
yeah that's so fantastic to hear you're

300
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,879
out I'm sure a lot of the community sort

301
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,159
of rallied behind that just to clarify

302
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:55,439
because I know a lot of people had asked

303
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:57,179
are you willing to disclose with us why

304
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,420
you ended up going to jail

305
00:11:57,179 --> 00:12:02,578
yeah of course uh yeah I guess telling

306
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:04,439
you earlier it's like it's free it's on

307

caught with it but you know that's the

331
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,980
that's the price price that you pay now

332
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,679
was it a good decision uh I don't know

333
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,940
probably not but that's you know given

334
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:02,879
the the

335
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:05,519
for the way the climate was then

336
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:08,820
um yeah it wasn't it wasn't it was kind

337
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:11,459
of it's a gamble but at the same note

338
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:13,500
and [ __ ] was [ __ ] going nuts man so

339
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:16,018
you know I made my made my decision I

340
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:18,539
stand by it and uh you know had to go

341
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:21,240
away do my time and you know I can do

342
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:22,980
say you know I did my time and walk

343
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,620
around with my with my head up and my

344
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,399
shoulders back you know so

345
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,578
um

346
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,440
can't uh can't make that risk anymore

347
00:13:29,578 --> 00:13:33,539
because then they hit you with like that

348
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,480
repeat repeat offender basically is what

349
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:39,059
it is so and then that's too much time

350
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,459
to look at you know like you can look at

351
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:44,239
it like a risk and reward thing and um

352
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:47,159
yeah that it would just be too much so

353
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:50,278
uh just have to keep it at uh keep it at

354
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:52,799
a knife and um just I guess stay away

355
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:56,220
from Walmart and you know Miss the

356
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:57,958
civilization I guess if uh you know yeah

357
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:00,899
world's just yeah world's going crazy

358
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:02,458
you know just have to you know flip the

359
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:03,958
tip coin toss and it's like all right

360
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:05,759
[ __ ] it gotta go to the grocery store

361
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:08,219
you know

362
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:09,899
yeah no look that's that's brilliant to

363
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:12,000
get clarification on that and I think a

364
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:14,159
lot of people can understand where

365
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,839
you're coming from with that and you

366
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:17,639
know as you said the world's going crazy

367
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,279
and something I specifically wanted to

368
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:22,440
ask is you've uh For Better or Worse

369
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:24,659
been away pretty much all through covert

370
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,700
and I wanted to ask you specifically I

371
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:29,699
remember seeing some news stories about

372
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:32,040
how people in jails weren't really being

373
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:34,560
protected or looked after properly in

374
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:37,019
regards to covert do you have any sort

375
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:38,518
of experiences or insights around that

376
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:42,078
at all

377
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:42,078
oh yeah

378
00:14:42,659 --> 00:14:48,899
I mean just flat out like you know your

379
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:49,799
your society's unwanted

380
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:52,259
um

381
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:55,019
I mean just cut and dry man they don't

382
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:57,480
give a [ __ ] about you you can live you

383
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:59,278
can die they don't care

384
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:02,039
um you're in human storage

385
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:04,139
you're just you're there

386
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:06,240
um not saying that everyone owns a

387
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:09,778
cold-blooded piece of [ __ ] there are

388
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,579
some caring people but even uh even if

389
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:13,379
they do

390
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:15,539
um the rest of that machine isn't going

391
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:17,639
to cater to that one personally how well

392
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:18,899
yeah this guy's drowning in his own lung

393
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:21,299
fluid over here you might want to get

394
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:23,879
them out like Yeah well yeah we'll we'll

395
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:26,458
look into it got a pencil amount or

396
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:28,919
something so yeah Jesus yeah they were

397
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:30,299
just yeah it was uh it was pretty bad

398
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:32,819
it's cramming up you know people

399
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:34,319
together and it's got to the point where

400
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:36,180
like especially right when it happened

401
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,399
they're just like looking in the units

402
00:15:36,179 --> 00:15:40,379
they don't even want to comment

403
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,440
um it's looking like it's a room full of

404
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:45,059
zombies you know what I mean so I just

405
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,279
let everything fly and like normally

406
00:15:45,059 --> 00:15:48,599
like there's a big fight or you know

407
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:51,838
some people stabbing each other they're

408
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:55,139
gonna run in and stop it not in there it

409
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,100
just is ran ran [ __ ] rampant uh at

410
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:58,560
first there were times where they

411
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,778
wouldn't even uh feeding us they didn't

412
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:02,278
even want to come near

413
00:16:00,778 --> 00:16:04,379
um I guess they were just scared

414
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:06,059
shitless you know about the stuff you

415
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:07,980
know the thought covered you know

416
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:11,099
spreading around pretty pretty rapidly

417
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:14,399
and uh you just had guys trying to look

418
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:17,100
out for guys to do the best but there's

419
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,259
nothing you can do you know it's not the

420
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,540
extent of it is like try to get them

421
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:22,919
some water out of a toilet sink to make

422
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:24,659
sure that at least they got they can

423
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:26,879
stay hydrated

424
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:28,919
um there's really not much else and

425
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,179
medications or anything like that so you

426
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:32,639
just kind of

427
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:35,099
just watch them die or you know get

428
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,240
really sick and slowly recover and

429
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:39,620
that's about

430
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:43,620
it's about the end of that you know

431
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:47,698
wow it really does sound as Bleak as lot

432
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:50,879
like what many of the news reports said

433
00:16:47,698 --> 00:16:53,159
yeah it was it was really uh

434
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:55,139
it was really bad man really really bad

435
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:57,120
and like you know there'd be a TV on and

436
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:59,459
the whole time it's on

437
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,919
um they have the [ __ ] death toll

438
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:03,958
number that's going out throwing up

439
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:06,599
going up and everybody's just sitting

440
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:09,000
there thinking like oh [ __ ] you know

441
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:11,159
this is it you know and here we are

442
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,818
we're stuck in here and there's nothing

443
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:16,798
nobody can do so uh it was it wasn't

444
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:19,438
looking good it definitely was not

445
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:22,019
looking good for for everything and I

446
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,179
was like man you know this can't be this

447
00:17:22,019 --> 00:17:26,759
can't be the slacking out again it can't

448
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:27,660
go down like this so

449
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:30,058
um

450
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:33,058
you know you just uh just kind of you

451
00:17:30,058 --> 00:17:35,279
know cross your fingers and um I feel

452
00:17:33,058 --> 00:17:37,319
the best and hope you don't uh you know

453
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:39,720
catch that [ __ ] but you you crammed in

454
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:42,178
so [ __ ] close like in this one unit

455
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,400
there's like 80 [ __ ] people and

456
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:45,960
there's two toilets too [ __ ] tall

457
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,880
it's one for pissing and one from [ __ ]

458
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,200
and there's nothing around them they're

459
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,179
just like kind of just sitting in the

460
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,460
middle of the floor and there there's

461
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:56,100
industrial ones you know so hit the butt

462
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:58,679
it shoots a huge aerosol effect up in

463
00:17:56,099 --> 00:17:59,399
the air so that's spreading [ __ ]

464
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:01,559
um

465
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,600
there's no soap available you know like

466
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:05,759
to give to you so people that got no

467
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:07,740
money or whatever they can't even afford

468
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:10,200
to get some soap to take a shower let

469
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:13,798
alone wash your hands so it was just

470
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:16,679
filthy filthy [ __ ] place too so it

471
00:18:13,798 --> 00:18:19,740
was like well you know it's definitely

472
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:23,100
definitely not looking good uh I didn't

473
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:24,960
end up uh I didn't end up catching it I

474
00:18:23,099 --> 00:18:27,538
was thinking thinking like you know as

475
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,798
all them years being like Emerald cup

476
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:30,599
and everything and that [ __ ]

477
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:32,819
walkthrough that would go around every

478
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:35,399
year I think like and build up some type

479
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:39,558
of super immunity or some [ __ ] like I

480
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,559
didn't uh thank God you know

481
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:44,399
who would have thought all those years

482
00:18:41,819 --> 00:18:45,839
of hitting random joints and blunts

483
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,780
might have paid off for the Cannabis

484
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:50,459
Community it might have man it might

485
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:53,160
have I don't know about everybody else

486
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:55,440
but yeah yeah I thought about I was like

487
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:58,080
you know I've been exposed to a lot of

488
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,179
[ __ ] up [ __ ] man so maybe my immune

489
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:03,058
system would stay Rock Solid and I won't

490
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:06,059
uh I won't get this [ __ ]

491
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:08,038
yeah we look very happy to hear you you

492
00:19:06,058 --> 00:19:09,418
didn't end up uh Contracting it yourself

493
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:11,759
you know it's sort of funny you

494
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:13,500
mentioned that because when when like

495
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:15,298
sort of in the early stages of when

496
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,160
covert came out a research paper came

497
00:19:15,298 --> 00:19:19,500
out from China which basically showed

498
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,600
that people who smoke cigarettes are at

499
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,940
a reduced chance of Contracting the

500
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:26,279
virus and I won't go too much into the

501
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:28,620
details but basically one of the

502
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:30,839
receptors in your lungs gets down

503
00:19:28,619 --> 00:19:32,519
regulated from smoking cigarettes and

504
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:34,199
that's the same receptor the virus uses

505
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:35,759
to enter the cells

506
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,200
and there was a lot of controversy

507
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:38,519
around like do we announce this because

508
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,500
we're worried you know is everyone going

509
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:42,538
to start smoking to a point yeah I'm

510
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:44,160
gonna stay in this this Public Health

511
00:19:42,538 --> 00:19:46,619
Service Announcement sponsored though

512
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,538
Philip Morris sponsored by Philip Morris

513
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:50,159
yeah

514
00:19:47,538 --> 00:19:52,679
oh good stuff good stuff well I mean

515
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,720
look obviously having never experienced

516
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:58,019
it myself I said this with a grain of

517
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,700
salt but I'm sure there's rarely uh an

518
00:19:58,019 --> 00:20:02,400
abundance of overwhelmingly positive

519
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:04,919
things to occur from being in jail but I

520
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,200
was wanting to ask you did you have any

521
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:09,660
sort of Revelations or insights is is

522
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,120
there any sort of new views on life you

523
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:13,860
feel like you've sort of developed since

524
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:16,019
having had this experience and now being

525
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:16,918
free

526
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:19,319
um

527
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:21,360
not like the first time

528
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:23,279
because after the first time yeah

529
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:25,558
definitely you know

530
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:28,019
um get all that self reflection time and

531
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:30,119
see things do things and then you get

532
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:32,099
out and you know everything smells

533
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:33,719
better tastes sweeter you know all that

534
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:35,939
good stuff

535
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:39,120
um so I already had that and that never

536
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:40,558
that never went away

537
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:43,979
um

538
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:46,440
out of it you know I've always tried to

539
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:49,079
you know make the best of every day no

540
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:51,840
matter what I'm doing or where I'm at

541
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:54,538
um and I just took the time to uh come

542
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:57,298
up with ideas and I was doing a lot of

543
00:20:54,538 --> 00:21:00,240
writing at night time when it was uh

544
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:03,298
doors locked and it's safe and quiet and

545
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,339
you're able to you know concentrate and

546
00:21:03,298 --> 00:21:07,619
uh yeah I was working on working on

547
00:21:05,339 --> 00:21:09,480
writing a book and

548
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:12,178
um like I said this coming up with the

549
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:14,880
what's a good good solid uh game plan

550
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:15,960
though so when I hit hit back home you

551
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,960
know I could I could hit the ground

552
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:21,960
running and everything

553
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:25,440
um and just like on the last bit

554
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:27,000
um it's it's the same anybody that ever

555
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,400
gets locked up and got us on the same

556
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,819
thing you really get to see who's with

557
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:34,679
you and who ain't with you right and um

558
00:21:32,819 --> 00:21:36,240
you know it's it's the same every time

559
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:37,919
you know I got to see that on the last

560
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,079
one when I got to see it on this one too

561
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,000
so it was good to like you know you see

562
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:44,819
where people really stand people are

563
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,740
like really really with you in a ride or

564
00:21:44,819 --> 00:21:48,960
die [ __ ]

565
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:51,480
um they're gonna be there

566
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,100
um people that are against you

567
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,620
um you know of course they're gonna take

568
00:21:53,099 --> 00:21:57,298
those opportunities to hate or [ __ ] [ __ ]

569
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:58,918
or whatever and then you're gonna have

570
00:21:57,298 --> 00:22:02,819
people that you thought were gonna be

571
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:04,620
there that end up not being there so a

572
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:07,019
lot of people say

573
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:09,779
you know it's a bummer you know and yeah

574
00:22:07,019 --> 00:22:11,700
it is it's like it's bad don't get me

575
00:22:09,779 --> 00:22:14,099
wrong like the you know it's hurtful

576
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:16,200
right but at the end of the day it's

577
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:17,158
like well [ __ ] imagine going through

578
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,679
life

579
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:21,600
uh with people that you think are like

580
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,600
that just to find out that they're not

581
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:26,339
way later down the road and um I'm

582
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:28,619
always I'm I'm actually you know I'm a

583
00:22:26,339 --> 00:22:31,079
thankful thankful person just it's good

584
00:22:28,619 --> 00:22:34,319
to know you know so that way when I do

585
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:36,359
move on like I you know I know who's who

586
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:39,480
and that's that's a great that's a great

587
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:41,819
[ __ ] thing so out of all of it yeah

588
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:45,000
just you know the time management coming

589
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:46,619
up with you know things to do and then

590
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,619
um you know there's a little working out

591
00:22:46,619 --> 00:22:50,759
you know the normal normal [ __ ] you know

592
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:53,639
but

593
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:55,379
um writing that was cool and just uh you

594
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,080
know seeing like you know some real got

595
00:22:55,380 --> 00:23:00,600
some real solid [ __ ] uh in my

596
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:04,199
corner you know

597
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:06,178
yeah so many uh relevant topics you just

598
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,100
touched on will come back and touch on

599
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:10,019
some of them other other ones shortly

600
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:12,719
but I did want to follow up quickly on

601
00:23:10,019 --> 00:23:15,119
your book I think you really generated a

602
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,819
bit of a buzz because many people like

603
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:19,619
myself have seen you know little bits

604
00:23:17,819 --> 00:23:21,418
and tibbards of the book come out

605
00:23:19,619 --> 00:23:23,399
through you know maybe you've posted a

606
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:24,780
soil mix here maybe you've posted or

607
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,059
something else there

608
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:28,918
when do you anticipate it might be

609
00:23:27,058 --> 00:23:32,519
finished and what sort of things can

610
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:36,059
people hope to learn from this book

611
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:37,918
wow I hate to put a timeline on it

612
00:23:36,058 --> 00:23:39,658
because like it's all written you know

613
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:43,500
and I gotta tape it up

614
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:45,840
my spelling is just atrocious man like

615
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:49,440
I'm just horrible there's so many

616
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:50,220
grammatical errors I'm sure like so

617
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,220
um

618
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:56,159
I'm guessing you know like between Titan

619
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:58,019
and all back up fixing all that

620
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,640
um continuing to add to it because there

621
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:02,038
was like some a lot of things I didn't

622
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,538
have access to some art supplies so

623
00:24:02,038 --> 00:24:05,220
there's a lot of things I wanted to draw

624
00:24:03,538 --> 00:24:07,500
you remember my old sketches and

625
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:09,419
everything I would draw up when I

626
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,859
include stuff like that good charts and

627
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:14,940
like things that I really need access

628
00:24:10,859 --> 00:24:17,519
like printer and you know a computer to

629
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:19,919
to do certain charts and things like

630
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:23,158
that because it's like a big it's a

631
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:25,500
reference type thing it's a how-to plus

632
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:28,200
plus a reference so you got to put all

633
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:30,240
that together and then you've got to uh

634
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:33,480
you know have somebody look at it you

635
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:36,179
know last you know outside eyes do any

636
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:39,179
you know editing needed after that then

637
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:40,980
go through to the Republicans um and I

638
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:43,740
couldn't couldn't put a definitive

639
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:47,940
timeline on it but what people can look

640
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:49,919
out of it is like if you were and maybe

641
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:52,440
not necessarily new to Growing but

642
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,360
you're setting up a new spot

643
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:57,419
um you know guiding people through

644
00:24:54,359 --> 00:25:00,178
literally setting up the space just to

645
00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:01,740
begin with plumbing electrical teaching

646
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:04,259
a little bit of electrical electrical

647
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:06,179
Theory like things safety

648
00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:07,980
um you know so it's like if you gotta

649
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:10,440
delve into some electrical you can go to

650
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:12,480
that and if you're comfortable with it

651
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,400
then by all means you can you can go

652
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,839
ahead and do it or if you just want to

653
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,179
know you got your friend doing it that's

654
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:20,879
cool too but literally setting up the

655
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:22,559
space for Success before you even get

656
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,720
started because so many people would

657
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:27,720
just jump right into a space and start

658
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,159
duct tape and super glue and velcro and

659
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,019
all around them and then they're

660
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:33,240
struggling the whole time and you never

661
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:34,740
catch up because they didn't you know do

662
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,380
the important thing first get the space

663
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:40,620
straight the Environment Straight

664
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:42,539
um yeah soil mixes

665
00:25:40,619 --> 00:25:44,278
um a couple of different regimens that

666
00:25:42,538 --> 00:25:45,900
people could choose from depending on

667
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:48,298
your you know what's in your pocket

668
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:51,120
availability you can mix and match

669
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:52,980
whatever but trying to keep it very

670
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:55,199
definitive like

671
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:58,079
this isn't like you know if you're

672
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,179
reading this it's like just do this do

673
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:03,418
this do this do this do it this way do

674
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:05,460
it just don't mediate from it after you

675
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:08,278
do it then at least you got you got a

676
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:10,380
good you know Baseline of you know

677
00:26:08,278 --> 00:26:12,119
success so if you do said okay well I

678
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:14,520
want to try this try that you can do

679
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:16,319
that but at least you know like hey this

680
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:18,658
did better this did work you at least

681
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:20,879
have your Baseline so it's good for the

682
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:22,919
like so the new the new person wanting

683
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,960
to want to get into their Organics and

684
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:27,900
everything plus like a lot of references

685
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,400
and [ __ ] like that to you know

686
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,259
um you know like a metric metric

687
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:34,440
conversion tables and stuff like that

688
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:36,599
that you know it comes in handy I mean

689
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,940
we all got smartphones and [ __ ] like

690
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:40,500
that but sometimes it's good just to

691
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:42,000
have it having a book real quick where

692
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:45,240
you can just highlight it or go right

693
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,679
back to it and in a nutshell that's it I

694
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:50,159
was gonna do include some of the other

695
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:53,580
writing I did with it but I think this

696
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:55,380
is too much so we'll just keep that as

697
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:59,399
one thing and then the other book just

698
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:01,520
keep that as uh you know a book all the

699
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,519
time

700
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:06,298
uh when you say writings what sort of

701
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:08,720
writings are we we're talking like

702
00:27:06,298 --> 00:27:11,519
uniboma Manifesto type stuff

703
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:16,440
[Laughter]

704
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:18,418
no man just uh personal personal stories

705
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:22,200
um things like that

706
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:24,900
um my thoughts you know thoughts and you

707
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,880
know [ __ ] about uh you know variety

708
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:29,038
variety of different things

709
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,380
the world scene through you know another

710
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:32,460
another set of eyes and a crazy brain I

711
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:35,159
guess

712
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:37,679
I love it like the the modern day Marcus

713
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:39,840
Aurelius meditations that sounds sounds

714
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:42,120
good and I I want to put it out there

715
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:44,519
now so everyone knows I officially call

716
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:47,119
dibs on editing the book

717
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:50,220
oh man you be my editor

718
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:52,439
we gotta do it do it like

719
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:55,200
you know like it's cool because like I

720
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:58,140
still use like in uh color and favorite

721
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,940
and stuff like that so it's cool because

722
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:02,520
I think y'all still do that over there

723
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:05,278
too so it'll work out

724
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:08,639
sounds good sounds good one of the fans

725
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:10,798
submitted questions we got was they sort

726
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,600
of wanted to know first of all was it

727
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:14,099
going to be a more general or a specific

728
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:15,178
book about growing and you sort of

729
00:28:14,099 --> 00:28:16,798
answer it's going to be more General

730
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:18,659
it's going to be like laying out all the

731
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:21,359
options and people choose their own path

732
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:23,700
but one question that did get asked was

733
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:25,979
for some of your more notable strains

734
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:28,080
particularly uh people were asking about

735
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:29,819
the hoodoo I think that's just become a

736
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:32,759
really popular one will you maybe

737
00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:35,220
provide like a specifically dialed in

738
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:37,558
sort of info page or you just want to

739
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:39,298
keep it quite Broad

740
00:28:37,558 --> 00:28:41,460
um yeah with something like a book like

741
00:28:39,298 --> 00:28:44,220
that you kind of you kind of gotta keep

742
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:46,019
it broad but with with every pack that

743
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:48,538
they got there were like specific

744
00:28:46,019 --> 00:28:51,298
tidbits always on the back of every pack

745
00:28:48,538 --> 00:28:52,919
like what to do week to week

746
00:28:51,298 --> 00:28:54,538
um if you needed to supplement more or

747
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:56,460
less or something

748
00:28:54,538 --> 00:28:58,379
um so they can kind of you know if they

749
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:00,778
just if you were to stick to like the

750
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:03,179
Baseline of like Tom growing in this

751
00:29:00,778 --> 00:29:06,359
book and it's not going to deviate from

752
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:08,880
what I'm I'm personally doing so if a

753
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:12,058
person isn't deviating from that your

754
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,580
environments you know in the in this you

755
00:29:12,058 --> 00:29:17,220
know span of acceptable

756
00:29:14,579 --> 00:29:20,038
um the same as mine ultimately at the

757
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:21,778
end if you do everything as as said me

758
00:29:20,038 --> 00:29:22,759
and this other person we should have the

759
00:29:21,778 --> 00:29:26,278
same result

760
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:28,859
so anything in detail that I would write

761
00:29:26,278 --> 00:29:30,778
about it was already you know it was

762
00:29:28,859 --> 00:29:32,699
already on the back of that back of that

763
00:29:30,778 --> 00:29:35,339
card

764
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:37,440
yeah certainly I I think that's one of

765
00:29:35,339 --> 00:29:39,119
the things people view you as notable

766
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,740
for was giving that really sort of

767
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:44,219
in-depth information around the

768
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:45,960
cultivars well the final sort of uh fan

769
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:48,659
submitted question we got around this

770
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:50,519
topic was they sort of asked the

771
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:51,960
question of along the lines of like you

772
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:54,298
know there's so many different ways you

773
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:56,340
can skin a cat in relation to Growing

774
00:29:54,298 --> 00:29:58,019
organically they were just sort of

775
00:29:56,339 --> 00:30:00,778
wondering obviously you've got your own

776
00:29:58,019 --> 00:30:02,579
style do you have any thoughts on the

777
00:30:00,778 --> 00:30:04,200
alternative styles of growing like you

778
00:30:02,579 --> 00:30:06,359
know I know that you don't do like a

779
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,819
pure no-till thing but you do obviously

780
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:10,139
do organic amended bases do you have any

781
00:30:08,819 --> 00:30:11,759
thoughts on the other styles or do you

782
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:13,200
think it's just personal preference sort

783
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:14,819
of thing

784
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,440
um personal preference and like what

785
00:30:14,819 --> 00:30:19,379
works for you

786
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:22,440
um you know I've I've just like I said

787
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:24,539
whatever person wants to do

788
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,000
um by all means like whatever works for

789
00:30:24,538 --> 00:30:30,298
you and your space on your budget like

790
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,240
no two people are exactly the same so

791
00:30:30,298 --> 00:30:35,639
like let us know I like the way

792
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,079
the way I do it and I've tried you know

793
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,899
different other ways

794
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:41,639
felt that for my space and my style and

795
00:30:39,898 --> 00:30:43,678
you know what what I was doing was

796
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,640
working best for me

797
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,620
um

798
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,299
so like and that's that's the thing is

799
00:30:46,619 --> 00:30:50,879
like there's like so many ways it's

800
00:30:48,298 --> 00:30:52,859
gonna cut and a lot of people will get

801
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,960
info from here and info from there and

802
00:30:52,859 --> 00:30:58,558
they kind of muddle it up and sometimes

803
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:00,240
it runs them into a uh into a jam so

804
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:02,639
that's why I was like I wanted just to

805
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,558
keep it very definitively and like the

806
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,840
differences is like like I'm talking

807
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:08,940
about different different approaches to

808
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:12,240
it and when I say different approaches

809
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:14,460
it might just be you know here's here's

810
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,259
a regimen but the alternative to that if

811
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:18,419
you don't have any money you know you

812
00:31:16,259 --> 00:31:21,419
can do this and and still get to that

813
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:24,299
same same part and even alternatively to

814
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:26,820
that if it's a dire emergency and you

815
00:31:24,298 --> 00:31:29,038
know it's going to be more with um you

816
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:30,960
know fixing problems it's like here's a

817
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:33,240
source of this that you can go to that

818
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,460
could be found at a at a grocery store

819
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,140
you know what I mean

820
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:39,319
um things things like that put on

821
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:41,940
MacGyver [ __ ]

822
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:43,079
yeah that's going to be very helpful I

823
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:46,640
think because a lot of people will find

824
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:46,639
them in those situations

825
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:53,519
but we do I think one of the it's sort

826
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:56,158
of an obvious question to us but I I

827
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:58,859
want to ask in a sense is you know

828
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:01,679
people are also curious on top of my own

829
00:31:58,859 --> 00:32:03,898
interest do you plan in the future to

830
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:06,298
return to your breeding to get Dominion

831
00:32:03,898 --> 00:32:07,859
back up and running or do you plan to do

832
00:32:06,298 --> 00:32:09,839
things slightly different to how they

833
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:10,979
were before you left when the time's

834
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:13,980
right that is

835
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:17,159
yeah yeah exactly and you know when the

836
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:19,259
time's right yeah Full Speed Ahead

837
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:21,299
um yeah it's just

838
00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:22,379
the same thing

839
00:32:21,298 --> 00:32:24,480
um

840
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:27,480
you know just uh taking my time through

841
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:30,360
it and not being in a rush and putting

842
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:31,440
out but not good work for people

843
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:33,538
um

844
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,159
you know and I got a lot of other like

845
00:32:33,538 --> 00:32:36,839
you you've already heard you know I got

846
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:39,179
a lot of other projects like that both

847
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:41,939
uh you even inspired me I'm gonna do my

848
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:44,038
own little podcast but it's gonna be

849
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:46,259
different yeah it's gonna be way way

850
00:32:44,038 --> 00:32:50,398
different uh type approach and

851
00:32:46,259 --> 00:32:53,579
everything and it's not going to be 100

852
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:55,139
um Hannah based you know what I mean so

853
00:32:53,579 --> 00:32:56,639
um I just know you know I met a lot of

854
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:59,159
interesting I know a lot of interesting

855
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,340
little people and talk about different

856
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:03,899
[ __ ] because like

857
00:33:01,339 --> 00:33:06,418
we're all into all types of different

858
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:08,579
stuff it's like that the scene or

859
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:10,980
industry or whatever you're into it's

860
00:33:08,579 --> 00:33:12,418
like people just look down like tunnel

861
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:15,298
vision like oh that's all this person

862
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:17,940
does like well no like I had so many

863
00:33:15,298 --> 00:33:20,460
other things surrounding this in my life

864
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:23,519
that you know I like to do and stuff and

865
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:25,500
like you know you know me so

866
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,240
um you know I'm into all types of cool

867
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:30,119
different little hobbies and [ __ ] like

868
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:32,640
that interesting fun stuff and uh I

869
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:33,959
think a lot of other people are too so

870
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,580
um it's just that while we're talking

871
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,079
about something we're really passionate

872
00:33:35,579 --> 00:33:39,058
about that's all it really gets brought

873
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:40,439
up you know but once you really get to

874
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:42,658
talking and knowing somebody you might

875
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:45,120
find out you know and then we're a

876
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:48,419
professional bass fisherman or whatever

877
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:52,379
you just you never know so

878
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:56,480
um from biochemist uh you know I can all

879
00:33:52,380 --> 00:34:00,200
man they'll just have to you know and uh

880
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,200
keep it suspenseful

881
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:05,099
that's exciting do you have do you plan

882
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:08,219
to just sort of some point in the future

883
00:34:05,099 --> 00:34:09,898
or any sort of plans specifically yeah

884
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:12,000
yeah here in the near future I'm gonna

885
00:34:09,898 --> 00:34:13,858
start working on it but I'm gonna Jam a

886
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,378
few out before I ever start

887
00:34:13,858 --> 00:34:18,239
putting them out that way I don't I

888
00:34:16,378 --> 00:34:19,739
don't miss any like lapses so that way

889
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:22,559
every week you know people can look

890
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:24,598
forward to it being there you know

891
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:26,219
maybe a follow-up question to the

892
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:30,059
breeding one a lot of people were

893
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:31,678
interested do you have access to you

894
00:34:30,059 --> 00:34:33,719
know some of the old genetics some of

895
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,519
the old seeds some of the old clones or

896
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:37,138
do you envision that when you do get

897
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:40,320
things back up and running it'll be sort

898
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:41,940
of a fresh start so to speak

899
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,879
um a little bit though so like I still

900
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:49,378
have all everything I had

901
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:51,838
um backed up so you know and I and I did

902
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:53,398
it in a Fail-Safe fashion too so it's

903
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:56,099
like in two places so if anything

904
00:34:53,398 --> 00:34:57,960
happens one the other one the other one

905
00:34:56,099 --> 00:35:00,059
had it you know and because you know

906
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:03,000
life happens [ __ ] happens especially

907
00:35:00,059 --> 00:35:05,579
when you eat regular right so

908
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,980
um yeah man so you know I still have all

909
00:35:05,579 --> 00:35:10,619
all that all that stuff to you know

910
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:13,019
continue any future work along lines I

911
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:16,500
might have already dealt that too to

912
00:35:13,019 --> 00:35:18,599
continue on I had a bunch of projects

913
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:20,159
that I had to put on hold that a lot of

914
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:24,480
final steps were done and it was ready

915
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:27,960
for that that final that final thing so

916
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:31,019
um you know we uh

917
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:34,079
I don't know man like it's just

918
00:35:31,019 --> 00:35:36,420
I got a lot of plans man and you know me

919
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:38,160
I don't I don't like to uh I don't like

920
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:39,659
to give too much out I want to show my

921
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:42,118
hand too early

922
00:35:39,659 --> 00:35:44,399
you know it is you know how it is out

923
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:47,460
there man like people are uh always

924
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,800
looking to copy or empty rip off or

925
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:51,539
whatever so um there's gonna be some

926
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,720
there's gonna be somebody some new

927
00:35:51,539 --> 00:35:53,719
things

928
00:35:54,539 --> 00:35:58,519
I don't know how to yeah say it without

929
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:02,039
giving away so

930
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:04,199
you don't have to wait and see

931
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:05,699
here I mean on that train of thought I

932
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:08,279
think there's probably a lot of people

933
00:36:05,699 --> 00:36:10,858
who in the community have been sitting

934
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:13,140
on some of your packs for a while and

935
00:36:10,858 --> 00:36:15,539
I'm wondering do you have any

936
00:36:13,139 --> 00:36:16,858
recommendations for people you know like

937
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:18,480
if they're sitting on a certain thing

938
00:36:16,858 --> 00:36:20,519
like oh man you should really pop that

939
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,559
one

940
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:24,659
um that was the thing like you know if

941
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:27,119
you ever came to a show or

942
00:36:24,659 --> 00:36:29,159
talk to me personally I'm like well

943
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,260
and what should I get I'm gonna say well

944
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:32,519
what do you need like what are you

945
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:34,440
lacking in life what are you what are

946
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:37,679
you looking for you know and I'd go from

947
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:39,119
there it was a medical necessity or a

948
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:42,960
certain smell of taste you're looking

949
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:45,660
for or you know and go from there so I

950
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:48,358
would say just uh you know dead pretty I

951
00:36:45,659 --> 00:36:51,358
did a pretty good job on descriptions

952
00:36:48,358 --> 00:36:52,500
and everything so

953
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:54,420
um

954
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:57,000
kind of just look at and see what you

955
00:36:54,420 --> 00:37:00,000
what you what you what you want uh what

956
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,460
what you're lacking in life and

957
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,858
um and you know just go from there I

958
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:07,139
would say like if you just been sitting

959
00:37:04,858 --> 00:37:08,940
on them for a real long time

960
00:37:07,139 --> 00:37:11,159
um maybe get if you got one that's like

961
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:13,079
real old maybe get those get those pop

962
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:16,139
in first because they're not getting any

963
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:18,599
younger but outside of that man just uh

964
00:37:16,139 --> 00:37:20,338
just stick with uh stick with your gut

965
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:21,599
what you're what you're wanting or what

966
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:23,460
you want or need right now because

967
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:26,220
obviously they bought them for some some

968
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:28,920
kind of reason you know

969
00:37:26,219 --> 00:37:30,959
yeah definitely and look you gave me a

970
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:33,240
great segue there because specifically

971
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,740
obviously all of the Dominion releases

972
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:35,879
have been very successful but

973
00:37:34,739 --> 00:37:37,379
specifically I've had a lot of people

974
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,300
message me and tell me that they've

975
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:41,940
found some gold and stuff out of there

976
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:44,400
the Vault series and I guess I'm

977
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:46,800
wondering do you have any future plans

978
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,180
for sort of some Vault stuff to or do

979
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,660
you think it'll be more like the

980
00:37:48,179 --> 00:37:54,838
stricter minion stuff going forward

981
00:37:50,659 --> 00:37:57,179
the I mean that could happen again but a

982
00:37:54,838 --> 00:37:59,519
lot of the Vault stuff was like you had

983
00:37:57,179 --> 00:38:01,319
things that may have been intended like

984
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:02,940
all right you know I want to try to do

985
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:05,099
this I want to I want to work this line

986
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:07,619
or whatever and then you go and you try

987
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:09,300
it out you make you make a hybrid you're

988
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:10,858
gonna find a meal out there you're going

989
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:12,780
to go to the next step make the next

990
00:38:10,858 --> 00:38:15,779
step you grow them out you're like wow

991
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:18,720
that totally did not work out at all

992
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:20,760
however the original hybrid that she

993
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:23,759
made for that male the female's [ __ ]

994
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:25,920
name right so it's it's like well

995
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,420
they're not gonna do anything else that

996
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:31,980
project it's not going to move forward

997
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:35,099
any anymore but this [ __ ] all all aside

998
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:36,838
was awesome so you know let's go ahead

999
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:39,119
and let some let some people people

1000
00:38:36,838 --> 00:38:41,820
enjoy that so that was kind of the whole

1001
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:44,820
the whole thing with that

1002
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:46,619
yeah definitely I know specifically

1003
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:48,660
something I wanted to ask you and I

1004
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:51,000
think I already know the answer so I'm a

1005
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:54,420
I'm sort of cheating myself here but I

1006
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,880
remember you made some hybrids with um

1007
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:59,780
specifically you did the Eugenics male

1008
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:05,280
to the skunk Northern Lights five

1009
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:07,920
females yeah oh my God that um that that

1010
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:10,560
female like because I found a clone in

1011
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:12,720
those seeds and in my opinion it was one

1012
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:15,059
of my best clones for ages and sadly I

1013
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:16,618
lost it when I was moving but I just

1014
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:19,320
thought man if there's ever another

1015
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:21,420
chance for me to find like a Fino like

1016
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:23,640
that I would jump on it do you have

1017
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:26,280
access to that sort of plant anymore or

1018
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:29,159
is it is it gone

1019
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:30,900
um yeah like I've given some seeds to a

1020
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:35,279
friend that said they had a bunch of

1021
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:37,740
bunch of stuff in mine and um they do so

1022
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:40,619
when uh when I get around to him I got a

1023
00:39:37,739 --> 00:39:43,439
[ __ ] Amish buddy he loves that [ __ ]

1024
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:44,760
too it was a long story like Bagon was

1025
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,900
working at a steel mill in Pennsylvania

1026
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,820
and

1027
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:50,579
he was getting a weed out of this this

1028
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:52,920
bar and [ __ ] so ever since Sunday's been

1029
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:55,500
kind of stuck on it so

1030
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:59,300
um when I get to those I have to make

1031
00:39:55,500 --> 00:40:02,639
sure that uh oh Queen's mail uh

1032
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:05,460
it finds it finds their way to you

1033
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:07,920
uh look you're you're too kind you're

1034
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:09,599
you're too kind I don't know why this

1035
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,920
jumped into my head but for some reason

1036
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,900
it did when you were sort of talking

1037
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,400
about where you've been in the past I

1038
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:16,500
was wondering I'm not sure if you've

1039
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,599
been like 100 up to date with it all but

1040
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:21,358
uh you know did you have any thoughts on

1041
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:23,640
the progression of the medical cannabis

1042
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:25,199
laws around Virginia you know because a

1043
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:26,639
lot of people have been excited about

1044
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:28,439
that since it's happened and I was

1045
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:31,078
wondering what's your thoughts

1046
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:33,119
oh man it's uh super awesome what's

1047
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:34,800
going on there

1048
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:37,140
um I would say like just the biggest

1049
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,660
biggest thing I can say to him is like

1050
00:40:37,139 --> 00:40:42,118
you fought hard to get it there don't

1051
00:40:39,659 --> 00:40:43,920
stop fighting because just look at the

1052
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:45,960
history of every other state

1053
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:49,440
we'll look at the progression of how how

1054
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:50,519
they work it's basically the corporate

1055
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,139
and government

1056
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:56,639
game plan you know they want to

1057
00:40:54,139 --> 00:41:00,539
so just look at the mistakes of everyone

1058
00:40:56,639 --> 00:41:02,699
before you right and uh you know fight

1059
00:41:00,539 --> 00:41:04,500
fight like that plan you know don't

1060
00:41:02,699 --> 00:41:06,539
don't let them take that from you it's

1061
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:08,579
hard to get there don't let them take it

1062
00:41:06,539 --> 00:41:11,460
from you through the guys of you know

1063
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:13,260
different wreck laws and [ __ ] like that

1064
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:15,119
um they put a law in front of you like

1065
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:17,280
don't don't decide oh yeah that sounds

1066
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,900
great read the whole [ __ ] thing read

1067
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,480
the fine print the devil's in the

1068
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:23,519
details so you know the second you

1069
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:26,280
forget history like that's when [ __ ]

1070
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:29,880
starts to repeat itself so just stay

1071
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:32,280
very adamant stay very Vigilant and you

1072
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:34,920
know keep it keep it strong you know I

1073
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:37,200
know I know how my Bros sisters are out

1074
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:39,480
in uh Virginia they they're a Rowdy

1075
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:42,000
[ __ ] Bunch man so uh you know they

1076
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:45,358
ain't gonna let nothing go easily just

1077
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,400
you know stay stay vigilant and uh don't

1078
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:49,199
don't let them take [ __ ]

1079
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:51,838
some brilliant words of encouragement

1080
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:54,659
there and I guess there's a follow-up do

1081
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:56,460
you see a time when you might head back

1082
00:41:54,659 --> 00:41:58,440
to Virginia to do your breeding work or

1083
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:01,320
the law is just not quite where they

1084
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:03,179
need to be to allow that yet yeah it's

1085
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:06,720
it's it would still be a little too

1086
00:42:03,179 --> 00:42:08,759
early on but I I saw like

1087
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:11,159
um the mode of action and like how how

1088
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:13,140
things are supposed to be implemented so

1089
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:15,719
like it's gonna be a couple years down

1090
00:42:13,139 --> 00:42:17,400
the road before it's there but I'll

1091
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:20,459
definitely be back there just just

1092
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:22,019
hanging out and you know

1093
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:24,300
just you know making trips and

1094
00:42:22,019 --> 00:42:26,519
everything but before I get a get to

1095
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:29,039
move back to the motherland uh yeah it's

1096
00:42:26,519 --> 00:42:31,759
gonna be a couple years before it's

1097
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:34,679
for its proper ready

1098
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:37,619
yeah sure I mean if we look at

1099
00:42:34,679 --> 00:42:40,799
California under the same sort of lens

1100
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:42,660
and sort of analyzing the legislation

1101
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,700
they've brought in a lot of people have

1102
00:42:42,659 --> 00:42:46,739
been critical of 215 including myself

1103
00:42:44,699 --> 00:42:47,838
I'm sure yourself for like a long time

1104
00:42:46,739 --> 00:42:51,358
in California

1105
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:53,578
and recently uh had Ed Rosenthal on the

1106
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:55,739
show and he he made an interesting point

1107
00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:59,339
where he said look you know could the

1108
00:42:55,739 --> 00:43:01,078
laws be better sure but at the end of

1109
00:42:59,338 --> 00:43:03,539
the day if you're keeping people out of

1110
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:05,700
jail for cannabis that's a net win no

1111
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:07,440
matter how much it could be improved

1112
00:43:05,699 --> 00:43:08,699
that you have to view it as a net win

1113
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,099
that we're keeping people out of jail

1114
00:43:08,699 --> 00:43:13,559
for cannabis and I thought given your

1115
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:16,140
recent sort of you know uh departure

1116
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:17,759
from jail would you say that this is you

1117
00:43:16,139 --> 00:43:19,078
know as much as it might be a bit of

1118
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,819
taste in people's mouth because there's

1119
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:22,318
a lot of people who don't like the way

1120
00:43:20,818 --> 00:43:24,599
their business has been affected because

1121
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:26,338
of it would you agree with Ed Rosenthal

1122
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:27,900
in that sense in saying that keeping

1123
00:43:26,338 --> 00:43:30,358
people out of jail should probably be

1124
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:33,000
the number one priority

1125
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:34,559
um yeah of course because like

1126
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,280
you're saying

1127
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:41,159
the words legal

1128
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:44,880
recreationally legal like the word legal

1129
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:47,578
how in the [ __ ] is anybody going to jail

1130
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:50,099
or something they call Legal you know

1131
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:52,980
what I mean like that's that's kind of

1132
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:55,200
absurd to me so yeah like yeah people

1133
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:57,420
definitely shouldn't be uh couldn't be

1134
00:43:55,199 --> 00:44:00,239
getting hauled off for it

1135
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:04,920
um does it does that happen you know

1136
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:06,899
yeah absolutely you know so um

1137
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:09,780
and you know maybe it's changed since

1138
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:11,700
they first implemented it but um like

1139
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:13,980
sun Grand mids and a few other guys that

1140
00:44:11,699 --> 00:44:16,199
are like real Savvy with everything

1141
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:18,119
going on these laws and everything they

1142
00:44:16,199 --> 00:44:20,098
were like my go-to's and since I didn't

1143
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:22,619
live in the state either

1144
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:24,960
um you know I'm I'm only gonna know what

1145
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:26,700
you know what's being shown to me and

1146
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:30,420
you know sold to me

1147
00:44:26,699 --> 00:44:31,739
and um you know when they had met or

1148
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:33,420
whatever

1149
00:44:31,739 --> 00:44:35,578
um I guess like when they went rack like

1150
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:39,000
some of the penalties or certain things

1151
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:42,960
change and it was it was worse

1152
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:45,179
right than it was beforehand so you know

1153
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:48,119
I um I don't know if that was in the

1154
00:44:45,179 --> 00:44:50,460
proposal or if that's actually what went

1155
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:51,539
through it was a long time ago but I

1156
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:53,880
thought that you know I was like hey

1157
00:44:51,539 --> 00:44:55,920
let's kind of kind of [ __ ] up man and

1158
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:58,140
how is it going to be legal and still

1159
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:00,059
like somebody's gonna go to the good of

1160
00:44:58,139 --> 00:45:01,858
the [ __ ] joint over it like [ __ ] up

1161
00:45:00,059 --> 00:45:04,739
you know

1162
00:45:01,858 --> 00:45:06,358
yeah I mean you raise a brilliant point

1163
00:45:04,739 --> 00:45:07,858
there you know it's almost a

1164
00:45:06,358 --> 00:45:09,719
contradiction right the fact is legal

1165
00:45:07,858 --> 00:45:11,940
but people still go to jail especially

1166
00:45:09,719 --> 00:45:14,459
when you think about the the Sackler

1167
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:16,318
family the the guys who put out what is

1168
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:18,179
like oxy and stuff and it's like those

1169
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:20,579
[ __ ] aren't going to jail and

1170
00:45:18,179 --> 00:45:22,679
yet people with a few pounds a few

1171
00:45:20,579 --> 00:45:25,619
plants over that yeah it's it's such a

1172
00:45:22,679 --> 00:45:27,899
contradictory isn't it yeah yeah big big

1173
00:45:25,619 --> 00:45:30,240
time man so

1174
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:32,519
um so yeah like yeah I definitely

1175
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:36,059
believe like nobody should be passed

1176
00:45:32,519 --> 00:45:37,980
down over over a plan like if you want

1177
00:45:36,059 --> 00:45:41,400
to like make the argument like well

1178
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:43,559
they're non-regulated grower and they're

1179
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,660
growing and doing all this well I don't

1180
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:49,139
I don't see that as a crime like

1181
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:51,960
you know but if they want to like you

1182
00:45:49,139 --> 00:45:53,879
know further it and say well the reason

1183
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:55,559
why is like dude was making a million

1184
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:59,338
dollars and not paying it back so okay

1185
00:45:55,559 --> 00:46:01,739
not paying taxes on Revenue okay cool

1186
00:45:59,338 --> 00:46:04,920
right of course like dude broke the law

1187
00:46:01,739 --> 00:46:07,318
what whatever but you know everything

1188
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:08,818
before that like if you want to grow a

1189
00:46:07,318 --> 00:46:10,739
[ __ ] plant should be able to grow a

1190
00:46:08,818 --> 00:46:11,460
[ __ ] plan you know

1191
00:46:10,739 --> 00:46:13,858
um

1192
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:15,480
yeah that's just that's just my my

1193
00:46:13,858 --> 00:46:18,179
opinion on it you know

1194
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:20,940
no I I think that's that's a very

1195
00:46:18,179 --> 00:46:23,519
insightful take for sure another one

1196
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:25,619
that's weird is uh like Washington DC

1197
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:27,719
it's not a state District of Columbia

1198
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:29,460
like where they make the laws and

1199
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:31,858
everything you know that's where the

1200
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:33,599
White House is and all that so since

1201
00:46:31,858 --> 00:46:35,400
it's not a state it's governed by

1202
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:38,818
federal law

1203
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:40,139
um so the other argument is like oh you

1204
00:46:38,818 --> 00:46:41,940
know and I'm going through that now

1205
00:46:40,139 --> 00:46:44,759
that's the reason I can't Blaze I'm a

1206
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:47,338
federal probation so since weeds

1207
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:49,079
federally illegal

1208
00:46:47,338 --> 00:46:50,219
um they say it doesn't matter what the

1209
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:53,460
state because the feds are going to

1210
00:46:50,219 --> 00:46:56,639
Trump over you know what the state says

1211
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:59,880
so okay so how in the [ __ ]

1212
00:46:56,639 --> 00:47:02,219
as we'd still federally illegal when

1213
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:04,740
it's recreationally legal

1214
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:07,980
in Washington DC a land Government

1215
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:10,979
Federal Law they riddle riddle me that

1216
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:14,579
yeah yeah it's very contradictory isn't

1217
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:16,920
it very yeah very very contradictory and

1218
00:47:14,579 --> 00:47:19,140
very frustrating you know

1219
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:22,980
think about it you know it's like we're

1220
00:47:19,139 --> 00:47:26,059
almost in 2022 and still having that

1221
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:28,858
still having that thought why why

1222
00:47:26,059 --> 00:47:30,900
like how like how how is this still

1223
00:47:28,858 --> 00:47:33,659
still a thing you know

1224
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:35,818
do you foresee a time in the near future

1225
00:47:33,659 --> 00:47:37,679
when you know some of these

1226
00:47:35,818 --> 00:47:40,920
inconsistencies get ironed out or do you

1227
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:45,239
think it's just gonna naggle on forever

1228
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:47,760
um I think as long as you got a lot of

1229
00:47:45,239 --> 00:47:49,858
a lot of the old guys that are still

1230
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:52,380
hanging in there

1231
00:47:49,858 --> 00:47:54,179
um that are influenced by Pharma and

1232
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:56,579
stuff like that lobbyists and everything

1233
00:47:54,179 --> 00:47:59,940
special interest groups you're gonna

1234
00:47:56,579 --> 00:48:02,039
have a lot of foot Dragon even though if

1235
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:03,900
they know damn right that they're dead

1236
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:06,300
and wrong they're still going to do it

1237
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:08,700
because you know money or promises

1238
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:10,079
whatever and it's going to take a while

1239
00:48:08,699 --> 00:48:13,318
because a lot of these guys start

1240
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:13,920
getting out or dying or whatever

1241
00:48:13,318 --> 00:48:15,838
um

1242
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,420
you know it's weird because like a lot

1243
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:19,318
of the people that are

1244
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:21,838
lawmakers and everything they're like

1245
00:48:19,318 --> 00:48:24,659
really old people really old multiple

1246
00:48:21,838 --> 00:48:26,940
ways of excuse me old school ways of

1247
00:48:24,659 --> 00:48:29,399
thought and they're kind of uh you know

1248
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:31,500
they're kind of [ __ ] up bummer you

1249
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:33,300
know I mean it's like proven fact you

1250
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:35,039
know they take all the special interests

1251
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:37,260
money and stuff and see where they come

1252
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:39,838
from like yeah of course you know like

1253
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:41,400
Mark Pharmaceuticals is like super huge

1254
00:48:39,838 --> 00:48:43,440
and you know donating all this money

1255
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:45,838
this person they're very adamant about

1256
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:49,500
like hey you know no I don't think it

1257
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:53,219
should be legal oh why oh well

1258
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:55,019
you know the kids because they're like

1259
00:48:53,219 --> 00:48:57,118
oh actually it shows that like you know

1260
00:48:55,019 --> 00:48:58,739
the smoke has gone dramatically down the

1261
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:00,740
under eight people blah blah blah and

1262
00:48:58,739 --> 00:49:05,578
like there's there's some facts

1263
00:49:00,739 --> 00:49:08,519
no no I'm just nah I don't think so all

1264
00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:11,339
right because you know as I say so so

1265
00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:12,659
yeah maybe next time boys you know that

1266
00:49:11,338 --> 00:49:15,299
type of [ __ ]

1267
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:16,920
it's insane isn't it how many people are

1268
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:20,880
Guided by

1269
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:23,880
just feelings or religious views or

1270
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:27,119
contextual Society stuff of like yeah

1271
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:28,200
it's wild yeah yeah it's really uh

1272
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:31,200
really

1273
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:33,299
really insane man especially they keep

1274
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:35,519
people like fitted against each other

1275
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:37,500
all the time too

1276
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:40,079
um you know division you know that's a

1277
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:42,179
good way to to keep doing what you're

1278
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:44,460
doing to keep people divided from coming

1279
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:46,500
together and you know it's

1280
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:49,019
that's a that's an old school trick they

1281
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:51,300
do it every day people still falling for

1282
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:53,099
that [ __ ]

1283
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:55,619
maybe maybe we just need to get our own

1284
00:49:53,099 --> 00:49:58,800
kind of us lobbyists and get some equal

1285
00:49:55,619 --> 00:50:00,480
representation yeah yeah that would be

1286
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:03,900
that would be cool

1287
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:05,699
um yeah a lot of money for that yeah a

1288
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:08,338
whole lot of money for that we're

1289
00:50:05,699 --> 00:50:09,838
talking a lot millions and millions and

1290
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:12,299
millions and millions of dollars that

1291
00:50:09,838 --> 00:50:13,679
they're pumping all the time so like you

1292
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:16,440
got to be able to keep up with that

1293
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:18,539
that's a hard thing to do man

1294
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:21,300
yeah it's interesting right because you

1295
00:50:18,539 --> 00:50:23,400
sort of painted an actually quite a

1296
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:24,780
clear picture in my mind there where a

1297
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:27,358
lot of people in the community are

1298
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:29,880
really critical of brands that aren't

1299
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:31,920
striving to be the absolute Pinnacle you

1300
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:34,079
know we always hear about how people say

1301
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:36,659
oh if you want to be the Bud Light of

1302
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:38,880
cannabis go for it or whatever and you

1303
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:40,679
sort of just made me realize maybe we do

1304
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,900
need more of that so that there are

1305
00:50:40,679 --> 00:50:44,818
people who can throw millions of dollars

1306
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:46,380
at lobbyist because maybe maybe that's

1307
00:50:44,818 --> 00:50:49,440
what you need like you know the mass

1308
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:51,358
production mid-tier because maybe yeah

1309
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,358
like you know maybe jungle boys is never

1310
00:50:51,358 --> 00:50:55,440
going to do it themselves

1311
00:50:53,358 --> 00:50:57,900
well I think like

1312
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:00,960
that's the thing is like

1313
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:03,420
people automatically associate anybody

1314
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:05,400
doing it big with beds because I mean

1315
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:07,619
you know that

1316
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:09,599
primarily yeah I mean that's that's kind

1317
00:51:07,619 --> 00:51:11,160
of how it is that's not to say that

1318
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:13,500
there aren't going to be some people

1319
00:51:11,159 --> 00:51:16,199
that come up and just [ __ ] kill it

1320
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:16,920
and do it the right way you know

1321
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:18,719
um

1322
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:20,220
you know and do it and do it without any

1323
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:23,159
like outside like corporate money

1324
00:51:20,219 --> 00:51:24,539
there's people that self-start but you

1325
00:51:23,159 --> 00:51:26,759
know that's the that's the bad part

1326
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:28,139
about being a slow starter is like you

1327
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,220
don't have all these investors you don't

1328
00:51:28,139 --> 00:51:31,558
have a lot of money you're like walking

1329
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:33,659
around in our Grassroots to make it big

1330
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:34,859
right so and there just hasn't been

1331
00:51:33,659 --> 00:51:36,118
enough time for a lot of these people to

1332
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:39,299
shine they're out there slugging it out

1333
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:41,519
and like they're getting there but

1334
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:43,500
um you know that time's still gonna it's

1335
00:51:41,519 --> 00:51:45,119
still gonna come and I think yeah when

1336
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:47,219
you do get there and it's not going to

1337
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:49,440
be like you know he said the Bud Light

1338
00:51:47,219 --> 00:51:52,500
weed I mean yeah you know it's right but

1339
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:54,420
yeah it's not to say somebody can't you

1340
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:56,400
know take what they're doing and still

1341
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:58,260
be quality high and then also keep

1342
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,220
reduction out like there's ways to do it

1343
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:01,500
it's just

1344
00:51:59,219 --> 00:52:03,299
a lot of the Chads that had all that big

1345
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:04,858
investment money that went in and it's

1346
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:07,380
through you know millions of dollars out

1347
00:52:04,858 --> 00:52:09,420
and blew up big they're not they're not

1348
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:11,099
craft type Growers they're not really

1349
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:13,619
Growers at all you know they're just

1350
00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:15,240
kind of hiring mediocre people for a

1351
00:52:13,619 --> 00:52:18,000
mediocre pay which is going to end up

1352
00:52:15,239 --> 00:52:19,858
being a mediocre job so

1353
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,380
um it's the same like skilled labor

1354
00:52:19,858 --> 00:52:25,078
isn't cheap cheap labor isn't skilled

1355
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:27,660
and they're paying cheap man so you get

1356
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:29,940
you kind of get what you pay for so but

1357
00:52:27,659 --> 00:52:31,739
I think I think we'll see a change you

1358
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:33,720
know in the near future and especially

1359
00:52:31,739 --> 00:52:35,879
you start looking like States like

1360
00:52:33,719 --> 00:52:38,219
Virginia coming online

1361
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:40,920
um it has a lot of farm boys there and

1362
00:52:38,219 --> 00:52:42,899
and girls all right including y'all

1363
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:45,119
um that really know how to they know how

1364
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:47,700
to do big things you know so I got a lot

1365
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:50,338
of Hope and I got a lot of faith uh

1366
00:52:47,699 --> 00:52:52,679
faith in Virginia

1367
00:52:50,338 --> 00:52:55,980
hell yeah that's exciting

1368
00:52:52,679 --> 00:52:57,358
if we just sort of uh change the topic

1369
00:52:55,980 --> 00:53:00,059
for a minute I was hoping to get into

1370
00:52:57,358 --> 00:53:01,980
some breeding stuff because probably the

1371
00:53:00,059 --> 00:53:03,900
the majority of questions that were

1372
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:06,300
submitted by listeners were related to

1373
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:09,059
that and I think you know if I sort of

1374
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:11,400
amalgamate many of the questions slash

1375
00:53:09,059 --> 00:53:13,319
concerns together I think I can sort of

1376
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:15,660
embody it with the question of you know

1377
00:53:13,318 --> 00:53:17,759
have you changed your mind at all in

1378
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:19,818
regards to the direction you want to

1379
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:22,559
take your breeding because in the past

1380
00:53:19,818 --> 00:53:24,119
you've always felt that there's a

1381
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:25,859
certain importance around certain

1382
00:53:24,119 --> 00:53:28,318
cultivars like notably sort of some of

1383
00:53:25,858 --> 00:53:30,659
the chem family the skunks for example

1384
00:53:28,318 --> 00:53:33,300
you've worked extensively with some of

1385
00:53:30,659 --> 00:53:34,500
these lines 88g13 do you think that

1386
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:37,140
you're going to continue with that

1387
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:41,159
direction or do you have an inkling to

1388
00:53:37,139 --> 00:53:45,118
welcome some new blood into the Haram

1389
00:53:41,159 --> 00:53:46,618
well I do uh I don't have any uh

1390
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:49,200
anything

1391
00:53:46,619 --> 00:53:51,180
really uh against anything new and there

1392
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:53,699
are going to be some new things but um

1393
00:53:51,179 --> 00:53:55,500
yeah man so you know yeah definitely

1394
00:53:53,699 --> 00:53:57,598
some of the new

1395
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:59,639
um back then you know I just had I had

1396
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:02,099
goals in mind you know start off with

1397
00:53:59,639 --> 00:54:04,618
what you want in a bowl and you know go

1398
00:54:02,099 --> 00:54:06,180
from there and I had some some things I

1399
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:07,380
wanted to see things I wanted to do and

1400
00:54:06,179 --> 00:54:10,139
some goals

1401
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:12,780
and I worked hard toward those goals and

1402
00:54:10,139 --> 00:54:14,940
then I made those goals happen so um

1403
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:17,880
there's some some that aren't aren't

1404
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:19,079
finished you know that I still got

1405
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:21,838
um

1406
00:54:19,079 --> 00:54:23,579
so we'll you know pick up there but yeah

1407
00:54:21,838 --> 00:54:26,400
there's a whole bunch of other things

1408
00:54:23,579 --> 00:54:28,500
I'd like to do and yeah it involve some

1409
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,420
some new things something new something

1410
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:33,599
old type of deal

1411
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:35,639
yeah nice I mean is there any specific

1412
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:37,859
lines of yours that you're really

1413
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:41,759
itching to get back into or it's going

1414
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:44,639
to be more open platter and evaluate

1415
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:46,200
um well I wanted to uh I wanted to

1416
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:49,318
finish up

1417
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:51,358
primarily like a couple of couple of

1418
00:54:49,318 --> 00:54:53,579
projects that I had like I said I was on

1419
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:56,098
that last step so I want to get them

1420
00:54:53,579 --> 00:54:57,599
knocked out first and foremost after

1421
00:54:56,099 --> 00:54:58,500
that point

1422
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:01,440
um

1423
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:03,358
I got a couple in mind but I guess I

1424
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:05,818
don't wanna I don't want to show my

1425
00:55:03,358 --> 00:55:09,119
hands too early man

1426
00:55:05,818 --> 00:55:09,838
yeah no understandable for sure well I

1427
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:11,640
had

1428
00:55:09,838 --> 00:55:13,980
um some questions from listeners who

1429
00:55:11,639 --> 00:55:16,440
were hoping maybe you could give them a

1430
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:18,599
little bit more sort of of an

1431
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:20,700
explanation or just maybe some thoughts

1432
00:55:18,599 --> 00:55:22,740
on some of the the packs they got from

1433
00:55:20,699 --> 00:55:24,500
you and one of the ones that caught my

1434
00:55:22,739 --> 00:55:26,939
eye was someone was interested to know

1435
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:29,579
what are the differences in your mind

1436
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:31,679
between say the skunk band and the dead

1437
00:55:29,579 --> 00:55:33,800
band given you know they are fairly

1438
00:55:31,679 --> 00:55:36,358
similar

1439
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:39,660
yeah very similar

1440
00:55:36,358 --> 00:55:42,838
um once one's given more more of the

1441
00:55:39,659 --> 00:55:45,118
narcotic knockdown Stone and you're

1442
00:55:42,838 --> 00:55:48,599
getting a difference in the flavonoids

1443
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:52,200
you know more the more the hashy hashy

1444
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:54,900
funky orag side of things and also like

1445
00:55:52,199 --> 00:55:57,299
structure and girth like half to it too

1446
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:59,818
that dead band has definitely had the

1447
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:02,579
more the more heft to it

1448
00:55:59,818 --> 00:56:06,659
um skunk band had more of that headband

1449
00:56:02,579 --> 00:56:08,579
type sour uh consistency to the book

1450
00:56:06,659 --> 00:56:11,338
um that band definitely had more the

1451
00:56:08,579 --> 00:56:13,640
more the knock down knock down type stun

1452
00:56:11,338 --> 00:56:13,639
too

1453
00:56:14,159 --> 00:56:20,639
yeah beautiful stuff there do you have

1454
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:22,619
any plans to re-release any of the lines

1455
00:56:20,639 --> 00:56:24,118
or you just want to focus on new things

1456
00:56:22,619 --> 00:56:27,119
going forward

1457
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:29,220
well there were certain things

1458
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:30,260
that are made and I thought I made

1459
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:33,299
enough

1460
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:34,440
but the problem was like every not a

1461
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:36,839
problem I guess it's a good problem is

1462
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:39,300
like people are really digging work

1463
00:56:36,838 --> 00:56:41,699
and as it was like it was catching on as

1464
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:43,559
I'm doing it so they they get onto this

1465
00:56:41,699 --> 00:56:45,659
new thing to them it's like it's been

1466
00:56:43,559 --> 00:56:46,619
out for six months or a year and they're

1467
00:56:45,659 --> 00:56:48,420
gone

1468
00:56:46,619 --> 00:56:49,858
you know

1469
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:51,599
um and I was just all about moving

1470
00:56:49,858 --> 00:56:53,460
forward moving forward

1471
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:56,338
um so there were certain ones that were

1472
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:57,380
very exceptional that I was like it's

1473
00:56:56,338 --> 00:57:01,078
it's

1474
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:04,200
worthy of the time to you know take it

1475
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:06,359
to an F3 or an F4 and and put it put it

1476
00:57:04,199 --> 00:57:08,219
back out there you know so there are

1477
00:57:06,358 --> 00:57:10,558
there are some of those that I'll

1478
00:57:08,219 --> 00:57:12,779
definitely go that route but

1479
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:14,339
that's that's going to be a hopeful

1480
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:16,019
answer to a lot of people listening

1481
00:57:14,338 --> 00:57:18,480
because I was going to say I did a quick

1482
00:57:16,019 --> 00:57:20,519
little tally of the strains that got

1483
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:22,679
mentioned from the listeners and the top

1484
00:57:20,519 --> 00:57:24,539
three that people had questions about oh

1485
00:57:22,679 --> 00:57:25,799
we're just in general really excited

1486
00:57:24,539 --> 00:57:27,719
about was

1487
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:29,460
the Polecat back cross which I think

1488
00:57:27,719 --> 00:57:30,659
might sort of fall into the category you

1489
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:33,780
just mentioned where you know people

1490
00:57:30,659 --> 00:57:35,759
only really realized about it you know a

1491
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:37,260
month after the release but the other

1492
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:39,960
two that made the list was the local

1493
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:41,520
skunk and the hoodoo were those some of

1494
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:44,639
the lines that you know you were

1495
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:48,119
thinking in that last answer

1496
00:57:44,639 --> 00:57:49,460
um yeah absolutely absolutely those are

1497
00:57:48,119 --> 00:57:51,660
definitely one Screaming Eagle

1498
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:53,940
definitely definitely would make the

1499
00:57:51,659 --> 00:57:55,799
list for me too because and you see like

1500
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:59,220
a lot of people don't know but people

1501
00:57:55,800 --> 00:58:01,619
that do know they you know they know so

1502
00:57:59,219 --> 00:58:03,959
um yeah that's definitely another one

1503
00:58:01,619 --> 00:58:06,599
you know there's only so many people had

1504
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:09,000
that one as well

1505
00:58:06,599 --> 00:58:10,800
yeah nice I've I've actually got a

1506
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,480
personal question for you that I've been

1507
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:15,318
wanting to ask you for a while but I

1508
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:19,199
never got the opportunity but basically

1509
00:58:15,318 --> 00:58:21,179
use Pantene that's what I use

1510
00:58:19,199 --> 00:58:22,759
beautiful stuff that's how you keep it

1511
00:58:21,179 --> 00:58:24,719
silky smooth

1512
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:28,079
that's right

1513
00:58:24,719 --> 00:58:32,699
I ended up growing out uh some of your

1514
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:36,660
chemd cross c99 feminized yeah I found

1515
00:58:32,699 --> 00:58:39,480
this pheno which to me is like bang on

1516
00:58:36,659 --> 00:58:41,759
chem 91.

1517
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:44,280
and I just always was like man that's

1518
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:46,619
crazy it's like chemd and c99 and I'm

1519
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:49,140
getting this plant that has like no real

1520
00:58:46,619 --> 00:58:51,660
sativa characteristics or influence in

1521
00:58:49,139 --> 00:58:53,879
the effect and not only that it sort of

1522
00:58:51,659 --> 00:58:56,460
tastes and looks like chem 91 more than

1523
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:58,260
the chem D and it got me wondering I was

1524
00:58:56,460 --> 00:59:00,298
like do you think you know because some

1525
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:02,460
people try to say maybe the chemd

1526
00:59:00,298 --> 00:59:03,719
actually came from the chem 91 and I

1527
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:05,940
thought that's the only thing I could

1528
00:59:03,719 --> 00:59:07,798
think of which maybe explained it a bit

1529
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:09,420
do you have any thoughts or do you just

1530
00:59:07,798 --> 00:59:11,400
think look chem D and the chem 91 are

1531
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:14,880
similar like that's that's it

1532
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:16,619
well the 91 you know being related you

1533
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:19,019
know yeah of course and that is that is

1534
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:21,780
the correct line of thought but let's

1535
00:59:19,019 --> 00:59:23,159
let's take it back a step further all

1536
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:25,260
right so

1537
00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:27,118
all right when I was working with

1538
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:28,980
Princess when we were doing the doing

1539
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:30,480
the brothers Grim thing you smoked the

1540
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:31,679
bud and everything you've seen it you've

1541
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:34,559
seen it grow

1542
00:59:31,679 --> 00:59:37,618
and there was no question in my mind

1543
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:41,880
that that magical you know backseat or

1544
00:59:37,619 --> 00:59:43,980
whatever was an NL hybrid like that that

1545
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:46,039
princess reminded me a lot and women

1546
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:50,818
like so

1547
00:59:46,039 --> 00:59:52,318
when when Saul or Sly who whomever was

1548
00:59:50,818 --> 00:59:55,679
doing that

1549
00:59:52,318 --> 00:59:57,358
um they they they chose a male to start

1550
00:59:55,679 --> 01:00:00,419
that cubing process right and if she

1551
00:59:57,358 --> 01:00:03,000
discovered as Northern Lights and skunk

1552
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:06,480
me personally I felt always felt like

1553
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:08,940
and I was gone would be a good nominee

1554
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:11,699
for the mystery pollen donor to make

1555
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:13,559
come anyway I was just always my gut and

1556
01:00:11,699 --> 01:00:16,798
you know I still still feel that way I

1557
01:00:13,559 --> 01:00:18,420
still think that way all right so

1558
01:00:16,798 --> 01:00:20,699
he takes uh

1559
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:23,220
and he hits it he hits that princess he

1560
01:00:20,699 --> 01:00:26,879
does his cubing process right so now you

1561
01:00:23,219 --> 01:00:30,239
got those jeans in the pool so and to me

1562
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:32,700
like when I smoked princess that the

1563
01:00:30,239 --> 01:00:35,219
first time this is [ __ ] kind of

1564
01:00:32,699 --> 01:00:37,739
narcotic [ __ ] weed man I got nothing

1565
01:00:35,219 --> 01:00:41,159
nothing sativa out of it basically a

1566
01:00:37,739 --> 01:00:43,979
shorter plant doesn't stretch crazy it

1567
01:00:41,159 --> 01:00:45,659
doesn't it definitely doesn't scream at

1568
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:48,298
me

1569
01:00:45,659 --> 01:00:50,879
so with having those jeans in the pool

1570
01:00:48,298 --> 01:00:53,759
and then ultimately that clone that was

1571
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:56,579
used was just I mean you remember man

1572
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:58,260
you've been to my shop you saw me

1573
01:00:56,579 --> 01:01:01,019
growing it and doing it right you've had

1574
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:04,980
the Bud you smelled the jars

1575
01:01:01,019 --> 01:01:06,599
um it was [ __ ] Funky Man kind of you

1576
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:09,480
know that gassy

1577
01:01:06,599 --> 01:01:11,579
[ __ ] nasty nasty smell to it you know

1578
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:13,740
and it was like as close to that

1579
01:01:11,579 --> 01:01:16,318
princess it wasn't exactly like it by

1580
01:01:13,739 --> 01:01:19,139
any means you know but you know it was

1581
01:01:16,318 --> 01:01:22,679
as close to it as I'd seen and any

1582
01:01:19,139 --> 01:01:25,679
anything else so having that

1583
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:28,139
as a pollen owner and solving that that

1584
01:01:25,679 --> 01:01:31,199
plant and using that reverse pollen to

1585
01:01:28,139 --> 01:01:33,960
hit chemd you know it's passing passing

1586
01:01:31,199 --> 01:01:36,298
everything I could out of that out of

1587
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:38,400
that original female that that could be

1588
01:01:36,298 --> 01:01:40,559
passed on so

1589
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:42,240
Bob getting all those jeans back in that

1590
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:44,400
pool that doesn't you know it's like no

1591
01:01:42,239 --> 01:01:47,039
surprise to me that you would see

1592
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:49,619
females that are spot on you know some

1593
01:01:47,039 --> 01:01:52,259
more like you know the the mother you

1594
01:01:49,619 --> 01:01:54,480
know the Kennedy some being like uh the

1595
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:56,099
Cindy and then you know Glenda the two

1596
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:59,400
ones that mean slightly one way or the

1597
01:01:56,099 --> 01:02:02,880
other but also expressing the the the

1598
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:05,639
parents and the and the uh the sisters

1599
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:08,760
if you will so that that doesn't doesn't

1600
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:10,920
surprise me surprise me at all

1601
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:13,680
yeah no that's a brilliant explanation

1602
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:16,200
and I I think I really resonate with how

1603
01:02:13,679 --> 01:02:18,779
you were describing a princess was more

1604
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:22,078
of an Indica I think yeah you definitely

1605
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:22,859
notice that disorientating factor of the

1606
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:26,700
high

1607
01:02:22,858 --> 01:02:29,420
yeah big time Big Time man it would it

1608
01:02:26,699 --> 01:02:31,858
would slump you slump you back dude

1609
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:34,619
yeah you know it's it's only now that

1610
01:02:31,858 --> 01:02:36,480
you say it that I think to myself if no

1611
01:02:34,619 --> 01:02:39,599
one ever told me and you put princess

1612
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:41,880
and genius like the buds at least next

1613
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:43,619
to each other I definitely would never

1614
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:45,000
have thought they were related

1615
01:02:43,619 --> 01:02:49,079
yeah

1616
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:51,239
and with with genius

1617
01:02:49,079 --> 01:02:53,039
you know I was like if I had my guts

1618
01:02:51,239 --> 01:02:58,318
like it reminded me so much of Super

1619
01:02:53,039 --> 01:03:00,239
Soul cakes I mean so much man and um

1620
01:02:58,318 --> 01:03:05,179
you know so that led me to think like

1621
01:03:00,239 --> 01:03:08,939
hey maybe you know maybe it was like uh

1622
01:03:05,179 --> 01:03:11,219
maybe like you know Haze or something

1623
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:12,838
like that that it was the diner like

1624
01:03:11,219 --> 01:03:14,699
there you know tell me what what

1625
01:03:12,838 --> 01:03:17,759
happened you know it's supposed to be a

1626
01:03:14,699 --> 01:03:21,480
bag You Know Jack air or whatever but

1627
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:22,740
you know that that mystery donor uh gave

1628
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:25,740
us something like

1629
01:03:22,739 --> 01:03:29,159
like uh like princess and that one was

1630
01:03:25,739 --> 01:03:32,098
so different so that's not to say what

1631
01:03:29,159 --> 01:03:33,779
if there was more donors right well if

1632
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:37,338
it wasn't just one donor

1633
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:39,359
the multiple pollen sources

1634
01:03:37,338 --> 01:03:41,039
yeah I guess that's actually a

1635
01:03:39,358 --> 01:03:43,259
possibility that's never really been

1636
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:44,519
discussed very much has it

1637
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:46,440
no

1638
01:03:44,519 --> 01:03:47,219
I got sat there thinking many a night

1639
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:50,960
like

1640
01:03:47,219 --> 01:03:50,959
this doesn't make any [ __ ] sense

1641
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:56,280
yeah yeah especially off such a small

1642
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:58,259
number of seeds popped you just wouldn't

1643
01:03:56,280 --> 01:04:00,599
expect to see that variation

1644
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:03,119
right and this wasn't like

1645
01:04:00,599 --> 01:04:05,940
you know bud that he grew

1646
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:09,900
this is purchase Bud from a coffee shop

1647
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:12,679
in Amsterdam so I used to say like it's

1648
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:15,539
not you know a bunch of different buds

1649
01:04:12,679 --> 01:04:18,419
homogenized in a in a tray from a

1650
01:04:15,539 --> 01:04:19,920
harvest and some plants were near one

1651
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:21,240
side of the room and then the other side

1652
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:23,280
of the room and

1653
01:04:21,239 --> 01:04:24,779
you know only got hit with one one got

1654
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:27,000
hit with the other and one bud had some

1655
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:28,740
seasonal but had some seed but

1656
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,119
two different plants two different

1657
01:04:28,739 --> 01:04:33,118
pollen donors

1658
01:04:30,119 --> 01:04:34,559
I think that might be a very well new

1659
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:37,858
possibility right

1660
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:40,920
yeah I mean it makes makes sense to me

1661
01:04:37,858 --> 01:04:43,980
you know so I felt that like I said that

1662
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:48,059
the jeans was a lot like super silver

1663
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:50,400
haze and the uh the princess I mean is

1664
01:04:48,059 --> 01:04:53,460
just totally totally different

1665
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:55,318
yeah yeah hugely hugely

1666
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:57,780
you got me thinking now that's

1667
01:04:55,318 --> 01:05:01,019
interesting

1668
01:04:57,780 --> 01:05:02,640
yeah man while we're on the topic I mean

1669
01:05:01,019 --> 01:05:04,259
the last the last episode we recorded

1670
01:05:02,639 --> 01:05:06,480
together was a number of years ago and I

1671
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:08,220
think at the time it was still pretty

1672
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:10,798
fresh and raw so we didn't really delve

1673
01:05:08,219 --> 01:05:13,019
into it but a lot of people have been

1674
01:05:10,798 --> 01:05:14,880
wondering for the longest time that the

1675
01:05:13,019 --> 01:05:16,920
circumstances in which you departed

1676
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:18,960
Brothers Grimm and a lot of rumors

1677
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:21,480
floating around about sort of you know

1678
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:23,639
money being owed and things like that

1679
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:26,219
would you be willing to set the record

1680
01:05:23,639 --> 01:05:27,779
straight on why you decided to part ways

1681
01:05:26,219 --> 01:05:32,039
with Brothers Grimm and maybe some of

1682
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:32,940
the circumstances yeah yeah for sure

1683
01:05:32,039 --> 01:05:34,500
um

1684
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:37,079
so

1685
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:40,920
the guy wasn't

1686
01:05:37,079 --> 01:05:43,260
who I thought he was and and that that

1687
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:44,460
[ __ ] happens you know if you talk to

1688
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:46,200
somebody on the Internet or whatever

1689
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:48,358
that's one thing but

1690
01:05:46,199 --> 01:05:50,399
being around somebody seeing them in

1691
01:05:48,358 --> 01:05:52,019
their everyday life and working with

1692
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,639
them and seeing how they interact with

1693
01:05:52,019 --> 01:05:54,780
people

1694
01:05:53,639 --> 01:05:58,139
um

1695
01:05:54,780 --> 01:06:00,839
just I guess to me uh be as nice as I

1696
01:05:58,139 --> 01:06:03,960
can about it like I didn't Jive at all

1697
01:06:00,838 --> 01:06:09,239
with the guy and um just some really

1698
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:09,240
really really bad practices

1699
01:06:09,358 --> 01:06:11,279
um

1700
01:06:09,699 --> 01:06:13,019
[Music]

1701
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:15,540
ethics

1702
01:06:13,019 --> 01:06:17,940
um how I treated people

1703
01:06:15,539 --> 01:06:20,818
um and it just turned into like a mess

1704
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:22,619
after mess after mess

1705
01:06:20,818 --> 01:06:25,440
um problem after problem and we're just

1706
01:06:22,619 --> 01:06:27,539
talking to dealing with people here

1707
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:28,740
um and it just got to that point where

1708
01:06:27,539 --> 01:06:33,660
it's just

1709
01:06:28,739 --> 01:06:36,179
yeah so frustrating so so frustrating

1710
01:06:33,659 --> 01:06:38,338
um and then when it came to the work and

1711
01:06:36,179 --> 01:06:39,358
everything else

1712
01:06:38,338 --> 01:06:42,119
um

1713
01:06:39,358 --> 01:06:44,519

1714
01:06:42,119 --> 01:06:46,798
just things that would really really

1715

really really piss me off

1716
01:06:46,798 --> 01:06:52,739

1718
01:06:52,739 --> 01:06:58,618

1785
01:09:17,219 --> 01:09:20,640
messages saying like you're blowing them

1786
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:21,900
off being rude to them and you couldn't

1787
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:24,838
be bothered because you're flirting with

1788
01:09:21,899 --> 01:09:26,818
some girl who's next to you and um

1789

furthermore you couldn't be bothered to

1790
01:09:26,819 --> 01:09:32,279
drop the seeds off at the hotel so he

1791
01:09:29,579 --> 01:09:34,679

1813
01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:24,300
going to be use that as a multiplier for

1814
01:10:22,140 --> 01:10:27,360

1818
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:36,900

1819
01:10:33,899 --> 01:10:38,939

execution and then ask for everything at

1826
01:10:52,079 --> 01:10:56,100

1827
01:10:53,219 --> 01:10:57,840
money man so you know we'll we'll split

this down into quarters you know over

1829
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:02,520
over a year

1830
01:10:59,719 --> 01:11:04,920
so I'm like it makes it easy for you two

1831
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:07,140
to continue doing what you're doing uh

1832

1837
01:11:18,179 --> 01:11:24,060

1838
01:11:19,859 --> 01:11:26,579
dude the last post we had on media

1839
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:28,320

1840
01:11:26,579 --> 01:11:30,719
months and it was middle of the evening

1841
01:11:28,319 --> 01:11:33,840
on day two of the show

1842
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:35,460
how in the [ __ ] do you think that's

1843
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:38,579
that's promotion right

1844
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:41,340
and I go down like this list of like 13

1845
01:11:38,579 --> 01:11:43,019
or so things like this is what you're

1846
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:45,360
doing wrong do this instead do this

1847
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:47,219
instead do this instead blah blah

1848
01:11:45,359 --> 01:11:49,738
all right I'll do that I was like but

1849
01:11:47,219 --> 01:11:53,840
look in all jokes aside like you you

1850
01:11:49,738 --> 01:11:57,658

1851
01:11:53,840 --> 01:12:01,760

1852
01:11:57,658 --> 01:12:05,879
whatever but but he does okay we're cool

1853
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:07,920

1854
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:10,279
can't make money

1855
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:12,779
um I don't feel that I owe you anything

1856
01:12:10,279 --> 01:12:16,079
and I'm I'm just I'm not I'm not gonna

1863
01:12:30,779 --> 01:12:33,960
people that you suck as a [ __ ] race

1864
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:35,640

1865
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:38,640
not be like Oh I'm not paying you for it

1866
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:40,800
because I can't win no man like you got

1867
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:43,020
it you got to pay like whatever failures

1868
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:45,360
are happening that's on you right now

1869
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:47,460
you're not doing any new work you're not

1870
01:12:45,359 --> 01:12:49,079
promoting it anytime you do talk to

1871
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:51,840
people they're they're incredibly

1872
01:12:49,079 --> 01:12:54,059
offended and you're not going good for a

1873
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:56,579
lot a lot of other reasons which none of

1874
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:58,620
which have anything to do with me so

1875
01:12:56,579 --> 01:13:02,340
he's just like yeah yeah not not gonna

1876
01:12:58,619 --> 01:13:04,619
do that so I was like okay so now I'm

1877
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:08,640
like well I need to need to figure some

1878
01:13:04,619 --> 01:13:10,439
figure some things out so basically

1879
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:13,920
um that's where that's where it ended

1880
01:13:10,439 --> 01:13:17,039
off was uh right there and uh just

1881
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:17,760
trying to you know figure it out

1882
01:13:17,039 --> 01:13:21,719
um

1883
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:24,840
you know I'm not big on courts and and

1884
01:13:21,719 --> 01:13:26,399
going going that route but uh if you get

1885
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:28,500
an alternative route you're gonna find

1886
01:13:26,399 --> 01:13:31,198
yourself in court anyway for something

1887
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:33,238
altogether different so

1888
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:34,979
um you know so I don't know

1889
01:13:33,238 --> 01:13:37,019
um you know maybe try to talk to the

1890
01:13:34,979 --> 01:13:39,238
dude again now that I'm now that I'm

1891
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:41,159
home and then and I have to figure it

1892
01:13:39,238 --> 01:13:43,859
out from there because I you know I

1893
01:13:41,158 --> 01:13:45,719
really don't like going to uh any type

1894
01:13:43,859 --> 01:13:47,819
of court court system and stuff like

1895
01:13:45,719 --> 01:13:49,859
that you know I've just always been like

1896
01:13:47,819 --> 01:13:51,119
you know you should just be a man of

1897
01:13:49,859 --> 01:13:55,019
your word and honor honor your

1898
01:13:51,119 --> 01:13:56,460
agreements and you know do it like that

1899
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:58,800
um but then at the same time I'm looking

1900
01:13:56,460 --> 01:14:00,539
I'm like wow you're buying an awful lot

1901
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:04,739
of lavish [ __ ] for a guy that doesn't

1902
01:14:00,539 --> 01:14:06,658
doesn't make any money so all right so I

1903
01:14:04,738 --> 01:14:09,238
didn't have much uh much sympathy in

1904
01:14:06,658 --> 01:14:10,979
that regard so he said hopefully I'll

1905
01:14:09,238 --> 01:14:12,959
talk to him again

1906
01:14:10,979 --> 01:14:14,819
um maybe shit's change or maybe he has a

1907
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:17,939
different outlook on on things I don't

1908
01:14:14,819 --> 01:14:20,219
know we'll just have to have to see

1909
01:14:17,939 --> 01:14:22,738
that provides a lot of clarity to the

1910
01:14:20,219 --> 01:14:24,539
situation and like he's still selling

1911
01:14:22,738 --> 01:14:26,639
[ __ ] that I made like back then like

1912
01:14:24,539 --> 01:14:28,679

1915
01:14:30,119 --> 01:14:33,658
and it's just like old seed stock that I

1916
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:35,880

1917
01:14:33,658 --> 01:14:39,779

don't know who and what's going on

1933

that and yeah nobody's a mind reader so

1941
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:33,360
so it's like you know one of the things

1942
01:15:30,779 --> 01:15:35,399
is like you air that out you know all

1943
01:15:33,359 --> 01:15:37,079
over the place or do you just you know

1944
01:15:35,399 --> 01:15:39,179
just work through it and you know call

1945
01:15:37,079 --> 01:15:41,158
it call it a day because I don't want to

1946
01:15:39,179 --> 01:15:43,260
like you know put a bunch of negative

1947
01:15:41,158 --> 01:15:44,759
negative [ __ ] on there you know and

1948
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:48,179
especially if it's something I just need

1949
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:49,800
to hash out with a person individually

1950
01:15:48,179 --> 01:15:52,140
um you know I'm gonna I'm gonna do that

1951
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:53,880
too you know that's just the way the way

1952
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:56,520
I was brought up

1953
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:57,900
um so yeah you know but I guess you know

1954
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:59,760
like I said I'm glad you're glad you

1955
01:15:57,899 --> 01:16:01,738
asked that because

1956
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:04,679
um after all these years and everything

1957
01:16:01,738 --> 01:16:06,238
uh yeah bigger [ __ ] you know you

1958
01:16:04,679 --> 01:16:08,420
might as might as well let people know

1959
01:16:06,238 --> 01:16:12,779
know what's up with the dude

1960
01:16:08,420 --> 01:16:14,940
yeah totally well I mean maybe maybe the

1961
01:16:12,779 --> 01:16:17,099
the silver lining of this is that we did

1962
01:16:14,939 --> 01:16:19,079
have a lot of people ask will we ever

1963
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:21,420
see cap G again I think it was one of

1964
01:16:19,079 --> 01:16:23,279
the most hottest strains when it hit the

1965
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:26,340
the scene that year

1966
01:16:23,279 --> 01:16:28,859
that was only 40. yeah it was only 40 uh

1967
01:16:26,340 --> 01:16:30,960
40 packs of it and you remember at the

1968
01:16:28,859 --> 01:16:32,399
at the show man like because it was gone

1969
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:36,359
you know a lot of it was even like

1970
01:16:32,399 --> 01:16:39,599
spoken for like right off the bat so

1971
01:16:36,359 --> 01:16:41,399
um with uh with that going on it was

1972
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:43,860
weird because later it was like you know

1973
01:16:41,399 --> 01:16:46,399
I saw like you know it seemed like 200

1974
01:16:43,859 --> 01:16:50,839
uh 200 packs of it in circulation like

1975
01:16:46,399 --> 01:16:54,658
that's uh that's a coincidence

1976
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:56,279
very peculiar so um but the thing was

1977
01:16:54,658 --> 01:16:58,198
with that

1978
01:16:56,279 --> 01:17:00,359
um it was it was just a beginning step

1979
01:16:58,198 --> 01:17:03,479
you know moving forward to making that

1980
01:17:00,359 --> 01:17:07,079
Dominion so no I don't I don't feel well

1981
01:17:03,479 --> 01:17:10,259
you know back it all the way up

1982
01:17:07,079 --> 01:17:11,698
um you know I kind of hit my goal you

1983
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:14,460
know where I wanted to be

1984
01:17:11,698 --> 01:17:16,019
yeah certainly I mean as a bit of a

1985
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:18,239
follow-up and it might be hard for you

1986
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:21,060
to pick just one but I was curious to

1987
01:17:18,238 --> 01:17:23,399
know what do you think is the most under

1988
01:17:21,060 --> 01:17:25,020
recognized Dominion strain in terms of

1989
01:17:23,399 --> 01:17:27,119
quality where like you know maybe the

1990
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:28,080
sales don't reflect it but it's truly a

1991
01:17:27,119 --> 01:17:30,658
killer

1992
01:17:28,079 --> 01:17:32,519
and they were man they were quite a

1993
01:17:30,658 --> 01:17:34,920
there were quite a few

1994
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:37,080
um the granny Scott was one the Virginia

1995
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:39,480
Beach Afghani

1996
01:17:37,079 --> 01:17:41,519
um that one was [ __ ] killer but

1997
01:17:39,479 --> 01:17:42,779
nobody knew it Virginia Beach candy was

1998
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:45,179
it's like

1999
01:17:42,779 --> 01:17:47,279
people only know what they want based

2000
01:17:45,179 --> 01:17:49,020
off the kind of what they like and that

2001
01:17:47,279 --> 01:17:51,179
wasn't like some big circulated thing

2002
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:52,860
like people in Virginia would beat it up

2003
01:17:51,179 --> 01:17:53,760
because everybody knows what the [ __ ]

2004
01:17:52,859 --> 01:17:56,339
that is

2005
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:58,260
by everybody else say yeah

2006
01:17:56,340 --> 01:18:00,480
I don't know what that is you know they

2007
01:17:58,260 --> 01:18:02,460
just keep it keep it moving like oh what

2008
01:18:00,479 --> 01:18:04,678
kind of dog yeah I like I know I've

2009
01:18:02,460 --> 01:18:07,560
heard that one before so they'll go go

2010
01:18:04,679 --> 01:18:10,219
that way that was probably the most the

2011
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:10,219
most slept on

2012
01:18:10,979 --> 01:18:15,238
yeah no that's that's a great answer I

2013
01:18:13,319 --> 01:18:16,738
remember having smelt that and it was it

2014
01:18:15,238 --> 01:18:18,599
was almost equally as impressive as the

2015
01:18:16,738 --> 01:18:22,198
cap G but I think many people smell that

2016
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:24,780
cap GM were just sold yeah man that was

2017
01:18:22,198 --> 01:18:26,698
like nasty garlicky rubber skunk you

2018
01:18:24,779 --> 01:18:29,880
font to it man that was that was some

2019
01:18:26,698 --> 01:18:31,500
good that was some good [ __ ] man and you

2020
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:33,480
know that was something that that was

2021
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:36,179
lacking around everybody was going like

2022
01:18:33,479 --> 01:18:38,819
super fruity [ __ ] and you know going

2023
01:18:36,179 --> 01:18:40,079
just for like straight straight down you

2024
01:18:38,819 --> 01:18:41,698
know

2025
01:18:40,079 --> 01:18:44,100
um at the time

2026
01:18:41,698 --> 01:18:47,039
and it was you know something different

2027
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:49,920
you know and something that hadn't been

2028
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:52,859
hadn't been in plenty I guess you know

2029
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:55,800
for a long time so it's cool to be like

2030
01:18:52,859 --> 01:18:58,139
yeah you know that those those types of

2031
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:59,940
things would still you know strike a

2032
01:18:58,140 --> 01:19:02,159
strike a thing with people's nose and be

2033
01:18:59,939 --> 01:19:05,279
like yeah that's that's something I like

2034
01:19:02,158 --> 01:19:08,039
that you know so along with all the all

2035
01:19:05,279 --> 01:19:11,099
the work coming after that and you know

2036
01:19:08,039 --> 01:19:12,960
uh projects I did along with it it was

2037
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:14,520
cool to see like yeah you know it's not

2038
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:16,140
just me or a group of friends that are

2039
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:18,960
indignant like a lot of people are

2040
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:20,640
digging and after I've come back I've

2041
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:22,260

2042
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:23,340
bought all that stuff up but they didn't

2043
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:25,260
pop it

2044
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:27,600
and I guess while I was gone a lot of

2045
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:30,020
people were popping packs and the DM box

2046

feedback you know I was getting some

2058
01:19:54,658 --> 01:19:59,879
from people you know immediately jumping

2059
01:19:57,179 --> 01:20:01,980
into the work but there was so much more

2060
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:03,300
that those people were sitting on it now

2061

2071
01:20:25,859 --> 01:20:30,059
Yeah a hundred percent and you just

2072
01:20:28,198 --> 01:20:31,678
named a few strands I wanted to ask you

2073
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:33,120
about but before we get there I just

2074
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:35,699
wanted to quickly loop back because you

2075
01:20:33,119 --> 01:20:37,679
mentioned the VA Afghani we actually had

2076
01:20:35,698 --> 01:20:39,419
a few people ask about that and the sort

2077
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:41,158
of Common Thread was do you have any

2078
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:42,239
information on the backstory around it

2079
01:20:41,158 --> 01:20:46,079
at all

2080
01:20:42,238 --> 01:20:50,039
see like that's always been like the

2081
01:20:46,079 --> 01:20:52,500
like a mystery mystery plant you know

2082
01:20:50,039 --> 01:20:54,000
um I'm gonna do a live on it at some

2083
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:56,039
point with a few different people from

2084
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:58,079
that time now they can they can talk

2085
01:20:56,039 --> 01:21:00,479
freely on it

2086
01:20:58,079 --> 01:21:02,100
um but man there's so many there's so

2087
01:21:00,479 --> 01:21:04,738
many stories

2088
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:07,800
um you know as with any anything

2089
01:21:04,738 --> 01:21:09,059
anything with any Lord man you got got a

2090
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:10,440
whole lot of [ __ ]

2091
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:14,219
um I always felt it's a whole lot

2092
01:21:10,439 --> 01:21:17,579
simpler than you know a Vietnam vet and

2093
01:21:14,219 --> 01:21:20,460
uh I can't say uh what's the new word a

2094
01:21:17,579 --> 01:21:22,859
little person uh like there's been some

2095
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:25,020
[ __ ] crazy crazy stories I heard but

2096
01:21:22,859 --> 01:21:28,859
I think at the end of the day it's just

2097
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:31,500
some old seed bank uh Afghani Stockton

2098
01:21:28,859 --> 01:21:33,119
to really really killer ones and it's

2099
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:34,500
still the test of time it's like

2100
01:21:33,119 --> 01:21:36,300
anything else that's real good if it's

2101
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:38,520
been around that long it's the reason

2102
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:40,560
why you know people aren't going to risk

2103
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:44,000
uh you know getting hemmed up and going

2104
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:46,500
to prison over some every some swag

2105
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:48,658
yeah certainly I mean but it stood the

2106
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:51,179
test of time which I think is sort of a

2107
01:21:48,658 --> 01:21:55,139
testament to its its quality

2108
01:21:51,179 --> 01:21:56,760
yeah strong [ __ ] man that's potent

2109
01:21:55,140 --> 01:21:58,199
definitely I definitely remember the

2110
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:59,699
first time I tried it with you and it

2111
01:21:58,198 --> 01:22:01,799
was everything you said you know very

2112
01:21:59,698 --> 01:22:03,599
sort of paranoia and juicing for an

2113
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:06,239
Afghani which was cool

2114
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:10,039
yeah man and then you just I just want

2115
01:22:06,238 --> 01:22:10,039
to shut you just want to sit down

2116
01:22:10,079 --> 01:22:16,079
um we had a someone who hails from VA as

2117
01:22:13,738 --> 01:22:18,539
well asked the question did you ever try

2118
01:22:16,079 --> 01:22:20,300
the Skyler skunk from Nelson Virginia

2119
01:22:18,539 --> 01:22:23,880
back in the day

2120
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:26,640
absolutely absolutely and that's the

2121
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:28,920
thing like I mentioned that on a couple

2122
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:31,860
shows I mentioned it once like before I

2123
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:33,600
even run away and I kind of had a slip

2124
01:22:31,859 --> 01:22:35,698
you're like what's that I was like

2125
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:37,219
nothing don't worry there's nothing to

2126
01:22:35,698 --> 01:22:42,178
see here

2127
01:22:37,219 --> 01:22:44,880
so yes yes yes I have and um had a had a

2128
01:22:42,179 --> 01:22:46,980
buddy that used to live out that way and

2129
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:48,779
you know he he knew the old dude with it

2130
01:22:46,979 --> 01:22:52,019
you know they got they got the point of

2131
01:22:48,779 --> 01:22:54,119
it and all that [ __ ] and um [ __ ]

2132
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:56,239
[ __ ] killer dude

2133
01:22:54,119 --> 01:23:00,059
but more on that later

2134
01:22:56,238 --> 01:23:01,979
okay I mean is it is it like a standard

2135
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:05,840
skunk but better or is it very is it

2136
01:23:01,979 --> 01:23:05,839
sort of different to a normal skunk

2137
01:23:06,179 --> 01:23:11,460
it's definitely more more on the Indica

2138
01:23:08,460 --> 01:23:12,179
side of things

2139
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:15,239
um

2140
01:23:12,179 --> 01:23:16,679
aside from the the strong smells and all

2141
01:23:15,238 --> 01:23:19,859
that [ __ ]

2142
01:23:16,679 --> 01:23:23,158
um very very strong narcotic uh doesn't

2143
01:23:19,859 --> 01:23:24,299
grow huge stretchy type type plants you

2144
01:23:23,158 --> 01:23:27,599
know so

2145
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:29,760
um it's definitely definitely more in

2146
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:32,940
that blend of Leaning a little more on

2147
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:36,960
the uh on the Indica side of stuff and

2148
01:23:32,939 --> 01:23:39,658
uh just absolutely [ __ ] stanky man I

2149
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:43,020
was a stinker you know it's got that

2150
01:23:39,658 --> 01:23:48,479
lingering effect too on the mouth like a

2151
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:50,219
iconic Coffee Bean hashy uh slight skunk

2152
01:23:48,479 --> 01:23:51,718
flavor

2153
01:23:50,219 --> 01:23:53,579
um to it and kind of like it's almost

2154
01:23:51,719 --> 01:23:56,158
like that Sour Diesel effect a little

2155
01:23:53,579 --> 01:23:59,279
bit so it's definitely definitely a

2156
01:23:56,158 --> 01:24:02,519
[ __ ] killer it was great outside too

2157
01:23:59,279 --> 01:24:04,920
that's that's awesome to hear I mean if

2158
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:07,380
we loop back to your answer before you

2159
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:08,579
mention the the purple Dahlia among

2160
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:10,980
other things and we had a few questions

2161
01:24:08,579 --> 01:24:12,840
about it I guess people must be sitting

2162
01:24:10,979 --> 01:24:14,218
on packs and they're sort of curious you

2163
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:16,920
know what sort of things can they expect

2164
01:24:14,219 --> 01:24:19,679
out of it and what's your thoughts on

2165
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:22,020
the purple Dahlia overall

2166
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:24,719
um really good it's just like I think

2167
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:26,100
like oh like what put people off

2168
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:28,319
is

2169
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:30,239
you know I put a warning on the pack if

2170
01:24:28,319 --> 01:24:32,279
something's like subject to her due to

2171
01:24:30,238 --> 01:24:33,779
something I'm gonna I'm gonna put that

2172
01:24:32,279 --> 01:24:35,939
on there so that way you know somebody

2173
01:24:33,779 --> 01:24:37,738
can avoid it so you got a lot of people

2174
01:24:35,939 --> 01:24:40,500
oh wait I heard him like well yeah a lot

2175
01:24:37,738 --> 01:24:43,019
of [ __ ] well if you you know if you do

2176
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:44,939
something [ __ ] up and this one has a

2177
01:24:43,020 --> 01:24:47,940
little Bugaboo about this so just don't

2178
01:24:44,939 --> 01:24:50,939
do that and you should uh you should be

2179
01:24:47,939 --> 01:24:54,119
cool you know and out of that honest

2180
01:24:50,939 --> 01:24:56,219
deal I'd be like no no so it's like cool

2181
01:24:54,119 --> 01:24:58,619
like you can go buy this other [ __ ] like

2182
01:24:56,219 --> 01:24:59,819
you know it's whatever I tell you that's

2183
01:24:58,619 --> 01:25:01,800
going to hurt them out but they're not

2184
01:24:59,819 --> 01:25:04,380
going to tell you so they get you get

2185
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:07,140
your money or whatever but it's it's

2186
01:25:04,380 --> 01:25:08,699
it's whatever man but out of the out of

2187
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:09,420
the phenotypes

2188
01:25:08,698 --> 01:25:12,419
um

2189
01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:14,219
they were just these these Blends man

2190
01:25:12,420 --> 01:25:16,319
um and and it's not like something it's

2191
01:25:14,219 --> 01:25:19,020
like oh you gotta pop a bunch of packs

2192
01:25:16,319 --> 01:25:21,779
for it is multiples and and every pack

2193
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:24,659
out of the females that were incredibly

2194
01:25:21,779 --> 01:25:27,539
incredibly dark purple on this black

2195
01:25:24,658 --> 01:25:30,238
Screaming Eagle style frost on it that

2196
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:32,399
just tasted like [ __ ] great candies

2197
01:25:30,238 --> 01:25:34,019
man and Boston tastes awesome and they

2198
01:25:32,399 --> 01:25:37,859
affect on it

2199
01:25:34,020 --> 01:25:39,900
s [ __ ] design man I really am really

2200
01:25:37,859 --> 01:25:42,359
like that one that was another like that

2201
01:25:39,899 --> 01:25:44,519
another ever ever looked one or maybe

2202
01:25:42,359 --> 01:25:46,738
looked at and just you know

2203
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:48,480
just just starting to decide instead

2204
01:25:46,738 --> 01:25:49,319
because you know I had worries or

2205
01:25:48,479 --> 01:25:51,779
whatever

2206
01:25:49,319 --> 01:25:53,939
yeah I mean it's interesting because I

2207
01:25:51,779 --> 01:25:56,460
remember when I smelled uh the jar of it

2208
01:25:53,939 --> 01:25:58,439
at the cup a few years back I think that

2209
01:25:56,460 --> 01:25:59,880
was one of the ones I was most impressed

2210
01:25:58,439 --> 01:26:01,559
by I'm having trouble remembering if it

2211
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:03,840
was that or the sangria punch but I

2212
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:06,000
think it was the purple Dahlia yeah the

2213
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:09,539
purple dye was definitely very extremely

2214
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:12,779
dark purple and had like that eagle type

2215
01:26:09,539 --> 01:26:15,658
block but purple if that that made any

2216
01:26:12,779 --> 01:26:19,500
sense at all purple grape bee also had

2217
01:26:15,658 --> 01:26:21,839
that that citrusy incensey type type

2218
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:24,539
Blended in with the

2219
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:27,300
um the sangria very very frosty stuff

2220
01:26:24,539 --> 01:26:30,300
but I mean yeah yeah it's not spot on

2221
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:32,400
there's a sangria punch like spot on and

2222
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:35,880
everybody smelled it was like holy [ __ ]

2223
01:26:32,399 --> 01:26:38,279
that's angry a punch it's like yup

2224
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:41,039
that's why we get the name

2225
01:26:38,279 --> 01:26:43,559
you know

2226
01:26:41,039 --> 01:26:47,399
yeah okay there you go

2227
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:50,280
well I mean if we move on sadly since

2228
01:26:47,399 --> 01:26:51,779
you sort of been away on Hiatus uh

2229
01:26:50,279 --> 01:26:53,579
there's sort of been a bit of a change

2230
01:26:51,779 --> 01:26:55,859
in the Cannabis landscape and

2231
01:26:53,579 --> 01:26:58,619
specifically we've we've sadly had to

2232
01:26:55,859 --> 01:27:00,420
Bid Farewell to two friends of both the

2233
01:26:58,619 --> 01:27:04,260
industry but yourself as well you know

2234
01:27:00,420 --> 01:27:06,960
notably Monty sub cool and and also bog

2235
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:09,239
yeah and Josie Wales too

2236
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:10,920
yeah Jersey well that also happened and

2237
01:27:09,238 --> 01:27:13,678
I guess my sort of question is how does

2238
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:15,600
it feel to come back and to see that the

2239
01:27:13,679 --> 01:27:17,399
Cannabis landscape has changed a little

2240
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:19,739
bit or do you feel like it actually

2241
01:27:17,399 --> 01:27:20,819
hasn't that much

2242
01:27:19,738 --> 01:27:23,698
um

2243
01:27:20,819 --> 01:27:24,960
and it's weird because like for me it's

2244
01:27:23,698 --> 01:27:26,939
kind of like the grow room thing if

2245
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:28,800
you're in there every day you don't see

2246
01:27:26,939 --> 01:27:30,479
a whole lot of change but if you go in

2247
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:32,400
once a week or something like that you

2248
01:27:30,479 --> 01:27:35,218
see a lot of Dramatics

2249
01:27:32,399 --> 01:27:37,619
so from being like totally totally away

2250
01:27:35,219 --> 01:27:41,520
from it and coming back my man

2251
01:27:37,619 --> 01:27:44,639
it seems about the same like honestly

2252
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:46,620
but like that's as far as like maybe

2253
01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:49,079
Instagram goes I haven't been to a show

2254
01:27:46,619 --> 01:27:51,719
or anything like that now from what I've

2255
01:27:49,079 --> 01:27:53,460
seen going on yeah I mean the shows are

2256
01:27:51,719 --> 01:27:55,460
definitely

2257
01:27:53,460 --> 01:27:55,460
um

2258
01:27:55,679 --> 01:28:01,560
going downhill I guess but I already saw

2259
01:27:58,859 --> 01:28:03,420
that coming many many years ago that

2260
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:04,980
last one that was at you were at or

2261
01:28:03,420 --> 01:28:06,658
whatever you remember when they told me

2262
01:28:04,979 --> 01:28:08,819
they're like yeah you're not on that

2263
01:28:06,658 --> 01:28:10,138
panel anymore you know that you're like

2264
01:28:08,819 --> 01:28:13,090
yeah they just want me to interview

2265
01:28:10,139 --> 01:28:15,239
somebody else man

2266
01:28:13,090 --> 01:28:17,219
[Music]

2267
01:28:15,238 --> 01:28:19,198
um you know I saw it you know even

2268
01:28:17,219 --> 01:28:21,960
coming before that point but then once

2269
01:28:19,198 --> 01:28:24,658
that that show happens yeah it's bad so

2270
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:27,719
yeah I hate to see it in a few years

2271
01:28:24,658 --> 01:28:29,339
now I have kind of vicariously you know

2272
01:28:27,719 --> 01:28:31,679
the others and they're showing their

2273
01:28:29,340 --> 01:28:33,900
videos and [ __ ] so

2274
01:28:31,679 --> 01:28:36,300
um yeah this is you know other than that

2275
01:28:33,899 --> 01:28:38,698
I mean yeah it's basically the same

2276
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:41,279
uh as far as like you have people

2277
01:28:38,698 --> 01:28:43,619
passing away you know how to project at

2278
01:28:41,279 --> 01:28:45,779
that show uh because me and Bob we ended

2279
01:28:43,619 --> 01:28:49,019
up uh we shared a booth space or

2280
01:28:45,779 --> 01:28:50,880
whatever and I thought it was like real

2281
01:28:49,020 --> 01:28:53,100
[ __ ] up it was like people were lined

2282
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:56,279
up and they even know who he was so I'm

2283
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:57,840
like no like you know you see this man

2284
01:28:56,279 --> 01:29:00,059
you need you need to get stuff around

2285
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:02,760
this is like uh like I grew this [ __ ]

2286
01:29:00,060 --> 01:29:05,100
like if I literally had space and time I

2287
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:07,980
would continue growing this [ __ ]

2288
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:09,719
um like you you really you really need

2289
01:29:07,979 --> 01:29:12,479
to you know get this guy so I ended up

2290
01:29:09,719 --> 01:29:15,119
like kind of bending been in for him as

2291
01:29:12,479 --> 01:29:17,279
well and just overall it's really really

2292
01:29:15,119 --> 01:29:19,619
good dude too

2293
01:29:17,279 --> 01:29:21,599
um so I was like look man like we need

2294
01:29:19,619 --> 01:29:23,099
to we need to do something together you

2295
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:26,039
know so

2296
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:27,420
um we came up with a good solid solid

2297
01:29:26,039 --> 01:29:28,920
plan or like two things that would

2298
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:31,199
really drive together that would be

2299
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:33,420
knock your socks off so I'm like yeah

2300
01:29:31,198 --> 01:29:36,059
cool we'll get to it you know

2301
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:37,560
and um you know as time goes by it's

2302
01:29:36,060 --> 01:29:39,840
like all right well it's about that time

2303
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:42,239
buddy that [ __ ] all went South for me

2304
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:45,239
and then I went away finally I died and

2305
01:29:42,238 --> 01:29:47,339
I'm like oh [ __ ] you know I didn't get a

2306
01:29:45,238 --> 01:29:49,198
chance to say goodbye and that's like

2307
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:50,100
probably one of the worst things about

2308
01:29:49,198 --> 01:29:52,198
one

2309
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:54,480
friends or people you know or care about

2310
01:29:52,198 --> 01:29:56,099
or think Holly when they die

2311
01:29:54,479 --> 01:29:58,738
um you know you don't get that chance to

2312
01:29:56,100 --> 01:30:01,679
say goodbye or you know anything else

2313
01:29:58,738 --> 01:30:03,359
that you wanted to stay home so

2314
01:30:01,679 --> 01:30:06,179
um and the same thing goes for you know

2315
01:30:03,359 --> 01:30:07,979
Josie and you know money and everything

2316
01:30:06,179 --> 01:30:08,579
it's like

2317
01:30:07,979 --> 01:30:10,559
um

2318
01:30:08,579 --> 01:30:14,579
you know you wish you maybe you'd said

2319
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:16,620
more uh with the time you had so just

2320
01:30:14,579 --> 01:30:18,960
for everybody you know it's her memory

2321
01:30:16,619 --> 01:30:22,619
and I was like it can happen at any time

2322
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:25,439
so uh you know um

2323
01:30:22,619 --> 01:30:27,899
tomorrow's not promised right so yeah

2324
01:30:25,439 --> 01:30:30,479
definitely definitely but cool thing is

2325
01:30:27,899 --> 01:30:32,698
uh his son his son's keeping keeping

2326
01:30:30,479 --> 01:30:34,919
things kind of going and uh I'm gonna

2327
01:30:32,698 --> 01:30:38,279
get with him and you know we're still

2328
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:40,859
still gonna make that make that happen

2329
01:30:38,279 --> 01:30:42,719
yeah yeah that would be awesome to still

2330
01:30:40,859 --> 01:30:45,000
see something happen because yeah Bogue

2331
01:30:42,719 --> 01:30:48,000
Jr and Pat are still still around and

2332
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:50,639
need to be taken care of yeah man yeah

2333
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:53,639
exactly and it can be a good honor honor

2334
01:30:50,639 --> 01:30:56,279
to honor to the guy you know

2335
01:30:53,639 --> 01:30:58,020
um yeah certainly well I probably should

2336
01:30:56,279 --> 01:31:00,059
have asked this a bit earlier but I was

2337
01:30:58,020 --> 01:31:02,880
curious to know do you have any advice

2338
01:31:00,060 --> 01:31:05,280
for people who maybe not in your exact

2339
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:07,199
circumstance but just sort of you know

2340
01:31:05,279 --> 01:31:09,420
trying to get everything back together

2341
01:31:07,198 --> 01:31:11,158
dust themselves off get back on the

2342
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:13,560
horse so to speak have you got any

2343
01:31:11,158 --> 01:31:15,839
advice in that respect

2344
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:16,560
yeah absolutely man

2345
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:20,400
um

2346
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:23,340
don't be hard-headed and or I mean do be

2347
01:31:20,399 --> 01:31:26,119
hard-headed I should say uh refuse to

2348
01:31:23,340 --> 01:31:29,639
stop refuse to lose refuse to give up

2349
01:31:26,119 --> 01:31:31,079
and as your mistakes come across as long

2350
01:31:29,639 --> 01:31:34,440
as you're learning from them you're

2351
01:31:31,079 --> 01:31:37,260
becoming stronger you're becoming better

2352
01:31:34,439 --> 01:31:38,879
um don't don't give up uh just whatever

2353
01:31:37,260 --> 01:31:41,280
is faulting you

2354
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:43,500
along your way you just gotta sit back

2355
01:31:41,279 --> 01:31:45,479
and look at it outside looking at it and

2356
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:47,340
really in a lot of things and then go

2357
01:31:45,479 --> 01:31:49,619
from there so that way when you when you

2358
01:31:47,340 --> 01:31:52,199
do succeed it'd be the best thing ever

2359
01:31:49,619 --> 01:31:54,179
and you'd really refine yourself

2360
01:31:52,198 --> 01:31:58,678
you know and you've grown as a as a

2361
01:31:54,179 --> 01:32:00,840
human being as well so just anything you

2362
01:31:58,679 --> 01:32:03,619
want to start or do you know just go all

2363
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:07,980
out man really you know just go all out

2364
01:32:03,619 --> 01:32:09,840
and don't focus on money and fame and

2365
01:32:07,979 --> 01:32:12,539
things like that those are the the worst

2366
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:14,340
things that you know you're getting into

2367
01:32:12,539 --> 01:32:17,340
something for the wrong reasons if

2368
01:32:14,340 --> 01:32:19,739
that's the goal I've seen people do that

2369
01:32:17,340 --> 01:32:21,659
as well and uh it doesn't it doesn't

2370
01:32:19,738 --> 01:32:24,238
work out well

2371
01:32:21,658 --> 01:32:26,399
um if that's your thing like go to

2372
01:32:24,238 --> 01:32:28,919
Hollywood maybe try to be an actor or

2373
01:32:26,399 --> 01:32:30,779
something like that but

2374
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:32,219
um just whatever it is that you're going

2375
01:32:30,779 --> 01:32:33,359
after

2376
01:32:32,219 --> 01:32:35,880
um if it's something you're passionate

2377
01:32:33,359 --> 01:32:36,960
about something you really love in a

2378
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:40,500
really

2379
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:42,600
really delve into that man and

2380
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:46,319
um follow that love follow that passion

2381
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:47,699
and do it for those reasons and a lot of

2382
01:32:46,319 --> 01:32:49,019
the other things are gonna are gonna

2383
01:32:47,698 --> 01:32:53,819
follow behind

2384
01:32:49,020 --> 01:32:55,920
and um you know and follow your six P's

2385
01:32:53,819 --> 01:32:58,738
um come up with a plan plan your work

2386
01:32:55,920 --> 01:33:00,359
work your plan follow your six P's the

2387
01:32:58,738 --> 01:33:02,759
proper planning prevents just for

2388
01:33:00,359 --> 01:33:04,139
performance so if you if you stick to

2389
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:06,539
that

2390
01:33:04,139 --> 01:33:08,760
um and like I said be you know very very

2391
01:33:06,539 --> 01:33:10,319
adamant about not not giving up moving

2392
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:14,119
forward you're going to succeed you know

2393
01:33:10,319 --> 01:33:14,119
and I'm cool simple as that

2394
01:33:14,158 --> 01:33:20,339
some brilliant advice there

2395
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:22,260
I I know that in in your absence there

2396
01:33:20,340 --> 01:33:24,119
had been some rumors surrounding

2397
01:33:22,260 --> 01:33:25,860
Dominion Seed Co and I think

2398
01:33:24,119 --> 01:33:28,319
specifically some of the things that I

2399
01:33:25,859 --> 01:33:30,779
saw posted was that there was supposedly

2400
01:33:28,319 --> 01:33:32,460
some seeds that didn't end up with the

2401
01:33:30,779 --> 01:33:34,139
vendors they were meant to and others

2402
01:33:32,460 --> 01:33:37,560
say they were sort of stolen it's a bit

2403
01:33:34,139 --> 01:33:39,719
unclear and then other people had been

2404
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:41,520
involved I know that your wife had been

2405
01:33:39,719 --> 01:33:43,380
dragged into it at one point and I think

2406
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:45,659
skunk VA had been sort of dragged into

2407
01:33:43,380 --> 01:33:47,520
it would you just be able to clarify a

2408
01:33:45,658 --> 01:33:49,859
little bit around what happened because

2409
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:51,600
I think the the toughest part about what

2410
01:33:49,859 --> 01:33:53,759
happened to you was that you didn't have

2411
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:55,079
the opportunity to to discuss any of it

2412
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:57,480
yourself you know it's all sort of

2413
01:33:55,079 --> 01:33:59,639
second-hand knowledge so if you could

2414
01:33:57,479 --> 01:34:01,079
maybe clarify some of those things and

2415
01:33:59,639 --> 01:34:02,940
just help set the record straight that

2416
01:34:01,079 --> 01:34:05,939
would be phenomenal

2417
01:34:02,939 --> 01:34:07,738
oh for sure for sure for sure because

2418
01:34:05,939 --> 01:34:09,719
man it's like

2419
01:34:07,738 --> 01:34:12,178
you know there's nothing worse

2420
01:34:09,719 --> 01:34:16,380
than you know you when you can't even

2421
01:34:12,179 --> 01:34:17,100
speak up for yourself you know so

2422
01:34:16,380 --> 01:34:20,460
um

2423
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:22,139
essentially like what had happened was

2424
01:34:20,460 --> 01:34:24,420
um I had all this planned out in case

2425
01:34:22,139 --> 01:34:27,060
[ __ ] went South I didn't get a bomb or

2426
01:34:24,420 --> 01:34:28,500
whatever and everything was laid out you

2427
01:34:27,060 --> 01:34:30,480
know these are supposed to go this way

2428
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:33,179
another

2429
01:34:30,479 --> 01:34:35,039
um Monies to be done like this so

2430
01:34:33,179 --> 01:34:36,658
everybody's still you know making it

2431
01:34:35,039 --> 01:34:39,420
with everything the projects were

2432
01:34:36,658 --> 01:34:40,979
already ready to go uh the seeds were

2433
01:34:39,420 --> 01:34:43,319
ready

2434
01:34:40,979 --> 01:34:45,658
um everything should have been nice nice

2435
01:34:43,319 --> 01:34:48,000
and smooth and then uh you know I'm

2436
01:34:45,658 --> 01:34:50,039
losing contact with people not being

2437
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:51,779
able to get a hold of people and like

2438
01:34:50,039 --> 01:34:54,079
literally none of his planned is

2439
01:34:51,779 --> 01:34:57,059
happening whatsoever

2440
01:34:54,079 --> 01:34:59,519
so you know it led to me he's thinking

2441
01:34:57,060 --> 01:35:01,800
like huh like you know what what's going

2442
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:04,260

2443
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:06,779
problem you know like like I can fix it

2444
01:35:04,260 --> 01:35:07,640
you know I can figure [ __ ] out even from

2445
01:35:06,779 --> 01:35:09,000

um but like I said every not everybody

2448
01:35:11,219 --> 01:35:17,520

2449
01:35:14,579 --> 01:35:20,880

um just dude there's so many [ __ ]

2528
01:38:16,139 --> 01:38:20,279
people that were just like that is a

2529
01:38:18,179 --> 01:38:22,319
load of [ __ ] you know but a rumor is a

2530
01:38:20,279 --> 01:38:24,658
rumor and a rumor doesn't value it until

2531
01:38:22,319 --> 01:38:26,340
it's killed so

2532
01:38:24,658 --> 01:38:27,779
another thing is like yeah they're

2533
01:38:26,340 --> 01:38:28,619
claiming to be a stud breeder I'm like

2534
01:38:27,779 --> 01:38:31,019
all right

2535
01:38:28,619 --> 01:38:33,119
well like is anybody actually asking

2536
01:38:31,020 --> 01:38:35,639
them any any questions about breeding so

2537
01:38:33,119 --> 01:38:36,779
oh I bet you about you a dollar they

2538
01:38:35,639 --> 01:38:39,840
don't they're not going to have the

2539
01:38:36,779 --> 01:38:41,460
answer to it you know so because they

2540
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:44,279
they weren't they weren't ones doing the

2541
01:38:41,460 --> 01:38:47,100
work so I was like yeah so obviously

2542
01:38:44,279 --> 01:38:49,198
like this is this is not not good and

2543
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:52,739
like this is the source of you know

2544
01:38:49,198 --> 01:38:55,799
what's going on and like some people

2545
01:38:52,738 --> 01:38:57,658
um I won't even throw his name out there

2546
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:58,920
but even though I probably should but

2547
01:38:57,658 --> 01:39:01,319
I'm not

2548
01:38:58,920 --> 01:39:04,319
um like buys into a lot of us

2549
01:39:01,319 --> 01:39:05,519
like another one like any type of it

2550
01:39:04,319 --> 01:39:07,859
because like I needed to talk to him

2551
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:10,380
recently and he's like bought into this

2552
01:39:07,859 --> 01:39:12,599
[ __ ] he was like yeah you lied about uh

2553
01:39:10,380 --> 01:39:15,840
going to going to prison back in the day

2554
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:18,960
I was like what that's level the thing

2555
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:20,880
to lie about anyway but whatever so I

2556
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:23,100
luckily I got like some paperwork nearby

2557
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:24,719
it's got like my original you know date

2558
01:39:23,100 --> 01:39:27,360
and everything else so snap a picture

2559
01:39:24,719 --> 01:39:30,658
I'm like all right yeah that says 2007

2560
01:39:27,359 --> 01:39:32,039
you know explains a lot you know and you

2561
01:39:30,658 --> 01:39:34,379
know once again you have old friends

2562
01:39:32,039 --> 01:39:37,139

2563
01:39:34,380 --> 01:39:39,480
know over the phone at this at this

2564
01:39:37,139 --> 01:39:40,980
facility they you know help me out

2565
01:39:39,479 --> 01:39:43,079
through money on my books back in the

2566
01:39:40,979 --> 01:39:46,559
day and they all they all knew what was

2567
01:39:43,079 --> 01:39:48,238
up so and and the worst thing is is a

2568
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:50,100
person that's like you know spreading

2569
01:39:48,238 --> 01:39:52,079
his lie

2570
01:39:50,100 --> 01:39:53,880
um saw me like right when I got out of

2571
01:39:52,079 --> 01:39:55,920
prison and like was even around like

2572
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:58,020
with me going to the probation office to

2573
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:59,719
take my piss test like they they know

2574
01:39:58,020 --> 01:40:03,120
all this so like they're just obviously

2575
01:39:59,719 --> 01:40:05,880
just trying to come up with [ __ ] so

2576
01:40:03,119 --> 01:40:08,519
much [ __ ] just to you know

2577
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:10,079
accomplish their own goal so that was I

2578
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:11,639
guess at the time you know saw the

2579
01:40:10,079 --> 01:40:12,779
remaining because of stock and then they

2580
01:40:11,639 --> 01:40:15,060
said they were going to start up a new

2581
01:40:12,779 --> 01:40:16,738
company and like by all means like you

2582
01:40:15,060 --> 01:40:18,900

2584
01:40:18,899 --> 01:40:24,539

2585
01:40:21,779 --> 01:40:27,119
extra [ __ ] like uh you you didn't need

2586
01:40:24,539 --> 01:40:29,100

2587
01:40:27,119 --> 01:40:31,019
he was like oh yeah you're a mess dude

2588
01:40:29,100 --> 01:40:32,820
I've only seen that [ __ ] one time in my

2589
01:40:31,020 --> 01:40:34,620
life and I wasn't doing I even got in a

2590
01:40:32,819 --> 01:40:36,840
fight with the guy like two days later

2591
01:40:34,619 --> 01:40:39,238
on a job site because he's a [ __ ]

2592
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:41,100
piece of [ __ ] like I don't know if I can

2593
01:40:39,238 --> 01:40:43,439
do that anybody that really knows like I

2594
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:46,500
don't do drugs and these even cases of

2595
01:40:43,439 --> 01:40:49,259
people that could do drugs

2596
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:50,760
um and uh straight up I tell them like I

2597
01:40:49,260 --> 01:40:54,179
can't I can't hang around you like

2598
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:57,060
that's just you know it's not good so

2599
01:40:54,179 --> 01:40:58,739
and you know what I say to that uh

2600
01:40:57,060 --> 01:41:01,440
anybody that knows me could tell you but

2601
01:40:58,738 --> 01:41:04,619
anybody wants to say some [ __ ] like that

2602
01:41:01,439 --> 01:41:07,619
go down in your [ __ ] pocket pay for a

2603
01:41:04,619 --> 01:41:09,359
[ __ ] hair follicle test from me you

2604
01:41:07,619 --> 01:41:11,760
know put you put your money where your

2605
01:41:09,359 --> 01:41:13,799
[ __ ] cop holster is and [ __ ] get

2606
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:15,780
that test he didn't go back I think like

2607
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:17,520
seven years or more so I've been gone

2608
01:41:15,779 --> 01:41:19,439
too so that gives you a good five

2609
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:21,840
[ __ ] year so if I was on any type of

2610
01:41:19,439 --> 01:41:26,759
drug it'd be on there and I'm gonna come

2611
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:28,139
up hot as [ __ ] for THC that's it so you

2612
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:29,760
know I can squash out whenever you

2613
01:41:28,139 --> 01:41:31,619
[ __ ] there and like I said having

2614
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:33,300
this paperwork and [ __ ] like that to be

2615
01:41:31,619 --> 01:41:35,158
like nope that's where you're [ __ ] up

2616
01:41:33,300 --> 01:41:37,440
oh you weren't here you couldn't have

2617
01:41:35,158 --> 01:41:39,779
done that boom here's a check stub boom

2618
01:41:37,439 --> 01:41:42,960
you know like I got like literally like

2619
01:41:39,779 --> 01:41:44,519
the disprove every single [ __ ] thing

2620
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:47,100
and like I said some of it was so

2621
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:49,380
[ __ ] absurd the people in the know

2622
01:41:47,100 --> 01:41:51,300
which are out there like they obviously

2623
01:41:49,380 --> 01:41:54,960
know like it's [ __ ] because they

2624
01:41:51,300 --> 01:41:58,020
were [ __ ] there you know so um

2625
01:41:54,960 --> 01:42:00,899
very very you know

2626
01:41:58,020 --> 01:42:02,280
very disheartening you know to to see

2627
01:42:00,899 --> 01:42:03,420
all that you know especially after

2628
01:42:02,279 --> 01:42:06,479
somebody

2629
01:42:03,420 --> 01:42:09,899
uh that you really looked out for you

2630
01:42:06,479 --> 01:42:11,579
know so much and obviously you know they

2631
01:42:09,899 --> 01:42:12,839
you know I felt some kind of way and

2632
01:42:11,579 --> 01:42:16,079
we're gonna do what they were gonna do

2633
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:18,000
and they did it and you know that's all

2634
01:42:16,079 --> 01:42:20,639
in the past it's whatever like you know

2635

know I'm gonna keep doing me I'm gonna

2637
01:42:21,899 --> 01:42:25,138
keep moving forward but

2638
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:27,780
you know they're not going to be around

2639
01:42:25,139 --> 01:42:29,940
for it which is you know bad bad for

2640
01:42:27,779 --> 01:42:31,259
them but the worst part is like good

2641
01:42:29,939 --> 01:42:33,599
friends that you're really trying to

2642
01:42:31,260 --> 01:42:36,360
take care of and then ultimately one of

2643
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:38,579
them's like yeah no [ __ ] cash cash

2644
01:42:36,359 --> 01:42:40,319

2645
01:42:38,579 --> 01:42:42,658
Lies so I have somebody to help me cash

2646
01:42:40,319 --> 01:42:45,000
out and the worst part is like the good

2647
01:42:42,658 --> 01:42:47,879
friend that actually like believes this

2648
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:49,439
[ __ ] you know and was very adamant about

2649
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:51,179
Oh no you're lying you're lying you

2650
01:42:49,439 --> 01:42:52,759
always should just go stop lying get

2651
01:42:51,179 --> 01:42:55,618

2652
01:42:52,760 --> 01:42:57,659
like no like literally I can literally

2653
01:42:55,618 --> 01:43:00,899
prove all this right here and just with

2654
01:42:57,658 --> 01:43:02,579
what I have at my at my hands length

2655
01:43:00,899 --> 01:43:04,799
right now like a piece of paperwork with

2656
01:43:02,579 --> 01:43:06,359
the [ __ ] dates on it boom here when I

2657
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:08,279
get to the house I got my whole [ __ ]

2658
01:43:06,359 --> 01:43:10,219
PSR you can read the whole [ __ ] thing

2659
01:43:08,279 --> 01:43:13,079
like everything in detail like

2660
01:43:10,219 --> 01:43:15,060
discredits the [ __ ] out of it but why in

2661
01:43:13,079 --> 01:43:17,819
the [ __ ] are you [ __ ] gonna believe

2662
01:43:15,060 --> 01:43:19,619
some wild ass crazy [ __ ] like that from

2663
01:43:17,819 --> 01:43:22,460
somebody you don't even really know

2664
01:43:19,618 --> 01:43:26,039
right

2665
01:43:22,460 --> 01:43:29,279
some some years right and that's what is

2666
01:43:26,039 --> 01:43:31,679
more mind-blowing you know and hurtful I

2667
01:43:29,279 --> 01:43:33,719
guess than anything but yeah like you

2668
01:43:31,679 --> 01:43:34,980
know I could definitely definitely

2669
01:43:33,719 --> 01:43:38,460
squash out

2670
01:43:34,979 --> 01:43:40,198
you know any any of that [ __ ] so it's

2671
01:43:38,460 --> 01:43:42,779
just like I said it's just you know like

2672
01:43:40,198 --> 01:43:44,399
you were saying it's just you you're one

2673
01:43:42,779 --> 01:43:47,579
of the people that's actually been there

2674
01:43:44,399 --> 01:43:49,679
you know seeing this so it comes off as

2675
01:43:47,579 --> 01:43:50,399
just pretty pretty absurd anyway you

2676
01:43:49,679 --> 01:43:53,819
know

2677
01:43:50,399 --> 01:43:55,439
yeah look you hit all the questions I

2678
01:43:53,819 --> 01:43:57,899
was gonna follow up with before I even

2679
01:43:55,439 --> 01:44:00,419
had a chance so thank you for painting

2680
01:43:57,899 --> 01:44:03,179
you know a clearer picture and I think

2681
01:44:00,420 --> 01:44:04,980
that you've always got to take stories

2682
01:44:03,179 --> 01:44:06,480
you hear with a grain of salt when you

2683
01:44:04,979 --> 01:44:07,859
don't have the ability to hear all

2684
01:44:06,479 --> 01:44:10,138
perspectives and I think that must have

2685
01:44:07,859 --> 01:44:12,719
been a really frustrating aspect for you

2686
01:44:10,139 --> 01:44:14,219
not being able to reply throughout this

2687
01:44:12,719 --> 01:44:17,158
whole process

2688
01:44:14,219 --> 01:44:18,600
yeah and like that's what they count on

2689
01:44:17,158 --> 01:44:21,000
well I was just saying that's what

2690
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:22,440
people like that count on it's like you

2691
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:24,479
always hear the sayings like people are

2692
01:44:22,439 --> 01:44:25,979
going to kick you when you're down and

2693
01:44:24,479 --> 01:44:28,019
furthermore like being down is like

2694
01:44:25,979 --> 01:44:30,059
you're muffled your silence like you're

2695
01:44:28,020 --> 01:44:33,600
physically actually restrained like you

2696
01:44:30,060 --> 01:44:35,460
can't do a thing and then when people

2697
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:37,079
see things and then they come out with

2698
01:44:35,460 --> 01:44:39,000
it and like hey something's [ __ ] up

2699
01:44:37,079 --> 01:44:41,279
you know then you got people bickering

2700
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:44,219
and fighting amongst each other

2701
01:44:41,279 --> 01:44:46,139
um which is you know [ __ ] up and then

2702
01:44:44,219 --> 01:44:48,960
because one side's gonna pick one or the

2703
01:44:46,139 --> 01:44:50,819
other and it gets [ __ ] up and then

2704
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:52,679
unfortunately you know you get other

2705
01:44:50,819 --> 01:44:54,359
people drawn into the middle and then

2706
01:44:52,679 --> 01:44:56,699
they get really pissed and frustrated

2707
01:44:54,359 --> 01:44:58,859
with the whole thing and it's just it's

2708
01:44:56,698 --> 01:45:01,379
just a whole cancerous thing and it

2709
01:44:58,859 --> 01:45:04,019
grows and grows and if you're not able

2710
01:45:01,380 --> 01:45:07,279
to like really get out there and stop it

2711
01:45:04,020 --> 01:45:09,719
um it just gets worse until you know

2712
01:45:07,279 --> 01:45:11,759
time and we'll iron everything out

2713
01:45:09,719 --> 01:45:14,579
without you even having the you know

2714
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:16,800
step forward and obviously like I've

2715
01:45:14,579 --> 01:45:18,539
looked back and everything and you know

2716
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:19,679
like a lot of good people out there that

2717
01:45:18,539 --> 01:45:21,118
knew this [ __ ] was going on they're

2718
01:45:19,679 --> 01:45:23,039
screenshotting they're recording they're

2719
01:45:21,118 --> 01:45:24,839
doing all this stuff so like you know I

2720
01:45:23,039 --> 01:45:27,000
was well informed like right when I pray

2721
01:45:24,840 --> 01:45:28,980
when I got back and put it all together

2722
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:31,679
but

2723
01:45:28,979 --> 01:45:34,198
um you know it irons itself out really

2724
01:45:31,679 --> 01:45:36,600
especially when you got stuff it's just

2725
01:45:34,198 --> 01:45:38,579
so absurd it just comes off weird

2726
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:42,780
and it's like obviously it's like yeah

2727
01:45:38,579 --> 01:45:44,340
it's obviously uh obviously a lie so um

2728
01:45:42,779 --> 01:45:46,618
you know but

2729
01:45:44,340 --> 01:45:48,300
now being able to actually deal with it

2730
01:45:46,618 --> 01:45:50,880
and talk with it

2731
01:45:48,300 --> 01:45:52,320
um it wasn't really that widespread or

2732
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:53,880
that big of a deal

2733
01:45:52,319 --> 01:45:55,559
for real

2734
01:45:53,880 --> 01:45:57,659
um but still just the fact that somebody

2735
01:45:55,560 --> 01:45:59,940
that close was trying some [ __ ] like

2736

I mean most everybody anyways like yeah

2739
01:46:04,979 --> 01:46:09,479
that's that's a load of [ __ ] so that's

2740
01:46:07,380 --> 01:46:10,920
that's cool too it's good to know you

2741

2742
01:46:10,920 --> 01:46:15,179
know that you're you know a solid dude

2743
01:46:13,079 --> 01:46:17,158
unless you're doing what you're saying I

2744
01:46:15,179 --> 01:46:19,739
mean it's just you know the good thing

2745
01:46:17,158 --> 01:46:21,420
if you live a good good life and you you

2746
01:46:19,738 --> 01:46:23,039
know do that you don't really have

2747
01:46:21,420 --> 01:46:25,980
nothing to worry about when people do

2748
01:46:23,039 --> 01:46:28,439
you know talk outside like that and um

2749
01:46:25,979 --> 01:46:30,059
and now they're back and be able to kind

2750
01:46:28,439 --> 01:46:31,799
of iron that out and be like yeah you

2751
01:46:30,060 --> 01:46:33,960

2752
01:46:31,800 --> 01:46:36,000
Hoodwinked man and here it is here it is

2753
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:37,980
here it is and then by the end of it

2754
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:40,738
being like yeah now I kind of I kind of

2755
01:46:37,979 --> 01:46:43,500
see what you're saying so I just wanted

2756
01:46:40,738 --> 01:46:45,299
to you know get it get it very apparent

2757
01:46:43,500 --> 01:46:47,760
to them you know it's just so they know

2758
01:46:45,300 --> 01:46:49,619
and then you know that that should that

2759
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:51,060
should kill that right where it [ __ ]

2760
01:46:49,618 --> 01:46:54,118
my eyes you know

2761
01:46:51,060 --> 01:46:56,100
yeah look hopefully that can help set

2762
01:46:54,118 --> 01:46:58,799
the record straight for anyone who maybe

2763
01:46:56,100 --> 01:47:01,020
had heard some of the incorrect rumors

2764
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:02,699
circulating around but I think you know

2765
01:47:01,020 --> 01:47:04,380
on the other end of the spectrum there

2766
01:47:02,698 --> 01:47:06,059
was what I thought at least was some

2767
01:47:04,380 --> 01:47:08,039
good things that sort of came out

2768
01:47:06,060 --> 01:47:10,920
regarding like Community banding

2769
01:47:08,039 --> 01:47:13,800
together in that there was at least what

2770
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:15,960
I know of two breeders who were very

2771
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:18,960
keen to try to help you out financially

2772
01:47:15,960 --> 01:47:22,198
and uh good old ODI of Heroes of the

2773
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:24,300
Farms as well as sulfur genetics both

2774
01:47:22,198 --> 01:47:26,279
came to the table and wanted to offer

2775
01:47:24,300 --> 01:47:28,020
some strains to help raise some funds

2776
01:47:26,279 --> 01:47:29,819
for you was this something you had any

2777
01:47:28,020 --> 01:47:32,540
idea was happening or was it sort of a

2778
01:47:29,819 --> 01:47:35,579
pleasant surprise when you found out

2779
01:47:32,539 --> 01:47:36,899
just I won't even say pleasant surprise

2780
01:47:35,579 --> 01:47:39,118
like just

2781
01:47:36,899 --> 01:47:41,879
static

2782
01:47:39,118 --> 01:47:43,738
um they'll splint away

2783
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:45,420
um by all the people that came to the

2784
01:47:43,738 --> 01:47:47,099
fat for me and like I had friends

2785
01:47:45,420 --> 01:47:50,760
telling me they're like you're getting

2786
01:47:47,100 --> 01:47:54,060
hit up from people all over the world

2787
01:47:50,760 --> 01:47:56,219
these people are just like you know

2788
01:47:54,060 --> 01:47:58,020
whatever whatever they can do whatever

2789
01:47:56,219 --> 01:48:00,179
help that you need because and then they

2790
01:47:58,020 --> 01:48:02,639
all had a story oh there's this one time

2791
01:48:00,179 --> 01:48:05,819
this dude took two hours to you know on

2792
01:48:02,639 --> 01:48:08,520
a DM to teach me a new a new uh approach

2793
01:48:05,819 --> 01:48:10,859
and then I gave him an address and I

2794
01:48:08,520 --> 01:48:13,260
sent him you know a whole lot the whole

2795
01:48:10,859 --> 01:48:15,118
[ __ ] menu just on the house or

2796
01:48:13,260 --> 01:48:17,340
somebody that was down and out and I

2797
01:48:15,118 --> 01:48:20,639
donated to their fundraiser for Wildfire

2798
01:48:17,340 --> 01:48:22,679
fundraisers are just kind of not I don't

2799
01:48:20,639 --> 01:48:24,539
I don't do things like that because I'm

2800
01:48:22,679 --> 01:48:26,639
thinking like oh well and you know I

2801
01:48:24,539 --> 01:48:28,198
might get something I do it just to do

2802
01:48:26,639 --> 01:48:30,900
it you know what I mean

2803
01:48:28,198 --> 01:48:33,059
and I guess I'd done so much of it you

2804
01:48:30,899 --> 01:48:35,339
know it didn't really cross my mind it's

2805
01:48:33,060 --> 01:48:36,960
just the right thing to do and then when

2806
01:48:35,340 --> 01:48:39,600
they're you know I'm hearing back from

2807
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:41,340

2808
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:44,039
was getting I was getting out there you

2809
01:48:41,340 --> 01:48:46,199

2810
01:48:44,039 --> 01:48:48,658

nah man gotta you know put others before

2841
01:49:58,020 --> 01:50:01,500
yourself uh especially on stuff like

2842
01:50:00,420 --> 01:50:03,539
that so

2843
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:07,198
yeah I'm working uh

2844
01:50:03,539 --> 01:50:09,479
been working basically the day after I

2845
01:50:07,198 --> 01:50:11,279
got out I've already done uh on it like

2846
01:50:09,479 --> 01:50:13,500
stink on [ __ ] man so yeah y'all

01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:17,760
of that

2849
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:20,819
well you know what I was a little bit of

2850
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:22,560
a selfish segue on my part because you

2851
01:50:20,819 --> 01:50:24,779
know the the hoodoo it's been such a

2852
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:27,060
such popular strain really cool collab

2853
01:50:24,779 --> 01:50:29,340
between you and the skunk VA are there

2854
01:50:27,060 --> 01:50:32,100
any sort of breeders who since getting

2855
01:50:29,340 --> 01:50:34,260
out you're interested in or more

2856
01:50:32,100 --> 01:50:35,760
importantly since you know you've gotten

2857
01:50:34,260 --> 01:50:37,800
back out are there any I was thinking

2858
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:39,539
about are there any strains that have

2859
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:42,000
caught your eyes and like oh that wasn't

2860
01:50:39,539 --> 01:50:43,260
really a thing when I went away and I

2861
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:45,779
was thinking about it and I was like I

2862
01:50:43,260 --> 01:50:48,600
don't know if anything major has hit the

2863
01:50:45,779 --> 01:50:53,039
scene since you left it hasn't it hasn't

2864
01:50:48,600 --> 01:50:55,320
the only things that I've seen that

2865
01:50:53,039 --> 01:50:57,300
really really you know like caught my

2866
01:50:55,319 --> 01:51:00,059
eye or attention and I'm like oh yeah

2867
01:50:57,300 --> 01:51:02,940

stuff and kind of the same things that

2895
01:52:05,100 --> 01:52:10,440
were hitting when I was away you know

2896
01:52:07,260 --> 01:52:12,840
they're still doing doing their thing

2897
01:52:10,439 --> 01:52:14,219
yeah that was sort of the vibe I got but

2898
01:52:12,840 --> 01:52:16,260
you know what brilliant you you

2899
01:52:14,219 --> 01:52:18,179
mentioned both those two breeders

2900
01:52:16,260 --> 01:52:19,440
because I was gonna ask you questions I

2901
01:52:18,179 --> 01:52:21,359
was gonna say you know have you seen Bob

2902
01:52:19,439 --> 01:52:22,738
penfield's Park back cross it's looking

2903
01:52:21,359 --> 01:52:25,679
pretty cool

2904
01:52:22,738 --> 01:52:30,198
hell yeah I've seen that [ __ ] popular

2905
01:52:25,679 --> 01:52:33,658
Puck Lebanese too today oh yeah yeah

2906
01:52:30,198 --> 01:52:36,419
oh yeah that that plant is a special

2907
01:52:33,658 --> 01:52:38,460
plant for sure I was curious to know

2908
01:52:36,420 --> 01:52:40,319
though uh this is actually a fan

2909
01:52:38,460 --> 01:52:41,698
submitted question and they've got a

2910
01:52:40,319 --> 01:52:44,460
good memory they basically said that

2911
01:52:41,698 --> 01:52:46,618
they remembered uh some time ago you had

2912
01:52:44,460 --> 01:52:49,560
mentioned that you'd lost your Durban

2913
01:52:46,618 --> 01:52:52,380
Thai high flyer and they were wondering

2914
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:54,960
the cut you had was that different to

2915
01:52:52,380 --> 01:52:56,819
the one that AK beam Brands and skunk VA

2916
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:59,100
use or is it the same one and you just

2917
01:52:56,819 --> 01:53:01,319
like hadn't got it back off them

2918
01:52:59,100 --> 01:53:04,320
I'm not sure

2919
01:53:01,319 --> 01:53:07,319
about 8K being brains one

2920
01:53:04,319 --> 01:53:10,079
I would think so but I'm not 100 sure

2921
01:53:07,319 --> 01:53:13,139
but I gave the uh

2922
01:53:10,079 --> 01:53:15,539
the high flyer to uh VA so I know that's

2923
01:53:13,139 --> 01:53:17,100
that's the right one and uh I got

2924
01:53:15,539 --> 01:53:18,719
another buddy that's got it got it

2925
01:53:17,100 --> 01:53:19,440
backed up for me

2926
01:53:18,719 --> 01:53:22,380
um

2927
01:53:19,439 --> 01:53:24,419
my buddy uh Savage Gardens up in uh up

2928
01:53:22,380 --> 01:53:26,819
in Portland even did a little hybrid

2929
01:53:24,420 --> 01:53:29,579
using it it's called the Thai iced tea

2930
01:53:26,819 --> 01:53:32,279
it's like super super popular up there

2931
01:53:29,579 --> 01:53:35,158
right now that's true I do some [ __ ]

2932
01:53:32,279 --> 01:53:37,859
gnarly [ __ ] yeah he's got some cool bee

2933
01:53:35,158 --> 01:53:39,359
with hybrids he's made I I still follow

2934
01:53:37,859 --> 01:53:42,059
his stuff ever since meeting him at

2935
01:53:39,359 --> 01:53:44,939
Emerald cup 38 does nice stuff I guess

2936
01:53:42,060 --> 01:53:48,000
what I'm interested in asking is

2937
01:53:44,939 --> 01:53:49,799
do you have any reservations about the

2938
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:52,920
authenticity of the Durban Thai high

2939
01:53:49,800 --> 01:53:55,920
flyer because I remember when I spoke to

2940
01:53:52,920 --> 01:53:57,539
um Bodhi he actually said to me that he

2941
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:59,579
he wasn't speaking for certain or

2942
01:53:57,539 --> 01:54:01,319
anything but he said that over the years

2943
01:53:59,579 --> 01:54:03,118
there had been people who had come out

2944
01:54:01,319 --> 01:54:06,599
of the Woodworks with Durban Tire high

2945
01:54:03,118 --> 01:54:08,460
flyer clones and often he was skeptical

2946
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:10,440
of the authenticity and he sort of said

2947
01:54:08,460 --> 01:54:13,439
that he suspected it was maybe like a

2948
01:54:10,439 --> 01:54:16,198
Durban tie leaning

2949
01:54:13,439 --> 01:54:17,819
um hybrid of the Durban Thai c99 because

2950
01:54:16,198 --> 01:54:19,559
that was sort of a more recent release

2951
01:54:17,819 --> 01:54:21,779
more accessible

2952
01:54:19,560 --> 01:54:23,460
have you ever thought maybe that's the

2953
01:54:21,779 --> 01:54:25,859
case and again this isn't anyone

2954
01:54:23,460 --> 01:54:27,480
speaking about the specific clone in

2955
01:54:25,859 --> 01:54:31,618
question it's just a general sort of

2956
01:54:27,479 --> 01:54:35,158
question yeah so I would say like well

2957
01:54:31,618 --> 01:54:39,000
as far as like that exact thing before

2958
01:54:35,158 --> 01:54:41,519
I made that DC 99 like the re-release

2959
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:44,340
you know using a just a regular Durban

2960
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:47,159
uh we had that that cutting like bar

2961
01:54:44,340 --> 01:54:51,060
beyond that point so it wouldn't be for

2962
01:54:47,158 --> 01:54:55,319
that unless it was the older DTC 99 from

2963
01:54:51,060 --> 01:54:57,900
what 2001 I think you know when they

2964
01:54:55,319 --> 01:54:58,799
when they did that something like that

2965
01:54:57,899 --> 01:55:02,099
um

2966
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:04,860
I highly doubt it because that would be

2967
01:55:02,100 --> 01:55:06,659
a rare jump on its own and it would

2968
01:55:04,859 --> 01:55:09,719
probably be

2969
01:55:06,658 --> 01:55:11,638
um called and named as such so I kind of

2970
01:55:09,719 --> 01:55:13,560
kind of doubt that

2971
01:55:11,639 --> 01:55:15,719
um also

2972
01:55:13,560 --> 01:55:17,820
when Saul was you know smoking it you

2973
01:55:15,719 --> 01:55:19,920
know when I when I had gotten it

2974
01:55:17,819 --> 01:55:22,500
um he was like yeah that's that's it you

2975
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:24,480
know that's what he remembered

2976
01:55:22,500 --> 01:55:27,060
um as well and I was like yeah it's

2977
01:55:24,479 --> 01:55:28,738
pretty pretty spot-on to me and it's

2978
01:55:27,060 --> 01:55:31,080
kind of the way it grows and

2979
01:55:28,738 --> 01:55:34,500
kind of a little different influences

2980
01:55:31,079 --> 01:55:36,179
from just a straight Durban so but the

2981
01:55:34,500 --> 01:55:39,000
thing is at the end of the day and I

2982
01:55:36,179 --> 01:55:40,819
mean this could be safe for him or

2983
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:43,979
anybody that gets phones from somewhere

2984
01:55:40,819 --> 01:55:45,840
like do you really know right

2985
01:55:43,979 --> 01:55:47,279
do you really know what went on in

2986
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:48,840
Holland do you really know that their

2987
01:55:47,279 --> 01:55:50,939
tie was authentic do you really know

2988
01:55:48,840 --> 01:55:52,440
this you really know that and that's

2989
01:55:50,939 --> 01:55:55,319
that's a that's a great thing to say

2990
01:55:52,439 --> 01:55:58,259
because there is a lot of uncertainty in

2991
01:55:55,319 --> 01:56:00,719
what what is what isn't

2992
01:55:58,260 --> 01:56:01,860
um and I was you know I won't I won't

2993
01:56:00,719 --> 01:56:04,560
say it but there's been a lot of

2994
01:56:01,859 --> 01:56:06,359
breeders to go on and get something and

2995
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:08,039
breathe the [ __ ] out of it and then

2996
01:56:06,359 --> 01:56:09,779
years later you know after we've been

2997
01:56:08,039 --> 01:56:11,939
told year after year be like yeah well

2998
01:56:09,779 --> 01:56:15,359
that wasn't really this I guess it turns

2999
01:56:11,939 --> 01:56:18,479
out it was you know that right so you

3000
01:56:15,359 --> 01:56:21,960
know you gotta gotta be be weary for

3001
01:56:18,479 --> 01:56:23,759
sure you know and you you know always

3002
01:56:21,960 --> 01:56:25,679
try to stick to you know authentic

3003
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:27,780
authentic sources and everything but

3004
01:56:25,679 --> 01:56:31,859
sometimes people's authentic sources

3005
01:56:27,779 --> 01:56:33,539
turn out to be uh be all [ __ ] up then

3006
01:56:31,859 --> 01:56:36,658
it comes out later you know and I've

3007
01:56:33,539 --> 01:56:39,179
seen uh you know I won't put their name

3008
01:56:36,658 --> 01:56:41,460
out there but you know

3009
01:56:39,179 --> 01:56:43,380
um I know I've seen it happen happen to

3010
01:56:41,460 --> 01:56:45,480
you guys man so

3011
01:56:43,380 --> 01:56:47,400
um you know we just gotta do our best

3012
01:56:45,479 --> 01:56:50,279
and

3013
01:56:47,399 --> 01:56:52,379
um you know just take uh take with what

3014
01:56:50,279 --> 01:56:54,359
we got and

3015
01:56:52,380 --> 01:56:57,118
um you know if everything points to yeah

3016
01:56:54,359 --> 01:56:58,859
this is legit and cool then you know you

3017
01:56:57,118 --> 01:57:00,899
can uh you can move forward that's what

3018
01:56:58,859 --> 01:57:03,000
I just try to do with you know straight

3019
01:57:00,899 --> 01:57:04,859
up people and people I really know and

3020
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:06,899
you know it makes sense you know

3021
01:57:04,859 --> 01:57:08,960
especially if they gotta you know this

3022
01:57:06,899 --> 01:57:10,799
is hot right now that's where I got it

3023
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:12,960
you know

3024
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:14,400
um that's definitely a good thing

3025
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:17,099
because there's so many people out there

3026
01:57:14,399 --> 01:57:19,859
that have this or that there's just so

3027
01:57:17,099 --> 01:57:21,300
many so many red flags I think you know

3028
01:57:19,859 --> 01:57:25,198
you're talking about that that dude

3029
01:57:21,300 --> 01:57:29,880
earlier like yeah [ __ ] old cornbread

3030
01:57:25,198 --> 01:57:32,579
Mafia roadkill skunk clone uh right here

3031
01:57:29,880 --> 01:57:34,400
when we go and change the game you're

3032
01:57:32,579 --> 01:57:36,899
looking at this picture and it says

3033
01:57:34,399 --> 01:57:39,359
[ __ ] plant it has a lot of readings

3034
01:57:36,899 --> 01:57:40,920
on it it was it was literally just the

3035
01:57:39,359 --> 01:57:43,979
seedling and you're talking like this 30

3036
01:57:40,920 --> 01:57:46,380
year old time taking pictures of them

3037
01:57:43,979 --> 01:57:50,779
but I was like you can literally see the

3038
01:57:46,380 --> 01:57:54,060
god of winds on the uh on the picture

3039
01:57:50,779 --> 01:57:56,698
so you know you got a lot of a lot of

3040
01:57:54,060 --> 01:57:58,080
[ __ ] people out there too so you

3041
01:57:56,698 --> 01:58:01,259
know it's definitely it's definitely a

3042
01:57:58,079 --> 01:58:04,019
tricky tricky situation a lot of times

3043
01:58:01,260 --> 01:58:07,260
but um yeah so

3044
01:58:04,020 --> 01:58:10,320
as best as I can say yeah yeah it's a

3045
01:58:07,260 --> 01:58:13,199
it's yeah it was a legit one

3046
01:58:10,319 --> 01:58:14,698
no I feel you for sure and uh I'm

3047

01:58:27,260 --> 01:58:33,599
I [ __ ] that [ __ ]

3054
01:58:31,560 --> 01:58:36,119
you know so it's it's sort of

3055
01:58:33,599 --> 01:58:38,699
interesting that you mentioned many of

3056
01:58:36,118 --> 01:58:40,799
those things uh that you know talking

3057
01:58:38,698 --> 01:58:42,359
about when you get clones you know do

3058
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:44,699
you really know what they are things

3059
01:58:42,359 --> 01:58:46,679
like that sort of vibe and I guess it it

3060
01:58:44,698 --> 01:58:48,839
segues well into the next question which

3061
01:58:46,679 --> 01:58:50,639
was that although it was around before

3062
01:58:48,840 --> 01:58:52,800
you went away I think it's really come

3063
01:58:50,639 --> 01:58:56,219
to the climax in the past 12 months but

3064
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:58,079
the the Hop latent viroid is what I've

3065
01:58:56,219 --> 01:59:00,000
been calling recently it's it's the

3066
01:58:58,079 --> 01:59:02,399
covert of the Cannabis world you know

3067
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:05,579
it's it's really really spreading around

3068
01:59:02,399 --> 01:59:07,379
do you have any concerns around your

3069
01:59:05,579 --> 01:59:09,359
plants having it and would you ever look

3070
01:59:07,380 --> 01:59:11,460
into any sort of like tissue culturing

3071
01:59:09,359 --> 01:59:14,339
to try to get rid of it if so

3072
01:59:11,460 --> 01:59:16,079
yeah I would definitely want to test

3073
01:59:14,340 --> 01:59:16,619
everything

3074
01:59:16,079 --> 01:59:19,439
um

3075
01:59:16,618 --> 01:59:20,939
first and foremost and I really would

3076
01:59:19,439 --> 01:59:23,098
like to uh

3077
01:59:20,939 --> 01:59:26,219
this tissue culture the whole the whole

3078
01:59:23,099 --> 01:59:29,520
collector one for backup purposes two

3079
01:59:26,219 --> 01:59:31,859
if anything's gone astray since I've

3080
01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:34,679
been found it was nice it'd be nice to

3081
01:59:31,859 --> 01:59:36,839
start cleaning spray from scratch you

3082
01:59:34,679 --> 01:59:37,920
know plus you know that is bigger and

3083
01:59:36,840 --> 01:59:41,219
all that stuff

3084
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:43,020
that goes on as well

3085
01:59:41,219 --> 01:59:45,139
you know I feel like a good good way to

3086
01:59:43,020 --> 01:59:48,540
start you know what I mean

3087
01:59:45,139 --> 01:59:50,279
yeah of course and I mean I guess it's

3088
01:59:48,539 --> 01:59:52,920
probably too early for you to really

3089
01:59:50,279 --> 01:59:54,960
give definitive answers but are you

3090
01:59:52,920 --> 01:59:56,819
going to be much more apprehensive and

3091
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:58,020
skeptical taking in clones moving

3092
01:59:56,819 --> 02:00:01,500
forward

3093
01:59:58,020 --> 02:00:03,480
oh absolutely I was always sketchy but I

3094
02:00:01,500 --> 02:00:07,260
was a real sketchy kid anyhow you know

3095
02:00:03,479 --> 02:00:09,598
so um yeah man that's the number one

3096
02:00:07,260 --> 02:00:11,219
thing that people thought about is they

3097
02:00:09,599 --> 02:00:13,980
just take in whatever they don't

3098
02:00:11,219 --> 02:00:15,719
quarantine and stuff but hey I guess now

3099
02:00:13,979 --> 02:00:17,399
the code's been going on everybody's

3100
02:00:15,719 --> 02:00:19,859
doing quarantines on themselves you know

3101
02:00:17,399 --> 02:00:22,019
it's like the same with those plants you

3102
02:00:19,859 --> 02:00:25,139
know keep them out of the population and

3103
02:00:22,020 --> 02:00:28,199
keep them locked down you know keep the

3104
02:00:25,139 --> 02:00:30,239
uh I don't know not just you know just

3105
02:00:28,198 --> 02:00:31,919
throw it up in the mix and ruin your

3106
02:00:30,238 --> 02:00:34,859
[ __ ] you know

3107
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:37,380
yeah definitely I mean I know you've

3108
02:00:34,859 --> 02:00:38,639
spoken about it on the past so if you if

3109
02:00:37,380 --> 02:00:40,199
you feel like there isn't anything

3110
02:00:38,639 --> 02:00:41,699
really more to add I certainly

3111
02:00:40,198 --> 02:00:44,460
understand but we had a lot of people

3112
02:00:41,698 --> 02:00:46,738
ask about if you have any new tips or

3113
02:00:44,460 --> 02:00:49,319
trips for sort of your IPM or is it

3114
02:00:46,738 --> 02:00:50,579
still largely sort of what you used to

3115
02:00:49,319 --> 02:00:54,059
do

3116
02:00:50,579 --> 02:00:56,340
yeah it's it's generally like the same

3117
02:00:54,060 --> 02:00:58,450
you know kind of what always was anyway

3118
02:00:56,340 --> 02:01:00,420
and was going right back

3119
02:00:58,449 --> 02:01:03,840
[Music]

3120
02:01:00,420 --> 02:01:06,139
um just the basics are gonna keep you

3121
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:06,139
away

3122
02:01:07,800 --> 02:01:13,860
fixing so you know don't take in strange

3123
02:01:10,920 --> 02:01:15,840
[ __ ] don't let this dirty ass people up

3124
02:01:13,859 --> 02:01:18,000
in you grow and help it don't play

3125
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:21,239
anybody

3126
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:23,939
um just the the basic keep it simple

3127
02:01:21,238 --> 02:01:25,439
um process you know just be clean uh

3128
02:01:23,939 --> 02:01:27,559
don't let the animals run around the

3129
02:01:25,439 --> 02:01:27,559
yard

3130
02:01:28,198 --> 02:01:30,799
um so many things

3131
02:01:33,779 --> 02:01:40,559
broad Minds the rest of my

3132
02:01:36,238 --> 02:01:42,539
um spider mites uh epithium a lot of

3133
02:01:40,560 --> 02:01:44,520
other the more the more common things

3134
02:01:42,539 --> 02:01:47,460
that people are dealing with that just

3135
02:01:44,520 --> 02:01:49,320
all starts with good clean practices and

3136
02:01:47,460 --> 02:01:51,840
it's not taking anything

3137
02:01:49,319 --> 02:01:52,799
uh that you don't know about especially

3138
02:01:51,840 --> 02:01:54,260
without

3139
02:01:52,800 --> 02:01:57,960
um

3140
02:01:54,260 --> 02:02:00,000
so just keep it basic and all these

3141
02:01:57,960 --> 02:02:01,380
basic principles and you'll find you

3142
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,760
don't have to uh you don't really have

3143
02:02:01,380 --> 02:02:05,960
to deal with a whole lot other than

3144
02:02:02,760 --> 02:02:09,000
concentrating on this growing you know

3145
02:02:05,960 --> 02:02:11,099
yeah yeah I think that's that's really

3146
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:14,698
it you got to resist the urge to bring

3147
02:02:11,099 --> 02:02:18,480
in the uh the new silver gelato runs and

3148
02:02:14,698 --> 02:02:20,399
and keep the keep the Haram safe so a

3149
02:02:18,479 --> 02:02:21,959
question that was both submitted by fans

3150
02:02:20,399 --> 02:02:24,420
and me personally I was interested to

3151
02:02:21,960 --> 02:02:27,179
hear about unfortunately

3152
02:02:24,420 --> 02:02:30,840
um you ended up going away sort of not

3153
02:02:27,179 --> 02:02:33,420
too long after one of the releases from

3154
02:02:30,840 --> 02:02:35,760
dominion and so I guess people didn't

3155
02:02:33,420 --> 02:02:38,039
really find out as much about the figure

3156
02:02:35,760 --> 02:02:40,739
four crosses as maybe they were hoping

3157
02:02:38,039 --> 02:02:44,099
and so I was wondering could you give us

3158
02:02:40,738 --> 02:02:46,859
any sort of description slash details of

3159
02:02:44,099 --> 02:02:49,980
the figure four and what you are hoping

3160
02:02:46,859 --> 02:02:52,380
to bring to the table with that mail oh

3161
02:02:49,979 --> 02:02:53,819
absolutely yeah it was a shame because I

3162
02:02:52,380 --> 02:02:56,039
didn't really get to speak on and

3163
02:02:53,819 --> 02:02:57,719
everything was tested and ready and

3164
02:02:56,039 --> 02:02:59,760
packed up and went out but it was

3165
02:02:57,719 --> 02:03:00,679
literally right at the same time I'm

3166
02:02:59,760 --> 02:03:02,880
like

3167
02:03:00,679 --> 02:03:06,060
[ __ ] he had a good deal with this right

3168
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:09,900
quick and you know they lied about that

3169
02:03:06,060 --> 02:03:11,639
that Bond of course they did you know so

3170
02:03:09,899 --> 02:03:13,859
um I didn't get that chance to come back

3171
02:03:11,639 --> 02:03:17,699
out and talk more in depth about it but

3172
02:03:13,859 --> 02:03:21,658
you you actually if I'm not mistaken not

3173
02:03:17,698 --> 02:03:25,259
to witness at least one of the steps

3174
02:03:21,658 --> 02:03:27,179
um that was in in making the mail

3175
02:03:25,260 --> 02:03:30,060
so

3176
02:03:27,179 --> 02:03:31,980
you remember the ass man Airborne

3177
02:03:30,060 --> 02:03:35,039
skellystone yep

3178
02:03:31,979 --> 02:03:37,019
so that was that was the boy that ended

3179
02:03:35,039 --> 02:03:38,158
up getting developed and then hitting

3180
02:03:37,020 --> 02:03:42,000
the train

3181
02:03:38,158 --> 02:03:44,519
and the whole the whole process of

3182
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:45,300
selecting that final nail out of that

3183
02:03:44,520 --> 02:03:48,900
height

3184
02:03:45,300 --> 02:03:52,980
was to hit OG type plants chem type

3185
02:03:48,899 --> 02:03:55,920
plants thick structure and still still

3186
02:03:52,979 --> 02:03:59,279
not take too much away from what was

3187
02:03:55,920 --> 02:04:01,199
there originally and though like have

3188
02:03:59,279 --> 02:04:02,340
you did you get to see any like Savage

3189
02:04:01,198 --> 02:04:05,579
headbands

3190
02:04:02,340 --> 02:04:08,039
I don't know if I saw them but I saw the

3191
02:04:05,579 --> 02:04:11,099
the Osman and the pollination from it

3192
02:04:08,039 --> 02:04:13,560
yeah yeah big beefy big beefy

3193
02:04:11,099 --> 02:04:16,619
[ __ ] so I really like the main

3194
02:04:13,560 --> 02:04:19,139
things I wanted to really get into

3195
02:04:16,618 --> 02:04:22,738
outside of like you know the of course

3196
02:04:19,139 --> 02:04:24,900
the main Terrapins and the potency and

3197
02:04:22,738 --> 02:04:27,359
all that good stuff I wanted to take

3198
02:04:24,899 --> 02:04:28,979
away from a lot of that that internodal

3199
02:04:27,359 --> 02:04:31,618
spacing and I wanted to make the

3200
02:04:28,979 --> 02:04:34,678
branching a lot stronger so that was

3201
02:04:31,618 --> 02:04:37,319
that was the the main the main goal with

3202
02:04:34,679 --> 02:04:40,380
that and just and it's alive I'm not man

3203
02:04:37,319 --> 02:04:42,779
just reinvigorate them and get some [ __ ]

3204
02:04:40,380 --> 02:04:45,420
that was coming out extra extra snake

3205
02:04:42,779 --> 02:04:47,719
but also extra extra strong higher

3206
02:04:45,420 --> 02:04:50,099
wielding and everything too

3207
02:04:47,719 --> 02:04:52,800
yeah that's that's a brilliant answer

3208
02:04:50,099 --> 02:04:55,139
and uh we had another listener who was

3209
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:57,000
wondering you know they say look I I see

3210
02:04:55,139 --> 02:05:00,539
Duke's work with a variety of different

3211
02:04:57,000 --> 02:05:03,118
OG cushes over the years and I was just

3212
02:05:00,539 --> 02:05:07,618
wondering what do you prefer personally

3213
02:05:03,118 --> 02:05:09,059
and what do you think all day yo I knew

3214
02:05:07,618 --> 02:05:10,979
it I knew it I was like writing that

3215
02:05:09,060 --> 02:05:12,960
question and I they they'd been like

3216
02:05:10,979 --> 02:05:15,118
does he like headband ghost triangle and

3217
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:18,420
I was like it's just triangle yeah that

3218
02:05:15,118 --> 02:05:20,279
TK and then as far as like because like

3219
02:05:18,420 --> 02:05:23,880
I never considered like headband being

3220
02:05:20,279 --> 02:05:25,340
an OG you know but you know if he did

3221
02:05:23,880 --> 02:05:29,460
then yeah

3222
02:05:25,340 --> 02:05:31,260
of course yeah nice and out of a

3223
02:05:29,460 --> 02:05:33,060
personal curiosity I remember a while

3224
02:05:31,260 --> 02:05:35,639
back you you toyed around with the

3225
02:05:33,060 --> 02:05:37,980
Blissful wizard just as a like a freebie

3226
02:05:35,639 --> 02:05:40,260
slash a little you know muck around sort

3227
02:05:37,979 --> 02:05:42,959
of project is that the cutting of

3228
02:05:40,260 --> 02:05:44,579
cookies that you think is the one you

3229
02:05:42,960 --> 02:05:46,859
would most breed with if you were going

3230
02:05:44,579 --> 02:05:49,639
to or it's not necessarily your favorite

3231
02:05:46,859 --> 02:05:49,639
cut of cookies

3232
02:05:49,738 --> 02:05:54,059
um it has really killed me I ain't gonna

3233
02:05:52,679 --> 02:05:57,239
wow that is some pillow weed

3234
02:05:54,060 --> 02:05:58,920
unfortunately it veggies slower than

3235
02:05:57,238 --> 02:06:02,218
blood

3236
02:05:58,920 --> 02:06:05,579
um and like yield wise you know it's

3237
02:06:02,219 --> 02:06:07,739
like yeah but and it and like I said

3238
02:06:05,579 --> 02:06:09,179
pokey's never really been my thing and

3239
02:06:07,738 --> 02:06:12,839
like when I did that

3240
02:06:09,179 --> 02:06:14,760
I just uh you know Savage you know he

3241
02:06:12,840 --> 02:06:17,039
was the one that wanted me to do it I

3242
02:06:14,760 --> 02:06:18,780
was just making some means for him and

3243
02:06:17,039 --> 02:06:21,599
he's like yeah dude's at school or

3244
02:06:18,779 --> 02:06:24,479
whatever and you know we made some for

3245
02:06:21,599 --> 02:06:27,599
him he's like yeah

3246
02:06:24,479 --> 02:06:28,979
you know just to be a cool guy so yeah

3247
02:06:27,599 --> 02:06:31,279
it was just a

3248
02:06:28,979 --> 02:06:35,039
just a thing man

3249
02:06:31,279 --> 02:06:37,439
yeah nice we had uh a customer who had

3250
02:06:35,039 --> 02:06:38,880
grown out the funky town freebie and

3251
02:06:37,439 --> 02:06:42,198
they were like I love it I just would

3252
02:06:38,880 --> 02:06:44,539
love to know what are the genetics

3253
02:06:42,198 --> 02:06:47,098
never

3254
02:06:44,539 --> 02:06:49,920
I thought you might do that

3255
02:06:47,099 --> 02:06:52,500
yeah man if you go into the genetics

3256
02:06:49,920 --> 02:06:54,179
then people start trying to get it and

3257
02:06:52,500 --> 02:06:57,300
it's just better just leaving leaving

3258
02:06:54,179 --> 02:06:58,920
that part out and just stay just enjoy

3259
02:06:57,300 --> 02:07:00,900
it you know there's something that could

3260
02:06:58,920 --> 02:07:02,880
have been could have been sold for a

3261
02:07:00,899 --> 02:07:06,000
high dollar and that was the whole point

3262
02:07:02,880 --> 02:07:09,840
was to give it away and uh

3263
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:12,899
people enjoy it yeah okay can I can I

3264
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:16,020
take one stab at one of the parents

3265
02:07:12,899 --> 02:07:17,879
go for it I don't know why I have no

3266
02:07:16,020 --> 02:07:20,520
idea why but for some reason I just

3267
02:07:17,880 --> 02:07:23,699
always remembered you did that Urban

3268
02:07:20,520 --> 02:07:26,040
slice like slice and urban slice and for

3269
02:07:23,698 --> 02:07:27,479
some reason I just my heart's Telling Me

3270
02:07:26,039 --> 02:07:28,618
Maybe that's maybe that's in it

3271
02:07:27,479 --> 02:07:31,459
somewhere

3272
02:07:28,618 --> 02:07:31,460
no no

3273
02:07:31,520 --> 02:07:37,080
either one of the parents there and all

3274
02:07:33,899 --> 02:07:41,179
the see all the urban slices were like I

3275
02:07:37,079 --> 02:07:41,179
had the the tequila if you know

3276
02:07:46,219 --> 02:07:51,300
smelled like you had a bottle of tequila

3277
02:07:49,380 --> 02:07:54,719
open and then the other ones are just

3278
02:07:51,300 --> 02:07:57,239
like some [ __ ] really insane one yeah

3279
02:07:54,719 --> 02:07:59,639
beautiful beautiful stuff I I know it's

3280
02:07:57,238 --> 02:08:01,379
like just most of them were better

3281
02:07:59,639 --> 02:08:03,359
versions of Tangy I think I only tried

3282
02:08:01,380 --> 02:08:06,020
one or two slice Finos but they were

3283
02:08:03,359 --> 02:08:08,460
they were great beautiful stuff

3284
02:08:06,020 --> 02:08:12,000
exactly exactly

3285
02:08:08,460 --> 02:08:13,920
and uh you know that was a that was a

3286
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:15,840
real good one that was one of the

3287
02:08:13,920 --> 02:08:18,118
one of the projects that got left on

3288
02:08:15,840 --> 02:08:20,039
hold you know that I have to have to

3289
02:08:18,118 --> 02:08:22,920
pick up when I get out because I was

3290
02:08:20,039 --> 02:08:25,439
like yeah let me put some some Dominion

3291
02:08:22,920 --> 02:08:26,760
type orange out into the world

3292
02:08:25,439 --> 02:08:30,479
so

3293
02:08:26,760 --> 02:08:32,699
yeah hey before it leaves my mind you

3294
02:08:30,479 --> 02:08:34,500
know you you mentioned asked man a while

3295
02:08:32,698 --> 02:08:36,059
ago will we ever see that pop up in

3296
02:08:34,500 --> 02:08:38,520
another form or it would just be through

3297
02:08:36,060 --> 02:08:40,739
the figure four

3298
02:08:38,520 --> 02:08:43,500
um through the figure four but we did

3299
02:08:40,738 --> 02:08:45,598
something super cool and I did it I did

3300
02:08:43,500 --> 02:08:47,639
it for being brains because he hooked me

3301
02:08:45,599 --> 02:08:50,279
out with that MTF you know just to grow

3302
02:08:47,639 --> 02:08:52,859
out and [ __ ] yeah and I decided to be a

3303
02:08:50,279 --> 02:08:55,079
cool thing it's like [ __ ] it I'd ask man

3304
02:08:52,859 --> 02:08:57,960
would go really really really good on

3305
02:08:55,079 --> 02:09:01,760
that and uh so I hit it and I just sent

3306
02:08:57,960 --> 02:09:01,760
him a huge huge bag of seeds

3307
02:09:04,609 --> 02:09:10,079
[Music]

3308
02:09:07,219 --> 02:09:12,840
whatever you want this is just always

3309
02:09:10,079 --> 02:09:14,579
saying thank you or you know passing

3310
02:09:12,840 --> 02:09:17,880
something really special and old to me

3311
02:09:14,579 --> 02:09:21,059
to you know grow and enjoy and um and

3312
02:09:17,880 --> 02:09:21,840
did that so I guess

3313
02:09:21,060 --> 02:09:23,820
um

3314
02:09:21,840 --> 02:09:25,619
I guess probably by the time this comes

3315
02:09:23,819 --> 02:09:28,559
out it'll probably have already already

3316
02:09:25,618 --> 02:09:30,719
have happened he uh being the good dude

3317
02:09:28,560 --> 02:09:33,300
that he is is like bagging him up

3318
02:09:30,719 --> 02:09:35,039
sending them to James bean and we're

3319
02:09:33,300 --> 02:09:37,860
gonna we're gonna put them

3320
02:09:35,039 --> 02:09:41,539
put them out there you know to hook you

3321
02:09:37,859 --> 02:09:43,979
up I was like man you're too much man

3322
02:09:41,539 --> 02:09:46,698
that's awesome stuff

3323
02:09:43,979 --> 02:09:49,618
yeah the MTF crossed with the ass man

3324
02:09:46,698 --> 02:09:52,319
[ __ ] Christmas tree [ __ ] bugs some

3325
02:09:49,618 --> 02:09:54,779
like orange citrusy crazy [ __ ] going on

3326
02:09:52,319 --> 02:09:57,899
and just put your dick in the dirt take

3327
02:09:54,779 --> 02:10:00,179
potency on the on the heavy narcotic gun

3328
02:09:57,899 --> 02:10:02,519
that's awesome yeah you know as you as

3329
02:10:00,179 --> 02:10:05,158
you call thunderhole

3330
02:10:02,520 --> 02:10:07,020
as you started saying that I was like oh

3331
02:10:05,158 --> 02:10:08,698
I forgot to mention AK beam brains

3332
02:10:07,020 --> 02:10:10,020
earlier because he he had mentioned to

3333
02:10:08,698 --> 02:10:12,238
me that he was going to do that and I

3334
02:10:10,020 --> 02:10:13,380
was like oh he he donated some strands

3335
02:10:12,238 --> 02:10:15,899
as well

3336
02:10:13,380 --> 02:10:18,179
um yeah that's cool that's that's really

3337
02:10:15,899 --> 02:10:19,319
cool to hear I dig that a lot now you

3338
02:10:18,179 --> 02:10:21,118
got me thinking I think there was

3339
02:10:19,319 --> 02:10:23,639
someone else

3340
02:10:21,118 --> 02:10:27,179
anyway who knows probably not important

3341
02:10:23,639 --> 02:10:29,400
but um yeah Kudos AK band brains are a

3342
02:10:27,179 --> 02:10:32,699
really lovely guy who's always been very

3343
02:10:29,399 --> 02:10:33,839
lovely and helpful I mean now let's go

3344
02:10:32,698 --> 02:10:35,579
back to what we were talking about just

3345
02:10:33,840 --> 02:10:37,860
a moment ago and we're sort of in the

3346
02:10:35,579 --> 02:10:39,840
Realms of skunk and you know the slice

3347
02:10:37,859 --> 02:10:41,939
has got that skunk in it stuff like that

3348
02:10:39,840 --> 02:10:44,579
a lot of people are wondering do you

3349
02:10:41,939 --> 02:10:46,319
still have you know original skunk seeds

3350
02:10:44,579 --> 02:10:48,960
available to you or are you working with

3351
02:10:46,319 --> 02:10:51,118
the hybrids now

3352
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:53,939
um I still have uh seeds from the last

3353
02:10:51,118 --> 02:10:57,000
time I did Ophelia on them

3354
02:10:53,939 --> 02:10:59,399
um I've done so much work you know

3355
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:01,439
hybridizing them and and working them in

3356
02:10:59,399 --> 02:11:03,779
different ways seeing what's happening

3357
02:11:01,439 --> 02:11:07,198
what's not happening

3358
02:11:03,779 --> 02:11:09,779
um I wouldn't I wouldn't go back to the

3359
02:11:07,198 --> 02:11:11,638
starting point unless it's a whole a

3360
02:11:09,779 --> 02:11:14,099
whole another another project that I

3361
02:11:11,639 --> 02:11:15,719
found myself into

3362
02:11:14,099 --> 02:11:18,719
um and I don't I don't really have much

3363
02:11:15,719 --> 02:11:21,658
of that on my on my mind up at the

3364
02:11:18,719 --> 02:11:23,460
moment you know so

3365
02:11:21,658 --> 02:11:26,698
um I would use something I've hybridized

3366
02:11:23,460 --> 02:11:29,039
to them to go forward in a project if I

3367
02:11:26,698 --> 02:11:30,299
was going to go go that direction you

3368
02:11:29,039 --> 02:11:32,279
know

3369
02:11:30,300 --> 02:11:34,800
um now like with the slice for instance

3370
02:11:32,279 --> 02:11:37,319
you know it's like I would it was like

3371
02:11:34,800 --> 02:11:40,079
so like Calio it was just a weird stunt

3372
02:11:37,319 --> 02:11:42,059
number one you know type so that's what

3373
02:11:40,079 --> 02:11:44,698
like my curiosity felt that I was like

3374
02:11:42,060 --> 02:11:48,179
if I hit it with more Scotland like what

3375
02:11:44,698 --> 02:11:51,500
what happened you know and it was it was

3376
02:11:48,179 --> 02:11:51,500
pretty pretty [ __ ] awesome

3377
02:11:51,800 --> 02:11:58,260
yeah I I agree and you've you've sort of

3378
02:11:54,840 --> 02:12:02,099
got me interested now what are your

3379
02:11:58,260 --> 02:12:04,260
thoughts on the reincarnated version of

3380
02:12:02,099 --> 02:12:05,639
super sativa seed Club that's popped its

3381
02:12:04,260 --> 02:12:07,440
head out I don't know if you've paid

3382
02:12:05,639 --> 02:12:09,060
much attention to it or even got a

3383
02:12:07,439 --> 02:12:10,500
particular opinion on it but I'd be

3384
02:12:09,060 --> 02:12:13,500
curious to know

3385
02:12:10,500 --> 02:12:15,840
and it went it happened right after

3386
02:12:13,500 --> 02:12:19,260
or I mean excuse me right before I went

3387
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:21,300
in and it had happened a couple times

3388
02:12:19,260 --> 02:12:24,119
prior to that and then people found out

3389
02:12:21,300 --> 02:12:27,659
it was just like a fake or a scam

3390
02:12:24,118 --> 02:12:30,960
um so I heard it and then then I was

3391
02:12:27,658 --> 02:12:33,359
gone so I never I never got to really

3392
02:12:30,960 --> 02:12:34,319
look back into it and it's kind of just

3393
02:12:33,359 --> 02:12:36,598
kind of

3394
02:12:34,319 --> 02:12:38,399
like you just reminded me about that so

3395
02:12:36,599 --> 02:12:42,539
I have to have to look at it like it's

3396
02:12:38,399 --> 02:12:44,819
legit right yeah well look I mean I

3397
02:12:42,539 --> 02:12:46,920
don't know it's it's hard to say but I

3398
02:12:44,819 --> 02:12:48,840
guess the the if I sort of wanted to

3399
02:12:46,920 --> 02:12:50,960
give you the dot points and have you

3400
02:12:48,840 --> 02:12:53,219
reflect on those I would say number one

3401
02:12:50,960 --> 02:12:55,198
there's no strain they're currently

3402
02:12:53,219 --> 02:12:57,539
selling now that was one of the former

3403
02:12:55,198 --> 02:13:00,299
ones what they're selling now are new

3404
02:12:57,539 --> 02:13:05,519
strains and there's only one or two that

3405
02:13:00,300 --> 02:13:07,739
I can see that uh of older lineage so I

3406
02:13:05,520 --> 02:13:09,840
guess with those dot points in mind I'm

3407
02:13:07,738 --> 02:13:13,439
sort of a little bit skeptical and and

3408
02:13:09,840 --> 02:13:15,360
likewise it hasn't made any waves since

3409
02:13:13,439 --> 02:13:19,500
releasing those strains

3410
02:13:15,359 --> 02:13:21,179
I would uh I would uh I could see where

3411
02:13:19,500 --> 02:13:21,719
that would happen

3412
02:13:21,179 --> 02:13:24,179
um

3413
02:13:21,719 --> 02:13:26,060
like the thing that I saw like before I

3414
02:13:24,179 --> 02:13:28,199
went out which kind of was just like

3415
02:13:26,060 --> 02:13:30,840
well I just kind of didn't really think

3416
02:13:28,198 --> 02:13:33,118
about it was like when I saw it and

3417
02:13:30,840 --> 02:13:35,400
somebody went to it they had like a

3418
02:13:33,118 --> 02:13:36,679
cookie hybrid and like you said there

3419
02:13:35,399 --> 02:13:40,759
was nothing

3420
02:13:36,679 --> 02:13:44,819
at all from from now yeah

3421
02:13:40,760 --> 02:13:47,340
all right all right so um so yeah I mean

3422
02:13:44,819 --> 02:13:48,960
that that's that'd be that'd be my

3423
02:13:47,340 --> 02:13:52,078
thoughts you know it's a little a little

3424
02:13:48,960 --> 02:13:53,060
odd I mean [ __ ] you got let me say back

3425
02:13:52,078 --> 02:13:55,738
to it

3426
02:13:53,060 --> 02:13:58,440
AK beam Brands probably God he's been

3427
02:13:55,738 --> 02:14:00,539
talking about me but uh I mean he's

3428
02:13:58,439 --> 02:14:03,118
going back to home and some other other

3429
02:14:00,539 --> 02:14:04,738
folks that he hangs around like and even

3430
02:14:03,118 --> 02:14:08,098
they got old stocks that they're working

3431
02:14:04,738 --> 02:14:11,098
with and bringing back like how are you

3432
02:14:08,099 --> 02:14:12,420
the the main the main company you know

3433
02:14:11,099 --> 02:14:13,860
so that would

3434
02:14:12,420 --> 02:14:16,380
you know because like that's what people

3435
02:14:13,859 --> 02:14:18,779
would ideally want I mean not to say

3436
02:14:16,380 --> 02:14:20,039
they wouldn't want anything new but you

3437
02:14:18,779 --> 02:14:21,359
know you would like to think you'd see

3438
02:14:20,039 --> 02:14:23,880
some of the old or at least some of the

3439
02:14:21,359 --> 02:14:25,319
old hybridizers some of the new or you

3440
02:14:23,880 --> 02:14:27,300
know some all New Creations something

3441
02:14:25,319 --> 02:14:30,420
you know but

3442
02:14:27,300 --> 02:14:32,599
yeah I don't know man I think I'm I'm

3443
02:14:30,420 --> 02:14:35,340
probably good on that

3444
02:14:32,599 --> 02:14:37,020
yeah I was surprised when I saw the

3445
02:14:35,340 --> 02:14:38,578
cookie hybrids and stuff and I was like

3446
02:14:37,020 --> 02:14:41,099
oh well but you know the other thing I

3447
02:14:38,578 --> 02:14:45,658
was thinking about is all of the notable

3448
02:14:41,099 --> 02:14:48,960
SSC sorry sssc strains were ones that

3449
02:14:45,658 --> 02:14:51,118
were pretty confident like they weren't

3450
02:14:48,960 --> 02:14:53,279
breeding in Amsterdam like you know like

3451
02:14:51,118 --> 02:14:55,319
the the skunk comes from Virginia and

3452
02:14:53,279 --> 02:14:57,599
Williams Wonder from Oregon and so it's

3453
02:14:55,319 --> 02:14:59,639
like they weren't the Breeders anyway

3454
02:14:57,599 --> 02:15:02,039
right and that that was the thing is

3455
02:14:59,639 --> 02:15:04,380
like they were like a Distribution

3456
02:15:02,039 --> 02:15:07,019
Company and like even like in a Solo

3457
02:15:04,380 --> 02:15:08,760
work for him uh for a while as like one

3458
02:15:07,020 --> 02:15:11,400
of their Distributors you know like he

3459
02:15:08,760 --> 02:15:13,079
would nail you know mail the packs out

3460
02:15:11,399 --> 02:15:15,420
and everything

3461
02:15:13,078 --> 02:15:17,039
um but all the the company was like it

3462
02:15:15,420 --> 02:15:18,539
was like a collection of breeders from

3463
02:15:17,039 --> 02:15:21,238
all over the place

3464
02:15:18,539 --> 02:15:23,340
that all put their put their words under

3465
02:15:21,238 --> 02:15:25,738
under that line like uh like a record

3466
02:15:23,340 --> 02:15:28,560
label or something and that's what made

3467
02:15:25,738 --> 02:15:30,178
them really awesome as what I felt was

3468
02:15:28,560 --> 02:15:32,400
like because you got such diversity in

3469
02:15:30,179 --> 02:15:37,500
so many different people Styles based

3470
02:15:32,399 --> 02:15:40,559
that made that awesome you know so

3471
02:15:37,500 --> 02:15:43,560
um yeah like that that was a cool cool

3472
02:15:40,560 --> 02:15:46,079
thing so yeah it's like it so it's not

3473
02:15:43,560 --> 02:15:48,659
surprising you know

3474
02:15:46,078 --> 02:15:50,759
um a lot of those guys probably like nah

3475
02:15:48,658 --> 02:15:53,039
I think I'm good I'll just hold on to my

3476
02:15:50,760 --> 02:15:55,020
[ __ ] or they're just not giving a [ __ ]

3477
02:15:53,039 --> 02:15:57,139
anymore it's just not what they do you

3478
02:15:55,020 --> 02:15:59,099
know that was a long time ago yeah

3479
02:15:57,139 --> 02:16:01,859
certainly

3480
02:15:59,099 --> 02:16:04,260
I mean sort of in that same vein I'm not

3481
02:16:01,859 --> 02:16:07,500
sure if you've seen But Todd McCormick

3482
02:16:04,260 --> 02:16:10,020
is selling what looks took realistically

3483
02:16:07,500 --> 02:16:12,060
be like real deal Northern Lights and

3484
02:16:10,020 --> 02:16:14,040
including the predecessors because he's

3485
02:16:12,060 --> 02:16:16,440
been able to strike up a relationship

3486
02:16:14,039 --> 02:16:19,260
with the guy who seems quite

3487
02:16:16,439 --> 02:16:22,259
legitimately verified as um well I know

3488
02:16:19,260 --> 02:16:24,719
and I'll uh Greg yeah and so I guess I'm

3489
02:16:22,260 --> 02:16:26,880
interested to know does that sort of

3490
02:16:24,719 --> 02:16:28,859
pique your curiosity at all given it

3491
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:30,900
does seem to be some reasonable proof

3492
02:16:28,859 --> 02:16:32,218
that it could be legit or not so much

3493
02:16:30,899 --> 02:16:34,859
absolutely

3494
02:16:32,218 --> 02:16:37,678
yeah yeah like because especially like

3495
02:16:34,859 --> 02:16:39,599
when it's you know like I got I don't

3496
02:16:37,679 --> 02:16:40,859
know I'm like you know personally or

3497
02:16:39,599 --> 02:16:43,920
anything but

3498
02:16:40,859 --> 02:16:46,380
you know he's a stand-up dude has a good

3499
02:16:43,920 --> 02:16:49,138
reputation of being a stand-up dude and

3500
02:16:46,379 --> 02:16:51,000
stand-up people deal with the guy like

3501
02:16:49,138 --> 02:16:53,039
you know that you know there's a

3502
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:54,718
reputation proceeds him you know so

3503
02:16:53,040 --> 02:16:57,059
there's that

3504
02:16:54,718 --> 02:17:00,299
um you know I know Greg you know like

3505
02:16:57,058 --> 02:17:03,179
that that's that's legit right so that

3506
02:17:00,299 --> 02:17:06,299
that tells me like you know hey for me

3507
02:17:03,179 --> 02:17:09,120
like that's a go for sure I would get it

3508
02:17:06,299 --> 02:17:10,978
I would grow it absolutely

3509
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:12,540
yeah no it's like I guess I was just

3510
02:17:10,978 --> 02:17:14,638
curious like particularly because he's

3511
02:17:12,540 --> 02:17:16,740
also selling like skunk and I was like

3512
02:17:14,638 --> 02:17:18,179
oh I wonder if that had caught your eye

3513
02:17:16,739 --> 02:17:21,299
either

3514
02:17:18,179 --> 02:17:23,579
I haven't I haven't got really it's been

3515
02:17:21,299 --> 02:17:25,138
so busy just answering all the DMS I'm

3516
02:17:23,579 --> 02:17:27,659
still answering once from almost two

3517
02:17:25,138 --> 02:17:30,779
weeks ago [ __ ] um

3518
02:17:27,659 --> 02:17:33,420
so yeah just catching up with people and

3519
02:17:30,780 --> 02:17:36,239
working on like some real new projects

3520
02:17:33,420 --> 02:17:39,540
like the soil line on the new line

3521
02:17:36,239 --> 02:17:41,519
other other little things

3522
02:17:39,540 --> 02:17:44,219
um it's been taken up a lot of time plus

3523
02:17:41,519 --> 02:17:45,540
doing the whole song and dance of here

3524
02:17:44,218 --> 02:17:49,138
so

3525
02:17:45,540 --> 02:17:52,439
um yeah man I'll definitely definitely

3526
02:17:49,138 --> 02:17:54,959
have to work it at all man

3527
02:17:52,439 --> 02:17:56,760
yeah look I I you know what I sort of

3528
02:17:54,959 --> 02:17:58,199
feel bad as a as I hear you say that

3529
02:17:56,760 --> 02:18:00,239
because I I understand where you're

3530
02:17:58,200 --> 02:18:01,939
coming from you probably probably still

3531
02:18:00,239 --> 02:18:05,159
figuring out what way is up and down

3532
02:18:01,939 --> 02:18:07,500
time to do that sort of stuff one of the

3533
02:18:05,159 --> 02:18:11,519
more lighthearted questions we got was

3534
02:18:07,500 --> 02:18:16,019
uh how much did you miss barbecue

3535
02:18:11,519 --> 02:18:18,420
a lot God so much like just raw food

3536
02:18:16,019 --> 02:18:22,380
this human food in general

3537
02:18:18,420 --> 02:18:25,739
funny is is greatly greatly missed you

3538
02:18:22,379 --> 02:18:29,239
know so uh yeah it's a good General man

3539
02:18:25,739 --> 02:18:29,239
but we have already especially

3540
02:18:29,340 --> 02:18:36,500
definitely a big one on the list very

3541
02:18:32,340 --> 02:18:36,500
barbecue deficient in my system now

3542
02:18:36,739 --> 02:18:42,000
so we had another person who was

3543
02:18:39,299 --> 02:18:44,638
wondering they sort of we're hoping to

3544
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:46,799
get some clarification on what exactly

3545
02:18:44,638 --> 02:18:48,718
skunk you were using and I think that

3546
02:18:46,799 --> 02:18:50,938
maybe what they're referring to is like

3547
02:18:48,718 --> 02:18:53,699
maybe sometimes it said basic skunk

3548
02:18:50,939 --> 02:18:55,139
sometimes it said skunk and are they the

3549
02:18:53,700 --> 02:18:57,240
same thing because I think if you look

3550
02:18:55,138 --> 02:18:59,819
online something says Basics Gunk is

3551
02:18:57,239 --> 02:19:01,319
like nl5 skunk or something but yeah

3552
02:18:59,819 --> 02:19:03,179
just hoping to get some clarification

3553
02:19:01,319 --> 02:19:05,099
around like what was it that you were

3554
02:19:03,179 --> 02:19:08,819
toying with exactly

3555
02:19:05,099 --> 02:19:11,760
yeah so like if if it was you know stump

3556
02:19:08,819 --> 02:19:14,939
one it was you know noted as noted as

3557
02:19:11,760 --> 02:19:15,920
comp one and it's just old DVC Club

3558
02:19:14,939 --> 02:19:20,219
Scott

3559
02:19:15,920 --> 02:19:21,599
they got Billy old uh building a link in

3560
02:19:20,218 --> 02:19:23,279
red

3561
02:19:21,599 --> 02:19:26,398
um they were the forces of course the

3562
02:19:23,280 --> 02:19:28,260
ears just maintaining it or whatever

3563
02:19:26,398 --> 02:19:29,939
um and then the basic side yeah it's

3564
02:19:28,260 --> 02:19:32,659
like you know skunk and I was going for

3565
02:19:29,939 --> 02:19:36,719
a Shiva Stone to uh you know you know

3566
02:19:32,659 --> 02:19:39,058
she was a nice time so that was a that

3567
02:19:36,718 --> 02:19:41,419
was a hybrid of totally totally

3568
02:19:39,058 --> 02:19:41,420
different different

3569
02:19:41,579 --> 02:19:44,760
ah okay yeah no that makes a lot of

3570
02:19:43,859 --> 02:19:48,300
sense

3571
02:19:44,760 --> 02:19:51,420
yeah more Indica in Florence you know uh

3572
02:19:48,299 --> 02:19:54,779
and more a little bit heavier on the era

3573
02:19:51,420 --> 02:19:58,260
on the narcotic you know side of things

3574
02:19:54,780 --> 02:19:59,880
yeah look in that same vein we had

3575
02:19:58,260 --> 02:20:01,800
received about three questions from

3576
02:19:59,879 --> 02:20:04,319
people who were just curious about

3577
02:20:01,799 --> 02:20:07,139
specifically one of the parents in the

3578
02:20:04,319 --> 02:20:08,398
Local H the Cuttlefish hash plant they

3579
02:20:07,139 --> 02:20:10,619
were just wondering if you could give us

3580
02:20:08,398 --> 02:20:12,539
any information on these there's even I

3581
02:20:10,620 --> 02:20:14,579
myself looked around very little info

3582
02:20:12,540 --> 02:20:17,220
about it online

3583
02:20:14,579 --> 02:20:20,100
oh yeah it wasn't and like when we had

3584
02:20:17,219 --> 02:20:21,898
this back in the days before the big you

3585
02:20:20,100 --> 02:20:24,479
know legal weed world and all that

3586
02:20:21,898 --> 02:20:27,180
really blown up and it was kind of a

3587
02:20:24,478 --> 02:20:28,978
tight tight little cut being held you

3588
02:20:27,180 --> 02:20:29,819
know back then

3589
02:20:28,978 --> 02:20:33,059
um

3590
02:20:29,819 --> 02:20:35,459
really really really strong [ __ ] uh

3591
02:20:33,059 --> 02:20:38,459
skunky nose on it

3592
02:20:35,459 --> 02:20:40,919
um nice fat fat [ __ ] buds

3593
02:20:38,459 --> 02:20:43,379
strong Branch like it you know it's it's

3594
02:20:40,920 --> 02:20:46,379
hard hard to beat

3595
02:20:43,379 --> 02:20:48,659
um and unfortunately like I don't know

3596
02:20:46,379 --> 02:20:51,659
that's that's not my not my possession

3597
02:20:48,659 --> 02:20:53,818
anymore you know so that you know the

3598
02:20:51,659 --> 02:20:56,100
closest thing I have any relationship is

3599
02:20:53,818 --> 02:20:57,959
the one thing that it's done and I don't

3600
02:20:56,100 --> 02:21:00,540
I don't know anybody that's got any more

3601
02:20:57,959 --> 02:21:03,299
than one dude that hooked it up you know

3602
02:21:00,540 --> 02:21:06,060
he's he's dead now so

3603
02:21:03,299 --> 02:21:08,340
um yeah I really couldn't tell you I'd

3604
02:21:06,059 --> 02:21:10,559
be surprised I ever ever see it again

3605
02:21:08,340 --> 02:21:13,139
but who knows he calls somebody's

3606
02:21:10,559 --> 02:21:16,559
holding on to it out there

3607
02:21:13,139 --> 02:21:19,019
yeah maybe but I mean like the Local H

3608
02:21:16,559 --> 02:21:20,340
it feels like that embodies some of the

3609
02:21:19,020 --> 02:21:21,540
characteristics I'd have to imagine

3610
02:21:20,340 --> 02:21:24,120
right

3611
02:21:21,540 --> 02:21:27,780
oh yeah absolutely it came out a lot a

3612
02:21:24,120 --> 02:21:30,359
lot on the smell and the effect you know

3613
02:21:27,780 --> 02:21:32,460
um and then having that that Sour Diesel

3614
02:21:30,359 --> 02:21:34,559
on the next two and just you know really

3615
02:21:32,459 --> 02:21:36,539
really brought all these good points

3616
02:21:34,559 --> 02:21:40,019
together like you you smoke local and

3617
02:21:36,540 --> 02:21:41,460
it's pure you know what I mean so uh you

3618
02:21:40,020 --> 02:21:44,399
kind of know what I'm what I'm talking

3619
02:21:41,459 --> 02:21:47,279
about some funky ass weed

3620
02:21:44,398 --> 02:21:50,279
oh yeah and even the local hybrids I've

3621
02:21:47,280 --> 02:21:53,040
tried are all killer like consistently

3622
02:21:50,280 --> 02:21:55,800
yeah yeah it was definitely uh

3623
02:21:53,040 --> 02:21:59,040
definitely just it's a good breeder too

3624
02:21:55,799 --> 02:22:01,559
and it's just non-chenic plant first day

3625
02:21:59,040 --> 02:22:04,080
great got about everything that you want

3626
02:22:01,559 --> 02:22:06,719
in it you know it's like a no-brainer to

3627
02:22:04,079 --> 02:22:08,760
uh you know toy around with a little bit

3628
02:22:06,719 --> 02:22:10,920
so you know let's see what happens you

3629
02:22:08,760 --> 02:22:13,500
know and then

3630
02:22:10,920 --> 02:22:16,020
Crystal winner

3631
02:22:13,500 --> 02:22:17,818
that's awesome that's awesome

3632
02:22:16,020 --> 02:22:19,079
so someone had a question about the

3633
02:22:17,818 --> 02:22:20,699
shine apple and it's interesting because

3634
02:22:19,079 --> 02:22:23,280
I'd sort of noticed some of these things

3635
02:22:20,700 --> 02:22:25,260
they raised myself but they say what

3636
02:22:23,280 --> 02:22:28,020
percentage approximately of the shine

3637
02:22:25,260 --> 02:22:29,760
Apple Finos have like that leaf mutation

3638
02:22:28,020 --> 02:22:32,520
where it's like just you know one or a

3639
02:22:29,760 --> 02:22:33,960
couple of leaves and specifically the

3640
02:22:32,520 --> 02:22:36,420
reason why they were asking is because

3641
02:22:33,959 --> 02:22:39,119
this person likes you know those sort of

3642
02:22:36,420 --> 02:22:40,799
mutant plants and we're just wondering

3643
02:22:39,120 --> 02:22:42,420
what's their chances how many packs

3644
02:22:40,799 --> 02:22:43,619
would they need to buy to be sort of

3645
02:22:42,420 --> 02:22:46,318
reasonably certain they might come

3646
02:22:43,620 --> 02:22:48,840
across one hey you found a freak in

3647
02:22:46,318 --> 02:22:50,398
every pack man that was definitely a

3648
02:22:48,840 --> 02:22:53,280
freaky one

3649
02:22:50,398 --> 02:22:56,639
oh really it was it was that sort of uh

3650
02:22:53,280 --> 02:22:58,800
high oh yeah oh for sure like it like

3651
02:22:56,639 --> 02:23:01,079
even in my testing phase like when

3652
02:22:58,799 --> 02:23:03,179
they're in bed I was like oh [ __ ] what

3653
02:23:01,079 --> 02:23:05,340
we got going on here it's like oh it's

3654
02:23:03,180 --> 02:23:08,040
gonna be really good or really bad so

3655
02:23:05,340 --> 02:23:12,000
let's uh let's see what goes goes down

3656
02:23:08,040 --> 02:23:13,800
here you know and uh yeah man came out

3657
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:16,500
came out killer but yeah definitely you

3658
02:23:13,799 --> 02:23:18,779
see a lot of freaks freaks in the mix

3659
02:23:16,500 --> 02:23:21,239
and how do you approach that

3660
02:23:18,780 --> 02:23:23,220
commercially as a breeder where you're

3661
02:23:21,239 --> 02:23:25,439
like look there's killer seed line but

3662
02:23:23,219 --> 02:23:27,119
there's some people who just might not

3663
02:23:25,439 --> 02:23:28,680
like they might just think oh it's a run

3664
02:23:27,120 --> 02:23:30,060
I've got to call it and like then and

3665
02:23:28,680 --> 02:23:31,739
you know what I mean they're sort of

3666
02:23:30,059 --> 02:23:33,719
preemptively doing things without

3667
02:23:31,739 --> 02:23:37,439
realizing do you have to consider that

3668
02:23:33,719 --> 02:23:39,599
or it's just irrelevant to you

3669
02:23:37,439 --> 02:23:42,079
I mean what you know whatever people who

3670
02:23:39,600 --> 02:23:44,939
are gonna do uh and ultimately

3671
02:23:42,079 --> 02:23:48,120
ultimately they're gonna do uh if they

3672
02:23:44,939 --> 02:23:50,460
see freaks or rods or anything and they

3673
02:23:48,120 --> 02:23:53,340
decide to call it it's like

3674
02:23:50,459 --> 02:23:56,039
that's generally I've always been a bad

3675
02:23:53,340 --> 02:23:59,219
move like most of the best plants I've

3676
02:23:56,040 --> 02:24:01,800
ever grown were a little bit slower

3677
02:23:59,219 --> 02:24:04,019
um a little bit freakish you know and

3678
02:24:01,799 --> 02:24:05,639
it's just I always figured like you know

3679
02:24:04,020 --> 02:24:07,680
ones that were a little slower is like

3680
02:24:05,639 --> 02:24:09,840
they were taking their energy it's going

3681
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:11,280
to go somewhere it's got that energy in

3682
02:24:09,840 --> 02:24:13,739
the plant that's going to be producing

3683
02:24:11,280 --> 02:24:17,280
something and obviously it's not biomass

3684
02:24:13,739 --> 02:24:19,920
and fast edging so wow I'm thinking uh

3685
02:24:17,280 --> 02:24:22,500
it's going to be later on in flower and

3686
02:24:19,920 --> 02:24:24,420
uh typically yeah it's always super off

3687
02:24:22,500 --> 02:24:26,280
the chart Frosty and stinky or something

3688
02:24:24,420 --> 02:24:27,180
you know like that energy went somewhere

3689
02:24:26,280 --> 02:24:29,700
just

3690
02:24:27,180 --> 02:24:32,520
you know like that like dog must be whiz

3691
02:24:29,700 --> 02:24:35,640
early like I should Frosty's spot steak

3692
02:24:32,520 --> 02:24:38,939
and as we really kill her the slowest

3693
02:24:35,639 --> 02:24:42,318
vegging thing I think I've ever grown

3694
02:24:38,939 --> 02:24:42,318
and definitely a mutant noise

3695
02:24:42,359 --> 02:24:49,260
yeah definitely well I was wondering

3696
02:24:45,420 --> 02:24:51,000
have you ever seen any other cuttings

3697
02:24:49,260 --> 02:24:53,398
where like when you do a certain

3698
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:56,000
combination you equally get these weird

3699
02:24:53,398 --> 02:24:56,000
mutants

3700
02:24:56,120 --> 02:25:01,500
yeah

3701
02:24:57,659 --> 02:25:03,840
um I used to always notice uh when I was

3702
02:25:01,500 --> 02:25:07,139
growing a lot of bogs work I would get a

3703
02:25:03,840 --> 02:25:09,780
lot of patio buds you know like little

3704
02:25:07,139 --> 02:25:10,920
weird things like that

3705
02:25:09,780 --> 02:25:12,600
um

3706
02:25:10,920 --> 02:25:14,639
there were certain other things I've

3707
02:25:12,600 --> 02:25:17,399
read like where I get like the flat the

3708
02:25:14,639 --> 02:25:19,920
flats down you know that's like you know

3709
02:25:17,398 --> 02:25:22,260
not rounded black

3710
02:25:19,920 --> 02:25:24,540
um weird Leaf mutation a little [ __ ]

3711
02:25:22,260 --> 02:25:26,579
like that you know I've always kind of

3712
02:25:24,540 --> 02:25:28,140
encountered it fairly fairly regularly

3713
02:25:26,579 --> 02:25:28,799
you know

3714
02:25:28,139 --> 02:25:31,199
um

3715
02:25:28,799 --> 02:25:33,299
and even like when you start growing out

3716
02:25:31,200 --> 02:25:35,640
larger larger numbers and [ __ ] yeah

3717
02:25:33,299 --> 02:25:37,500
you'll see a lot of little odd odd

3718
02:25:35,639 --> 02:25:39,199
little things you know

3719
02:25:37,500 --> 02:25:41,040
um yeah that's really interesting

3720
02:25:39,200 --> 02:25:44,000
interesting you'll have to make like

3721
02:25:41,040 --> 02:25:46,920
your own Ducks foot out of it yeah

3722
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:49,020
long term long term while we're on the

3723
02:25:46,920 --> 02:25:50,939
topic of cultivation I want to quickly

3724
02:25:49,020 --> 02:25:53,520
get this one out there earlier on you

3725
02:25:50,939 --> 02:25:55,260
mentioned with the purple Dahlia that um

3726
02:25:53,520 --> 02:25:58,020
you know you put the warning on the pack

3727
02:25:55,260 --> 02:26:00,120
saying you know this can can Herm and I

3728
02:25:58,020 --> 02:26:01,859
was reading about it and you're sort of

3729
02:26:00,120 --> 02:26:05,040
saying you know if you feed humic acid

3730
02:26:01,859 --> 02:26:07,380
with these G13 hash plant hybrids like

3731
02:26:05,040 --> 02:26:09,660
it can just sometimes happen and I guess

3732
02:26:07,379 --> 02:26:12,059
the question is well it doesn't like it

3733
02:26:09,659 --> 02:26:13,859
yeah like how long did it take you to

3734
02:26:12,059 --> 02:26:15,600
figure that out that seems like it would

3735
02:26:13,859 --> 02:26:17,720
have taken me like a lifetime to be like

3736
02:26:15,600 --> 02:26:20,880
it's the humic

3737
02:26:17,719 --> 02:26:21,478
nah not not one man

3738
02:26:20,879 --> 02:26:22,920
um

3739
02:26:21,478 --> 02:26:25,559
so

3740
02:26:22,920 --> 02:26:27,540
you know when when testing you know

3741
02:26:25,559 --> 02:26:28,920
as you know like you know I would I

3742
02:26:27,540 --> 02:26:31,859
would try to put things through the

3743
02:26:28,920 --> 02:26:33,299
ringer like go on purpose you know and

3744
02:26:31,859 --> 02:26:36,420
there were other things that I would I

3745
02:26:33,299 --> 02:26:38,699
would do where I'm like not feeding at

3746
02:26:36,420 --> 02:26:40,200
all you know just plain water just to

3747
02:26:38,700 --> 02:26:43,200
see what like are you still gonna get

3748
02:26:40,200 --> 02:26:46,680
the results of this straight up water

3749
02:26:43,200 --> 02:26:49,079
um and when when doing that the ones

3750
02:26:46,680 --> 02:26:51,059
that we're getting a feed with the uh

3751
02:26:49,079 --> 02:26:54,478
with the humic and everything certain

3752
02:26:51,059 --> 02:26:55,978
ones would pop up like hey what what are

3753
02:26:54,478 --> 02:26:57,358
you what are you doing there you know

3754
02:26:55,978 --> 02:26:59,818
and

3755
02:26:57,359 --> 02:27:01,680
you know one with the one with the plane

3756
02:26:59,818 --> 02:27:03,359
plain amount of water wasn't you know so

3757
02:27:01,680 --> 02:27:07,139
I'm like all right it's like the feeding

3758
02:27:03,359 --> 02:27:08,880
thing so let me uh let me back off on a

3759
02:27:07,139 --> 02:27:10,260
lot of things you know and I think I

3760
02:27:08,879 --> 02:27:11,938
just went

3761
02:27:10,260 --> 02:27:15,780
just straight up

3762
02:27:11,939 --> 02:27:17,760
dragonfly got flowers

3763
02:27:15,780 --> 02:27:19,859
and then I think I just made like a back

3764
02:27:17,760 --> 02:27:21,120
one of you some earthworm castings and

3765
02:27:19,859 --> 02:27:23,399
then it didn't happen

3766
02:27:21,120 --> 02:27:25,680
so I'm like all right so I doubt it's

3767
02:27:23,398 --> 02:27:27,840
just Allied water or you know anything

3768
02:27:25,680 --> 02:27:29,760
else that that might have might have

3769
02:27:27,840 --> 02:27:32,398
been hit with it I was like what about

3770
02:27:29,760 --> 02:27:35,219
the human so then I reintroduced hammock

3771
02:27:32,398 --> 02:27:36,920
and and boom that happened again so take

3772
02:27:35,219 --> 02:27:40,260
it away nothing

3773
02:27:36,920 --> 02:27:43,079
and not every single you know you know

3774
02:27:40,260 --> 02:27:45,180
but certain ones it did happen like that

3775
02:27:43,079 --> 02:27:48,299
when you do it does and you don't don't

3776
02:27:45,180 --> 02:27:51,479
mean like hey you know you know he makes

3777
02:27:48,299 --> 02:27:53,398
uh he makes doing it right here and I'm

3778
02:27:51,478 --> 02:27:53,959
discussing with the

3779
02:27:53,398 --> 02:27:57,239
the

3780
02:27:53,959 --> 02:27:59,639
more uptake of uh phosphorus at that

3781
02:27:57,239 --> 02:28:02,659
time and just it didn't like that you

3782
02:27:59,639 --> 02:28:04,680
know it just wasn't wasn't digging

3783
02:28:02,659 --> 02:28:06,478
interesting yeah I mean that's actually

3784
02:28:04,680 --> 02:28:08,280
it makes sense like you're able to sort

3785
02:28:06,478 --> 02:28:10,438
of systematically figure it out like

3786
02:28:08,280 --> 02:28:12,540
that I I like that a lot yeah because

3787
02:28:10,439 --> 02:28:14,398
you know I don't feed much you know it's

3788
02:28:12,540 --> 02:28:17,399
pretty pretty simple pretty simple

3789
02:28:14,398 --> 02:28:19,519
approach so it's not a whole whole lot

3790
02:28:17,398 --> 02:28:21,959
of things to really diagnose you know

3791
02:28:19,520 --> 02:28:24,239
yeah yeah now that that actually

3792
02:28:21,959 --> 02:28:26,039
simplifies quite a bit well we've just

3793
02:28:24,239 --> 02:28:28,139
got a few fan submitted questions before

3794
02:28:26,040 --> 02:28:30,060
we get into the final ones I kind of

3795
02:28:28,139 --> 02:28:31,099
like that it's a new thing man that

3796
02:28:30,059 --> 02:28:33,439
you're doing

3797
02:28:31,100 --> 02:28:35,818
fans

3798
02:28:33,439 --> 02:28:37,920
didn't have that before that I mean a

3799
02:28:35,818 --> 02:28:39,840
bit we'll go on from our buddy true

3800
02:28:37,920 --> 02:28:42,719
cannabis and he says what's your

3801
02:28:39,840 --> 02:28:44,219
favorite chem dog cutting and what's if

3802
02:28:42,719 --> 02:28:46,260
you had to give just one definitive

3803
02:28:44,219 --> 02:28:48,959
answer or what strain do you think was

3804
02:28:46,260 --> 02:28:51,139
the bud that the first chem seeds came

3805
02:28:48,959 --> 02:28:51,139
from

3806
02:28:51,620 --> 02:28:57,660
oh animals good good question so

3807
02:28:58,620 --> 02:29:03,120
and second one threw me off because I

3808
02:29:01,139 --> 02:29:05,099
don't know what I must say but um

3809
02:29:03,120 --> 02:29:06,600
what was the first question what's your

3810
02:29:05,100 --> 02:29:11,520
favorite

3811
02:29:06,600 --> 02:29:14,340
oh that's right uh 91 91 hands down

3812
02:29:11,520 --> 02:29:16,319
um that was uh that was nothing you know

3813
02:29:14,340 --> 02:29:20,700
to me I think it's the that's the best

3814
02:29:16,318 --> 02:29:22,739
one here here so on the Kim where do I

3815
02:29:20,700 --> 02:29:25,740
think it came from as far as like just a

3816
02:29:22,739 --> 02:29:28,199
mom or both parents if if he yeah just

3817
02:29:25,739 --> 02:29:31,398
the female what was the actual bud that

3818
02:29:28,200 --> 02:29:31,399
the seed came out of

3819
02:29:34,100 --> 02:29:41,340
good answer good answer and so uh the

3820
02:29:38,639 --> 02:29:43,559
next question uh what's your overall

3821
02:29:41,340 --> 02:29:44,520
all-time favorite strain

3822
02:29:43,559 --> 02:29:46,318
oh

3823
02:29:44,520 --> 02:29:49,140
[ __ ] up question

3824
02:29:46,318 --> 02:29:51,539
you're a monster

3825
02:29:49,139 --> 02:29:53,340
um and that's so impossible

3826
02:29:51,540 --> 02:29:55,319
you know that's such an impossible

3827
02:29:53,340 --> 02:29:59,600
because it depends on you know the time

3828
02:29:55,318 --> 02:29:59,600
of day and everything else oh man

3829
02:30:02,180 --> 02:30:05,880
all right how about I make it a bit

3830
02:30:04,439 --> 02:30:08,100
easier for you one of the final

3831
02:30:05,879 --> 02:30:10,318
questions we normally ask is if I'm

3832
02:30:08,100 --> 02:30:12,180
gonna drop you off on an island and you

3833
02:30:10,318 --> 02:30:13,379
can take three strains with you for the

3834
02:30:12,180 --> 02:30:15,420
rest of your life they can either be

3835
02:30:13,379 --> 02:30:19,938
clones or you can just take a pack of

3836
02:30:15,420 --> 02:30:19,939
the seeds what are you gonna take okay

3837
02:30:20,100 --> 02:30:24,300
[ __ ]

3838
02:30:21,359 --> 02:30:25,200
yeah real fast

3839
02:30:24,299 --> 02:30:29,179
um

3840
02:30:25,200 --> 02:30:34,260
I'm gonna say Local H Screaming Eagle

3841
02:30:29,180 --> 02:30:36,780
and 91. nice you got you got a lot of uh

3842
02:30:34,260 --> 02:30:39,898
different bases or maybe even

3843
02:30:36,780 --> 02:30:41,340
yeah like but yeah that that would I

3844
02:30:39,898 --> 02:30:44,279
think that would be good to go there

3845
02:30:41,340 --> 02:30:46,020
good and would you take just your clones

3846
02:30:44,280 --> 02:30:50,280
or would you take a pack of seeds of

3847
02:30:46,020 --> 02:30:52,500
each if I was taking uh Voodoo

3848
02:30:50,280 --> 02:30:55,079
definitely a pack Screaming Eagle it'll

3849
02:30:52,500 --> 02:30:57,659
take a pack of seeds just because you're

3850
02:30:55,079 --> 02:30:58,739
on a desert island like you know I don't

3851
02:30:57,659 --> 02:31:00,780
know what you got to do if you get

3852
02:30:58,739 --> 02:31:01,500
something to do it right

3853
02:31:00,780 --> 02:31:04,140
um

3854
02:31:01,500 --> 02:31:07,439
and yeah then if it was like 91 and

3855
02:31:04,139 --> 02:31:09,059
local it would just be good yeah yeah

3856
02:31:07,439 --> 02:31:10,200
okay so the next one this is an

3857
02:31:09,059 --> 02:31:12,059
interesting one that I've sort of been

3858
02:31:10,200 --> 02:31:14,700
wondering about myself do you have any

3859
02:31:12,059 --> 02:31:17,100
idea what's causing more and more weed

3860
02:31:14,700 --> 02:31:19,620
to have those tiny little premature

3861
02:31:17,100 --> 02:31:23,700
seeds in the calyxes

3862
02:31:19,620 --> 02:31:24,420
yeah so me and my a boy pig farmer

3863
02:31:23,700 --> 02:31:28,260
um

3864
02:31:24,420 --> 02:31:29,780
we had this talk back in life

3865
02:31:28,260 --> 02:31:33,180
it was like

3866
02:31:29,780 --> 02:31:35,340
2016 even and we call them like micro

3867
02:31:33,180 --> 02:31:36,359
beans you know

3868
02:31:35,340 --> 02:31:40,139
um

3869
02:31:36,359 --> 02:31:42,780
I I really went with

3870
02:31:40,139 --> 02:31:44,879
because it wasn't every genetic

3871
02:31:42,780 --> 02:31:46,140
you know what I mean there's a certain

3872
02:31:44,879 --> 02:31:48,059
thing

3873
02:31:46,139 --> 02:31:51,299
and

3874
02:31:48,059 --> 02:31:53,579
we were really really in like it's a

3875
02:31:51,299 --> 02:31:54,898
beating a feeding thing are we are we

3876
02:31:53,579 --> 02:31:56,939
pushing too hard

3877
02:31:54,898 --> 02:31:58,739
you know what I mean is that what is or

3878
02:31:56,939 --> 02:32:01,979
is it the actual thing that we are

3879
02:31:58,739 --> 02:32:04,559
feeding you know so we got the got to

3880
02:32:01,978 --> 02:32:05,938
thinking about that and what I came to

3881
02:32:04,559 --> 02:32:08,879
was like look

3882
02:32:05,939 --> 02:32:10,979
you grow your clone your way on the

3883
02:32:08,879 --> 02:32:12,179
regimen that you're doing and he was on

3884
02:32:10,978 --> 02:32:14,760
like a very

3885
02:32:12,180 --> 02:32:18,898
strict regimen you know he's he's a real

3886
02:32:14,760 --> 02:32:21,359
producer like that dude my God that [ __ ]

3887
02:32:18,898 --> 02:32:25,619
pump some [ __ ] butt out and I'm of

3888
02:32:21,359 --> 02:32:26,579
the highest highest quality you know so

3889
02:32:25,620 --> 02:32:28,620
um

3890
02:32:26,579 --> 02:32:30,659
I take the same stuff and I'm growing it

3891
02:32:28,620 --> 02:32:33,359
growing it on my on my own doing it

3892
02:32:30,659 --> 02:32:36,239
totally on my way and when I was doing

3893
02:32:33,359 --> 02:32:37,979
it I wasn't I wasn't getting up and he

3894
02:32:36,239 --> 02:32:40,619
still was

3895
02:32:37,978 --> 02:32:42,719
um same type of lighting right the same

3896
02:32:40,620 --> 02:32:45,420
same environmental so we could we could

3897
02:32:42,719 --> 02:32:48,119
scratch scratch that part

3898
02:32:45,420 --> 02:32:51,120
um but it's it's something to do with

3899
02:32:48,120 --> 02:32:54,899
the nutrient and I I guess I feel like

3900
02:32:51,120 --> 02:32:58,680
if it's not a very particular

3901
02:32:54,898 --> 02:33:00,358
ingredients and a nutrient that was in

3902
02:32:58,680 --> 02:33:01,920
their mind that wasn't you know

3903
02:33:00,359 --> 02:33:03,960
something I was doing

3904
02:33:01,920 --> 02:33:05,700
or it just came from just pushing too

3905
02:33:03,959 --> 02:33:07,559
hard because the weird thing was you

3906
02:33:05,700 --> 02:33:09,720
wouldn't see any bananas

3907
02:33:07,559 --> 02:33:12,119
you didn't see any herbs but you got

3908
02:33:09,719 --> 02:33:14,818
these little bastards would pop up from

3909
02:33:12,120 --> 02:33:17,160
something somewhere you know so and like

3910
02:33:14,818 --> 02:33:20,340
I said they never developed I don't like

3911
02:33:17,159 --> 02:33:22,739
your beans so that one still to say that

3912
02:33:20,340 --> 02:33:24,960
one would kind of elude me but it's

3913
02:33:22,739 --> 02:33:27,180
something something to do with either an

3914
02:33:24,959 --> 02:33:30,419
ingredient that you know certain people

3915
02:33:27,180 --> 02:33:32,520
have in a regimen that they're feeding

3916
02:33:30,420 --> 02:33:34,500
um or pushing hard so if you're if

3917
02:33:32,520 --> 02:33:36,420
you're that person and you know you're

3918
02:33:34,500 --> 02:33:37,079
not pushing hard

3919
02:33:36,420 --> 02:33:39,600
um

3920
02:33:37,079 --> 02:33:42,239
look look at look at what you are

3921
02:33:39,600 --> 02:33:45,000
feeding and then just try to

3922
02:33:42,239 --> 02:33:47,219
start pulling things out you know one at

3923
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:48,959
a time until you that you figure it

3924
02:33:47,219 --> 02:33:50,760
because if you figure it out then you

3925
02:33:48,959 --> 02:33:51,959
say well a lot of people a whole lot of

3926
02:33:50,760 --> 02:33:54,180
trouble you know

3927
02:33:51,959 --> 02:33:55,858
yeah I I hadn't actually thought of that

3928
02:33:54,180 --> 02:33:59,180
but that's that's a pretty reasonable

3929
02:33:55,859 --> 02:33:59,180
explanation isn't it

3930
02:33:59,780 --> 02:34:03,540
another question we got which is

3931
02:34:01,978 --> 02:34:05,699
actually something I would love to know

3932
02:34:03,540 --> 02:34:08,460
the answer to Is what is your preferred

3933
02:34:05,700 --> 02:34:12,240
way to collect pollen ideally to sort of

3934
02:34:08,459 --> 02:34:14,579
store so storing pollen is kind of kind

3935
02:34:12,239 --> 02:34:17,159
of kind of tricky

3936
02:34:14,579 --> 02:34:19,379
um long term I guess you know like when

3937
02:34:17,159 --> 02:34:22,020
I think storing I'm thinking like you're

3938
02:34:19,379 --> 02:34:23,459
putting it away for for a later date and

3939
02:34:22,020 --> 02:34:27,000
time

3940
02:34:23,459 --> 02:34:29,519
um the main key to it is

3941
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:31,079
when you're sifting it out like you

3942
02:34:29,520 --> 02:34:35,579
really got to sift that [ __ ] there

3943
02:34:31,079 --> 02:34:37,620
cannot be any any plant material at all

3944
02:34:35,579 --> 02:34:39,180
um preferably in a low humidity

3945
02:34:37,620 --> 02:34:41,100
environment you know that would be a

3946
02:34:39,180 --> 02:34:42,960
bonus because the your main enemy is

3947
02:34:41,100 --> 02:34:45,780
going to be moisture than the other day

3948
02:34:42,959 --> 02:34:48,059
that's going to sterilize it so

3949
02:34:45,780 --> 02:34:49,859
make sure that you got no plant material

3950
02:34:48,059 --> 02:34:51,239
in it

3951
02:34:49,859 --> 02:34:53,939
um because of course that plant there's

3952
02:34:51,239 --> 02:34:56,280
no moisture in it and you're [ __ ] and

3953
02:34:53,939 --> 02:34:58,200
then uh keep it away from moisture and

3954
02:34:56,280 --> 02:35:01,380
when you're putting it away

3955
02:34:58,200 --> 02:35:04,319
um and I'll make sure that it's

3956
02:35:01,379 --> 02:35:07,379
not not going to incur any any moisture

3957
02:35:04,318 --> 02:35:09,420
there either so very well sealed up to

3958
02:35:07,379 --> 02:35:11,398
where uh you're not rapidly changing

3959
02:35:09,420 --> 02:35:12,659
temperature because one thing I noticed

3960
02:35:11,398 --> 02:35:14,039
with a buddy put some away did

3961
02:35:12,659 --> 02:35:17,398
everything perfect

3962
02:35:14,040 --> 02:35:19,200
brings it right out of the freezer sets

3963
02:35:17,398 --> 02:35:20,879
it down on the table and he's just got

3964
02:35:19,200 --> 02:35:22,319
it got it in this little Rubbermaid

3965
02:35:20,879 --> 02:35:26,039
thingy

3966
02:35:22,318 --> 02:35:27,959
cuts off the FoodSaver bag it sits there

3967
02:35:26,040 --> 02:35:31,020
hey what happens when you get real cold

3968
02:35:27,959 --> 02:35:32,039
coming in through a warm warm area in a

3969
02:35:31,020 --> 02:35:34,399
condensation

3970
02:35:32,040 --> 02:35:39,380
nice [ __ ] kills it all

3971
02:35:34,398 --> 02:35:44,159
I know don't do that so um

3972
02:35:39,379 --> 02:35:46,139
my little tip of the day and huh

3973
02:35:44,159 --> 02:35:47,280
that's cool I just realized it'll be a

3974
02:35:46,139 --> 02:35:50,039
play on words

3975
02:35:47,280 --> 02:35:52,859
tip of the day you tip

3976
02:35:50,040 --> 02:35:55,620
so there's your Q-tip of the day

3977
02:35:52,859 --> 02:35:57,120
um collect pollen on a few tips like and

3978
02:35:55,620 --> 02:35:58,979
this is like you know for the small

3979
02:35:57,120 --> 02:36:01,020
batch like you're just making [ __ ] at

3980
02:35:58,978 --> 02:36:06,059
home just to see what's up not for

3981
02:36:01,020 --> 02:36:07,640
making a fun OC before yeah but I'm just

3982
02:36:06,059 --> 02:36:10,619
taking it

3983
02:36:07,639 --> 02:36:12,539
and getting two tips and getting them

3984
02:36:10,620 --> 02:36:14,100
all nice and covered and Hauling and put

3985
02:36:12,540 --> 02:36:16,500
them in bags seal them up and then put

3986
02:36:14,100 --> 02:36:19,079
them away for for a later time I could

3987
02:36:16,500 --> 02:36:21,299
take those out and uh pollinate you know

3988
02:36:19,079 --> 02:36:24,359
just single buds you know to get you

3989
02:36:21,299 --> 02:36:27,059
know 50 seats so you know so you can you

3990
02:36:24,359 --> 02:36:29,520
can do that for the hobbyist

3991
02:36:27,059 --> 02:36:32,239
um for the guys who are making uh [ __ ]

3992
02:36:29,520 --> 02:36:32,239
tons of seed

3993
02:36:35,299 --> 02:36:40,619
good answer good answer I tried to do it

3994
02:36:37,920 --> 02:36:42,478
in the past myself with flour and that

3995
02:36:40,620 --> 02:36:45,420
that is not a good method

3996
02:36:42,478 --> 02:36:47,398
I don't like that either man I'm like I

3997
02:36:45,420 --> 02:36:49,879
don't like to add anything to it you

3998
02:36:47,398 --> 02:36:51,779
know yeah yeah I think the flower like

3999
02:36:49,879 --> 02:36:54,779
sterilizes it and is maybe even

4000
02:36:51,780 --> 02:36:57,359
hydroscopic in itself but anyway this is

4001
02:36:54,780 --> 02:36:58,859
one that like it's almost redundant but

4002
02:36:57,359 --> 02:37:01,559
I feel like we have to ask at this point

4003
02:36:58,859 --> 02:37:03,840
do you think that we're ever gonna get

4004
02:37:01,559 --> 02:37:05,340
like a roadkill skunk that comes out to

4005
02:37:03,840 --> 02:37:06,780
the community or do you think we're

4006
02:37:05,340 --> 02:37:09,540
going to recreate it or do you think

4007
02:37:06,780 --> 02:37:10,680
it's just maybe not entirely what we

4008
02:37:09,540 --> 02:37:14,280
remember

4009
02:37:10,680 --> 02:37:16,680
no I think I think that a lot of times

4010
02:37:14,280 --> 02:37:19,020
people will have some

4011
02:37:16,680 --> 02:37:21,960
some really skunky weed and like I hate

4012
02:37:19,020 --> 02:37:22,800
the word or the term red kill skunk you

4013
02:37:21,959 --> 02:37:25,079
know

4014
02:37:22,799 --> 02:37:28,079
um just from all the [ __ ] that goes on

4015
02:37:25,079 --> 02:37:31,379
with it from that especially like that

4016
02:37:28,079 --> 02:37:34,020
one guy anyway so

4017
02:37:31,379 --> 02:37:36,420
um I think a lot of people don't really

4018
02:37:34,020 --> 02:37:38,159
hit the genetic potential on a lot of

4019
02:37:36,420 --> 02:37:40,620
their growing

4020
02:37:38,159 --> 02:37:42,898
um certain plants are more forgiving and

4021
02:37:40,620 --> 02:37:46,560
the terpenoid range like

4022
02:37:42,898 --> 02:37:48,180
you know durbins and cookies Jack hairs

4023
02:37:46,559 --> 02:37:50,100
and a lot of things it just doesn't

4024
02:37:48,180 --> 02:37:52,620
matter at all the smell always comes out

4025
02:37:50,100 --> 02:37:54,960
there's a lot of things you really gotta

4026
02:37:52,620 --> 02:37:57,240
nail it man and you're not going to see

4027
02:37:54,959 --> 02:37:59,398
a whole lot of that outside of Organics

4028
02:37:57,239 --> 02:38:01,439
that are done like really really Primo

4029
02:37:59,398 --> 02:38:03,539
so I think a lot of times people get the

4030
02:38:01,439 --> 02:38:06,059
stuff and they they don't hit the uh

4031
02:38:03,540 --> 02:38:09,660
they don't hit the marks and they they

4032
02:38:06,059 --> 02:38:10,260
add it they just didn't quite get it

4033
02:38:09,659 --> 02:38:13,260
um

4034
02:38:10,260 --> 02:38:15,659
I do believe that yeah somebody somebody

4035
02:38:13,260 --> 02:38:18,180
could definitely put it out there you

4036
02:38:15,659 --> 02:38:21,359
know and work it take you know years of

4037
02:38:18,180 --> 02:38:24,300
work and put it into a seed form and you

4038
02:38:21,359 --> 02:38:27,059
know have everybody ran Rave try to rip

4039
02:38:24,299 --> 02:38:29,279
it off and you know act like [ __ ]

4040
02:38:27,059 --> 02:38:32,279
[ __ ] about it

4041
02:38:29,280 --> 02:38:34,020
um but you know that that's gonna take a

4042
02:38:32,280 --> 02:38:35,180
special type of person who wants to do

4043
02:38:34,020 --> 02:38:39,600
all that

4044
02:38:35,180 --> 02:38:42,659
and uh that ain't gonna be me thank you

4045
02:38:39,600 --> 02:38:44,818
so so yeah I mean it's it's there it's

4046
02:38:42,659 --> 02:38:47,760
there to be worked it's just you know

4047
02:38:44,818 --> 02:38:49,619
somebody somebody's gonna have to put in

4048
02:38:47,760 --> 02:38:51,300
the work to do it and decide what

4049
02:38:49,620 --> 02:38:52,500
they're going to do at the end of The

4050
02:38:51,299 --> 02:38:53,340
Journey if they're going to put it out

4051
02:38:52,500 --> 02:38:55,620
there

4052
02:38:53,340 --> 02:38:57,960
just hang on to it be happy it's kind of

4053
02:38:55,620 --> 02:39:00,540
kind of preserved you know but there's

4054
02:38:57,959 --> 02:39:02,639
just so many things that could be you

4055
02:39:00,540 --> 02:39:04,260
know skunky weed you know it doesn't

4056
02:39:02,639 --> 02:39:05,939
have to be like you know it's not a pure

4057
02:39:04,260 --> 02:39:08,639
skunk variety or anything like that

4058
02:39:05,939 --> 02:39:11,280
there's a lot of you know Afghan hybrids

4059
02:39:08,639 --> 02:39:13,559
Ash plant hybrids and

4060
02:39:11,280 --> 02:39:15,300
all types of stuff they can give them

4061
02:39:13,559 --> 02:39:17,459
the desired fact at the end of the day

4062
02:39:15,299 --> 02:39:19,739
but then ultimately it's going to be up

4063
02:39:17,459 --> 02:39:23,039
to the grower to you know do their thing

4064
02:39:19,739 --> 02:39:25,199
and grow it because back when yeah I

4065
02:39:23,040 --> 02:39:28,260
lost skunk you eat you know people grew

4066
02:39:25,200 --> 02:39:29,700
up a little bit differently too so

4067
02:39:28,260 --> 02:39:31,800
um you know I think there's a lot of

4068
02:39:29,700 --> 02:39:34,140
inputs that people don't don't use

4069
02:39:31,799 --> 02:39:36,840
nowadays that we're being being used

4070
02:39:34,139 --> 02:39:39,420
back then and people miss out on a lot

4071
02:39:36,840 --> 02:39:41,659
of that stuff too uh it's just doesn't

4072
02:39:39,420 --> 02:39:41,659
matter

4073
02:39:41,760 --> 02:39:45,478
yeah that's an interesting take I

4074
02:39:43,799 --> 02:39:48,179
definitely think that the style in which

4075
02:39:45,478 --> 02:39:50,818
we grow Now versus then has something to

4076
02:39:48,180 --> 02:39:53,340
do with it for sure but that brings us

4077
02:39:50,818 --> 02:39:55,379
on to the final quick fire questions and

4078
02:39:53,340 --> 02:39:56,460
I'm gonna have to word this one I'm

4079
02:39:55,379 --> 02:39:59,039
gonna have to think a little bit about

4080
02:39:56,459 --> 02:40:01,919
how I word it but basically I'm

4081
02:39:59,040 --> 02:40:05,280
wondering if there were theoretically

4082
02:40:01,920 --> 02:40:08,760
people in jail who did smoke weed

4083
02:40:05,280 --> 02:40:11,239
was there a particular experience that

4084
02:40:08,760 --> 02:40:12,719
people thought was quite memorable

4085
02:40:11,239 --> 02:40:14,939
[Applause]

4086
02:40:12,719 --> 02:40:18,539
yeah so

4087
02:40:14,939 --> 02:40:20,818
I kind of I got a story about a friend

4088
02:40:18,540 --> 02:40:23,120
and a legend friend she might have

4089
02:40:20,818 --> 02:40:27,840
allegedly got that right

4090
02:40:23,120 --> 02:40:30,060
and instantly he's like oh man because

4091
02:40:27,840 --> 02:40:32,460
like by the way they pissed us back

4092
02:40:30,059 --> 02:40:34,559
so just you know like it could it could

4093
02:40:32,459 --> 02:40:39,358
get hit randomly if you you just dirty

4094
02:40:34,559 --> 02:40:42,000
like it's a very bad thing so all the

4095
02:40:39,359 --> 02:40:43,739
time he's like hey man okay all right

4096
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:46,139
you think I'm good you think I'm all

4097
02:40:43,739 --> 02:40:48,780
right you think I'm fine oh no dude

4098
02:40:46,139 --> 02:40:51,779
you're [ __ ] yeah you know like they're

4099
02:40:48,780 --> 02:40:53,720
gonna say oh man damn I mean this is

4100
02:40:51,780 --> 02:40:57,060
like within an hour his eyes are already

4101
02:40:53,719 --> 02:40:58,260
oh man like should I just drink a bunch

4102
02:40:57,059 --> 02:41:00,779
of water what should I do they just

4103
02:40:58,260 --> 02:41:03,600
total [ __ ] paranoia and this goes on

4104
02:41:00,780 --> 02:41:05,880
for weeks like I mean you think I'm okay

4105
02:41:03,600 --> 02:41:07,260
by now like I'm you know and I'm like

4106
02:41:05,879 --> 02:41:10,500
yeah mine's effect well I'm not really

4107
02:41:07,260 --> 02:41:12,120
fat I'm saying I don't know man I don't

4108
02:41:10,500 --> 02:41:14,459
know a couple pounds

4109
02:41:12,120 --> 02:41:16,140
I don't know man it's pretty iffy off

4110
02:41:14,459 --> 02:41:18,839
man oh you think they're gonna call me

4111
02:41:16,139 --> 02:41:21,959
uh it dude and I enjoyed [ __ ] with

4112
02:41:18,840 --> 02:41:24,600
them every [ __ ] day because I passed

4113
02:41:21,959 --> 02:41:27,478
on the on the opportunity allegedly

4114
02:41:24,600 --> 02:41:30,540
if that ever happened and

4115
02:41:27,478 --> 02:41:32,639
um and for for that reason because I

4116
02:41:30,540 --> 02:41:34,859
know that that would be this is probably

4117
02:41:32,639 --> 02:41:37,760
the worst thing to [ __ ] do like it'd

4118
02:41:34,859 --> 02:41:40,500
be great it's been on the same token man

4119
02:41:37,760 --> 02:41:43,079
or where you would instantly regret it

4120
02:41:40,500 --> 02:41:46,139
from the exhale it would not be

4121
02:41:43,079 --> 02:41:48,600
enjoyable at all you know for sure man

4122
02:41:46,139 --> 02:41:52,318
that's that's an interesting one I hope

4123
02:41:48,600 --> 02:41:55,260
uh your friend was it was all good

4124
02:41:52,318 --> 02:41:56,779
oh yeah yeah allegedly he was he was

4125
02:41:55,260 --> 02:42:00,659
fine

4126
02:41:56,780 --> 02:42:03,420
yeah it was all he walked in so the next

4127
02:42:00,659 --> 02:42:06,260
question is what's the one cutting you

4128
02:42:03,420 --> 02:42:06,260
missed the most

4129
02:42:06,659 --> 02:42:11,879
um like currently in this in this moment

4130
02:42:09,299 --> 02:42:14,699
if I had one just rock it out real quick

4131
02:42:11,879 --> 02:42:16,500
well like just overall something you had

4132
02:42:14,700 --> 02:42:18,120
at some point in the past that just

4133
02:42:16,500 --> 02:42:21,359
isn't around anymore and you're like man

4134
02:42:18,120 --> 02:42:23,340
I missed that that cuttlefish was a

4135
02:42:21,359 --> 02:42:25,559
pretty big pretty big hit and we were

4136
02:42:23,340 --> 02:42:27,540
already talking about it earlier so

4137
02:42:25,559 --> 02:42:31,260
you know

4138
02:42:27,540 --> 02:42:35,580
that's that's definitely

4139
02:42:31,260 --> 02:42:37,260
definitely that one and I had a uh had a

4140
02:42:35,579 --> 02:42:40,739
female

4141
02:42:37,260 --> 02:42:42,898
um out of a sour IBL

4142
02:42:40,739 --> 02:42:45,199
um from back in the day that was like

4143
02:42:42,898 --> 02:42:50,478
way better than the original original

4144
02:42:45,200 --> 02:42:53,520
sour and uh I missed that one a lot yeah

4145
02:42:50,478 --> 02:42:56,579
it was awesome

4146
02:42:53,520 --> 02:42:58,680
yeah good one to pick Ubuntu pick

4147
02:42:56,579 --> 02:43:01,978
so the next question is

4148
02:42:58,680 --> 02:43:04,200
is there a question that you wish you

4149
02:43:01,978 --> 02:43:06,000
could ask one of the other breeders out

4150
02:43:04,200 --> 02:43:08,659
there alive or dead

4151
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:08,659
oh

4152
02:43:10,500 --> 02:43:16,859
I would probably if I had the

4153
02:43:14,459 --> 02:43:19,500
if I had to pick one

4154
02:43:16,859 --> 02:43:22,079
I'll pick somebody who's no longer with

4155
02:43:19,500 --> 02:43:24,719
us because they're alive so I still got

4156
02:43:22,079 --> 02:43:25,500
that chance you know

4157
02:43:24,719 --> 02:43:27,599
um

4158
02:43:25,500 --> 02:43:29,760
and there's a lot of dudes you know

4159
02:43:27,600 --> 02:43:31,140
alive I'd still like this ticket with

4160
02:43:29,760 --> 02:43:33,960
and just

4161
02:43:31,139 --> 02:43:36,180
you know talk to like I know shiny

4162
02:43:33,959 --> 02:43:37,379
bottles always want to always kind of

4163
02:43:36,180 --> 02:43:39,659
wanted to

4164
02:43:37,379 --> 02:43:42,839
I was picked as pick his brain a little

4165
02:43:39,659 --> 02:43:45,659
bit he's a good one no it was a few but

4166
02:43:42,840 --> 02:43:48,239
probably have to go for another one to

4167
02:43:45,659 --> 02:43:50,398
sit down behind I'd have a lot of a lot

4168
02:43:48,239 --> 02:43:52,260
of questions too because he got to see

4169
02:43:50,398 --> 02:43:54,539
so many things growing on such a large

4170
02:43:52,260 --> 02:43:55,318
scale back then

4171
02:43:54,540 --> 02:43:57,660
um

4172
02:43:55,318 --> 02:43:59,760
and be you know asking about all types

4173
02:43:57,659 --> 02:44:01,799
of little little traits you know that

4174
02:43:59,760 --> 02:44:04,139
that he was picking on

4175
02:44:01,799 --> 02:44:06,358
in these large populations that led him

4176
02:44:04,139 --> 02:44:08,039
to do what he did because they were they

4177
02:44:06,359 --> 02:44:11,159
were truly starting from

4178
02:44:08,040 --> 02:44:13,439
very very swaggy Beginnings man and to

4179
02:44:11,159 --> 02:44:15,318
see the work that he ended up with at

4180
02:44:13,439 --> 02:44:18,359
the at the end that was being released

4181
02:44:15,318 --> 02:44:20,340
[ __ ] amazing those guys were really

4182
02:44:18,359 --> 02:44:23,520
[ __ ] doing it man

4183
02:44:20,340 --> 02:44:26,939
you know yeah so yeah that that would be

4184
02:44:23,520 --> 02:44:28,739
one my one probably

4185
02:44:26,939 --> 02:44:31,439
brilliant answer brilliant answer I'd

4186
02:44:28,739 --> 02:44:34,500
probably have to likewise do the same

4187
02:44:31,439 --> 02:44:37,380
second last question what's the most

4188
02:44:34,500 --> 02:44:39,180
disappointing weed experience you ever

4189
02:44:37,379 --> 02:44:43,339
had so maybe it's like something that

4190
02:44:39,180 --> 02:44:43,340
was really hyped and just fell short

4191
02:44:44,639 --> 02:44:48,260
um

4192
02:44:44,809 --> 02:44:52,199
[Laughter]

4193
02:44:48,260 --> 02:44:54,000
oh man that's a dangerous question

4194
02:44:52,200 --> 02:44:57,560
um

4195
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:57,559
there have been so many

4196
02:44:57,840 --> 02:44:59,960
um

4197
02:45:04,859 --> 02:45:09,239
yeah

4198
02:45:05,780 --> 02:45:11,040
I don't think I could say just just one

4199
02:45:09,239 --> 02:45:13,500
I'm thinking like things that I've I've

4200
02:45:11,040 --> 02:45:15,680
learned personally but

4201
02:45:13,500 --> 02:45:15,680
um

4202
02:45:17,398 --> 02:45:21,898
probably say like you've been with me

4203
02:45:20,159 --> 02:45:24,959
you've been with me at the shows before

4204
02:45:21,898 --> 02:45:27,478
yeah so can you remember people like

4205
02:45:24,959 --> 02:45:29,699
just bringing it bringing random Buds

4206
02:45:27,478 --> 02:45:33,119
and everything else yeah

4207
02:45:29,700 --> 02:45:35,640
um there's a lot of [ __ ] up bud that

4208
02:45:33,120 --> 02:45:37,740
would come our way yeah it's not taking

4209
02:45:35,639 --> 02:45:40,199
this out and telling me yeah

4210
02:45:37,739 --> 02:45:42,059
don't feed coping off after the whole

4211
02:45:40,200 --> 02:45:44,100
cycle you're [ __ ] yourself up here

4212
02:45:42,059 --> 02:45:45,478
and then laterally come back and be like

4213
02:45:44,100 --> 02:45:48,239
wow I made all the difference in the

4214
02:45:45,478 --> 02:45:48,959
world like yeah for sure

4215
02:45:48,239 --> 02:45:51,478
um

4216
02:45:48,959 --> 02:45:54,599
and sometimes these stuffed with powdery

4217
02:45:51,478 --> 02:45:55,619
mildew on it and everything

4218
02:45:54,600 --> 02:45:57,780
um

4219
02:45:55,620 --> 02:45:58,920
I guess

4220
02:45:57,780 --> 02:46:01,260
man

4221
02:45:58,920 --> 02:46:03,659
I don't even want to say it because oh I

4222
02:46:01,260 --> 02:46:08,398
used to hate her you know because

4223
02:46:03,659 --> 02:46:10,859
it wasn't even the real so like back in

4224
02:46:08,398 --> 02:46:12,719
the day like I got turned on to like to

4225
02:46:10,859 --> 02:46:15,239
smoke some cookies that was like the

4226
02:46:12,719 --> 02:46:18,119
real the real legit cut I like that like

4227
02:46:15,239 --> 02:46:20,939
that was pretty good but it was like

4228
02:46:18,120 --> 02:46:23,880
some of the offshoots or the knockoffs

4229
02:46:20,939 --> 02:46:25,500
is like wow this is just you just get

4230
02:46:23,879 --> 02:46:27,839
kind of like a little buzz for a few

4231
02:46:25,500 --> 02:46:30,659
minutes when it's gone you know tastes

4232
02:46:27,840 --> 02:46:33,059
good but it's just nothing no sustenance

4233
02:46:30,659 --> 02:46:34,500
do it man it's just not not doing

4234
02:46:33,059 --> 02:46:36,659
anything and like

4235
02:46:34,500 --> 02:46:39,120
when you hear the person with this guy

4236
02:46:36,659 --> 02:46:42,659
just raving about it you know and we're

4237
02:46:39,120 --> 02:46:46,079
just like ah I don't know man that real

4238
02:46:42,659 --> 02:46:47,780
one was you know kind of kind of kind of

4239
02:46:46,079 --> 02:46:51,059
what's up you know but

4240
02:46:47,780 --> 02:46:53,880
I was let down by a lot of the a lot of

4241
02:46:51,059 --> 02:46:56,818
the hybrids and [ __ ] like that

4242
02:46:53,879 --> 02:46:58,619
yeah look certainly not a sentiment new

4243
02:46:56,818 --> 02:47:01,139
to us we've heard that before for sure

4244
02:46:58,620 --> 02:47:03,420
and there's like a few of them that

4245
02:47:01,139 --> 02:47:05,279
stood out like really good like exotic

4246
02:47:03,420 --> 02:47:06,478
Mike had that cookies and cream that was

4247
02:47:05,280 --> 02:47:07,920
like really good

4248
02:47:06,478 --> 02:47:09,358
you know

4249
02:47:07,920 --> 02:47:11,939
um there were like a few that stood out

4250
02:47:09,359 --> 02:47:13,260
I was like wow that's actually good

4251
02:47:11,939 --> 02:47:15,300
um but yeah a lot of them and they're

4252
02:47:13,260 --> 02:47:19,079
just like yeah whatever

4253
02:47:15,299 --> 02:47:21,119
yeah yeah I think everyone's grown out

4254
02:47:19,079 --> 02:47:22,859
of cookie hybrid before and usually

4255
02:47:21,120 --> 02:47:24,780
you'll find some weird mutant in there

4256
02:47:22,859 --> 02:47:28,280
that just totally fails and you're like

4257
02:47:24,780 --> 02:47:28,280
okay okay we're done here

4258
02:47:30,840 --> 02:47:37,318
so our final question for this one

4259
02:47:33,359 --> 02:47:39,540
if you had to pick one genetic or strain

4260
02:47:37,318 --> 02:47:41,639
that's just gonna be erased from

4261
02:47:39,540 --> 02:47:43,040
existence and all the Prodigy from it

4262
02:47:41,639 --> 02:47:46,379
are gone

4263
02:47:43,040 --> 02:47:50,000
which one you're gonna do

4264
02:47:46,379 --> 02:47:50,000
oh my God

4265
02:47:50,100 --> 02:47:56,960
um I'm gonna I'm gonna answer this

4266
02:47:53,159 --> 02:47:58,139
and everybody's like oh yeah no

4267
02:47:56,959 --> 02:48:01,199
[Music]

4268
02:47:58,139 --> 02:48:03,358
I'm gonna take out pieces all right I'm

4269
02:48:01,200 --> 02:48:06,120
gonna take out the [ __ ] beasters the

4270
02:48:03,359 --> 02:48:08,818
top 44 or whatever I'm gonna call it the

4271
02:48:06,120 --> 02:48:10,920
Viking that [ __ ] clone

4272
02:48:08,818 --> 02:48:13,739
and the beasters yeah that needs to be

4273
02:48:10,920 --> 02:48:15,478
striking stricken from uh from existence

4274
02:48:13,739 --> 02:48:18,559
for sure but yeah

4275
02:48:15,478 --> 02:48:21,539
that that was that was a bad heavy

4276
02:48:18,559 --> 02:48:24,059
non-resonated shitty buds yeah it's long

4277
02:48:21,540 --> 02:48:27,000
for way too much money across college

4278
02:48:24,059 --> 02:48:28,100
campuses and heady boys you know like

4279
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:31,680

4281
02:48:31,680 --> 02:48:36,300

in the glassy cinnamon outer space

4289
02:48:47,959 --> 02:48:52,398
that's when the beasters needs to go
