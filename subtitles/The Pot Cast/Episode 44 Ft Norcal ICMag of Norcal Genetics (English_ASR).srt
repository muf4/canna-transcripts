00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:53,039
uh like uh pretty much right now that

46
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,719
the newest thing is gonna be the og kbx2

47
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,320
and then i'm waiting on these uh

48
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,239
these new apple fritter crosses to come

49
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:01,199
out um but i mean they're they're still

50
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:03,199
a little ways away but uh the og kbx2 is

51
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,920
is basically uh

52
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,360
the og kb cross to a blueberry headband

53
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,878
and so uh like it's i mean it's

54
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,440
i definitely like it it has a lot more

55
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:16,000
vigor and it's uh it's it's it's not as

56
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,520
stony as the og kb the original one but

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,919
it's uh it's it's you know it's

58
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,360
definitely like more of a like a

59
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,280
a plant that you

60
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,640
you know you'd rather grow than the og

61
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,719
because og keep is kind of a pain in the

62
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:29,039
ass

63
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:31,039
for sure i mean just on a personal note

64
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,639
i'm curious what's the flavor on that

65
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:33,759
one like because i hear a lot about it

66
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:35,518
but i've never been able to try it

67
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:37,199
myself

68
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,120
yeah i mean i literally just finished

69
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,878
flowering it out which is when i saw you

70
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,640
i think of the emerald cup um that was

71
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:44,399
the first batch i had i mean there's

72
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:46,639
still some dialing in to be done

73
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,159
um but i mean it's a very like blueberry

74
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,799
dominant and so i kind of want to

75
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:52,400
further like work the line but it's just

76
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,480
um it's just a matter of getting the

77
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,719
time to do it but uh me and compound

78
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:58,399
genetics are actually uh i gave him the

79
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,800
cut so he's gonna be crossing it i want

80
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,800
to say it says like jet fuel gelato or

81
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,319
uh like some of his mails that he has

82
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,599
and so you know that's going to be very

83
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:07,679
interesting to see as far as like you

84
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:09,679
know that's uh like as far as what comes

85
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,680
about from that

86
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,000
yeah for sure i've seen some really nice

87
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,640
stuff come from that jet fuel gelato no

88
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,800
questions but just to divert back you

89
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:20,399
mentioned some apple fritter crosses i'm

90
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,040
always keen to hear about apple fritter

91
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,719
what can you tell me about it

92
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:26,959
i mean it was just a cut that i got from

93
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,959
my homies in la um i mean it's

94
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,680
definitely like you know i it's it's

95
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,519
it's uh apple fritters it's a very nice

96
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,120
cut i like it a lot you know i just

97
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,680
happened across it because i hit it with

98
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,640
like some palm that i got from my homie

99
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,439
um like always be flowering genetics and

100
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:45,119
uh like also my like uh i had some

101
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,400
purple pollen as well

102
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,759
um from

103
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,920
like csi like humble basically he

104
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:54,000
he i had some males from one of the

105
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,719
breedings that he did and um and you

106
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,840
know like i i utilized that pollen uh so

107
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:00,239
it's kind of like it was like an open

108
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,200
pollination and so um it's it's gonna be

109
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,480
interesting to see what comes out of

110
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,919
that right now i'm like i'm sexing all

111
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:07,438
those seeds like right now so

112
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:09,438
that's cool and are you looking to

113
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:11,680
preserve the apple flavor because i

114
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:14,000
often hear people debate about whether

115
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,438
the apple flavor really even is apple

116
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,279
like it's kind of a roundabout but it's

117
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:20,079
not super on do you want to keep that or

118
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,599
refine it or what's your plan

119
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,240
i mean i'd like to cross it i have some

120
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,000
blueberry f7s from dj short that i like

121
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,918
once i get a chance to have like a

122
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,478
little bit of time to uh to you know

123
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:32,719
fully like focus myself on that on that

124
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:34,959
work um i'll you know i'll crack them

125
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,280
and germinate them and and then utilize

126
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:39,918
those for to cross to that and see where

127
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:41,758
we get you know so it's um you know uh

128
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:43,519
besides that also i want to hit it back

129
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,680
to the og kb as well

130
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:46,959
uh you know so we'll see where it all

131
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,160
where it all ends up at but for the

132
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:49,918
meantime they're all just kind of in the

133
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,800
vault as far as this uh holding on to

134
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:54,959
them the the no seeds

135
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,560
and that's cool i'm definitely keen to

136
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:58,159
see what pans out with that and i've got

137
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,879
to ask the question

138
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,960
do you have any kind of fond memories of

139
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,639
any of the older dj short work like you

140
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:06,079
know everyone like has one thing where

141
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,840
like you know i used to get this really

142
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:09,439
good flow or i used to get this really

143
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:11,839
good blueberry do you have one of those

144
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:11,839
stories

145
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,439
uh i mean

146
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:17,439
it's the the only time that i would have

147
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:20,399
ever had access to like uh dj shorts

148
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:23,680
genetics uh uh like i never bought any

149
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:24,959
like uh you know like um from overseas

150
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,720
when

151
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,719
when we were buying stuff on on like

152
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,720
seed bay or breed bay or whatever

153
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,000
um but uh like it would it would have

154
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,160
been in amsterdam i was in amsterdam in

155
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,839
like 2006. they had like a couple

156
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,199
different phenotypes of like it's

157
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:40,239
blueberry there was a i think it's a lsd

158
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,160
uh

159
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,439
i i can't think about the strains off

160
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,600
the top of my head to be honest like if

161
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:48,240
i actually have his book was it

162
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,240
skywalker

163
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,079
no no it wasn't like skywalker came way

164
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,319
after after all of that like it's there

165
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:55,839
was an lsd i want to say it was one of

166
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,879
the strains he had uh the original

167
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:00,719
blueberry is one thing um i think there

168
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,879
there was a there's a few other ones

169
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,479
that he was pretty well known for um

170
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:07,120
like i said i have his book

171
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:07,839
here but um i mean we'll actually know

172
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,000
so

173
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:12,000
somebody actually took the goddamn book

174
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,759
so i don't have to be but the the

175
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,759
straight names would be in there but i

176
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,000
remember going to like barney's and uh

177
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,919
and and i think that the bulldog

178
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,319
in uh in amsterdam and they had a bunch

179
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:23,758
of stuff but this is in 2006. so a lot

180
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,400
of those lines have probably been

181
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:29,360
reworked or um or just are not even like

182
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:31,599
a like around anymore so

183
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,080
yeah yeah and i know that

184
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,600
he kind of stopped formally working with

185
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:37,279
them and then at that point i think they

186
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,520
started popping seeds to find new

187
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:41,038
parents and stuff like that

188
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:44,000
yeah yeah i mean now with like tissue

189
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:45,759
culture uh like being more prevalent i

190
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,120
it's definitely a lot easier to preserve

191
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,720
like genetics for like a longer period

192
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,319
of time but i mean it's really hard to

193
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,120
keep a plan alive for you know like i

194
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,919
said

195
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,598
like 15-20 years so

196
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:58,399
yeah okay well i love to ask people this

197
00:06:55,598 --> 00:07:02,120
question what's the oldest clone that

198
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:02,120
you're aware of

199
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,680
man honestly like to me like me still

200
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,879
having the og kb is pretty like uh it's

201
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,879
pretty impressive

202
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,639
just because like that plant is

203
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:15,598
like when i got those when i got that

204
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,478
strain it was it was

205
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:21,680
it was butchered um it was in very bad

206
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:23,519
condition so it's it's uh it's it's very

207
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,038
interesting to see how like you know

208
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:26,799
like how it does now like it's pretty

209
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:29,680
healthy but i've actually had it tissue

210
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,520
cultured by my homie um at dsg labs and

211
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,038
um and like you know like he's pretty

212
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:34,959
much trying to figure out like what the

213
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:36,879
issues that it actually had because i

214
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:38,638
mean we went through like sorium and all

215
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,319
sorts of stuff so the fact that it's

216
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,199
still even um

217
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,919
like has as any vigor uh it's it's you

218
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,840
know

219
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:47,758
kind of impressive in a sense but beyond

220
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:48,959
that um

221
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,199
it's

222
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:52,799
man like i i like it's it's hard to put

223
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,319
a you know

224
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,319
to

225
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,160
to to basically tell you a strain that's

226
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,479
been around for so long i mean there's

227
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,800
like most most stuff has been lost and

228
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:04,878
you know and um unless they they backed

229
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,240
everything up by seed or whatever but

230
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,919
other than that like most times like

231
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,160
back in the days they didn't do it like

232
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:11,519
you know any of that so i mean even like

233
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,360
if people tell you that they have a

234
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,359
certain strain nowadays like if

235
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,199
somewhere to be like like they have uh

236
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,960
like train wreck or something i mean

237
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,319
more than likely i would i would

238
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:21,439
probably

239
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,800
um

240
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:24,160
i wouldn't say i wouldn't believe them

241
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,960
but it's just more of i think it's just

242
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,560
more of that terpene profile and um and

243
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:30,318
you know like that's

244
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,240
you know that's more of like where they

245
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,918
would classify it as far as like uh in a

246
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,000
train wreck profile

247
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:39,199
uh but you know i'm it's

248
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,360
i'm yeah it's it's at this at this at

249
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,680
this point and um

250
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,519
you know that like down the road it's uh

251
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,278
keeping a plant alive for that long like

252
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,399
train wreck was from like you know i

253
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:50,799
mean i remember hearing about that in

254
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,480
the 90s uh it's it's it's it's going to

255
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:54,000
be pretty impressive to find someone

256
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,839
that actually has like access as a

257
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,080
genetic still

258
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,160
yeah of course shout out to the people

259
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,920
who have that one i i've met a few who i

260
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,399
think do but i get what you mean where

261
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:06,399
like that profile became representative

262
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,639
of the strain in a way didn't it but

263
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:11,039
let's jump back on track for just a

264
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,720
second i know everyone's keen to hear us

265
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:14,399
talk about the og kb because you just

266
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,560
brought it up but let's put that to the

267
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,039
side for just a minute what was your

268
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:21,599
first experience with cannabis

269
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:22,879
i mean it was like uh

270
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,120
i mean i didn't i didn't smoke weed

271
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:26,958
until like basically i got out of uh out

272
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,480
of high school i graduated whatnot and i

273
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:29,919
was just i pretty much took like the

274
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,440
semester off and i didn't go to college

275
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:34,000
or anything and so i was just i was

276
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:37,279
hanging out at my homies house and um

277
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,039
and you know uh we we pretty much we

278
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:41,838
used to like literally just throw down

279
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:43,278
on like a dub every day and a 40 and uh

280
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,720
go to his house and just chill and his

281
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:46,559
parents were cool as [ __ ] uh

282
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,278
unfortunately like my homies not with us

283
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:51,199
anymore but um you know it was like we

284
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:52,799
had like a tight little crew

285
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,959
and uh like that was like our daily

286
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:56,000
ritual and that's when i started smoking

287
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,518
weed and then

288
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,080
pretty much i got into selling weed as a

289
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,039
result of all that because i figured it

290
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,959
would be

291
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:05,360
cheaper to just you know grab you know

292
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:07,759
grab a grab more like you know like a

293
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,278
larger amount like grab more quantity

294
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:10,799
and and it was because we were paying

295
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:13,200
like back then we were paying 20 bucks

296
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:15,519
for a [ __ ] for a dub which is like

297
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,720
it's kind of like unheard of nowadays

298
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:21,278
yeah okay and so do you remember any of

299
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,560
like the notable name strains of that

300
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:24,078
time

301
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:25,838
uh i mean back then

302
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:27,919
people i mean people were just throwing

303
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,839
names on whatever there was like juicy

304
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:33,519
fruit i know there was m39 um

305
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,959
uh okay i mean a lot a lot of the stuff

306
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,360
was coming from from you know from

307
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:40,559
british columbia from from uh from from

308
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:43,440
you know from canada so it um like i

309
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:47,679
said like like juicy fruit m39

310
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,120
um critical mass i want to say uh

311
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,559
like you know like just very

312
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,159
commercialized strains at this point

313
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:54,399
that people normally like if you had it

314
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:56,078
to this like this day uh you probably

315
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,039
would not be able to get much money for

316
00:10:56,078 --> 00:10:58,799
it

317
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:00,480
and did you have a soft spot for any of

318
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:01,838
those looking back like kind of guilty

319
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,639
soft spot

320
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,920
i mean i mean not necessarily it's like

321
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:06,879
like uh

322
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:08,719
it's

323
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:11,439
i mean a lot of that stuff is was really

324
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,399
it was just like chemed out you know um

325
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,760
phospholoated you know like uh like

326
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,000
product that was just coming from like

327
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:20,720
like i said bc you know more than likely

328
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,240
uh like uh the

329
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,839
the only stuff that was like actually

330
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,879
was more notable would be probably the

331
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,959
outdoor that was coming out of like

332
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:29,039
mendocino and humble but

333
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:30,559
um you know like back then a lot of the

334
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:32,399
stuff that was in the streets was was

335
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:33,919
all going to be like canada like bc

336
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,480
stuff so

337
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:38,240
and it's um you know like they were kind

338
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,720
of like a lot of the times like they

339
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,680
were like what was coming in was stuff

340
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,079
that was kind of bland in the uh in

341
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:47,679
in the the sense of like like a nose as

342
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:49,519
far as like like the smell

343
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:52,000
and it all kind of has to do with as far

344
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,639
as like uh they didn't like when you're

345
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,240
shipping large quantities of of

346
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,079
anything you're not gonna want it to

347
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,519
smell too bad and you know so that all

348
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:01,679
the skunky varieties were pretty much

349
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,639
coming out of like mendo and humble at

350
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,078
the time

351
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,839
um

352
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:07,039
but back then there was like i can't i

353
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,600
can't say there was anything that that

354
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:12,319
was that uh memorable

355
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,480
no understandable understandable so

356
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,959
i guess my question is did you have a

357
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,120
eureka or like a light bulb moment with

358
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:20,559
cannabis where it all kind of clicked

359
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,159
for you and you realize this was

360
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:24,799
something you wanted to dedicate

361
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:26,639
yourself to so to speak oh yeah i know

362
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:28,799
when i started growing it was uh it was

363
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,839
like it was very like a eye opening in a

364
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,599
sense where

365
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,880
it just gave me a whole another respect

366
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,879
for the actual

367
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:36,559
plant and you know it's it's like

368
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:39,120
medical properties and how it can help

369
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:41,679
people out and and you know like when i

370
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,360
went to amsterdam it was uh in 2006 i

371
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:45,519
went with like eddie left and

372
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,680
and uh we went there and i met like

373
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,519
ariane from greenhouse seeds and

374
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:51,759
and like that's kind of when i was able

375
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,399
to actually because we didn't like the

376
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:55,919
clubs here were very like minimalist i

377
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,039
want to say it was medical at the time

378
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:59,838
and um

379
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:01,199
and it just there wasn't that as much of

380
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,200
a variety like everything was coming

381
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,200
from amsterdam actually and there was a

382
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,200
transitionary period where actually a

383
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,040
lot of the stuff started coming from

384
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,200
here like from northern california and

385
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:12,958
we started becoming a staple as far as

386
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,000
like uh being known

387
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,838
as the

388
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,078
the uh

389
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,959
like basically like the the

390
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:22,479
the

391
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:25,039
sorry my dog is tripping um like uh like

392
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,879
they basically like like like the that's

393
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:29,039
a staple for like a lot of the good

394
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:31,039
strains here and also like the like the

395
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:33,439
the granddaddy when it came out the or

396
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:34,879
the urkel actually um that was one of

397
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,639
the bigger like you know game changers

398
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:38,720
and whatnot then after that i would say

399
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,759
it was like the og and then

400
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:44,480
and then uh and then cookies you know so

401
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:46,240
yeah of course it definitely fits with

402
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,879
the general consensus that there was

403
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,198
that paradigm shift and kind of

404
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:53,679
a changing of the world's superpowers in

405
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:55,759
regards to weed from yeah the europeans

406
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:57,519
to americans so

407
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:58,879
i guess was there anything notable about

408
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,839
that trip would you would you make

409
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:04,000
avarian when you met

410
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:06,000
him mean it's pretty much well

411
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,278
i mean he was he was nice he was cool

412
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,679
like but uh but i it gave me a big um

413
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:12,958
like a big understanding as far as as uh

414
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:14,719
as far as like the game and how

415
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:17,599
everything works like as far as seed

416
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,720
companies because it at like back then

417
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,240
it was like if you were going to grow

418
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,959
you couldn't go on craigslist and get

419
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,120
clones i mean like i at s at some point

420
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:28,319
um like darkheart nursery they started

421
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,159
like off on like on craigslist but

422
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,680
back then you know you'd want to grow

423
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:33,198
like the fire and

424
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:35,519
what you would consider the fire would

425
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:38,319
be the cannabis cup winners and so you'd

426
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,959
open up like a like a high times

427
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,480
and um and there would be low old

428
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:45,039
greenhouse

429
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,639
seeds and they you know they they would

430
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:47,599
tout how many like cannabis cups they

431
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,039
won

432
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,560
and whatever and

433
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:52,480
like when i actually went to amsterdam i

434
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:53,919
realized like like a lot of the dutch

435
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,560
genetics were

436
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:58,879
inferior to what we have here in uh and

437
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:00,638
actually like in california or in you

438
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:01,919
know yeah in california basically

439
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,120
because i was there and i was like i'm

440
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:07,439
paying the euro was definitely um

441
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,159
you know the dollar was was definitely

442
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,800
weaker than the euro and so to pay you

443
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:13,919
know like whatever 18 20 euros for a

444
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:15,679
gram

445
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,078
and like to realize that it was actually

446
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:21,120
not like it wasn't that good of weed it

447
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:23,278
was very eye-opening to me you know

448
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,000
yeah and that's a really pertinent issue

449
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:28,399
we should talk about like people buying

450
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,278
cups or rigging cups or however it is

451
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,198
you know

452
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:33,519
do you think that was something which

453
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:34,799
was kind of limited to the european

454
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,799
scene or do you think that that's

455
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:39,519
happened and like what might be some

456
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:41,198
examples of it elsewhere

457
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,519
well i mean i like i i couldn't tell you

458
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:45,439
to what extent it still exists but i i

459
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,799
mean i definitely know that

460
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,160
um

461
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:49,919
like i like

462
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:53,198
back in the days it definitely came off

463
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:55,120
as uh like you know ariane um

464
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:57,198
he you know he

465
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,879
he he would basically i mean they have

466
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:00,078
so many cannabis cups and like like i

467
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:01,759
said the other day when people are

468
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:03,838
looking for you know they want to start

469
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,360
growing they're they they're gonna

470
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,639
they're gonna trust like high times as

471
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,800
judgment and they're gonna you know

472
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,959
think that whatever one that the latest

473
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:13,838
cannabis cup is gonna be you know the

474
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:15,518
like the hot stuff and so um i mean even

475
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,240
like like eddie left told me he's like

476
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,759
every time that he wins like a cup it

477
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,680
equates to literally like over a million

478
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,360
dollars in seed sales and back then that

479
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:25,758
was you know like

480
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,360
you know quite a bit amount of money and

481
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,919
um and so you know just a matter of

482
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,320
buying advertising space and high times

483
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:34,958
there's no definitive evidence about all

484
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,480
this but it's kind of like you can

485
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:38,000
i mean you can put two and two together

486
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,519
and you know realize that that's kind of

487
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,679
what was going on so

488
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,440
um you know like uh

489
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:45,679
i mean i was there myself when i was

490
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,600
kind of like oh damn like i want to when

491
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:49,599
i started growing i wanted to grow

492
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,040
the like we didn't have access to clones

493
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,240
so i wanted to grow

494
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:55,919
you know like the best weed ever and i

495
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,919
assumed that it was pretty much whatever

496
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:59,599
had won the cannabis cup that year and

497
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:00,958
um and like that when i went to

498
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,440
amsterdam it was kind of eye opening as

499
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:05,119
far as like uh that wasn't true

500
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,240
of course of course

501
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,719
so yeah

502
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,240
tell us do you remember about your first

503
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,240
grow what were you growing what was it

504
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,160
like

505
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,359
uh the the i want to say the strains

506
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,640
that like what i was growing the

507
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,479
the first ones that i did i was actually

508
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,679
i was growing up my mom's in the closet

509
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,759
of my mom's house and um and it was uh

510
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:29,360
og kush i actually had gotten like some

511
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:30,879
legit og like sfvog and uh back then

512
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:32,479
like those pounds were going for like

513
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,799
over six thousand dollars it's crazy

514
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,440
like and i happened to meet one of my

515
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:40,160
homies homies and he had these clones

516
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,240
and uh i mean it was legit og cushion so

517
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,840
that's the first first train i grew and

518
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,558
that was like you know one of the game

519
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:48,399
changers as far as uh where people were

520
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:50,720
like like i guess transitioning more

521
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,679
from like the fruity stuff to more the

522
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,919
gassy stuff and um and you know like uh

523
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,960
like like yeah i grew that in my mom's

524
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,799
closet

525
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,120
and uh

526
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:03,359
and it i mean it was it was definitely

527
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:05,519
uh it was it was it was pretty you know

528
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:06,558
it was nice to have your my own smoke

529
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:07,759
and whatnot it was definitely better

530
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:09,599
than most [ __ ] that i was getting on the

531
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:12,960
streets

532
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:15,199
wow and did you realize kind of what a

533
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,600
baseline you had because i often talk to

534
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,519
growers and you realize very quickly

535
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:21,678
that everything's so relative it's like

536
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:23,918
what what's your best could be [ __ ] for

537
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,400
me did you realize at the time you just

538
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:29,038
had the kill

539
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,200
i mean i i mean no i actually i did not

540
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:34,240
like i was i like thinking about it this

541
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:37,120
like uh to this day like it's actually

542
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,720
i'm very um surprised that

543
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:40,399
you know like my homie he was kind of

544
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,240
known he was more like a connoisseur or

545
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,759
whatnot but back then they were like

546
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,919
connoisseurs were definitely like the

547
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:48,558
minority within the you know the uh the

548
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:51,679
industry and whatnot and uh like for to

549
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:53,279
even be giving those clones it's uh like

550
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,720
i'm very i'm still surprised at this day

551
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:56,960
that i actually got those cuts it's kind

552
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:00,319
of like you know i like to get like

553
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,720
legit og clones back then was uh you

554
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:03,519
normally you would get some [ __ ] like

555
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,038
you know

556
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:07,119
somebody would just throw the og name on

557
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:08,960
it just to sell it to you know so i was

558
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:11,119
very uh you know i was very grateful for

559
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,200
that but i yeah i was it was legit it

560
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:14,639
was like i said vog and then we got the

561
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,240
larry after that

562
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,520
and um and you know like you know even

563
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,759
to this day like it's

564
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:22,240
they're hard to come by so

565
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:24,319
yeah larry is like a personal favorite

566
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,679
of mine but it's also one i find hard to

567
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:27,678
talk about because there's like that

568
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,679
lemon larry and it's like most people

569
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,919
don't know which one they're getting and

570
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,080
whatnot have you tried both and which

571
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,799
one do you prefer

572
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:39,119
i mean the original one was um

573
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:41,759
it was very like lime greenish and and

574
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:43,599
uh like i i i would say like

575
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:45,038
yeah lemony but at this point like

576
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,798
nowadays it's

577
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:48,400
i mean it's it's really hard to find

578
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:50,480
those same exact genetics like i mean

579
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,480
it's uh like i have not come across them

580
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,480
um ever like since

581
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,279
you know so it's kind of like even like

582
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,880
uh like the urkel like like most i mean

583
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:00,558
that it's a pretty hard

584
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,159
hard strain to come across nowadays you

585
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:03,839
mean like uh especially once it got

586
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,960
watered down with the granddaddy and you

587
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:06,879
know people were trying to get more of

588
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,240
like a yield out of it

589
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:12,720
so um but yeah i mean i like yeah i you

590
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,640
know like i i the og was there was a

591
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,319
reason why it was it was a game changer

592
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,480
and at the time like everything seemed

593
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:21,599
to be like fruity and kind of blandish

594
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,599
and og was just like like uh like gassy

595
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:25,759
so people you know people definitely

596
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:27,038
took you know took to that

597
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:27,839
for sure

598
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:29,440
so

599
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:31,359
what was it like when you were then you

600
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,279
know starting to progress in kind of

601
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:34,879
your skills you'd had a few harvests

602
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:37,440
you're getting more clones how did you

603
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,360
kind of develop

604
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,279
i mean i like like i i pretty much i

605
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:42,079
kept my closet at my mom's house rocking

606
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:44,000
for

607
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:46,399
for a little while uh like probably like

608
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,798
at least like a year year and a half um

609
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,320
i mean at that point too i like

610
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:52,798
the reality is like you didn't have to

611
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:54,079
really grow that good of weed um so you

612
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:56,480
know there was like a more of like there

613
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:59,439
was a higher margin for like for error

614
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,919
um you know if i mean i had [ __ ] that

615
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,080
when i was starting to do seeds that had

616
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,360
literally gotten seeded up and i i was

617
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:07,279
still getting rid of the pounds for like

618
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:09,839
four thousand dollars just because there

619
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:12,558
was so much shitty weed on on the market

620
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:14,319
um you know so back then it was you know

621
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:15,678
like i definitely made a little bit you

622
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:17,599
know a nice little chunk of change off

623
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,120
off of that two there was like two six

624
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:22,158
hundreds in the closet

625
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:23,199
and um and and yeah like it's like it it

626
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,799
was uh

627
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,640
it was nice because everything else like

628
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:29,200
i said was coming from more than likely

629
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,559
canada and and it's it it was not it

630
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,919
wasn't comparable to like what i was

631
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:34,639
even growing when i was just starting

632
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,520
off so it was fr and from then like i

633
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,600
got

634
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:39,440
other spots and you know like save my

635
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:40,558
money up and whatever and

636
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,400
pretty much

637
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:44,480
you know moved on like growing

638
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,400
more and more uh like basically like you

639
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,919
know get getting more lights going and

640
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,038
all that you know all that [ __ ] getting

641
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,200
a warehouse

642
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:53,279
here in the city and then um you know

643
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,640
like i kind of regressed a little bit

644
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:56,480
just because like the whole tech boom

645
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,880
that came in into play

646
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,640
um like the prices for for the rent on

647
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,320
like the like the warehouses went like

648
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,159
through the roof and whatnot so we went

649
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:05,439
back to residential stuff and you know

650
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,600
like that's

651
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,120
um you know like that's pretty much

652
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:11,439
where we're at now in a sense you know

653
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:13,038
like that's uh like okay i mean getting

654
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,960
into the market here in california is

655
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:17,038
pretty pretty expensive you know so

656
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,038
that's kind of why i choose to

657
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:21,119
do like more of my consulting and like

658
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:22,720
like uh dabble in like other states

659
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:24,879
because it's just it's it's cheaper and

660
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,200
easier to get into yeah it's cutthroat

661
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,120
in california i want to jump back though

662
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,798
just for a second to

663
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:32,639
how you talked about getting an

664
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:34,319
industrial space i feel like this is a

665
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,679
topic we don't really delve into a lot

666
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:37,839
on the show so

667
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,440
i'm just wondering when you first did

668
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:41,038
get your bigger space no matter what

669
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,720
like the context was

670
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:44,640
were you quite anxious about it or you

671
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,159
just overwhelmingly excited and what

672
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,919
were kind of the factors that played

673
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,760
into mine when you were selecting say

674
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,520
strains for it were you just thinking

675
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:53,440
well i've got to get a good return so

676
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:54,960
that's kind of the priority here or was

677
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,480
it like you were able to kind of just

678
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,159
grow whatever you wanted that wasn't a

679
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,558
consideration

680
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,679
yeah i mean i mean back then it's i mean

681
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:04,319
it's crazy because the market's

682
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,880
completely completely changed um i mean

683
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:09,439
back then i wouldn't i mean i was just

684
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,679
buying like uh you know strains from

685
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,200
from like seeds from from

686
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,840
you know dutch genetics and whatnot on

687
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,919
like breed bay and and uh like scene

688
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:19,519
band what not and i just i just

689
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,600
literally remember being up at like two

690
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:24,079
three in the morning to like get in on

691
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:25,759
these auctions um you know for like

692
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:28,639
certain like strains i like like

693
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:30,558
reservoirs stuff and um

694
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,759
you know back then like honestly like it

695
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:34,240
um

696
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:36,480
it's it like the the market the way it

697
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,120
was it allowed me actually to have a lot

698
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,839
of my mistakes as far as like like like

699
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:44,639
messing [ __ ] up like i said as far as

700
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:46,480
like missing males in in the room and

701
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,679
then like when you're like you know uh

702
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,558
when you're sorting through seeds and

703
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,798
whatnot

704
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:52,558
and um and like having us like a seated

705
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:54,798
crop and still like being able to sell

706
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:57,519
it like nowadays you wouldn't be able to

707
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:59,038
to do that so it was uh but back then it

708
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:01,679
was that there was no

709
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:03,359
there was no um i mean og kush was

710
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,840
definitely like the probably like the

711
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:07,839
the you know the top strain at the

712
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:09,678
moment i just was never into like mono

713
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:11,678
cropping and that kind of i mean that's

714
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,679
that's actually like my own

715
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,278
like no i don't say issue but in a sense

716
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,080
i just always was looking for something

717
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:20,000
else and so i ran some of that i ran

718
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:22,720
some of you know whatever whatever else

719
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,880
is available but um you know like back

720
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,558
then you could pretty much grow

721
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,320
whatever and most of the time if you

722
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:29,759
were growing like decently you would be

723
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:32,558
doing better than whatever's coming was

724
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:33,599
coming through like on the streets yeah

725
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:34,399
for sure

726
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:35,839
so

727
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,840
correct me if i'm wrong but it sounds

728
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:39,439
like probably the next big thing that

729
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:41,918
really caught your eye after you're

730
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,919
running the og was probably the first

731
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:47,038
cookies right

732
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,960
i i mean yeah like um i mean og kind of

733
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:51,440
like i mean it's it's still pretty

734
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,960
pivotal as far as like like uh you know

735
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,880
like within the market there's a huge

736
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:58,000
market still for it people love like you

737
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,520
know the gassiness of it um but yeah

738
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,839
cookies you know there's a reason why

739
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:03,599
cookies was a was a game changer as far

740
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:07,359
as you know what like why it is so

741
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:09,119
prominent at like as it is today um and

742
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:10,399
like yeah i mean it's

743
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:12,000
like i said it's just a matter of like

744
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,440
with your market and what you have and

745
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,278
you know um

746
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,798
but like coming to see how like like

747
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:20,558
like you know like the first time i ever

748
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:21,918
saw cookies and came across it it was

749
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:24,158
like there i mean people were passing

750
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,360
off bubbas as cookies so i was like a

751
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,799
lot of people were showing me stuff and

752
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:29,678
i was like this just smells like bubba

753
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:31,759
you know and um and when i finally

754
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,360
actually got a hold of the real deal

755
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:35,679
cookies i was like oh this is what

756
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:37,199
everyone's talking about but like i said

757
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,798
people were you know trying to pass off

758
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,400
[ __ ] left and right as far as you know

759
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:43,278
being cookies like like especially

760
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,798
bubbas um and like you know it wasn't

761
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:46,480
you know to me i was like it just smells

762
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:47,918
like bubba so

763
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,839
when i finally got

764
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:52,320
a hold of like the actual you know real

765
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:53,759
deal cookies it was i was like this is i

766
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:56,399
understand why you know why it's a game

767
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:58,798
changer at that point you know yeah so

768
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,278
what was the first sample you got to try

769
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:03,440
was it like forum was it like thin min

770
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:04,880
do you have any idea

771
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,880
actually i i couldn't tell you what it

772
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:10,720
was i know that um like the like the the

773
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,080
first packs were coming through

774
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,640
from from

775
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:17,199
like burner to like oh like basically og

776
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,038
kush bread which is my homie um

777
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,000
and like that was like even like like

778
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:23,440
frost boss uh like he like i remember

779
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,720
like you know i was selling them packs

780
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,080
like they they like they had [ __ ] up a

781
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,000
bunch of those batches like there was a

782
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:31,519
bunch of seated packs that came through

783
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,278
and we were still [ __ ] selling them

784
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:35,359
like like nothing and this is

785
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:38,319
in i want to say like uh like probably

786
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:39,519
like 2010-ish 2009 which actually was

787
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:41,359
like the

788
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:43,119
the crash of the weed market in a sense

789
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:45,359
where everyone kind of went balls of the

790
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:48,239
wall and grew a bunch of weed

791
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:49,599
and um the prices like plummeted like

792
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,599
went through the floor

793
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:52,959
and so like you know like back then to

794
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:55,519
be able to get rid of like seated

795
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,840
products and you know like people were

796
00:26:55,519 --> 00:27:00,158
like lining up to buy cookies but it was

797
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:01,759
also more of the fact that that uh it

798
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,159
was only coming out of like the cookie

799
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:05,599
fam little like they're the circle and

800
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:08,320
so there there's only so much to go

801
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:10,079
around and um i mean luckily i i knew

802
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:12,399
like like oh gee kush breath was kind of

803
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:14,399
tied in with all them so he was like

804
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,480
showing me you know those packs and i

805
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,840
remember going to his house and i was

806
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,120
like yeah like actually this is like

807
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:21,439
pretty fire you know and then when he

808
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:22,719
told me the tickets i was like like i

809
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,240
don't know if i can get rid of this sort

810
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,399
of you know this stuff for this kind of

811
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,399
a ticket but you know there's a certain

812
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:30,879
market that definitely wanted it and uh

813
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:33,839
like said like frost boss and my other

814
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:36,159
abf and um like unknown profit they kind

815
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:37,599
of had that uh that market where people

816
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,080
were actually like willing to pay for it

817
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:41,278
it was you know pretty crazy so

818
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:42,960
yeah wow

819
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:45,679
so though when you said those first

820
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,399
couple ones came through with seeds

821
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:50,480
you mean that the first batches coming

822
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:53,918
out of cookie fam when they were grown

823
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,839
it was seeded with like s1's or whatever

824
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,840
yeah i mean well no that i mean there

825
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:59,519
was a like a bunch of batches that came

826
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:00,720
through that were fine but then there

827
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:03,359
were some that

828
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,200
that definitely were seated and so uh

829
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:06,719
you know it was just kind of like

830
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,319
like beggars can't be choosers if you

831
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,319
want cookies then you're you know you're

832
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:12,000
gonna have to [ __ ] buy it so

833
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:14,319
uh and i like i'd probably like

834
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,200
attribute that to actually all the

835
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:18,639
different phenotypes that we see um

836
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,240
today just because like there were so

837
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,320
many seeds and if you were smart at the

838
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,480
time you would have uh you would have

839
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:26,879
planted the seeds because uh because you

840
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,159
know the strain was in high demand so

841
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,320
yeah okay

842
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:32,880
and do you remember how long it was

843
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:35,519
between then and when you first tried

844
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,080
ogkb

845
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:40,240
uh i mean the the og kb just kind of

846
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:42,639
like like uh pretty much fell into my

847
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,480
lap as far as like um

848
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,000
they're like we were already testing the

849
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,679
the animal in the forum because we

850
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,159
already had access to those

851
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,519
and then uh like i said like the og we

852
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,640
kind of just fell into my lap as a

853
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:55,119
result of

854
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,679
like uh like unfortunate incident in a

855
00:28:55,119 --> 00:29:00,479
sense where i you know i pretty much

856
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:04,080
i grabbed the clones and like those uh

857
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:07,038
like like out of og kush red spot and

858
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:08,558
and um you know like i we we only knew

859
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:12,158
the animal in the forum and at that

860
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:14,720
point um you know when i got the actual

861
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:16,159
i mean oh the og kb clone was not even

862
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,038
it wasn't even named that it was just

863
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,200
more of

864
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:20,798
i named it after og kush bread because

865
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,720
that's my homie who gave it to me and

866
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:25,278
that's pretty much it but i you know

867
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,600
like it's uh like it it's like a mutant

868
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:30,558
cookies that actually is like [ __ ]

869
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:32,719
like you know like really good obviously

870
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:34,798
yeah of course so a lot of people are

871
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,798
really curious as to how you actually

872
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:38,158
got your hands on the og kb would you be

873
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:39,599
able to tell us the backstory behind

874
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:43,200
that one

875
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:46,079
yeah yeah so i'm so basically um i mean

876
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:48,399
like og kb was like like i've known him

877
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:50,079
for for a long a long time at this point

878
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:51,918
it's you know close to like almost 20

879
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:52,639
years and um he's

880
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,000
like

881
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,480
he actually like brought me in the game

882
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,159
and whatnot and um and he's all he's

883
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,319
always taking care of me but at that

884
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,640
time we only knew of the animal in the

885
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:04,798
forum and there was a instance that

886
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,720
basically like one of his um his spots

887
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:09,519
had gotten robbed like like they it was

888
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,278
like a home invasion and so he was in i

889
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:13,359
think he was in vegas and he called me

890
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:15,919
it was like like three like three or

891
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:17,439
four like four in the morning and um

892
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:19,520
he just he was like yo he's like can you

893
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,759
go clear this spot out for me because

894
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:22,879
uh like you know pretty much they was it

895
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:25,599
got robbed

896
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,840
and so i was alright cool so i i hopped

897
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:30,000
in in my girlfriend's car and like i was

898
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:31,839
saying like at the time i didn't have

899
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,319
like a license i grabbed my pistol and

900
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:35,918
just you know pretty much took off and i

901
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:38,240
had to make a bunch of trips back and

902
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:39,840
forth it was pretty pretty [ __ ]

903
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,120
pretty wild really like to think about

904
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:42,480
it and um

905
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:44,239
and you know whatever it is what it is i

906
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,759
got i cleared the place out there was a

907
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,640
bunch of plants that were literally in

908
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:48,319
like

909
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,799
five gallon pots that i had to put in

910
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:53,439
contractor bags and and like luckily

911
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:54,319
there was people there um but like they

912
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,399
you know

913
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:58,639
well once they were like some of them

914
00:30:56,398 --> 00:31:00,479
were all tied up and whatever so i once

915
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,399
i you know got them you know loose and

916
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,720
whatnot they were able to help me out

917
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:06,879
but i was like driving back and forth

918
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,399
uh with with these huge plants that were

919
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:11,278
literally like five six weeks in a

920
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:12,639
flower and um in like five gallon pots

921
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:14,079
and in my car

922
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,679
or and um

923
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:17,359
you know like basically what was there

924
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:20,798
was the og cabbie is what we know is the

925
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:22,719
og kv now and so it was uh it was it was

926
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:24,398
pretty wild like so i got you know i got

927
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,480
it taking care of it one night but like

928
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:28,558
like you know back then it's

929
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,480
it was at different times as far as uh

930
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:31,678
the legality of as as far as what we're

931
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,278
doing and stuff

932
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:37,120
so um you know like it's that was you

933
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:38,880
know the cops could have came in at any

934
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:39,918
given moment i had no i had no idea what

935
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,360
the hell was going on but i just want to

936
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,480
get everything out of there and whatever

937
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:44,158
and then when i brought that like all

938
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,399
the stuff back to my house

939
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,159
um i asked them what like you know this

940
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:50,558
mutant ass plant like what like what it

941
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:51,840
was and he said it was cookies and i was

942
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:52,879
i was like that's weird because we've

943
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:54,798
already like been documenting the

944
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,080
cookies um

945
00:31:54,798 --> 00:31:59,759
as you know as far as like what we know

946
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:02,158
and he's like nah so it was like a whole

947
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:03,839
other phenotype of the cookies and once

948
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:06,159
i finished everything up

949
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:07,839
it was definitely like a you know a very

950
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:09,519
a very good cookies cut

951
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:11,359
and um

952
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:12,880
it wasn't that desirable to actually

953
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:14,639
like grow because of the fact that like

954
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,240
a veg so damn slow

955
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,399
but like that's pretty much what came to

956
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,000
be known as the og kb and i mean it

957
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:21,199
wasn't even named that at the time it

958
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,519
was pretty much

959
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,360
i named it after my homie like pretty

960
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,960
much after him and that was pretty much

961
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:28,479
it just to like differentiate the clones

962
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,120
that we had already

963
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,519
wow what an amazing story i'm giving you

964
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:35,759
a virtual clap for being a solid homie

965
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,880
on that one so i guess the first

966
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:39,919
question is

967
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,880
how does og kb himself

968
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,720
feel

969
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,320
about how the strains gone on to become

970
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,038
so popular because he really doesn't

971
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:48,398
seem to be involved in the scene too

972
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:50,558
much you don't really get to hear his

973
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:52,558
perspective much

974
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:55,278
yeah i mean i mean at the end of the day

975
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:57,678
uh i mean that's the reason why uh why

976
00:32:55,278 --> 00:32:59,679
it was named after him at the new day

977
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,360
like the the

978
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,798
the recognition will kind of always go

979
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:04,558
back to him so

980
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:06,319
whatever but it's it is kind of crazy

981
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:08,319
how everything has kind of like

982
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:11,119
you know uh snowballed into like what it

983
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:13,359
actually is and how it's actually very

984
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:15,199
very you know it's it's a basis of a lot

985
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:17,359
of like fit you know one of the some of

986
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,880
the most famous strains i guess

987
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:21,678
to date now you know

988
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,278
um it's uh yeah it's a very unique plant

989
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,480
and whatnot but i mean he's not really

990
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:25,839
concerned with a lot of that stuff to be

991
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,360
honest you like i don't think he is he

992
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:29,199
it's just more of it's just

993
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:31,119
crazy how it all kind of likes like i

994
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,120
said like you know just everything kind

995
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:34,798
of came into this whole situation and i

996
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:37,038
mean it's a good plant it's it's it

997
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:38,879
produces [ __ ] you know fire

998
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:40,720
uh the offspring is definitely like a

999
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,519
lot of it's very promising

1000
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,640
um and you know like yeah there's

1001
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,159
there's a

1002
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,200
it's you know

1003
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:51,120
i like it's doesn't you it's hard it was

1004
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,120
a finicky plant to get basically dialed

1005
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:54,479
in and whatnot but like you know

1006
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:55,278
whatever like i said like at the end of

1007
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,038
the day

1008
00:33:55,278 --> 00:33:58,398
to see where it's at now as far as like

1009
00:33:57,038 --> 00:33:59,278
if you saw like the healthy plants that

1010
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:01,199
i have

1011
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:02,960
of the og kb and that that i even have

1012
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,278
it's still alive it's pretty

1013
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,360
pretty crazy considering the the uh the

1014
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:09,280
shape that it came to be in

1015
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:11,279
yeah of course it's a great little

1016
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,359
turnaround story i definitely want to

1017
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,240
chat about the offspring of the og kb

1018
00:34:13,358 --> 00:34:17,358
but just as a quick little side track

1019
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:20,239
do you

1020
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:22,799
know much about or have you tried the og

1021
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:24,319
kb 2.0 the one that came from the bag

1022
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,879
seed

1023
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,559
uh i i have not is that like uh dark

1024
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:30,480
horse or

1025
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:32,878
i'm not sure who it is but like someone

1026
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,878
bought some og kb from a dispensary and

1027
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:36,799
they found like some s-ones and they

1028
00:34:34,878 --> 00:34:39,598
popped it and it was like really good

1029
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,359
and they called it og kb 2.0 and now

1030
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,359
there's even a few breeders who agreed

1031
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:47,679
with it like most notably in-house has

1032
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:49,918
done across and he calls it og kb 2.1

1033
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:52,000
yeah i mean at that point i i don't know

1034
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:55,039
like man i'm honestly like people hit me

1035
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,199
up all day and they want to uh

1036
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:58,719
like they want me to vouch for their for

1037
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:00,000
whatever their their clone or whatever

1038
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:01,919
it is um

1039
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,280
i i just like like like i said at the

1040
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,639
end of the day i just tell people like

1041
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,560
yo if you're happy with what you got

1042
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:08,719
like you know and it's fire then you

1043
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:10,159
know like um you know that's that's

1044
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:11,598
great just be happy with that like i

1045
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:14,159
can't i can't

1046
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:16,640
you know specifically vouch for her

1047
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:18,239
for for your clones like i have no idea

1048
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:20,319
like you know what

1049
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:22,078
what what the wheat is people are very

1050
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,920
quick to attach a name to something that

1051
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:26,160
pretty much sell it so the end of the

1052
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,320
day like uh like you know it's it's kind

1053
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:29,679
of hard to tell but if it like i said at

1054
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,039
the end of the day if it's good then you

1055
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:33,358
know this is what it is like you know

1056
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:35,759
like you got to give props to that but i

1057
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:38,639
i have not tried any of those um you

1058
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:40,000
know like the the og kb 2.0 and whatnot

1059
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:41,838
i don't i mean for me it's just more of

1060
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,880
like i have the original like like why

1061
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:44,000
the hell would i

1062
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,760
what

1063
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,880
you know like experiment with like

1064
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,880
trying something else and and whatnot

1065
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,480
yeah understandable

1066
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,240
so when you started growing it out did

1067
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,480
you notice any similarities with the

1068
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:58,479
ogkb and any other plants and the reason

1069
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,240
why i asked this is because

1070
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,639
we've heard um

1071
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:04,399
csi in the past say that some of the

1072
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:07,039
urkel s1s

1073
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,440
come out with that exact same morphology

1074
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:11,519
that mutant kind of look that the og-kbb

1075
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,039
has have you ever grown the og kb and

1076
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:15,358
just kind of thought oh man i see a bit

1077
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:17,920
of this plant in it

1078
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:20,319
i mean uh i mean yeah the urkel is very

1079
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,559
uh i mean it's a short stocky plant that

1080
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:25,280
was and which is pretty similar to the

1081
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:27,759
og kv and i mean he definitely could

1082
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,440
have be on on to something um

1083
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,520
besides that the only other one that i

1084
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,000
actually noticed like the leaf structure

1085
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:36,000
was that at the time back then was uh

1086
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,920
was the cherry pie that was going around

1087
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,358
and it was actually like a the cherry

1088
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,159
pie tended to have

1089
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:44,880
uh tendencies and uh and

1090
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:46,719
and uh back then it actually was it was

1091
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,880
pretty similar in in structure and

1092
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:49,679
whatnot and um it had to kind of like

1093
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,280
that

1094
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:52,719
the leaf structure and it was kind of

1095
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:56,000
short and squat and it also tended to

1096
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:57,598
make uh like like um like like you know

1097
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,400
pollen sacks but they were they were

1098
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:02,320
non-viable so um like but that's the

1099
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,480
thing is like it was kind of like uh the

1100
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,400
cherry pie came first and then cookies

1101
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,639
started coming around after that

1102
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,400
and uh and you know like like it was i

1103
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:12,239
mean even i i wish i still had that

1104
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,240
cherry pie i was definitely that cherry

1105
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:17,598
pie was was you know was was nice it was

1106
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:19,838
just not very uh very stable

1107
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,960
yeah of course

1108
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:22,880
so

1109
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,800
you got the og kbb

1110
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,119
when did you first start to do some

1111
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:31,119
collaborations with it

1112
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:33,920
uh i mean like back then i i i

1113
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:36,480
met fletcher from archive c bank through

1114
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,599
uh through the forums and um and it was

1115
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,599
just kind of like a thing where i was

1116
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:41,519
like yo like you know uh he was working

1117
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:44,160
with the face off oh g mail at the time

1118
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:46,800
um on and uh and so that was kind of

1119
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:48,000
like like the basis of a lot of his uh

1120
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,119
his seeds

1121
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,960
and um his his seed company was kind of

1122
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,800
more like the infancy stages as far as

1123
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,800
like it was kind of like just taking off

1124
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,640
but not quite and so i was like yo man

1125
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,240
like if you want to you know hit like

1126
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:03,440
people were asking me left and right for

1127
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:05,679
the og kb because we had uh the form and

1128
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,599
the animal already but like the og kb

1129
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:10,078
once it became known as like uh like a

1130
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:11,760
like a very like legit cookie strain

1131
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,920
people you know people people were you

1132
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,960
know they everyone was interested in it

1133
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,960
so

1134
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,119
i hit him up and was like you know if

1135
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,720
you want to pollinate it you know just

1136
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:22,079
you know we'll split the seeds and

1137
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:25,118
pretty much that's about it and that's

1138
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:26,560
what became the dositos basically and um

1139
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:29,119
and you know like

1140
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:30,400
and from there it just uh

1141
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:32,160
it's kind of progressed into like

1142
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,000
everything else that it is nowadays too

1143
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:36,399
so

1144
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,760
yeah okay so the seeds were made did you

1145
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,119
pop them immediately were you really

1146
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,119
excited for it or you kind of didn't

1147
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,440
really suspect it would go on to become

1148
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,960
what it's become

1149
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:48,079
yeah i mean well like a lot of the seeds

1150
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:50,079
were like um like they like the og kb

1151
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:52,160
tends to produce very like white pale

1152
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,320
seeds that are typically non like

1153
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:55,920
non-viable like they don't it's really

1154
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:59,039
hard to get them to germinate so i mean

1155
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:01,440
i had like a jar full of seeds and uh

1156
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:03,519
and you know i kind of actually held on

1157
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,480
to like some of them and i i gave them

1158
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:09,679
to i think was np cali actually my my

1159
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:11,599
friend uh my friend ryan and decali and

1160
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:15,358
he got actually the last of the of the

1161
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:17,200
dositos original dosito seeds um and

1162
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:19,440
they they were it was really hard to

1163
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:20,639
germinate them and whatnot uh like but

1164
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,039
you know that's that's pretty much where

1165
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:25,199
the dositos came from i you know i got

1166
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:27,440
the jar i started like doing the

1167
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:29,919
selections and then pretty much like

1168
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,358
that like fletcher named it the dositos

1169
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,800
and like you know that's that's pretty

1170
00:39:31,358 --> 00:39:34,960
much like where it's at now you know the

1171
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,680
mendo bread is another story as far as

1172
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:40,240
uh that was done with gage green and um

1173
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:42,879
and you know like it's it it was

1174
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:45,199
like like you know out of like a tray of

1175
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,680
seeds i'd probably get like

1176
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:49,279
like less than a quarter like 25 of them

1177
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:51,199
to like actually germinate they're you

1178
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,839
know they're they're they're definitely

1179
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:55,838
uh they require a little bit of work

1180
00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:57,199
how did the mendo breath collab come

1181
00:39:55,838 --> 00:40:00,159
about

1182
00:39:57,199 --> 00:40:02,078
oh that was um like

1183
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:03,519
like i had i had a friend that was like

1184
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,359
that that was trimming for me it was

1185
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:08,159
like a friend of a friend and he

1186
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:10,239
actually mentioned to me that uh he had

1187
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:12,399
some neighbors that i guess had the seed

1188
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:13,919
company and like like back then same

1189
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,838
thing gageman was kind of in their

1190
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,519
infancy stages and in a sense that they

1191
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:19,358
weren't um you know they weren't that

1192
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:21,358
big but they were definitely doing like

1193
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:22,880
breeding work and so i was like yeah you

1194
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:25,039
know whatever like i was i'm always like

1195
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,720
you know about like you know if

1196
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:28,480
if you know i'm always about working

1197
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:29,759
with people and whatnot and so i was

1198
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,240
like oh that's cool you know this and

1199
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,359
that and then he had talked to them and

1200
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:34,799
then they were like oh yeah i know i

1201
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:36,559
know who you're talking about like as

1202
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,079
far as like you know me having the og

1203
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:40,239
kush breath and whatever and being on

1204
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:42,480
the forums and um

1205
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:44,879
and so like i like we you know we made

1206
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,559
an agreement and i gave him the clone

1207
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,280
and then they pollinated it and there

1208
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:50,000
was

1209
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:52,640
uh the mendo breath and the grateful

1210
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,079
breath and then you know there was

1211
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:56,159
you know that was those were probably

1212
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:59,359
the two most prominent strains that they

1213
00:40:56,159 --> 00:41:01,679
actually like produced and whatnot so

1214
00:40:59,358 --> 00:41:03,358
um like you know but it like they uh

1215
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:04,159
they you know it

1216
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:05,598
they

1217
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:07,279
like you know like

1218
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:09,280
what like a lot of the stuff that comes

1219
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:12,160
from the og kb it tends to be pretty you

1220
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:14,880
know pretty pretty uh impressive

1221
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:16,960
without question so how do you feel that

1222
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,599
the majority of their work now is just

1223
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:22,880
really stemming off the ogb and then

1224
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:25,039
even further you know gromer's now made

1225
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,720
his whole thing off their whole thing

1226
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:28,239
like you've almost given birth to a

1227
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:30,480
brand that's given birth to a brand if

1228
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:32,559
you get what i mean

1229
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,400
yeah i know it's like the the basis of

1230
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:36,880
uh the infrastructure for

1231
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,400
other people's [ __ ] companies um

1232
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,079
i don't know i mean it's in a sense it's

1233
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,358
kind of flattering but i'm not ever

1234
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:44,318
really

1235
00:41:41,358 --> 00:41:46,719
one to be uh like a hater in a sense you

1236
00:41:44,318 --> 00:41:48,880
mean like like at the end of the day i

1237
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:50,639
like i like the the way that this this

1238
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,838
industry is like i'm i'm not gonna try

1239
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:53,838
to go and like

1240
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:55,119
shake people down for you know whatever

1241
00:41:53,838 --> 00:41:56,719
it's like i'm just happy for people that

1242
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:57,838
they're being successful with it and at

1243
00:41:56,719 --> 00:42:00,078
the end of the day if you really know

1244
00:41:57,838 --> 00:42:01,920
what's up you'll know that like the work

1245
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:04,400
came from me you know i mean so there's

1246
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:06,400
always you know um you know there

1247
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,240
there's always that sort of recognition

1248
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,160
in a sense but at the end of the day

1249
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:11,679
like you know someone's you know doing

1250
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:13,440
well like i'm i'm happy for them you

1251
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:15,598
know like as long as they're not a you

1252
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,039
know a punk [ __ ] like [ __ ] to me

1253
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,318
i don't anchor you know like like even

1254
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:19,920
like with gromer

1255
00:42:18,318 --> 00:42:21,358
um i literally hit him up and i was like

1256
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,039
yo like i wanted to run i think some

1257
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:24,400
like the peanut butter red so i asked

1258
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:25,519
him for like a pack of the seeds and he

1259
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,680
sent me like

1260
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:30,318
25 packs of seeds of like all the [ __ ]

1261
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:32,318
you know like i respect that you name um

1262
00:42:30,318 --> 00:42:34,318
and i'm sure he's made plenty of more

1263
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:36,000
money than whatever those are worth but

1264
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:38,559
at the end of the day like it's you know

1265
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,159
it's uh i respect the fact that that uh

1266
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:40,880
you know he kind of paid it forward you

1267
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:41,598
know

1268
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,519
so

1269
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:46,480
yeah of course that's always good karma

1270
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:49,039
stuff so a lot of people would know you

1271
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:52,000
because through name because the fact

1272
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:54,079
that the predominantly widespread cut of

1273
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,239
both the docido and the mendo breath are

1274
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:59,280
the ones you found when you were doing

1275
00:42:56,239 --> 00:43:00,879
those pheno hunts did you realize that

1276
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,400
these were going to be really good like

1277
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,680
i remember we just spoke about when they

1278
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,280
were in seats but when you're actually

1279
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:07,118
flowering them out and you could smell

1280
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,400
them and get excited were you really

1281
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:10,960
excited or you just thought oh this is a

1282
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,240
nice cut i'll give it to some friends

1283
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,159
no i mean i could tell they were they

1284
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:16,799
were game changers um

1285
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:19,039
it's like as far as like like how you

1286
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,560
know how it's you know they've taken off

1287
00:43:19,039 --> 00:43:22,400
or whatever um

1288
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:23,920
i mean there i mean nowadays there's

1289
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,000
there's definitely a lot of like like

1290
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,680
really good strains out but at the time

1291
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,119
they were definitely like you know game

1292
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:31,279
changers you know there was definitely

1293
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:33,519
very special as far as whatever i

1294
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,720
already had on deck and um it kind of

1295
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:36,480
blew everything else out of the water

1296
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:38,239
which is why i was like if you look at

1297
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,719
my instagram or whatever you realize

1298
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:43,118
like i i wasn't i didn't never intended

1299
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:45,279
to hype them up i'm not like uh like

1300
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:46,960
like i call like a like like a used car

1301
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,400
salesman where it's it's kind of like

1302
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,199
i'm not gonna put my name on something

1303
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,480
that's not gonna be that good um and you

1304
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:54,960
know

1305
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,480
pretty much now like you know one like

1306
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,079
to nowadays

1307
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,079
if there's a reason why people utilize

1308
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,760
those strains for you know for for the

1309
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,039
the basis of their breeding products too

1310
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,640
you know

1311
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:07,199
of course

1312
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:09,440
so at this time i think it was kind of

1313
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:11,039
about the same time like look cookies

1314
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,800
was just going through the roof you know

1315
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:14,880
like you had like rappers starting to

1316
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:17,359
name drop it and the really the cultural

1317
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:20,000
side of weed started to really generate

1318
00:44:17,358 --> 00:44:21,679
a lot of interest in cookies as well did

1319
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,920
you ever think to yourself

1320
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:25,919
i could try to like you know jump on

1321
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,440
docido or mendo breath and try to launch

1322
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,159
it or did you just feel like that was

1323
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,679
just kind of not in your lane

1324
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:33,838
i mean it's

1325
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:35,519
it was i i think like a lot of the the

1326
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:37,119
hype that came along with it was very

1327
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:39,838
organically uh

1328
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:41,680
fabricated um you know i mean like a lot

1329
00:44:39,838 --> 00:44:43,199
of people like would hear about it and

1330
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,480
uh they like

1331
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:45,919
it's one thing to hear about something

1332
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,199
that's another thing to like you know

1333
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,599
actually

1334
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:51,759
have it and you know uh like smell it

1335
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:52,720
and you know just like you know smoke it

1336
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,359
whatever

1337
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:57,118
um you know like i but at the time it

1338
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:58,799
was you know it wasn't

1339
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,318
it wasn't about like capitalizing on

1340
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,160
that all that hype really like i'm

1341
00:45:00,318 --> 00:45:04,559
actually very surprised as far as like

1342
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:06,879
how far uh even like you know like

1343
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:09,440
cookies itself has like come along you

1344
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:11,838
know so it's uh but but it was at the

1345
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:14,240
time it was definitely like i can't deny

1346
00:45:11,838 --> 00:45:15,599
that it was not i mean that it was a

1347
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:16,559
game changer you know like it was just

1348
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:19,039
definitely

1349
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:20,480
um like like like i said back then

1350
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:22,318
people were passing around bubba as

1351
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,240
cookies and i'd be like this ain't that

1352
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:26,000
fire you know whatever and then when i

1353
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:27,598
actually got a hold of the actual like

1354
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,440
real cookies i was like oh this is what

1355
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:31,280
people are talking about this is

1356
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,960
actually yeah like game changer [ __ ] you

1357
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,160
know

1358
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:37,119
yeah okay

1359
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:39,838
so if we try to put personal attachments

1360
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:42,079
and whatnot to the side if you consider

1361
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:44,799
the fact that you conceded you know it's

1362
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:47,359
not not a great breeding plant the ogb

1363
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:49,119
and it's a bit slower overall do you

1364
00:45:47,358 --> 00:45:50,960
still think that it's worthy of the

1365
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:53,280
title of like it's a good plant or do

1366
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,960
you think that it's just like worth the

1367
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,519
hassle but overall it's probably not

1368
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,880
really a great plant so to speak

1369
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:01,599
no i mean when it when i mean the

1370
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:03,200
flowers are are i mean that like

1371
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,640
whenever i have any of it

1372
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:06,960
i mean there's plenty of people that

1373
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:09,759
like if they want to run it into ice you

1374
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:11,838
know like ice wax or uh like you know as

1375
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,800
far as like making it into hash or even

1376
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:14,559
you know just

1377
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,880
it's i mean it's sold always it's just

1378
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:19,119
not necessarily the most lucrative plan

1379
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,318
to to run when you're when you're when

1380
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:22,640
you're running

1381
00:46:20,318 --> 00:46:24,400
you know when you're growing um

1382
00:46:22,639 --> 00:46:26,318
but uh but i mean i always love having

1383
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,519
it around it's it's definitely

1384
00:46:26,318 --> 00:46:29,679
very much

1385
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:31,199
a really good a good plant but i feel

1386
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:33,118
like the offspring

1387
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:34,719
in itself too is actually

1388
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:36,720
it you know that it holds a lot of

1389
00:46:34,719 --> 00:46:38,559
weight as far as uh again against it as

1390
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:40,000
well you know so i kind of prefer to

1391
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:42,078
work with the offspring as far as like

1392
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,079
you know just like the dositos or even

1393
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:45,680
the ogb blueberry headband that like you

1394
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:47,760
know that i just did all those plants

1395
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:50,239
are going to be like definitively a lot

1396
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:52,160
more like have more vigor and just be

1397
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:53,598
more like easier to work with you know

1398
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:57,358
so

1399
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:58,640
yeah fantastic um so i guess before we

1400
00:46:57,358 --> 00:47:00,719
jump into the

1401
00:46:58,639 --> 00:47:02,879
ogb blueberry headband stuff a little

1402
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:05,759
more i do have one last question do you

1403
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:07,358
have any other plants which kind of fit

1404
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:09,200
that category where you know it is a

1405
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:10,799
little bit finicky and most people don't

1406
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:13,199
put in the effort but you still keep it

1407
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,400
around because it's the killer

1408
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:16,639
i mean

1409
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,079
i not really like honestly like that's

1410
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:20,000
the one plant that

1411
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:21,839
i will always make space for in my veg

1412
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,800
in my bedroom um i know that there's

1413
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:27,199
like a i hear like the mac one is like

1414
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,559
very similar and like it's a like uh

1415
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:30,960
characteristics as far as like

1416
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:33,760
vegetative growth i've not i don't have

1417
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,199
that plan i've never grown it so i i

1418
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,400
couldn't say anything you know about

1419
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:38,639
that um

1420
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,599
but as far as just the og kb just it's

1421
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:40,400
uh

1422
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:42,318
like

1423
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,519
i mean it's clearly it's it's it's a

1424
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:45,199
it's a plant worth keeping around

1425
00:47:43,519 --> 00:47:47,280
considering it's notoriety at this point

1426
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:50,239
so

1427
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:51,760
wow you've never grown the mac one i

1428
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:54,479
guess you're one of the few people to

1429
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:57,920
resist the overwhelming hype

1430
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:59,679
i mean i i mean i i i know cap like if

1431
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:02,000
i'm sure if i wanted to go grab a cut i

1432
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:04,000
could go down you know see him and and

1433
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,800
you know grab it i i run

1434
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,239
uh like like some of his seeds and

1435
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,000
all that stuff it's just more of i'm not

1436
00:48:08,239 --> 00:48:12,959
really one like the type of person to go

1437
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,838
out and like uh like seek certain things

1438
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,240
um

1439
00:48:13,838 --> 00:48:17,920
i mean i've seen flowers of the mack one

1440
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:19,519
but yeah it's just i don't know man i'm

1441
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,119
like i kind of just work with what i

1442
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:23,039
work with because i'm already sifting

1443
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:25,838
through so much stuff as it is

1444
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:27,679
uh and it's um it's kind of like

1445
00:48:25,838 --> 00:48:30,000
uh it's i mean it's a good thing and a

1446
00:48:27,679 --> 00:48:31,679
bad thing but because like there's a lot

1447
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,920
of a lot of [ __ ] that you have to

1448
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:34,719
sit through but uh you know like i like

1449
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,240
i have

1450
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:37,759
so many seeds and things that i like

1451
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:39,199
crosses that i've already made that i'm

1452
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,400
kind of like i kind of try to focus on

1453
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:41,919
that

1454
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,358
yeah for sure

1455
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,639
but i gotta ask

1456
00:48:43,358 --> 00:48:48,558
did you end up getting into like gg4 or

1457
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:51,440
skittles or any of the other commonly

1458
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:53,920
hyped ones of recent

1459
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:55,920
um i mean i literally just got a

1460
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:58,480
skittles clone um

1461
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:01,119
probably like like a month ago but like

1462
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:03,838
like like i said for me um

1463
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:05,920
i'm you know like gorilla glue 4 was

1464
00:49:03,838 --> 00:49:06,960
like i i want to say it was that that's

1465
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:09,838
josie's

1466
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:13,920
uh like clone and whatnot and i've ran

1467
00:49:09,838 --> 00:49:17,759
it but before i i like it it just um it

1468
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:19,680
wasn't it didn't it tended to get over

1469
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,040
like overproduced to the sense where

1470
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:22,159
like it actually like the market got

1471
00:49:21,039 --> 00:49:24,239
kind of saturated with like a lot of

1472
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:26,639
gorilla glue as a result of that because

1473
00:49:24,239 --> 00:49:28,558
it was a huge yielder and it was it

1474
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:31,598
wasn't that tough to grow

1475
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:33,599
so um but skittles i mean i like it

1476
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:35,280
wrong but like i said i kind of tend to

1477
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:37,039
focus on a lot of stuff like that i'm

1478
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,800
already doing myself as far as like you

1479
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:41,599
know my own work

1480
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:44,480
of course so let's jump back into the og

1481
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:45,519
kb x2 which is the blueberry headband

1482
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,960
cross

1483
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:48,960
what do you hope to pair with that like

1484
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,960
do you plan to find a male from that and

1485
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,720
then pair that with stuff or use that as

1486
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:55,920
the mothers

1487
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:58,078
i mean with that one i mean at like

1488
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:00,480
it basically was a cross that i made uh

1489
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:02,559
an outdoor cross and so like i i still

1490
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,000
have some seeds left of it i can which i

1491
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:06,319
can sort through like i said a lot of

1492
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:09,119
those seeds from the original og kb are

1493
00:50:06,318 --> 00:50:10,838
typically not like non-viable i think i

1494
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:15,280
like i said i

1495
00:50:10,838 --> 00:50:16,880
i i planted like 72 in a tray and i

1496
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:19,440
probably got like

1497
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:21,838
like you know 14 or something like out

1498
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:24,000
of that um and so

1499
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:26,000
like you know for me i still have

1500
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,679
i probably still got another like 20 or

1501
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,920
30 seeds left that i can sort through

1502
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:32,719
and whatnot but that og kb blu-ray

1503
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:34,400
headband was definitely um like you know

1504
00:50:32,719 --> 00:50:37,358
as far as like what i wanted out of the

1505
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:39,280
og kb it was it definitely like brought

1506
00:50:37,358 --> 00:50:41,440
more vigor into it and i also like it

1507
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:43,760
has more like the blueberry nose on it

1508
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:45,039
so it's um and like and like i said

1509
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:47,040
right now like compounds going to be

1510
00:50:45,039 --> 00:50:49,199
working with it so i'm like i'm really

1511
00:50:47,039 --> 00:50:52,318
more excited about that whole situation

1512
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:55,039
um you know and like see where that that

1513
00:50:52,318 --> 00:50:56,558
like that all goes that's cool and so

1514
00:50:55,039 --> 00:50:58,719
you plan to

1515
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:00,640
get a few females together and then

1516
00:50:58,719 --> 00:51:03,439
he'll provide the mail or do you know

1517
00:51:00,639 --> 00:51:05,358
how you plan to do the co-lab exactly

1518
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:07,280
i mean i i pretty much i made this

1519
00:51:05,358 --> 00:51:08,960
election and then i gave him the uh like

1520
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:11,119
he saw the flowers and was like oh damn

1521
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,639
like i like he liked it a lot so he was

1522
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:14,880
like you know whatever like we should do

1523
00:51:12,639 --> 00:51:15,759
like you know i guess collaboration and

1524
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,519
so

1525
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:19,359
um you know that's pretty much like

1526
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:20,480
where we're at now so he's i was like

1527
00:51:19,358 --> 00:51:21,920
yeah if you want to take it and like

1528
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,039
work with it go like you know go ahead

1529
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,119
dude you can do whatever you want with

1530
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:26,880
it and so that's uh like i said i don't

1531
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:28,960
know exactly we haven't really discussed

1532
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:31,039
exactly what he's gonna do with it as

1533
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:33,838
far as like what males he's gonna use to

1534
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:35,838
uh to pollinate it but i mean i'm just

1535
00:51:33,838 --> 00:51:37,119
excited that like you know that that

1536
00:51:35,838 --> 00:51:39,599
work is getting you know like it's

1537
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:41,358
progressing and and whatnot because i

1538
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:43,280
don't um i don't i can't always be

1539
00:51:41,358 --> 00:51:44,558
pollinating things um you know

1540
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:47,040
considering like

1541
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:48,800
you know my like you know like my the

1542
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:49,679
spaces that i have and whatnot

1543
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,280
so

1544
00:51:49,679 --> 00:51:52,960
do you think that you'll ever open your

1545
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:56,000
own seed company or do you prefer to do

1546
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:58,079
this sort of collab type of creation

1547
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,559
no i mean honestly like it's i mean like

1548
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:02,720
like you said i i really would i like

1549
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:05,040
i'd rather work with people and you know

1550
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:07,358
like i i like the idea of it um you know

1551
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:09,358
like i think like collaborative minds um

1552
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:11,440
when they come together they like a lot

1553
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:12,639
of like good stuff can come from that so

1554
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:15,679
i mean i'm not trying to be a jack of

1555
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:17,358
all trades uh and you know like i just

1556
00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:18,639
like i like i appreciate the fact that

1557
00:52:17,358 --> 00:52:20,799
certain people are even willing to work

1558
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:22,000
with me and things like that but i'm

1559
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,760
like you know as far as like

1560
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,719
establishing a seed company i mean i'd

1561
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,640
rather

1562
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:28,558
i'd rather work with somebody that i

1563
00:52:26,639 --> 00:52:30,078
already know and you know let them do

1564
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:31,760
their thing and then we can figure it

1565
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:33,839
out from there you know but i'm not i'm

1566
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:35,599
not uh i just i don't really have the

1567
00:52:33,838 --> 00:52:37,279
time for that at the moment and i don't

1568
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:38,960
really see myself having the time for

1569
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:41,040
that

1570
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,960
yeah okay so i mean with that being said

1571
00:52:41,039 --> 00:52:44,558
what do you perceive as your future

1572
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,079
within the cannabis industry where do

1573
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:47,760
you see it going and what do you think

1574
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:50,000
your role will be

1575
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:51,440
i mean for me like i like i i'm pretty

1576
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,599
tied up with like a lot of my consulting

1577
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:55,519
work as far as um you know designing

1578
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:57,359
like certain facilities and and uh

1579
00:52:55,519 --> 00:52:59,358
things like that we you know right now

1580
00:52:57,358 --> 00:53:00,558
we just submitted our application to uh

1581
00:52:59,358 --> 00:53:02,639
in illinois

1582
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:04,800
and so once that goes through and if

1583
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:06,639
everything is you know good with that

1584
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,400
then i'll definitely be busy with that

1585
00:53:06,639 --> 00:53:10,799
but i mean i just i i just like growing

1586
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,920
leaning like it's um it's like i've

1587
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,440
always liked

1588
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,519
that you know

1589
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:17,440
like the plants and you know as far as

1590
00:53:15,519 --> 00:53:19,519
like working with them and

1591
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:21,200
just just uh being around them really

1592
00:53:19,519 --> 00:53:22,800
it's very like it's therapeutic in a

1593
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:25,039
sense you know and then also the fact

1594
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,720
that like certain you know like i i

1595
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:28,880
would like to do more research as far as

1596
00:53:26,719 --> 00:53:31,279
going into strains that are like more

1597
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:33,599
medically uh like you know they have

1598
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:35,680
more like like medicinal benefits and

1599
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:37,599
you know things like that as as far as

1600
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:38,799
like word you know where they tend to

1601
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:41,280
help people out with like certain

1602
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:42,559
ailments they have and you know uh like

1603
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:45,200
things like that like that's kind of

1604
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:46,800
what kind of drives me in a sense

1605
00:53:45,199 --> 00:53:48,558
that's really cool in terms of the

1606
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:50,079
medicinal stuff you just mentioned do

1607
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:52,400
you think that that will take you into

1608
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:53,519
the kind of cbd realm or are you talking

1609
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,838
more of like

1610
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:58,960
just a regular thc dominant strain but

1611
00:53:55,838 --> 00:54:00,400
it just also happens to help with x or y

1612
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,358
uh i mean

1613
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,358
like

1614
00:54:01,358 --> 00:54:05,199
uh there's i mean the the i feel like

1615
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:07,039
the sky is kind of the limit it sounds

1616
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:09,118
kind of like weird but like there's so

1617
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:11,599
much stuff we don't know about the like

1618
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:13,039
the cannabis plant at this point um like

1619
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:16,480
certain compounds that we're just like

1620
00:54:13,039 --> 00:54:18,079
discovering and seeing how they uh like

1621
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,480
like you know medicinally like how they

1622
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:22,720
affect people and stuff like that so

1623
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:24,719
it's it's like like i said uh at the end

1624
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:25,679
of the day i'm just happy to to provide

1625
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:26,399
like a

1626
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:28,318
a

1627
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,559
a service for people if like if they

1628
00:54:28,318 --> 00:54:32,960
feel like the you know these you know

1629
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:35,200
these certain strains um you know

1630
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:37,039
medicinally benefit them

1631
00:54:35,199 --> 00:54:38,639
and are there any conditions that are

1632
00:54:37,039 --> 00:54:40,400

able to work on or anything which

1635
00:54:41,838 --> 00:54:46,400
catches your eye you just it's just a

1636
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,519
general topic of interest

1637
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,920
i mean

1638
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:51,759
like i feel like like uh like cannabis

1639
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,920
is so subjective that

1640
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:56,160
it's you know when you when you smoke

1641
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:58,000
like someone could smoke a sativa and

1642
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:58,879
tell you it's a sativa

1643
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,400
um

1644
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:02,640
and then someone else could be like oh

1645
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,160
that you know that same strain like kind

1646
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:06,078
of put me to sleep or like they feel

1647
00:55:04,159 --> 00:55:07,759
like it's more indica dominant it's i

1648
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:10,160
just feel like it's very subjective but

1649
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:12,640
at the end of the day if you know that

1650
00:55:10,159 --> 00:55:14,399
like like like i said if any of my work

1651
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:16,558
or whatever can help anybody out as far

1652
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,559
as um you know like like you know

1653
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:20,400
therapeutically or like medically i mean

1654
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:22,480
that's just very uh

1655
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:24,079
it's it's very um

1656
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:26,159
you know like it's

1657
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:28,400
it's it you know it makes you know makes

1658
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:30,960
you feel good in a sense you know

1659
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:32,639
yeah definitely definitely

1660
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,639
so you mentioned that you submitted an

1661
00:55:32,639 --> 00:55:36,480
application illinois soon

1662
00:55:34,639 --> 00:55:39,279
i mean given we're dealing with kind of

1663
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:41,280
this current corona uncertainty thing

1664
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:43,200
going on how do you perceive that's

1665
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:44,720
going to affect your work in general do

1666
00:55:43,199 --> 00:55:45,919
you think everything will come to a

1667
00:55:44,719 --> 00:55:47,439
grinding hold or do you think the

1668
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,960
cannabis industry will kind of keep

1669
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:51,599
doing its thing

1670
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:53,838
i mean i mean i it's it's really hard to

1671
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:56,079
say like i know that the

1672
00:55:53,838 --> 00:55:57,759
the application deadline was extended by

1673
00:55:56,079 --> 00:56:00,559
two weeks in illinois because of the

1674
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:03,520
whole corona virus thing um so

1675
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:04,640
that's one thing um and then um

1676
00:56:03,519 --> 00:56:06,880
it's uh

1677
00:56:04,639 --> 00:56:09,199
i mean yeah well they may extend it even

1678
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:11,760
further and also like as far as on the

1679
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:14,719
application process they were requiring

1680
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:17,280
people to submit the application itself

1681
00:56:14,719 --> 00:56:18,239
in person to like the office i guess it

1682
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:21,599
was

1683
00:56:18,239 --> 00:56:23,759
in springfield um and uh and now they

1684
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:25,599
they don't even want you to do that so

1685
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,880
like um i like i couldn't tell you to

1686
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:28,960
the extent that it actually is gonna

1687
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:31,680
affect everything but it actually it has

1688
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,880
affected you know somewhat already like

1689
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:34,159
they don't they don't want to take any

1690
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:36,318
applications from anybody in person

1691
00:56:34,159 --> 00:56:38,159
anymore you have to mail them in and

1692
00:56:36,318 --> 00:56:39,838
things like that as far as like moving

1693
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:41,440
you know down the road

1694
00:56:39,838 --> 00:56:43,119
um i mean

1695
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,960
who knows man with this uh with this

1696
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:46,640
whole situation i i wouldn't

1697
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:48,480
i wouldn't have uh

1698
00:56:46,639 --> 00:56:50,078
a forecast that i would even get to this

1699
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:52,798
point as far as like where we're at now

1700
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:54,720
or literally like we can't you know

1701
00:56:52,798 --> 00:56:55,838
can't leave our houses you know

1702
00:56:54,719 --> 00:56:57,598
yeah

1703
00:56:55,838 --> 00:56:59,838
well we've heard a general sentiment

1704
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:00,720
from a lot of notable instagram figures

1705
00:56:59,838 --> 00:57:02,159
saying

1706
00:57:00,719 --> 00:57:04,159
you know now is a great time to just

1707
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:06,639
spend some time with your plants do you

1708
00:57:04,159 --> 00:57:08,000
feel like that's a good idea

1709
00:57:06,639 --> 00:57:09,199
yeah i mean i got nothing better to do

1710
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,318
really you know

1711
00:57:09,199 --> 00:57:14,399
so it's like uh like like literally like

1712
00:57:12,318 --> 00:57:17,119
hang out with my dog and and you know

1713
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:18,400
yeah just basically like yeah like just

1714
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:21,280
put some more work in the garden there's

1715
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:23,119
nothing else to do um

1716
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:25,519
you know typically there's

1717
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:27,920
other stuff to uh

1718
00:57:25,519 --> 00:57:29,519
to uh like i guess attend to or whatnot

1719
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:32,079
but at this point

1720
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:34,400
we're not supposed to leave our house so

1721
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:36,400
yeah definitely so

1722
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,440
just to kind of jump back for a little

1723
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,960
bit

1724
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:40,559
was there any certain point when you

1725
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:42,880
were on the forums where you felt like

1726
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:44,559
you started to have like some kind of

1727
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:47,680
notoriety so to speak or do you feel

1728
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:50,000

and

1736
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,639
some things don't always necessarily

1737
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:04,960
work out with the

1738
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:06,480

just know that we were doing a bunch of

1743
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:17,599
like documenting as far as the uh you

1744
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:19,200
know as far as the cuts that we had and

1745

to you know to to uh to you know

1752
00:58:31,358 --> 00:58:34,639
to basically accept the fact that like

1753
00:58:33,519 --> 00:58:36,239
you're you know like that there's

1754
00:58:34,639 --> 00:58:39,920
notoriety that comes along with like the

1755
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:42,798
territory that you know i'm in i guess

1756
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:44,720
yeah ever humble that's always nice so

i mean like i see mag was good at one

1761
00:58:51,358 --> 00:58:55,598
point i think it's very convoluted like

1762
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:57,280
watered down at this point um just

1763
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:59,760
because you have so many like new newbie

1764
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:02,880
growers uh but it was like it was you

1765
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:07,040

like uh

1771
00:59:12,798 --> 00:59:17,759
like a the you know huge like a library

1772
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,000
to basically learn like about growing at

1773

00:59:51,039 --> 00:59:55,838
like like i said i i kind of stuck to i

1789
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:57,838
see mag and that was about it but it was

1790
00:59:55,838 --> 00:59:59,440
never about like gaining any notoriety

1791
00:59:57,838 --> 01:00:02,239
or anything like that like really when i

1792
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:04,639
jumped onto like uh instagram was when i

1793
01:00:02,239 --> 01:00:07,919
noticed that like a instagram was a huge

1794
01:00:04,639 --> 01:00:09,279
marketing tool um and you know it was i

1795
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,720
was very surprised at how like

1796
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,440
everything from there to kind of took

1797
01:00:10,719 --> 01:00:14,000
off

1798
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:15,679
um you know and so it was like when i

1799
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,599
when i said i'm like my instagram handle

1800
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:18,960
people were like recognizing me for the

1801
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:20,960
forums and i was like how like how do

1802
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:23,039
you know about about that

1803
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:25,039
and uh and you know people had basically

1804
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:26,400
had been following my work and so

1805
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:29,119
they were you know they were like kind

1806
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:31,680
of like like are you that person from

1807
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:33,680
you know whatever i see mag and uh and

1808
01:00:31,679 --> 01:00:36,480
yes it was that's kind of what surprised

1809
01:00:33,679 --> 01:00:38,318
me a little bit and whatnot

1810
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:40,318
yeah okay well i mean you mentioned the

1811
01:00:38,318 --> 01:00:42,960
marketing of instagram

1812
01:00:40,318 --> 01:00:44,239
do you look at cookie fam now and feel

1813
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:46,400
like they've done a pretty good job

1814
01:00:44,239 --> 01:00:49,358
marketing and if you were to say that

1815
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:53,039
who do you put the uh like the kudos to

1816
01:00:49,358 --> 01:00:54,558
who out of the cookie fans the marketer

1817
01:00:53,039 --> 01:00:56,480
i mean i don't think cookie fam did

1818
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:58,880
anything really they like realistically

1819
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:01,119
like burner is the one that actually uh

1820
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:02,960
hyped the strain like um

1821
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:04,400
at the end of the day like the strain

1822
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:06,720
actually kind of held its own weight

1823
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,880
because it was like i said cookies was

1824
01:01:06,719 --> 01:01:10,959
definitely a game changer but

1825
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:13,200
um like i don't i don't you know i don't

1826
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:15,440
i don't see how they did anything to

1827
01:01:13,199 --> 01:01:16,798
like uh fuel that whole situation uh

1828
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:18,960
burner definitely

1829
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:20,798
definitely did um but at the end of the

1830
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:22,079
day like it's i mean it's kind of ironic

1831
01:01:20,798 --> 01:01:24,480
like a lot of people

1832
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:27,359
uh assume like burner's like a like a

1833
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:28,719
weed grower i'm like he i mean he might

1834
01:01:27,358 --> 01:01:30,239
have grown weed back in the day or

1835
01:01:28,719 --> 01:01:32,480
whatever but he's more of a hustler in a

1836
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:34,719
sense which i mean i totally respect but

1837
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:36,559
uh but like you know like he

1838
01:01:34,719 --> 01:01:38,879
he uh he was the one that fueled the

1839
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:40,798
whole cookies hype it's it's uh

1840
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:42,400
it's you know that's that's i i would

1841
01:01:40,798 --> 01:01:44,960
say that's really who's responsible for

1842
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:46,798
it if not like uh scherbinski like but

1843
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,760
he's he kind of branched off and did his

1844
01:01:46,798 --> 01:01:51,280
own thing

1845
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:52,960
um but he also had like the the

1846
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:54,640
you know the um

1847
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:56,720
the the momentum from like the whole

1848
01:01:54,639 --> 01:01:58,239
cookies thing as well

1849
01:01:56,719 --> 01:02:00,000
you read my mind that was going to be

1850
01:01:58,239 --> 01:02:01,759
the next question it was about shibinsky

1851
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,239
and how he branched off so what i want

1852
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:06,079
to know is he's been name-dropped a lot

1853
01:02:04,239 --> 01:02:07,919
in a lot of pop culture like even in a

1854
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:10,640
calvin harris song which is pretty good

1855
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:12,559
for him um do you feel like he's done a

1856
01:02:10,639 --> 01:02:14,078
better job and furthermore what do you

1857
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:16,240
think will happen to the cookies brand

1858
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:18,480
if they continue to be passive as you

1859
01:02:16,239 --> 01:02:20,318
said

1860
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:22,240
uh i mean there's only so much that that

1861
01:02:20,318 --> 01:02:24,639
they that that i mean they can actually

1862
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:26,318
do i think uh scherbinski's definitely a

1863
01:02:24,639 --> 01:02:28,639
lot more of a

1864
01:02:26,318 --> 01:02:31,440
like a marketing type of person and like

1865
01:02:28,639 --> 01:02:32,879
you know um that's [ __ ] great for him

1866
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:34,960
i like said i'll never hate on anybody

1867
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:36,798
you know i mean but um even like when he

1868
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:38,559
branched off from the actual

1869
01:02:36,798 --> 01:02:40,639
cookie fam and all that other [ __ ] like

1870
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:42,798
like initially i was like i like you

1871
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:44,078
know i didn't i couldn't foresee how it

1872
01:02:42,798 --> 01:02:45,759
was actually going to work out for him

1873
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:49,200
and whatnot but i've i've met him he's

1874
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:51,039
cool as dude um i mean you know like he

1875
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:52,239
like you know i'm i'm very happy for

1876
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:54,000
anybody that's [ __ ] making anything

1877
01:02:52,239 --> 01:02:56,479
happen at this you know in this industry

1878
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:59,519
and whatnot um but he's i mean you know

1879
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:01,760
he's he's definitely more of a of a

1880
01:02:59,519 --> 01:03:03,280
marketing type of person you know in in

1881
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:05,280
the mix as far as

1882
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:08,160
uh you know like branding and things

1883
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:10,000
like that which is actually um like it's

1884
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:12,480
it's very surprising how everything's

1885
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:14,239
come together nowadays as far as

1886
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:16,480
branding within like the industry and

1887
01:03:14,239 --> 01:03:18,399
all that it's like a lot like

1888
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:19,199
it goes a long ways you know i i would

1889
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:21,680
have never thought that it would have

1890
01:03:19,199 --> 01:03:23,598
came with this

1891
01:03:21,679 --> 01:03:24,879
do you feel like it would be wrong to

1892
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:28,079
say that

1893
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:30,880
cookies in a sense was the root of where

1894
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:32,400
all this bloody branded mylar bag comes

1895
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:34,318
from if you like kind of really think

1896
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:36,480
about it

1897
01:03:34,318 --> 01:03:38,880
i mean i mean not not at all like i mean

1898
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:41,199
it's uh cookies is the basis for pretty

1899
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:44,240
much i mean even the

1900
01:03:41,199 --> 01:03:45,519
like uh the dos like dositos like what

1901
01:03:44,239 --> 01:03:47,919
like whatever it all it all kind of

1902
01:03:45,519 --> 01:03:50,318
stems from from there um i mean we're

1903
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:53,039
just like uh

1904
01:03:50,318 --> 01:03:55,679
burner base i mean he has a platform to

1905
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:58,400
basically promote this like that strain

1906
01:03:55,679 --> 01:04:01,199
and he has a huge following and uh and

1907
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:02,798
as a result it kind of uh it's like a

1908
01:04:01,199 --> 01:04:04,719
trickle-down effect so where you know

1909
01:04:02,798 --> 01:04:06,880
anything associated with it can actually

1910
01:04:04,719 --> 01:04:09,519
you know be very you know worthy of

1911
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:12,079
recognition in a sense um so like you

1912
01:04:09,519 --> 01:04:14,480
know like sure like i said like you know

1913
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:16,000
sherbinsky um

1914
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:17,920
as far as like him branching off and

1915
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,519
doing his own thing like he does have

1916
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:21,680
you know very prominent strains that are

1917
01:04:19,519 --> 01:04:23,920
like pretty well known in the industry

1918
01:04:21,679 --> 01:04:25,519
uh like under under his belt and whatnot

1919
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:27,760
um but

1920
01:04:25,519 --> 01:04:29,679
it's uh yeah i think

1921
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:32,079
it's you know like i like you can't deny

1922
01:04:29,679 --> 01:04:33,519
the fact that like cookies literally is

1923
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:35,039
the basis for a lot of the stuff that's

1924
01:04:33,519 --> 01:04:36,480
going on now in the industry that's the

1925
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:38,880
bottom line

1926
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:40,880
of course yeah i think that you can

1927
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:43,119
reduce it all down to like cookies and

1928
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:44,079
tk

1929
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:46,240
yeah i mean

1930
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:49,359
i mean a lot i mean a lot i i feel like

1931
01:04:46,239 --> 01:04:50,159
the tk is more of a connoisseur um

1932
01:04:49,358 --> 01:04:51,838
like

1933
01:04:50,159 --> 01:04:54,719
market most people would not know what

1934
01:04:51,838 --> 01:04:57,279
like what what the tk is you mean so

1935
01:04:54,719 --> 01:04:59,679
yeah but i mean like all the hybrids are

1936
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:01,920
like have those two components in them

1937
01:04:59,679 --> 01:05:03,598
mostly

1938
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:05,599
yeah i mean it's it's uh

1939
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:07,760
yeah i mean it's i'd like yeah i would

1940
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:08,798
not i would not uh argue with that for

1941
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:10,559
that way

1942
01:05:08,798 --> 01:05:13,679
but um at that like at the end of the

1943
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:15,599
day like like like i said uh

1944
01:05:13,679 --> 01:05:17,279
cookies is i mean there's a reason why

1945
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:18,720
it was a game changer in a sense it was

1946
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:20,559
definitely like when i first saw the

1947
01:05:18,719 --> 01:05:22,399
actual real deal cookies i was like oh

1948
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:23,760
this [ __ ] is actually fire like and the

1949
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,960
only other strain that i could attribute

1950
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:27,200
that to would be

1951
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:29,599
like uh the og kush like the like the

1952
01:05:27,199 --> 01:05:31,838
original sfv or the larry that that was

1953
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:34,798
around and then uh and also like the

1954
01:05:31,838 --> 01:05:36,798
urkel um like back then like nobody had

1955
01:05:34,798 --> 01:05:37,759
like purple strings it was kind of crazy

1956
01:05:36,798 --> 01:05:40,239
to to

1957
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:41,200
to see so

1958
01:05:40,239 --> 01:05:43,598
um

1959
01:05:41,199 --> 01:05:45,358
what did you make of the sherbets and

1960
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:47,920
the gelatos when they first came out did

1961
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:50,400
they impress you at all

1962
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:52,318
i mean honestly like i didn't i didn't

1963
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:54,559
uh i'm not i'm not the person to like go

1964
01:05:52,318 --> 01:05:56,639
go and seek out these strains and if it

1965
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:58,160
comes across me like like then i you

1966
01:05:56,639 --> 01:06:00,239
know i'll check it out and usually like

1967
01:05:58,159 --> 01:06:02,159
the people that i deal with they they're

1968
01:06:00,239 --> 01:06:03,759
uh they're

1969
01:06:02,159 --> 01:06:05,038
they they're

1970
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:06,720
you know they they hold some weight in

1971
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:08,799
the industry in a sense where like i

1972
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:11,759
would trust that whatever they had was

1973
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:13,199
legit um because like at some point

1974
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:15,440
everyone wants to kind of pass whatever

1975
01:06:13,199 --> 01:06:16,798
they have off as the sherbet or like

1976
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:18,480
gelato but

1977
01:06:16,798 --> 01:06:20,079
i mean it's you know that they're

1978
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:21,039
they're good strains they're wrong like

1979
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:22,798
but

1980
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:24,480
like you know like i was i didn't even

1981
01:06:22,798 --> 01:06:26,480
have any idea that the

1982
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:28,719
the the gelato like there was the

1983
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:30,318
different um different types are

1984
01:06:28,719 --> 01:06:33,279
basically just different phenotypes of

1985
01:06:30,318 --> 01:06:35,920
the same you know i guess like seeds

1986
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:38,079
uh and so i was like yeah i had no i you

1987
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:39,200
know the sahih and um

1988
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:41,119
the uh

1989
01:06:39,199 --> 01:06:42,798
like whatever other like you know

1990
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:45,039
phenotypes there are they're all kind of

1991
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:47,280
all based off the same seeds

1992
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:48,240
but um you know like that i mean they're

1993
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:51,200
they're good

1994
01:06:48,239 --> 01:06:54,078
i can't i can't deny that for sure

1995
01:06:51,199 --> 01:06:54,960
yeah for sure i'm a fan of the old 41

1996
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:57,519
but

1997
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:59,679
have you seen what the uh cookie fam are

1998
01:06:57,519 --> 01:07:03,358
doing now with their like their collab

1999
01:06:59,679 --> 01:07:05,759
with jbz and the mints thing

2000
01:07:03,358 --> 01:07:06,798
i mean i i have seen that like in there

2001
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:08,160
i mean

2002
01:07:06,798 --> 01:07:10,000
like there's definitely like a lot of

2003
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:12,399
good strains coming out of that uh out

2004
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,159
of that camp in a sense um

2005
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:16,240
like you know like i said then today

2006
01:07:14,159 --> 01:07:18,078
like i wish i'm not nothing but the best

2007
01:07:16,239 --> 01:07:20,159
um i'm in the same boat where i'm always

2008
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:22,240
looking for something better i just hope

2009
01:07:20,159 --> 01:07:24,318
that everything works out uh

2010
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:26,798
you know like for them and you know

2011
01:07:24,318 --> 01:07:28,000
there's uh there's when money comes into

2012
01:07:26,798 --> 01:07:29,920
play a lot of bridges get burned

2013
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:32,000
sometimes it ain't so

2014
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:33,440
yeah that's you know like that's uh but

2015
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,559
i mean they're they're doing good work

2016
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,920
so i hope everybody's getting

2017
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:37,359
compensated and everyone's getting paid

2018
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:39,039
and making money and you know be able to

2019
01:07:37,358 --> 01:07:40,798
take care of their family

2020
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:43,039
of course

2021
01:07:40,798 --> 01:07:45,440
so a sentiment we've heard echoed by

2022
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:46,720
many different people over the past few

2023
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:48,960
years is that

2024
01:07:46,719 --> 01:07:50,399
everyone's so hyped over like these new

2025
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:51,920
school things but people don't really

2026
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:54,079
give enough credit to how some of the

2027
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:55,680
old-school strains were really awesome

2028
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:57,519
do you kind of feel like you're into

2029
01:07:55,679 --> 01:07:59,838
that mentality or are you not really

2030
01:07:57,519 --> 01:08:01,838
subscribing to that

2031
01:07:59,838 --> 01:08:03,759
i mean i i i'm

2032
01:08:01,838 --> 01:08:05,759
like i i love old school strains man

2033
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:08,480
like the problem is they're just not

2034
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:09,760
like necessarily available anymore so

2035
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:10,719
and like a lot of the new stuff is

2036
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:13,440
definitely

2037
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:15,439
um like very you know like there's a lot

2038
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:16,560
of not like nice stuff that's out like

2039
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:19,679
nowadays

2040
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:21,279
but um you know like to be able to have

2041
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:23,600
like a like you know some land race

2042
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:26,480
genetics that are you know you know from

2043
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:27,679
back in the days it's just not really uh

2044
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:29,759
it's it's

2045
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:31,520
it's very few and far between like to

2046
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:34,479
actually come across them especially

2047
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:35,759
like the legit ones um you know there's

2048
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:37,439
there's a

2049
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:38,880
yeah i mean there's

2050
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:41,358
like there's certain like there was a

2051
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:42,880
like that the pepper uh pheno of romulan

2052
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:45,120
that i like is very like for me like

2053
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:46,079
very nostalgic um

2054
01:08:45,119 --> 01:08:47,358
like

2055
01:08:46,079 --> 01:08:48,559
probably a couple others i can't even

2056
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:50,319
think about them right now off the top

2057
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:51,920
of my head but but uh like things like

2058
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:54,400
that you're not probably not not going

2059
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:56,640
to come across them again

2060
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:59,278
yeah wow pepper fino of romeo and i've

2061
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:01,119
only really heard of a berry one

2062
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:03,120
yeah there was a grape one but there was

2063
01:09:01,119 --> 01:09:04,880
also a pepper one um i mean i actually

2064
01:09:03,119 --> 01:09:06,719
brought it back from amsterdam when i

2065
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:08,640
when i came back um

2066
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:10,560
you know from the cannabis cup and like

2067
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:13,039
i think it was like 2006

2068
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:15,440
and um and yeah like i brought back the

2069
01:09:13,039 --> 01:09:17,439
seeds and and there there was i know i

2070
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:20,000
know the grape pheno was that was one of

2071
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:22,238
the uh one of the more prominent ones as

2072
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:24,319
far as like that that was one around but

2073
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:27,039
there was also the pepper fino that was

2074
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:29,759
very like kind of like spicy and it was

2075
01:09:27,039 --> 01:09:32,158
like yeah like like i said in the day

2076
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:33,838
like if i had it today um

2077
01:09:32,158 --> 01:09:35,519
there's

2078
01:09:33,838 --> 01:09:37,119
you're probably not you're going to get

2079
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:40,239
more money for things that are a lot

2080
01:09:37,119 --> 01:09:42,479
more hyped up like like jbz stuff or you

2081
01:09:40,238 --> 01:09:44,079
know gelatos or you know sherbets and

2082
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:44,879
all that stuff you know all that stuff

2083
01:09:44,079 --> 01:09:46,559
so

2084
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:48,640
it's uh it's more of a personal

2085
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:50,159
preference to run them and you know keep

2086
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:52,719
them in the stable

2087
01:09:50,158 --> 01:09:55,198
so when you pop new seeds do you like to

2088
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:58,158
delve into some old some new or you find

2089
01:09:55,198 --> 01:09:59,359
it's fairly much the new

2090
01:09:58,158 --> 01:10:01,359
um i mean

2091
01:09:59,359 --> 01:10:03,039
like as far as like uh like

2092
01:10:01,359 --> 01:10:04,639
as far as what i'm looking for or yeah

2093
01:10:03,039 --> 01:10:05,920
like if you're gonna do like a fino hunt

2094
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:07,440
just kind of you know look through some

2095
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:10,158
new stuff

2096
01:10:07,439 --> 01:10:11,839
yeah i mean it's it's uh

2097
01:10:10,158 --> 01:10:14,238
for me like it's it's i mean there's a

2098
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:15,679
lot of stuff that gets uh

2099
01:10:14,238 --> 01:10:17,039
that ends up you know you have to sit

2100
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:18,800
through a lot of the [ __ ] to get to

2101
01:10:17,039 --> 01:10:21,359
the good stuff and so that's that's just

2102
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:23,119
kind of like the reality of it um you

2103
01:10:21,359 --> 01:10:24,960
know but like when i'm selecting like

2104
01:10:23,119 --> 01:10:26,319
males or you know and like crossing them

2105
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,679
to certain females

2106
01:10:26,319 --> 01:10:30,559
it you know it's all like a matter of

2107
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:32,800
selection and um you never know exactly

2108
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:34,159
what what's going to come about but for

2109
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:36,640
the most part if you put your best foot

2110
01:10:34,158 --> 01:10:38,399
forward you usually will get something

2111
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:40,400
you know like you know something worthy

2112
01:10:38,399 --> 01:10:42,158
of keeping around but at the end of the

2113
01:10:40,399 --> 01:10:42,960
day too everyone gets tired of [ __ ] like

2114
01:10:42,158 --> 01:10:44,639
after

2115
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:46,000
you know you you run the same strain for

2116
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:48,000
like a year year and a half people are

2117
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,880
gonna get tired of it no matter what

2118
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,719
do you think that popping new seeds is

2119
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:54,000
really kind of a vital thing to the

2120
01:10:52,719 --> 01:10:56,399
scene

2121
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:58,000
i mean yeah it is it's honestly like as

2122
01:10:56,399 --> 01:10:59,759
far as like uh

2123
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,679
like uh like i mean the longer you keep

2124
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:03,760
a plant alive the the more of an

2125
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:06,239
instance it has to actually

2126
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:08,800
become you know a diseased or like have

2127
01:11:06,238 --> 01:11:11,439
like a like like some sort of a like

2128
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:13,520
pest and infection i you know i guess if

2129
01:11:11,439 --> 01:11:16,000
that's what you want to call it um

2130
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:17,120
and so like seeds are are you know

2131
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,520
definitely

2132
01:11:17,119 --> 01:11:21,519
you know like if you constantly are

2133
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:22,960
are uh popping seeds and looking through

2134
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:24,320
stuff which like i said in the day you

2135
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:26,000
have like you have to sit through a lot

2136
01:11:24,319 --> 01:11:27,840
of [ __ ] to get to some good stuff

2137
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:30,319
sometimes depending on the stability of

2138
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:31,199
like like a lot of the the genetics

2139
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:32,799
um

2140
01:11:31,198 --> 01:11:35,519
like you know like you're gonna always

2141
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:37,360
have like new stuff i i love that the

2142
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:39,520
idea of always having something new to

2143
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:41,359
like look forward to even though like

2144
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:44,000
it's not always gonna be like not

2145
01:11:41,359 --> 01:11:46,479
everything's a winner you know

2146
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:49,359
yeah okay i definitely feel like we've

2147
01:11:46,479 --> 01:11:51,678
all had our fair share of junk seeds but

2148
01:11:49,359 --> 01:11:53,759
in that kind of same vein of thought

2149
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:55,840
when you are popping seeds do you

2150
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:57,119
subscribe to this idea of like maybe

2151
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:59,199
popping a certain amount like for

2152
01:11:57,119 --> 01:12:00,800
example if i gave you five seats would

2153
01:11:59,198 --> 01:12:02,399
you be like man it's not really enough

2154
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:05,600
to do a good hunt or do you just

2155
01:12:02,399 --> 01:12:05,599
whatever's there is there

2156
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:08,399
well i mean

2157
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:10,800
i mean if someone give me five seeds i'd

2158
01:12:08,399 --> 01:12:12,399
just plant the five seeds like uh it's

2159
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:14,000
uh you know beggars can't be choosers in

2160
01:12:12,399 --> 01:12:15,039
a sense uh

2161
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,960
but

2162
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:18,960
like yeah i mean it's definitely nice to

2163
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:20,960
have like more of a

2164
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:22,719
like like a broader

2165
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:25,198
you know spectrum to like select from

2166
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:27,760
and whatnot but you know like you can

2167
01:12:25,198 --> 01:12:30,479
also you know you can find some some

2168
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:32,880
winners within five seeds um like like i

2169
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:35,279
said it's definitely nicer to have uh

2170
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:37,039
like like you know

2171
01:12:35,279 --> 01:12:38,399
a lot more to choose from but

2172
01:12:37,039 --> 01:12:40,319
you know at the end of the day it you

2173
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:41,439
know it is what it is like it's uh you

2174
01:12:40,319 --> 01:12:43,039
know like i'm at the end of the day i'm

2175
01:12:41,439 --> 01:12:44,399
probably going to narrow it down to

2176
01:12:43,039 --> 01:12:46,158
probably like a few phenotypes and

2177
01:12:44,399 --> 01:12:47,839
that's it and then toss everything else

2178
01:12:46,158 --> 01:12:49,920
like it's it's it's easy to get like

2179
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:51,440
attached to wanting to keep certain

2180
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:53,760
things around but at the end of the day

2181
01:12:51,439 --> 01:12:54,960
it's just like you have to realize like

2182
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:56,159
like there's always going to be

2183
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:58,239
something better you just got to keep

2184
01:12:56,158 --> 01:13:01,039
looking you know

2185
01:12:58,238 --> 01:13:02,639
definitely so when you do a pheno hunt

2186
01:13:01,039 --> 01:13:05,119
do you like to

2187
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:06,880
run the keeper so to speak as a clone a

2188
01:13:05,119 --> 01:13:08,238
few times before you rule at the keeper

2189
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:10,000
or do you feel like you've got a good

2190
01:13:08,238 --> 01:13:13,519
idea from the first run because i find

2191
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,520
people different opinions on this

2192
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:17,440
i mean yeah i mean you have to like like

2193
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:18,800
like uh i mean

2194
01:13:17,439 --> 01:13:20,639
it takes a little while to dial the

2195
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:23,279
strains in because they all have like

2196
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:24,960
different you know um like

2197
01:13:23,279 --> 01:13:26,800
nutritional requirements in a sense as

2198
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:29,920
far as like uh like

2199
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:31,679
like you know nutrients and whatnot um

2200
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:33,199
and like so your first round may not be

2201
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:34,560
like you're not going to hit it out you

2202
01:13:33,198 --> 01:13:36,719
know out the park

2203
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:38,560
but uh like you know you'll get a decent

2204
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:40,239
idea of what you know what it can

2205
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:42,080
produce and what you know what not if

2206
01:13:40,238 --> 01:13:44,879
you get a pheno that's

2207
01:13:42,079 --> 01:13:47,198
super you know larpy and uh and like has

2208
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:49,119
like a like you know like like a bland

2209
01:13:47,198 --> 01:13:50,960
smell you're probably i mean i probably

2210
01:13:49,119 --> 01:13:52,158
are not going to run it again but like

2211
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:54,319
there's you can definitely see the

2212
01:13:52,158 --> 01:13:56,799
potential in certain strains as like you

2213
01:13:54,319 --> 01:13:59,359
know like when you grow them but at the

2214
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:00,960
end of the day um you know most of the

2215
01:13:59,359 --> 01:14:02,319
time like i can tell within like the

2216
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:04,239
first round like what's going to be

2217
01:14:02,319 --> 01:14:05,599
worthy of like keeping around and and

2218
01:14:04,238 --> 01:14:07,198
running it again and trying to dial it

2219
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:09,679
in better as opposed to just like

2220
01:14:07,198 --> 01:14:11,198
wasting my time on keeping the mothers

2221
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:13,359
for you know certain genetics that are

2222
01:14:11,198 --> 01:14:14,879
not going to be you know that

2223
01:14:13,359 --> 01:14:16,799
like you know worthy of keeping around

2224
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:18,560
in a sense

2225
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:20,719
yeah okay so

2226
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:22,080
a bit of a hard question to answer i

2227
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:23,920
understand but

2228
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:25,519
what to you makes you want to keep a

2229
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:26,960
plant like do you have like a certain

2230
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:29,040
baseline and you think if it doesn't

2231
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:30,560
meet the standard maybe like a a common

2232
01:14:29,039 --> 01:14:31,760
plant you just refer everything to and

2233
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:33,199
you're like if it's not better than that

2234
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:34,880
i'm just not keeping it like how do you

2235
01:14:33,198 --> 01:14:37,439
try to define what's going to stay and

2236
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:39,119
what's going to go is it just a hunch

2237
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:42,319
well realistically i mean it comes down

2238
01:14:39,119 --> 01:14:43,760
to a matter of space and um after like

2239
01:14:42,319 --> 01:14:45,599
most of stuff that i'm gonna select is

2240
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:47,920
gonna be stuff that i kind of like i'd

2241
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:50,239
like to keep but then as i'm sorting

2242
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:52,158
through new stuff then things have to go

2243
01:14:50,238 --> 01:14:54,639
and that's just the bottom line you know

2244
01:14:52,158 --> 01:14:56,559
um and so like you know like there's if

2245
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:58,800
i have unlimited space and things like

2246
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:00,800
that it's one thing but at the end of

2247
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:02,880
the day too it's like it's always nice

2248
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:05,199
to start from new seed stock and have

2249
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:06,640
like new genetics and like you know

2250
01:15:05,198 --> 01:15:08,960
everything gets old no matter what

2251
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:12,719
that's the bottom line it's uh like it's

2252
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:14,560
ironic how like now um

2253
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:16,319
certain strains like are literally like

2254
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:19,280
vintage strains in a sense if you call

2255
01:15:16,319 --> 01:15:22,719
like you know things they're like

2256
01:15:19,279 --> 01:15:25,039
um like like the the trends are cyclical

2257
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:27,359
in a sense even with the weed it's crazy

2258
01:15:25,039 --> 01:15:28,880
and so it's it's uh it's you know like

2259
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:30,479
like i said

2260
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:32,000
some people like nowadays they'd want

2261
01:15:30,479 --> 01:15:33,678
they're like oh man i wish i had like

2262
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,679
this train wreck or something and it's

2263
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:38,000
just kind of like that was you know

2264
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:40,800
around a long time ago and it's really

2265
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,800
hard to come by nowadays um but you know

2266
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:44,400
like i said it's it's just it's ironic

2267
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:45,920
how things are very like i said like the

2268
01:15:44,399 --> 01:15:49,679
trends are very cyclical even within

2269
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:51,840
like the cannabis market and whatnot

2270
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:54,399
of course it is very cyclical like with

2271
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:56,480
a lot of things i haven't asked you yet

2272
01:15:54,399 --> 01:15:59,439
what's your thoughts on femme seeds

2273
01:15:56,479 --> 01:15:59,439
would you ever make them

2274
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:03,840
uh i mean i like i i personally wouldn't

2275
01:16:02,079 --> 01:16:04,719
i'm actually running some for the first

2276
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:06,800
time

2277
01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:09,198
uh right now um

2278
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:10,880
and and i got like that's that's gonna

2279
01:16:09,198 --> 01:16:13,279
basically be the basis for for my

2280
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:15,279
opinion on on that i typically wouldn't

2281
01:16:13,279 --> 01:16:16,800
i know that like back in the days

2282
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:18,559
uh like like there was a lot of

2283
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:21,440
hermaphroditic like tendencies that

2284
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:24,239
could come about from like the feminized

2285
01:16:21,439 --> 01:16:27,919
scenes but i like from what i know now

2286
01:16:24,238 --> 01:16:30,399
like i'm running uh some of like um like

2287
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:32,719
like like from abf genetics some of his

2288
01:16:30,399 --> 01:16:34,079
are like feminized and you know like i

2289
01:16:32,719 --> 01:16:36,560
trust his judgment so that's why i'm

2290
01:16:34,079 --> 01:16:37,519
running them and like uh like i probably

2291
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:40,400
wouldn't

2292
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:42,159
um keep mothers for longer than maybe

2293
01:16:40,399 --> 01:16:44,479
like like a few rounds as far as taking

2294
01:16:42,158 --> 01:16:46,000
clones off of them but that's just me

2295
01:16:44,479 --> 01:16:48,479
you know erring on the side of caution

2296
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,399
as far as uh traditionally

2297
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:52,879
like back in the days

2298
01:16:50,399 --> 01:16:54,238
hearing that like they they tend they

2299
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:57,520
tend to have her hermaphroditic

2300
01:16:54,238 --> 01:17:00,479
tendencies uh after a while um so i mean

2301
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:02,400
i i could be completely wrong though so

2302
01:17:00,479 --> 01:17:04,799
okay sorry so just to clarify you're

2303
01:17:02,399 --> 01:17:06,399
saying if you found one you'd like you'd

2304
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,679
run it a few times but you'd probably

2305
01:17:06,399 --> 01:17:09,759
give it up after a while because it'd

2306
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:11,679
probably start to hurt

2307
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:13,760
well that i mean i i can't say that

2308
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:16,640
that's that's what would happen but more

2309
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:18,320
than likely like in my experience back

2310
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:20,239
like back in the days before things were

2311
01:17:18,319 --> 01:17:22,158
like a little more dialed in that's

2312
01:17:20,238 --> 01:17:24,639
that's kind of what was the consensus at

2313
01:17:22,158 --> 01:17:26,319
the time things i mean they people i

2314
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:29,199
mean even like autoflower genetics and

2315
01:17:26,319 --> 01:17:31,198
like feminize autoflower like like uh

2316
01:17:29,198 --> 01:17:32,319
like everything's gotten you know people

2317
01:17:31,198 --> 01:17:33,919
have definitely dialed in things a

2318
01:17:32,319 --> 01:17:36,960
little bit better and so

2319
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:38,640
um you know like it's i like i couldn't

2320
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:40,719
i don't know in my experience i've

2321
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:42,000
always like uh like back in the days

2322
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:44,399
there was always kind of her

2323
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:46,319
hermaphroditic tendencies as far as like

2324
01:17:44,399 --> 01:17:48,079
back then people would typically run

2325
01:17:46,319 --> 01:17:50,238
feminized seeds and

2326
01:17:48,079 --> 01:17:51,920
uh for like one round and then you know

2327
01:17:50,238 --> 01:17:54,559
move on to the the next round of like

2328
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:56,158
like new seeds but um you know like i

2329
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:57,760
said like this is literally like the

2330
01:17:56,158 --> 01:17:58,399
first time i'm running feminized seeds

2331
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:00,400
and

2332
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:02,399
you know we'll see how it all goes but i

2333
01:18:00,399 --> 01:18:04,479
trust like i said my like my homie

2334
01:18:02,399 --> 01:18:05,439
brian's judgment and um you know if he

2335
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:07,198
tells me

2336
01:18:05,439 --> 01:18:08,639
there shouldn't be a problem then then

2337
01:18:07,198 --> 01:18:10,000
that's you know that's why i'm running

2338
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:12,079
them

2339
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,679

01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:16,960
amount of these people and and uh and

01:19:15,039 --> 01:19:18,800
you know like like i said be able to run

01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:20,880
some of their gear like it's uh you know

2372
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:22,960
they all do good work some really big

2373
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:25,039
heavy hitters in the list there another

2374
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:26,640
heavy hitter you mentioned early on was

2375
01:19:25,039 --> 01:19:28,880
mp carly

2376
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:30,880
i think i can guess what type of gross

2377
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:33,920
style you use and my question is do you

2378
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:36,719
use mp carly pro nutrient mix

2379
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:37,600
uh no actually i i do not at the moment

2380
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:39,439
um

2381
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:42,320
i like i

2382
01:19:39,439 --> 01:19:44,000
i i use perfect grower and um like i

2383
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:45,119
like you know they're they take care of

2384
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,279
me like they

2385
01:19:45,119 --> 01:19:48,880
they you know like the nutrients are are

2386
01:19:47,279 --> 01:19:51,439
dope like you know we have very good

2387
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:54,480
success with them um uh you know but

2388
01:19:51,439 --> 01:19:57,119
like you know ryan is is is my homie and

2389
01:19:54,479 --> 01:19:59,519
so like i i wouldn't you know like

2390
01:19:57,119 --> 01:20:01,198
i would not shy away from utilizing his

2391
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:03,840
stuff but it's also more of at this

2392
01:20:01,198 --> 01:20:05,198
point i'm kind of like uh we you know we

2393
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:08,000
were already used to running the the

2394
01:20:05,198 --> 01:20:10,399
perfect grower stuff and um and like

2395
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:12,319
like ryan's he's a brilliant person like

2396
01:20:10,399 --> 01:20:14,000
he's i'm his product i'm sure is like

2397
01:20:12,319 --> 01:20:15,439
really well so like me like you know

2398
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,600
maybe like further down the line

2399
01:20:15,439 --> 01:20:19,839
unfortunately at the time when i was uh

2400
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:21,840
making the transition from like my like

2401
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:23,360
my old form formula like which is based

2402
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:25,679
off i think it was like a

2403
01:20:23,359 --> 01:20:27,839
uh cutting edge um

2404
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:30,800
like he he hadn't he hadn't gotten his

2405
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:32,880
nutrients like like you know on deck yet

2406
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:34,800
so um so yeah that's why i went with the

2407
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:36,480
perfect grower and you know like

2408
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:38,239
everything as far as for me it's just

2409
01:20:36,479 --> 01:20:39,678
more of like if it it's not broke don't

2410
01:20:38,238 --> 01:20:41,919
fix it and we have really good success

2411
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:43,600
with that so but you know i got nothing

2412
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:45,359
but respect for ryan like he's he's a

2413
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:47,679
really good friend of mine yeah yeah of

2414
01:20:45,359 --> 01:20:49,119

mentioned there i definitely want to get

2454
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:07,199
into some of the nit gritty of that so

2455
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:08,719
first of all

2456
01:22:07,198 --> 01:22:10,638
people are going to be super interested

2457
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:12,319
in this what's like tell us about your

2458
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:13,679
relationship with ivan of the jungle

2459
01:22:12,319 --> 01:22:15,759
boys

2460
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:17,199
uh i mean we we just we came up from the

2461
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:19,280
from the forums and whatnot like you

2462
01:22:17,198 --> 01:22:22,559
know like he was one of the pioneers as

2463
01:22:19,279 --> 01:22:24,639
far as uh like like i mean he he taught

2464
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:27,120
me how to literally like set up a pump

2465
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:29,920
start relay and irrigation controller uh

2466
01:22:27,119 --> 01:22:31,279
like for over a drip system and like you

2467
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:34,719
know when we didn't have access i need

2468
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:36,639
this information um you know and so it's

2469
01:22:34,719 --> 01:22:38,239
uh it's it's just crazy to see how

2470
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:39,039
everything's kind of progressed as far

2471
01:22:38,238 --> 01:22:40,879
as

2472
01:22:39,039 --> 01:22:42,560
to where we're at now and you know and

2473
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:44,639
whatnot but he's he's definitely like a

2474
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:47,039
pioneer within this industry and he's uh

2475
01:22:44,639 --> 01:22:50,239
he's he's a smart guy he's not [ __ ]

2476
01:22:47,039 --> 01:22:52,000
he's uh you know he's he's definitely

2477
01:22:50,238 --> 01:22:53,599
he's definitely not not i mean i don't

2478
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,119
say not stupid but like i'm saying like

2479
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:56,880
he's a [ __ ] smart guy i respect the

2480
01:22:55,119 --> 01:22:58,479
[ __ ] out of him but it was more of just

2481
01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:00,960
like a like a relationship within the

2482
01:22:58,479 --> 01:23:02,479
forums that we had and uh and like

2483
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:05,119
that's you know that's kind of where we

2484
01:23:02,479 --> 01:23:07,359
all came up from like um as far as like

2485
01:23:05,119 --> 01:23:09,279
i said like abf uh

2486
01:23:07,359 --> 01:23:12,639
frost boss which was actually yes for

2487
01:23:09,279 --> 01:23:14,319
prop 215 on ic mag i don't profit like

2488
01:23:12,639 --> 01:23:16,000
you know i got like all of our homies

2489
01:23:14,319 --> 01:23:17,759
like it's it's crazy to see how we've

2490
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:20,399
all kind of came up and and we're at

2491
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:22,880
like where we're at now you know

2492
01:23:20,399 --> 01:23:24,960
yeah definitely it definitely seems that

2493
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:27,279
when you talk to all the kind of more

2494
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:29,198
notable names in the scene there is a

2495
01:23:27,279 --> 01:23:31,279
common thread especially in the early

2496
01:23:29,198 --> 01:23:32,559
days which is nice to see that

2497
01:23:31,279 --> 01:23:33,840
you know the people who associated

2498
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:36,480
together in the early days putting in

2499
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:39,679
the work it's kind of translated on

2500
01:23:36,479 --> 01:23:41,279
yeah i mean it's it's a it's like i said

2501
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:43,920
it's really crazy to realize like how

2502
01:23:41,279 --> 01:23:47,279
everything's uh fabricated

2503
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:49,440
as far as like our success and um and

2504
01:23:47,279 --> 01:23:51,519
you know whatever like it's kind of like

2505
01:23:49,439 --> 01:23:52,479
like we all kind of took up a trade that

2506
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:55,199
was

2507
01:23:52,479 --> 01:23:57,839
um you know we're very underground

2508
01:23:55,198 --> 01:23:59,439
at the time and then uh that's like it's

2509
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:02,400
like a trade that literally is in very

2510
01:23:59,439 --> 01:24:03,839
high demand and we uh are like you know

2511
01:24:02,399 --> 01:24:06,079
we're getting paid for our experience as

2512
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:07,360
far as like how many [ __ ] ups we had

2513
01:24:06,079 --> 01:24:09,760
so

2514
01:24:07,359 --> 01:24:12,559
so you also mentioned the troll

2515
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:14,079
automated system do you feel that that's

2516
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:16,880
going to be the future of growing with

2517
01:24:14,079 --> 01:24:18,559
these really tightly regulated automated

2518
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:20,159
censoring which helps keep things in

2519
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:22,239
control

2520
01:24:20,158 --> 01:24:25,679
i mean i i like the idea of it but like

2521
01:24:22,238 --> 01:24:27,359
you also always like eat like um like

2522
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:28,960
like i remember when um

2523
01:24:27,359 --> 01:24:31,119
like there's there's a thread i want to

2524
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:32,719
say it's on i think it's on thc farmer

2525
01:24:31,119 --> 01:24:34,079
and it's like it's weird how i actually

2526
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:36,960
even remember this because it's so long

2527
01:24:34,079 --> 01:24:39,039
ago but ivan um from jungle boys he had

2528
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:40,560
mentioned that like he had uh it was

2529
01:24:39,039 --> 01:24:41,760
like one of the threads as far as i

2530
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:42,880
think he was sitting like an irrigation

2531
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:45,119
controller up

2532
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:47,440
and he was like you can automate this

2533
01:24:45,119 --> 01:24:49,519
but like i still like to go there

2534
01:24:47,439 --> 01:24:50,879
and push the buttons and literally like

2535
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:53,840
make sure everything's getting watered

2536
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:56,079
appropriately um so it i mean it's good

2537
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:57,199
but it's also uh you know you have to be

2538
01:24:56,079 --> 01:24:58,559
there there's certain things like

2539
01:24:57,198 --> 01:25:00,479
mechanically that

2540
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:02,719
like that can def definitely like fail

2541
01:25:00,479 --> 01:25:05,198
on you and if they do like uh depending

2542
01:25:02,719 --> 01:25:07,359
on how big of your of a of a setup you

2543
01:25:05,198 --> 01:25:09,519
have like it could be catastrophic as

2544
01:25:07,359 --> 01:25:11,279
far as um you know like

2545
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:12,719
like you know things don't get watered

2546
01:25:11,279 --> 01:25:14,880
or there's certain clogs in like certain

2547
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:17,279
irrigation lines you know you always

2548
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:19,279
want to be there uh but automation is

2549
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:21,519
definitely nice it's nice to have the

2550
01:25:19,279 --> 01:25:24,158
like uh the ability to

2551
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:26,400
to uh to like you know to have access to

2552
01:25:24,158 --> 01:25:28,399
these products because back then

2553
01:25:26,399 --> 01:25:30,719
we didn't like we had to

2554
01:25:28,399 --> 01:25:32,960
pretty much kind of like uh come up with

2555
01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:35,279
ways to to do what we needed to do with

2556
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:36,719
what you know in in our industry because

2557
01:25:35,279 --> 01:25:38,639
the products weren't readily available

2558
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:40,399
they had to like you had to incorporate

2559
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:42,960
other products from other industries to

2560
01:25:40,399 --> 01:25:45,279
actually uh you know like like get what

2561
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:47,359
we wanted to get done

2562
01:25:45,279 --> 01:25:49,599
so with that in mind what do you see as

2563
01:25:47,359 --> 01:25:51,839
the future of more large-scale

2564
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:54,079
cultivation

2565
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:55,840
i mean it just it really depends on like

2566
01:25:54,079 --> 01:25:57,039
what what you're going for i feel like

2567
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,920
there's a

2568
01:25:57,039 --> 01:26:01,279
you're going to have like your

2569
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:02,480
budweisers where you know um you know

2570
01:26:01,279 --> 01:26:04,238
that like

2571
01:26:02,479 --> 01:26:06,238
people still buy budweiser but there's

2572
01:26:04,238 --> 01:26:08,879
always also a uh

2573
01:26:06,238 --> 01:26:10,718
a market for like craft beer and uh like

2574
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:13,199
the same thing with like with weed like

2575
01:26:10,719 --> 01:26:16,079
i think x for me i'm very much into like

2576
01:26:13,198 --> 01:26:17,198
exclusivity and having that like uh like

2577
01:26:16,079 --> 01:26:18,880
you know not

2578
01:26:17,198 --> 01:26:21,359
not you know not necessarily having

2579
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:23,279
whatever whatever everybody else has

2580
01:26:21,359 --> 01:26:25,920
access to or has but at the end of the

2581
01:26:23,279 --> 01:26:28,158
day too i mean i like you know people

2582
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:31,440
love to clown on uh purple punch or blue

2583
01:26:28,158 --> 01:26:33,839
dream or green crack but um i do know

2584
01:26:31,439 --> 01:26:36,638
that i got homies that have dispensaries

2585
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:39,039
and they like people love to to buy

2586
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:40,719
those strengths you know so

2587
01:26:39,039 --> 01:26:42,079
it's uh it's it's you know it's it's

2588
01:26:40,719 --> 01:26:44,719
just a matter of like what what people

2589
01:26:42,079 --> 01:26:47,519
want um you know like

2590
01:26:44,719 --> 01:26:49,039
what like what the market dictates

2591
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:51,600
yeah so kind of something i've been

2592
01:26:49,039 --> 01:26:53,198
thinking about for a long time is the

2593
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:55,360
budweiser analogy it's a good one

2594
01:26:53,198 --> 01:26:56,319
because i think people understand it

2595
01:26:55,359 --> 01:26:58,639
would you

2596
01:26:56,319 --> 01:27:00,559
on a personal level be a little bit

2597
01:26:58,639 --> 01:27:02,719
bummed out about if we use that same

2598
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:04,239
analogy you know budweiser makes a lot

2599
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:05,679
more money than a lot of say craft

2600
01:27:04,238 --> 01:27:07,119
breweries that are making a really high

2601
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:08,880
quality product

2602
01:27:07,119 --> 01:27:10,800
if that same analogy holds true in

2603
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:14,000
cannabis is it a bit disheartening or is

2604
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:17,039
it just a whatever thing to you

2605
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:19,520
i mean at the end of the day um

2606
01:27:17,039 --> 01:27:21,439
i mean i like like like uh

2607
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:23,199
it's i mean it's it's commercial growing

2608
01:27:21,439 --> 01:27:25,198
versus like i guess more like craft

2609
01:27:23,198 --> 01:27:27,919
growing but at the end of the day like

2610
01:27:25,198 --> 01:27:29,919
once you commercialize something um like

2611
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:31,199
especially agriculture and whatnot it

2612
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:33,840
usually always is gonna lead to like a

2613
01:27:31,198 --> 01:27:36,238
degradation of quality and so i mean

2614
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:37,199
there but most people are like like i

2615
01:27:36,238 --> 01:27:39,198
always say that there's like the

2616
01:27:37,198 --> 01:27:42,079
consumer market and the connoisseur

2617
01:27:39,198 --> 01:27:44,000
market and um

2618
01:27:42,079 --> 01:27:46,238
most of them it's it's a very thin line

2619
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:48,238
as far as like discerning like whether

2620
01:27:46,238 --> 01:27:50,638
or not this weed was grown you know

2621
01:27:48,238 --> 01:27:52,718
commercially or or like you know like or

2622
01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:56,079
someone grew it like uh you know ten

2623
01:27:52,719 --> 01:27:59,039
lights or versus like a hundred likes so

2624
01:27:56,079 --> 01:28:00,559
i mean it's it's uh like i said it's

2625
01:27:59,039 --> 01:28:02,158
it's pretty subjective and most of the

2626
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:04,320
time like the majority of the market is

2627
01:28:02,158 --> 01:28:06,079
going to be uh like

2628
01:28:04,319 --> 01:28:07,679
consumers not necessarily connoisseurs

2629
01:28:06,079 --> 01:28:08,559
like a lot of people it's crazy to me

2630
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:10,158
that they

2631
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:12,159
will literally like

2632
01:28:10,158 --> 01:28:14,960
buy stuff without even looking at it or

2633
01:28:12,158 --> 01:28:16,158
like you know like uh like i just i

2634
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:18,719
can't i can't

2635
01:28:16,158 --> 01:28:20,638
i can't buy something like that

2636
01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:22,480
yeah certainly

2637
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:25,199
yeah as far as like going to a store and

2638
01:28:22,479 --> 01:28:26,559
um you know like like

2639
01:28:25,198 --> 01:28:28,079
not being able to look at the product

2640
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:30,239
like that's why like even like delivery

2641
01:28:28,079 --> 01:28:31,119
services i'm like i like i don't you

2642
01:28:30,238 --> 01:28:34,000
know

2643
01:28:31,119 --> 01:28:36,158
it never really like uh like you know um

2644
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,279
like struck me as far as like a

2645
01:28:36,158 --> 01:28:38,158
lucrative

2646
01:28:37,279 --> 01:28:39,439
um

2647
01:28:38,158 --> 01:28:40,960
business in a sense because i'm like who

2648
01:28:39,439 --> 01:28:42,799
the [ __ ] would want to buy something

2649
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:45,119
that they can't necessarily

2650
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:48,239
like see or smell or whatever but i mean

2651
01:28:45,119 --> 01:28:50,000
it's i mean i clearly i was wrong

2652
01:28:48,238 --> 01:28:51,839
so

2653
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:54,079
so let's get down to some of the neat

2654
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:55,520
greedies of growing itself what type of

2655
01:28:54,079 --> 01:28:57,039
medium do you like to grow in and what's

2656
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:58,800
your how would you describe your general

2657
01:28:57,039 --> 01:29:00,960
style

2658
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:04,000
uh i mean i i just try to keep things as

2659
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:06,319
sterile as possible um i like i like

2660
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:08,158
using uh i mean rockwool is just kind of

2661
01:29:06,319 --> 01:29:09,920
like a generic term in a sense because

2662
01:29:08,158 --> 01:29:10,719
there's so many other like brands it's

2663
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:12,800
uh

2664
01:29:10,719 --> 01:29:14,719
but like you know i i like to just keep

2665
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:17,199
it simple i've i've done pretty much

2666
01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:18,880
everything up like that you know i've

2667
01:29:17,198 --> 01:29:20,559
ran every single medium you possibly

2668
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:22,319
could deep water culture

2669
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:24,080
i've done uh like

2670
01:29:22,319 --> 01:29:25,759
water cooled lights at one point uh

2671
01:29:24,079 --> 01:29:27,439
which was a disaster

2672
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:29,360
uh which is not a medium but i'm just

2673
01:29:27,439 --> 01:29:31,279
saying like you know i've i

2674
01:29:29,359 --> 01:29:33,599
i tried everything on it like you know

2675
01:29:31,279 --> 01:29:34,880
everything that is pretty much

2676
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:37,199
like like

2677
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:38,960
is it's tribal and uh

2678
01:29:37,198 --> 01:29:40,879
and i i kind of settled on the rockwell

2679
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:44,158
because i had my most consistent yields

2680
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:46,719
and um and you know like product to come

2681
01:29:44,158 --> 01:29:47,439
from that and it's it's it's it's uh

2682
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:49,679
it's

2683
01:29:47,439 --> 01:29:51,519
it's it's sterile and you know like like

2684
01:29:49,679 --> 01:29:52,560
i've like said i've done cocoa i've done

2685
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:54,320
beds

2686
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:55,600
um i think you know like the other day

2687
01:29:54,319 --> 01:29:57,759
like rockwool was just kind of like what

2688
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:59,199
i did best with

2689
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:01,520
great and so

2690
01:29:59,198 --> 01:30:02,960
um is there any little tips or tricks

2691
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:04,480
you might have for our growers in

2692
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:06,560
regards to

2693
01:30:04,479 --> 01:30:09,039
how they can produce a better quality

2694
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:11,840
and bud just general ideas or product

2695
01:30:09,039 --> 01:30:11,840
recommendations

2696
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,960
it's like there's a very negative

2697
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:16,719
connotation that comes along with

2698
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:18,800
rockwool especially rockwool with

2699
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:20,960
salt-based nutrients

2700
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:22,239
people will always you know the soil

2701
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:23,840
growers it's like a never-ending

2702
01:30:22,238 --> 01:30:26,079
argument where they're gonna they're

2703
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:26,880
gonna you know tell you that like uh

2704
01:30:26,079 --> 01:30:28,880
it's

2705
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:31,039
it's gonna taste this way or whatever

2706
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:33,920
but at the day i feel like a lot of that

2707
01:30:31,039 --> 01:30:35,760
is somewhat subjective um you know and

2708
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:38,239
uh and i mean it's it's definitively

2709
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:40,880
subjective but like you know at the end

2710
01:30:38,238 --> 01:30:43,439
of the day i i i've

2711
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:45,199
i've smoked organic you know soil which

2712
01:30:43,439 --> 01:30:47,599
i like i definitely like but on a

2713
01:30:45,198 --> 01:30:50,319
commercial scale it's not necessarily uh

2714
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:52,159
like feasible i mean it is somewhat but

2715
01:30:50,319 --> 01:30:54,639
it's it's like when you're talking about

2716
01:30:52,158 --> 01:30:56,799
like minimizing your not necessarily

2717
01:30:54,639 --> 01:30:58,639
like just your cost but as far as like

2718
01:30:56,800 --> 01:31:01,279
like a labor intensity and things like

2719
01:30:58,639 --> 01:31:02,400
that uh you know like rockwell's like if

2720
01:31:01,279 --> 01:31:04,559
you you know

2721
01:31:02,399 --> 01:31:06,479
it can be it's a lot easier to work with

2722
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:08,159
than and it's it's sterile so like every

2723
01:31:06,479 --> 01:31:09,919
time you buy it it's going to be sterile

2724
01:31:08,158 --> 01:31:11,679
there's no pots you have to sterilize

2725
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:13,520
like after every round and

2726
01:31:11,679 --> 01:31:15,840
um you know dirt all that stuff can

2727
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:17,760
become very like you know labor intense

2728
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:18,800
um it's not about being lazy either it's

2729
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:21,679
just more of

2730
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:23,440
uh like i you know i i like the idea of

2731
01:31:21,679 --> 01:31:25,520
having everything kind of uh

2732
01:31:23,439 --> 01:31:28,479
you know like like just like streamlined

2733
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:31,520
and you know that's it like it's uh yeah

2734
01:31:28,479 --> 01:31:34,399
it's it's i like i like i said i've done

2735
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:35,920
cocoa i've done dirt um it's and

2736
01:31:34,399 --> 01:31:38,079
and i like the product but at the end of

2737
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:39,199
the day like i could there's very few

2738
01:31:38,079 --> 01:31:41,679
times that i've actually been able to

2739
01:31:39,198 --> 01:31:42,719
discern the difference between you know

2740
01:31:41,679 --> 01:31:44,158
like something that was grown in

2741
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:47,039
rockwool with salts that's flushed

2742
01:31:44,158 --> 01:31:49,599
properly as opposed to uh like you know

2743
01:31:47,039 --> 01:31:51,519
like soil that's you know organic soil

2744
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:53,760
so you mentioned earlier that you like

2745
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:56,000
luxe lighting are they the

2746
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:57,679
ceramic metal halides

2747
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:00,079
uh the ones that we have are actually we

2748
01:31:57,679 --> 01:32:02,480
use the the cmhs for our our mother room

2749
01:32:00,079 --> 01:32:05,198
in uh in oklahoma like like everything

2750
01:32:02,479 --> 01:32:06,959
else is like dueling in like hps's so uh

2751
01:32:05,198 --> 01:32:09,599
like but you know we're

2752
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:12,239
basically we run dli and we also run uh

2753
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:13,920
run lux so like they're they're both you

2754
01:32:12,238 --> 01:32:15,198
know they're both good brands they both

2755
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:16,480
take care of us like you know i

2756
01:32:15,198 --> 01:32:20,000
appreciate the [ __ ] out of all like you

2757
01:32:16,479 --> 01:32:22,079
know both those companies so

2758
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,359
and so what type of temperatures and

2759
01:32:22,079 --> 01:32:26,079
humidities do you like to run your

2760
01:32:23,359 --> 01:32:27,599
flower rooms at

2761
01:32:26,079 --> 01:32:29,519
oh the fl i mean the flower room is

2762
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:31,920
typically like i i like to keep right

2763
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:33,360
around like 80 maybe like the low 80s as

2764
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:34,960
far as when we're running like like uh

2765
01:32:33,359 --> 01:32:36,158
co2 there's a lot of people they're

2766
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:38,480
gonna like

2767
01:32:36,158 --> 01:32:41,279
they want to follow like the vpd charts

2768
01:32:38,479 --> 01:32:44,559
which they i mean it's not a not a bad

2769
01:32:41,279 --> 01:32:46,479
idea but uh like those charts uh they're

2770
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:49,280
not necessarily tailored for like

2771
01:32:46,479 --> 01:32:51,678
cannabis growing um they're like they're

2772
01:32:49,279 --> 01:32:54,238
kind of a generalization for for like uh

2773
01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:55,920
like i like agricultural crops but

2774
01:32:54,238 --> 01:32:57,599
cannabis like you can't

2775
01:32:55,920 --> 01:33:00,158
run that high of a humidity like

2776
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:03,679
according to the vpd charts uh like that

2777
01:33:00,158 --> 01:33:05,198
later in a flower and uh and so like you

2778
01:33:03,679 --> 01:33:06,719
know it's kind of like you kind of take

2779
01:33:05,198 --> 01:33:08,000
it with you know

2780
01:33:06,719 --> 01:33:09,439
you know take what you want from it and

2781
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,960
whatnot but i usually run everything at

2782
01:33:09,439 --> 01:33:12,879
like 80 and like the humidity is always

2783
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:14,880
going to be like between 50 and 60 and

2784
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:17,199
that's that's it

2785
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:19,119
cool and what's your kind of basic

2786
01:33:17,198 --> 01:33:20,559
outlier for your dry and cure process

2787
01:33:19,119 --> 01:33:22,399
because i find this is an area people

2788
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:24,639
are always kind of looking to learn more

2789
01:33:22,399 --> 01:33:27,599
about

2790
01:33:24,639 --> 01:33:29,920
uh like honestly it's uh

2791
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:31,520
it's not it's really not that not that

2792
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:34,800
difficult in the sense where we pretty

2793
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:37,199
much uh we we cut we we cut at the like

2794
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:39,679
the base of the stock hang it on on a

2795
01:33:37,198 --> 01:33:42,399
hanger um and have it in a climate

2796
01:33:39,679 --> 01:33:45,039
controlled room uh like a drying room

2797
01:33:42,399 --> 01:33:46,479
that's like gonna be about 60 degrees uh

2798
01:33:45,039 --> 01:33:49,119
you know you want to keep a little bit

2799
01:33:46,479 --> 01:33:52,638
colder just because

2800
01:33:49,119 --> 01:33:54,880
you like the cold tends to uh to inhibit

2801
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:57,600
the growth of like mold and whatnot and

2802
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:59,760
um and uh and like the humidity just

2803
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:01,760
like right around like you know 50 you

2804
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:03,920
know basically like 50 percent like 60

2805
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:05,920
degrees and just let it do its thing for

2806
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:07,760
you know two weeks and then uh from

2807
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:10,639
there everything gets trimmed up and

2808
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:12,800
then from there like we like i designed

2809
01:34:10,639 --> 01:34:14,960
this the this uh we call like a can of

2810
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:16,719
seller and uh and for our place in

2811
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:18,960
oklahoma with uh where we have like the

2812
01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:20,800
cure tubes so from you know we're not

2813
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:22,880
throwing them in like turkey bags

2814
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:24,159
directly after we like uh like after

2815
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:26,400
everything gets trimmed we're literally

2816
01:34:24,158 --> 01:34:28,559
we're throwing them in the the tubes and

2817
01:34:26,399 --> 01:34:30,479
from there they can kind of cure like a

2818
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:33,600
you know as long as we want until the

2819
01:34:30,479 --> 01:34:36,000
product actually gets uh gets gets

2820
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:37,280
gets uh get gets bought by the by the

2821
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,800
distributors

2822
01:34:37,279 --> 01:34:40,559
and do you feel that'll be the future

2823
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:42,719
for a lot of brands getting out of the

2824
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:46,080
old turkey bags

2825
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:47,840
i mean i i don't like the idea of um of

2826
01:34:46,079 --> 01:34:49,279
uh like you know just

2827
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:50,560
trimming your you know your your buds

2828
01:34:49,279 --> 01:34:51,679
and just throwing them in a turkey bag

2829
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:52,560
like it's like

2830
01:34:51,679 --> 01:34:53,520
you're gonna

2831
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:54,960
i mean you could literally see the

2832
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:57,360
trichomes

2833
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:59,359
getting you know like uh like sticking

2834
01:34:57,359 --> 01:35:01,198
to the actual turkey bag if you if

2835
01:34:59,359 --> 01:35:02,079
you've opened open up a turkey bag like

2836
01:35:01,198 --> 01:35:03,919
you know

2837
01:35:02,079 --> 01:35:05,439
i like after everything's been trimmed

2838
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:08,079
and you know like thrown thrown in the

2839
01:35:05,439 --> 01:35:09,279
bag um so you know i just i just like

2840
01:35:08,079 --> 01:35:11,840
the idea that you know you're gonna

2841
01:35:09,279 --> 01:35:12,880
smash trichomes and things like that i

2842
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:14,480
mean it's

2843
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:15,679
at the end of the day it's just you know

2844
01:35:14,479 --> 01:35:19,039
like it's just a matter of doing things

2845
01:35:15,679 --> 01:35:21,279
like as as best as we can so

2846
01:35:19,039 --> 01:35:22,800
um you know like i like i love the idea

2847
01:35:21,279 --> 01:35:24,639
of having that uh

2848
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:27,199
that that can of seller and you know

2849
01:35:24,639 --> 01:35:29,199
like pretty much taking everything from

2850
01:35:27,198 --> 01:35:30,719
being trimmed and not throwing in a

2851
01:35:29,198 --> 01:35:32,879
bunch of turkey bags and you know

2852
01:35:30,719 --> 01:35:34,319
throwing them into the cure tubes and

2853
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:35,920
letting them cure in there from there

2854
01:35:34,319 --> 01:35:37,840
you know

2855
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:40,480
yeah definitely

2856
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:42,880
so just to kind of jump to a different

2857
01:35:40,479 --> 01:35:44,479
topic i forgot to ask you earlier

2858
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:47,520
between the dosey doe and the mendo

2859
01:35:44,479 --> 01:35:49,279
breath which one do you like more

2860
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:50,239
uh honestly like i like them both they

2861
01:35:49,279 --> 01:35:52,079
they

2862
01:35:50,238 --> 01:35:53,359
it's uh i would say the dosa does is

2863
01:35:52,079 --> 01:35:55,760
probably like a little more indica

2864
01:35:53,359 --> 01:35:57,279
dominant but uh the mendo breath is like

2865
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:59,280
you know like if you're gonna run it out

2866
01:35:57,279 --> 01:36:00,639
the words like the dositos is very i

2867
01:35:59,279 --> 01:36:03,118
feel like um

2868
01:36:00,639 --> 01:36:05,199
like it's very reminiscent of uh

2869
01:36:03,118 --> 01:36:07,039
of like more of an og the mendo bread

2870
01:36:05,198 --> 01:36:08,719
though just like stacks like if you i

2871
01:36:07,039 --> 01:36:10,800
mean i have homies that they'll pull

2872
01:36:08,719 --> 01:36:14,000
down like 10 12 pounds off of like one

2873
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:15,679
single plant uh outdoors um and with the

2874
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,840
dositos it's going to be

2875
01:36:15,679 --> 01:36:19,039
pretty tough to do that uh i mean it's

2876
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:21,279
like

2877
01:36:19,039 --> 01:36:22,800
it's probably doable but like it's it

2878
01:36:21,279 --> 01:36:25,279
takes less effort to deal with the metal

2879
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:26,400
breath and uh and like i mean yeah i

2880
01:36:25,279 --> 01:36:27,920
like

2881
01:36:26,399 --> 01:36:29,198
they they both have their own like you

2882
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:31,279
know place

2883
01:36:29,198 --> 01:36:33,118
in uh as far as like what what i you

2884
01:36:31,279 --> 01:36:35,840
know what i like them for or what not

2885
01:36:33,118 --> 01:36:38,079
but i think um you know the mendo bread

2886
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:39,600
definitely will yield a lot more for you

2887
01:36:38,079 --> 01:36:41,840
i just think that the if you're looking

2888
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:43,199
more for indica effect your uh the

2889
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:44,639
doseos is probably going to be your best

2890
01:36:43,198 --> 01:36:45,678
bet

2891
01:36:44,639 --> 01:36:46,400
yeah okay

2892
01:36:45,679 --> 01:36:50,000
so

2893
01:36:46,399 --> 01:36:52,399
often when we talk about ogs and chem

2894
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:53,679
dogs and things breeding i often talk to

2895
01:36:52,399 --> 01:36:56,799
guests about

2896
01:36:53,679 --> 01:36:58,560
what pairs well generally speaking

2897
01:36:56,800 --> 01:37:00,159
in your mind do you feel as though

2898
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:03,440
there's something which generally

2899
01:37:00,158 --> 01:37:04,799
speaking pairs well with cookies

2900
01:37:03,439 --> 01:37:07,118
there's there's nothing that i like

2901
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:09,760
necessarily prefer there's certain like

2902
01:37:07,118 --> 01:37:12,079
cookies crosses that i definitely

2903
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:14,159
have like been impressed by and whatnot

2904
01:37:12,079 --> 01:37:15,760
but i mean i like you know when you take

2905
01:37:14,158 --> 01:37:17,118
two things it's i mean for me it's just

2906
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:19,199
very interesting to like pretty much see

2907
01:37:17,118 --> 01:37:20,639
what comes about from you know from the

2908
01:37:19,198 --> 01:37:23,359
cookies like i mean the dositos is

2909
01:37:20,639 --> 01:37:25,520
basically like a remade cookies um which

2910
01:37:23,359 --> 01:37:27,599
is you know like uh

2911
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:29,199
you know like as far as that when it's

2912
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:31,520
the dositos crossed the skittles i

2913
01:37:29,198 --> 01:37:33,759
forget what the actual name um

2914
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:36,400
of the uh of the strain was that i want

2915
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:38,639
to say fletcher

2916
01:37:36,399 --> 01:37:40,719
yeah yeah exactly that's

2917
01:37:38,639 --> 01:37:43,199
uh so yeah like it's it's it's

2918
01:37:40,719 --> 01:37:44,800
definitely um i mean you know like

2919
01:37:43,198 --> 01:37:46,399
when you take two like really good

2920
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:49,039
things you usually will come out with

2921
01:37:46,399 --> 01:37:50,719
something pretty damn good so

2922
01:37:49,039 --> 01:37:52,800
uh but they're like you know like i like

2923
01:37:50,719 --> 01:37:54,880
i'm i'm still like experimenting with

2924
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:57,520
that as far as like the you know

2925
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:59,520
breeding like uh things with the og kami

2926
01:37:57,520 --> 01:38:01,360
especially and like stuff like that i

2927
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:03,040
have like certain projects that i i'm

2928
01:38:01,359 --> 01:38:04,639
looking forward to like down the line

2929
01:38:03,039 --> 01:38:06,800
but it's going to be a little while

2930
01:38:04,639 --> 01:38:08,480
before we before i get there

2931
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:10,639
oh okay well yeah let's talk a little

2932
01:38:08,479 --> 01:38:12,079
more collaborative stuff

2933
01:38:10,639 --> 01:38:14,319
what's your affiliation with cult

2934
01:38:12,079 --> 01:38:16,479
classics they seem to use a lot of your

2935
01:38:14,319 --> 01:38:18,158
stuff

2936
01:38:16,479 --> 01:38:20,158
i mean like

2937
01:38:18,158 --> 01:38:21,839
i mean marcus is basically like someone

2938
01:38:20,158 --> 01:38:24,399
that was introduced to me and

2939
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:26,000
um you know like we like

2940
01:38:24,399 --> 01:38:27,439
i like say it's kind of the same thing

2941
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,600
as far as like everything else that like

2942
01:38:27,439 --> 01:38:31,839
that i've done i gave him the cut

2943
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:34,400
and uh and you know like he he bred it

2944
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:36,400
so like it's like you know um a bunch of

2945
01:38:34,399 --> 01:38:37,599
like whatever like males that he had and

2946
01:38:36,399 --> 01:38:40,000
whatnot i just kind of let him do his

2947
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:41,840
thing and uh it's you know like whatever

2948
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:44,479
like he like uh

2949
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:46,000
i unfortunately like i don't i don't

2950
01:38:44,479 --> 01:38:48,319
really hear too much about his company

2951
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:49,600
at this point but uh but you know like

2952
01:38:48,319 --> 01:38:51,118
uh like there was certain things that

2953
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:52,800
came out of like those breeding projects

2954
01:38:51,118 --> 01:38:55,279
that were like pretty like very like

2955
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:58,400
very promising so

2956
01:38:55,279 --> 01:39:00,800
yeah i remember that ultra violence

2957
01:38:58,399 --> 01:39:02,879
thing he did was pretty popular

2958
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:05,119
yeah that the cement shoes

2959
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:07,039
um you know like there was definitely a

2960
01:39:05,118 --> 01:39:08,479
lot of promising stuff that came out of

2961
01:39:07,039 --> 01:39:10,639
out of those breeding projects and you

2962
01:39:08,479 --> 01:39:13,279
know like i was like for me at the end

2963
01:39:10,639 --> 01:39:15,118
of the day it's just it's it's very uh

2964
01:39:13,279 --> 01:39:16,719
like it's exciting to see what comes out

2965
01:39:15,118 --> 01:39:19,519
of these crosses and these these

2966
01:39:16,719 --> 01:39:21,520
pollinations and whatnot

2967
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:23,840
definitely so someone we've spoken about

2968
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:25,600
a few times already always be flowering

2969
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:26,719
you mentioned he's a good friend i guess

2970
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:28,719
the question is do you have any

2971
01:39:26,719 --> 01:39:31,520
collaborations in mind or do you think

2972
01:39:28,719 --> 01:39:34,158
that it'll happen in the future

2973
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:35,920
oh well yeah with um i mean i'm always

2974
01:39:34,158 --> 01:39:37,599
like uh like

2975
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:39,440
eager to work with him regardless like i

2976
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:42,079
respect the [ __ ] um

2977
01:39:39,439 --> 01:39:44,479
uh like i mean yeah he has og kb i gave

2978
01:39:42,079 --> 01:39:46,000
him the the cut uh

2979
01:39:44,479 --> 01:39:47,919
he you know he's free to pretty much

2980
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:49,840
work with it like however he wants so

2981
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:51,760
like i like said that today like i trust

2982
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:54,159
his judgment as far as what he's gonna

2983
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:56,800
do with it and uh i'm same thing like

2984
01:39:54,158 --> 01:39:58,559
i'm excited to see what what would come

2985
01:39:56,800 --> 01:40:01,039
about from from that whole you know that

2986
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:02,880
whole situation so

2987
01:40:01,039 --> 01:40:04,479
if someone wanted to get their hands on

2988
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:06,159
some of your work what would be the way

2989
01:40:04,479 --> 01:40:07,359
to do it even if it's in the future you

2990
01:40:06,158 --> 01:40:08,719
know what do you think will be the best

2991
01:40:07,359 --> 01:40:12,000
way for him to get it through a seed

2992
01:40:08,719 --> 01:40:14,560
bank or maybe through a clone bank

2993
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:16,000
i mean like i i like i said that's why i

2994
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:18,320
kind of let other people handle that

2995
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:20,000
that whole situation um like i couldn't

2996
01:40:18,319 --> 01:40:21,519
tell you i honestly i've had multiple

2997
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:23,439
offers for like all sorts of stuff where

2998
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:26,080
people are you know they they they want

2999
01:40:23,439 --> 01:40:28,000
to carry like uh you know like whatever

3000
01:40:26,079 --> 01:40:30,238
like the you know the crosses i make and

3001
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:31,760
whatever but i at the day that's not

3002
01:40:30,238 --> 01:40:34,158
really like i would say it's not my

3003
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:35,600
specialty but it's just more of like

3004
01:40:34,158 --> 01:40:37,039
i'd rather leave that up to like

3005
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:39,119
somebody else and have them take care of

3006
01:40:37,039 --> 01:40:41,279
that you know just like you know work

3007
01:40:39,118 --> 01:40:43,519
with somebody else and you know do like

3008
01:40:41,279 --> 01:40:45,039
the collaborations and have them uh you

3009
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:47,440
know take care of all that

3010
01:40:45,039 --> 01:40:49,439
you know as far as like uh facilitate

3011
01:40:47,439 --> 01:40:50,799
like you know the liquidation of all

3012
01:40:49,439 --> 01:40:51,599
of like the seeds and all that other

3013
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:53,360
stuff

3014
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:54,800
what i'm sensing here is that you're

3015
01:40:53,359 --> 01:40:56,639
actually giving a message to all the

3016
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:58,480
pollen chuckers out there being like

3017
01:40:56,639 --> 01:41:00,000
guys making the seeds isn't the hard

3018
01:40:58,479 --> 01:41:02,319
part it's the other bit i don't want to

3019
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:05,439
be involved with

3020
01:41:02,319 --> 01:41:07,279
yeah it's i mean it's it's uh i mean

3021
01:41:05,439 --> 01:41:08,799
it's i mean selection goes a long ways

3022
01:41:07,279 --> 01:41:11,279
that's what takes the longest time you

3023
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:13,840
know but uh but like yeah for me it's

3024
01:41:11,279 --> 01:41:16,719
just more of like i like working with

3025
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:18,480
people and um and like uh like you know

3026
01:41:16,719 --> 01:41:20,158
like seeing what like like i said it's

3027
01:41:18,479 --> 01:41:21,759
exciting at the day to see what can come

3028
01:41:20,158 --> 01:41:23,759
about from from the work and the

3029
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:25,199
collaborations that can be done that's

3030
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:26,400
really like uh like you know a lot of

3031
01:41:25,198 --> 01:41:27,839
people are very

3032
01:41:26,399 --> 01:41:30,079
they want to keep everything in house

3033
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:31,840
and and uh not work with other people

3034
01:41:30,079 --> 01:41:34,479
like this industry industry's very ego

3035
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:36,319
driven and um and i i think that's kind

3036
01:41:34,479 --> 01:41:37,919
of what will hold some people back at

3037
01:41:36,319 --> 01:41:40,238
the end of the day and so

3038
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:41,920
like i said i'm like you know like i

3039
01:41:40,238 --> 01:41:44,158
decided at the end of the day like i

3040
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:45,440
think just kind of everybody eats so

3041
01:41:44,158 --> 01:41:47,519
whatever if we can all help each other

3042
01:41:45,439 --> 01:41:49,678
out let's make it happen you know

3043
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:51,520
certainly so you mentioned

3044
01:41:49,679 --> 01:41:53,760
people contacting you about stocking

3045
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:55,440
your things and even earlier in this

3046
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:58,000
episode you you mentioned darkheart

3047
01:41:55,439 --> 01:42:00,000
nursery they're a notable um nursery

3048
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:02,639
that definitely sells a lot of the mendo

3049
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:04,319
breath clones do you feel like honored

3050
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:06,239
by that do you like how do you feel when

3051
01:42:04,319 --> 01:42:09,359
there's places stocking kind of your

3052
01:42:06,238 --> 01:42:11,198
work directly or indirectly

3053
01:42:09,359 --> 01:42:14,000
oh i mean at the end of the day like

3054
01:42:11,198 --> 01:42:16,158
like i said if you know uh you know like

3055
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:18,158
not especially like the lineage of like

3056
01:42:16,158 --> 01:42:19,359
of the genetics but like you know a lot

3057
01:42:18,158 --> 01:42:21,198
of the times all that stuff is kind of

3058
01:42:19,359 --> 01:42:23,359
associated with me anyways so

3059
01:42:21,198 --> 01:42:25,279
i'm in a sense yeah like kind of honored

3060
01:42:23,359 --> 01:42:27,279
but at the end of the day too like they

3061
01:42:25,279 --> 01:42:29,679
like i said when i released the uh the

3062
01:42:27,279 --> 01:42:31,759
the the clones the documentary

3063
01:42:29,679 --> 01:42:34,158
um they were some of the first people to

3064
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:35,280
literally line up to like grab them they

3065
01:42:34,158 --> 01:42:36,559
paid for them they can do whatever they

3066
01:42:35,279 --> 01:42:38,880
want with it at that point you know i'm

3067
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:41,199
not it's uh like you know i can't hate

3068
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:43,760
on on on them at the end of the day like

3069
01:42:41,198 --> 01:42:45,839
it's it's uh like all the

3070
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:48,239
all the you know the the notoriety that

3071
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:49,520
comes along with those strings kind of

3072
01:42:48,238 --> 01:42:51,439
if you know where they came from they're

3073
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:52,719
it's gonna come back to me anyway so at

3074
01:42:51,439 --> 01:42:55,279
the end of the day like i said before

3075
01:42:52,719 --> 01:42:56,639
like i'm more than happy for

3076
01:42:55,279 --> 01:42:57,759
them doing their thing they actually

3077
01:42:56,639 --> 01:42:58,800
just

3078
01:42:57,760 --> 01:43:00,639
uh

3079
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:02,560
identified like the hop uh i think it

3080
01:43:00,639 --> 01:43:04,079
was like the hot blatant viroid

3081
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:05,600
um

3082
01:43:04,079 --> 01:43:08,000
issue with like plants and whatnot like

3083
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:10,800
you know like they uh

3084
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:13,198
yeah exactly like when we yeah years ago

3085
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:14,239
when we were uh when we were growing it

3086
01:43:13,198 --> 01:43:16,319
was that that's pretty much what we

3087
01:43:14,238 --> 01:43:18,158
called it was dying but they actually

3088
01:43:16,319 --> 01:43:20,319
were able to lock it down and you know

3089
01:43:18,158 --> 01:43:21,759
like uh identify it so you know i

3090
01:43:20,319 --> 01:43:24,158
respect that that's cool as [ __ ] because

3091
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:26,639
it probably didn't cost them it probably

3092
01:43:24,158 --> 01:43:28,238
cost them a lot a lot of money to uh to

3093
01:43:26,639 --> 01:43:30,319
retain the people to actually you know

3094
01:43:28,238 --> 01:43:32,158
do the work to figure that out so

3095
01:43:30,319 --> 01:43:34,000
whatever

3096
01:43:32,158 --> 01:43:36,000
yeah that's cool so i'd love to get your

3097
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:37,679
opinion on this situation then how do

3098
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,479
you feel when people

3099
01:43:37,679 --> 01:43:40,158
like

3100
01:43:38,479 --> 01:43:41,919
i guess kind of do what groma did you

3101
01:43:40,158 --> 01:43:44,238
know grab someone's strains and like

3102
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:46,399
just f to it and sell it or just run

3103
01:43:44,238 --> 01:43:47,599
with it does that fit into your same

3104
01:43:46,399 --> 01:43:49,198
philosophy where like you know you're

3105
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:50,639
not really gonna hate just whatever or

3106
01:43:49,198 --> 01:43:52,719
do you feel like at a certain point you

3107
01:43:50,639 --> 01:43:54,319
draw a line

3108
01:43:52,719 --> 01:43:56,079
i mean there's nothing you can do so

3109
01:43:54,319 --> 01:43:58,079
like why well like why lose sleep over

3110
01:43:56,079 --> 01:43:59,920
here like it's uh at the end of the day

3111
01:43:58,079 --> 01:44:01,359
it's like if uh

3112
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:03,600
if uh

3113
01:44:01,359 --> 01:44:05,920
if i can i in a sense i feel like i

3114
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:08,079
helped somebody out you know and um if

3115
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:10,800
you want to utilize like my work to like

3116
01:44:08,079 --> 01:44:13,198
further yourself [ __ ] that's great uh

3117
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:15,360
when when people want to uh

3118
01:44:13,198 --> 01:44:18,479
to like you know like if i mean if

3119
01:44:15,359 --> 01:44:20,319
someone wants to mouth off and and uh

3120
01:44:18,479 --> 01:44:21,839
and like you know like like uh you know

3121
01:44:20,319 --> 01:44:23,599
like i said like with him i literally

3122
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:25,199
hit him up and i was like yo i wanted to

3123
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:27,280
get a pack of like peanut butter bread

3124
01:44:25,198 --> 01:44:28,960
and he sent me like 25 packs of scenes

3125
01:44:27,279 --> 01:44:31,439
like i i respect that you know he

3126
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:33,198
doesn't owe me [ __ ] um so at the end of

3127
01:44:31,439 --> 01:44:35,439
the day like i respect his work he's

3128
01:44:33,198 --> 01:44:37,279
done good work based off of

3129
01:44:35,439 --> 01:44:39,439
my stuff but that's kind of just like

3130
01:44:37,279 --> 01:44:40,559
that's kind of what you know par for the

3131
01:44:39,439 --> 01:44:42,000
course as far as what comes with the

3132
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:44,480
territory and you can't you can't

3133
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:46,479
control that so

3134
01:44:44,479 --> 01:44:48,638
um you know like at the end of the day

3135
01:44:46,479 --> 01:44:50,079
uh i mean if he was a dick and was like

3136
01:44:48,639 --> 01:44:51,760
you know like

3137
01:44:50,079 --> 01:44:53,359
like you know

3138
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:54,880
like wanted to like you know like talk

3139
01:44:53,359 --> 01:44:56,319
[ __ ] to me about you know whatever when

3140
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:57,679
i asked him for some seeds then that's a

3141
01:44:56,319 --> 01:44:59,439
different story but he was cool he

3142
01:44:57,679 --> 01:45:01,600
[ __ ] you know i i

3143
01:44:59,439 --> 01:45:04,000
i respect that so

3144
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:06,000
great so i just really

3145
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:08,399
yeah i just realized i hadn't actually

3146
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:10,399
asked you what was the story with gage

3147
01:45:08,399 --> 01:45:13,039
green how did that end

3148
01:45:10,399 --> 01:45:16,238
well it was just so i mean it was just

3149
01:45:13,039 --> 01:45:18,399
more of a like like that was like i said

3150
01:45:16,238 --> 01:45:20,238
me like me and fletcher like people want

3151
01:45:18,399 --> 01:45:22,158
to think that like uh they're you know

3152
01:45:20,238 --> 01:45:24,319
think like i got rich off of

3153
01:45:22,158 --> 01:45:26,319
uh the whole docidos like situation or

3154
01:45:24,319 --> 01:45:28,238
whatever but like our original agreement

3155
01:45:26,319 --> 01:45:30,079
was basically to make the cross and

3156
01:45:28,238 --> 01:45:31,839
split the seeds and that that was it

3157
01:45:30,079 --> 01:45:33,439
like so you know i respect the [ __ ] out

3158
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:34,880
of fletcher um

3159
01:45:33,439 --> 01:45:38,879
and you know like he's a good friend of

3160
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:41,279
mine um and i'm very like uh you know

3161
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:43,440
i'm very happy for him and like his like

3162
01:45:41,279 --> 01:45:45,759
success as far as like like the you know

3163
01:45:43,439 --> 01:45:47,279
the the the the sea lions that he's

3164
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:49,039
running like now we're not based off the

3165
01:45:47,279 --> 01:45:51,359
docidos like all that [ __ ]

3166
01:45:49,039 --> 01:45:54,000
um with them i we actually had a

3167
01:45:51,359 --> 01:45:55,679
contract where there was like uh like

3168
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:57,520
you know like i was supposed to get

3169
01:45:55,679 --> 01:45:59,840
compensated for you know the scenes that

3170
01:45:57,520 --> 01:46:01,920
were sold and things just got kind of

3171
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:03,279
like convoluted and uh didn't

3172
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:07,039
necessarily work out the way they were

3173
01:46:03,279 --> 01:46:09,679
supposed to um i mean i i like i

3174
01:46:07,039 --> 01:46:11,679
i know uh i guess like key play and uh

3175
01:46:09,679 --> 01:46:13,920
and mike and

3176
01:46:11,679 --> 01:46:15,679
and uh like you know like we're cool i'm

3177
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:17,118
not like there's no bad blood it's just

3178
01:46:15,679 --> 01:46:19,279
more of like they

3179
01:46:17,118 --> 01:46:21,118
you know like they i mean they they

3180
01:46:19,279 --> 01:46:22,960
definitively like defaulted on our

3181
01:46:21,118 --> 01:46:24,799
agreement put it that way so but at the

3182
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:26,480
end of the day there's not much you know

3183
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:28,480
else you know you can do this it's not

3184
01:46:26,479 --> 01:46:31,439
an industry where like i can have my

3185
01:46:28,479 --> 01:46:34,799
lawyer contact you and uh and

3186
01:46:31,439 --> 01:46:37,039
sue you for you know whatever so

3187
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:38,960
yeah okay and do you think that more

3188
01:46:37,039 --> 01:46:40,880
contract based collaborative project

3189
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:42,560
will be the way going forward or do you

3190
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:44,000
hope not

3191
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:45,840
oh yeah i mean not like like everything

3192
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:48,238
i do like even like with with compound

3193
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:50,639
like uh like you know our agreement was

3194
01:46:48,238 --> 01:46:51,919
like i wanna say like 30 pages or

3195
01:46:50,639 --> 01:46:55,118
something you know like my lawyer put it

3196
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:58,158
all together um and you know that's i

3197
01:46:55,118 --> 01:46:59,359
mean at the end of the day it's it's uh

3198
01:46:58,158 --> 01:47:01,439
i mean

3199
01:46:59,359 --> 01:47:04,158
it's it's

3200
01:47:01,439 --> 01:47:06,319
it's uh like it's it's just it's just

3201
01:47:04,158 --> 01:47:08,000
tough the industry is very it's not very

3202
01:47:06,319 --> 01:47:10,079
like uh mature in the sense where you

3203
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:11,760
can actually like uh exercise these

3204
01:47:10,079 --> 01:47:14,238
rights but at the end of the day too

3205
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:16,719
it's like i just i'm i just feel like it

3206
01:47:14,238 --> 01:47:18,799
like i'm over the whole like handshake

3207
01:47:16,719 --> 01:47:20,319
[ __ ] and you know like uh like those

3208
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:22,159
sort of agreements like if everything's

3209
01:47:20,319 --> 01:47:25,039
written down on paper and at the end of

3210
01:47:22,158 --> 01:47:27,279
the day uh like someone defaults on it

3211
01:47:25,039 --> 01:47:29,439
um you know then it's like you know like

3212
01:47:27,279 --> 01:47:31,679
it's like it's it's it's clear as day as

3213
01:47:29,439 --> 01:47:32,960
far as like it's it's you know it's all

3214
01:47:31,679 --> 01:47:36,880
written down there this is what we

3215
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:39,359
agreed on and that's pretty much it so

3216
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:41,118
yeah okay so you mentioned earlier that

3217
01:47:39,359 --> 01:47:43,039
um we bumped into each other at the

3218
01:47:41,118 --> 01:47:45,039
emerald cup what's your feelings on the

3219
01:47:43,039 --> 01:47:46,719
emerald cup and on the cups in general

3220
01:47:45,039 --> 01:47:48,319
how do you feel the general vibe of them

3221
01:47:46,719 --> 01:47:50,639
is going

3222
01:47:48,319 --> 01:47:52,719
uh i mean what's ironic is actually like

3223
01:47:50,639 --> 01:47:54,880
a lot of people they they

3224
01:47:52,719 --> 01:47:56,880
they consider the emerald cup as as like

3225
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:58,639
being like a very like i guess like like

3226
01:47:56,880 --> 01:48:00,239
a a custy

3227
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:02,960
um uh

3228
01:48:00,238 --> 01:48:04,959

and uh i was also lucky enough to bump

3262
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:10,800
into it at the counter illuminati party

3263
01:49:09,118 --> 01:49:12,960
the thing to me which stands out about

3264
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:14,560
the counter illuminati party and also

3265
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:16,560
things like the ego clash is that we're

3266
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:19,119
seeing the rise of these kind of more

3267
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:20,800
smaller boutique events because some

3268
01:49:19,118 --> 01:49:23,118
people are losing a bit of faith in the

3269
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:24,400
bigger ones do you like that or what do

3270
01:49:23,118 --> 01:49:27,039
you how do you feel about the smaller

3271
01:49:24,399 --> 01:49:28,638
more boutique ones

3272
01:49:27,039 --> 01:49:30,238
oh i mean

3273
01:49:28,639 --> 01:49:33,520
at the end of the day like it's uh i

3274
01:49:30,238 --> 01:49:35,519
mean if there's i always i always uh

3275
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:37,360
i like i always like to see like what

3276
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:39,280
people have to offer at these sort of

3277
01:49:37,359 --> 01:49:40,960
events and whatnot you know like there's

3278
01:49:39,279 --> 01:49:44,158
a you know so

3279
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:45,039
like the the i mean the bigger ones are

3280
01:49:44,158 --> 01:49:46,238
you know

3281
01:49:45,039 --> 01:49:48,719
i would say they're definitely a little

3282
01:49:46,238 --> 01:49:50,238
bit more uh like watered down and so

3283
01:49:48,719 --> 01:49:51,679
it's nice to have like see the up and

3284
01:49:50,238 --> 01:49:53,678
coming people that are like you know

3285
01:49:51,679 --> 01:49:55,039
literally like trying to like make moves

3286
01:49:53,679 --> 01:49:56,719
in the industry and that are like you

3287
01:49:55,039 --> 01:49:57,760
know doing like really good work because

3288
01:49:56,719 --> 01:50:00,158
that's really where you're going to see

3289
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:01,920
it at most the time you know um as far

3290
01:50:00,158 --> 01:50:02,799
as like the up-and-comers like you know

3291
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:04,079
at the

3292
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:05,039
i like the bigger events you're going to

3293
01:50:04,079 --> 01:50:07,198
see the people that are probably a

3294
01:50:05,039 --> 01:50:09,359
little bit more established which is is

3295
01:50:07,198 --> 01:50:11,439
dope as well but you know it's like you

3296
01:50:09,359 --> 01:50:13,198
know there's always like i said

3297
01:50:11,439 --> 01:50:14,719
something new coming up and like you

3298
01:50:13,198 --> 01:50:16,158
know like it's it's always interesting

3299
01:50:14,719 --> 01:50:18,399
to see what other people have to offer

3300
01:50:16,158 --> 01:50:19,920
you know especially the underdogs

3301
01:50:18,399 --> 01:50:21,118
so one of the last things i wanted to

3302
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:23,760
ask you about before we get into the

3303
01:50:21,118 --> 01:50:25,679
quickfire questions is

3304
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:27,679
the concentrate takeover we haven't

3305
01:50:25,679 --> 01:50:29,520
heard so much news about it recently but

3306
01:50:27,679 --> 01:50:31,760
for the longest time you know

3307
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:33,760
the rise of the vape pens the issues

3308
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:35,440
with them the way it's you know kind of

3309
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:37,360
taking over the market the casual

3310
01:50:35,439 --> 01:50:39,439
consumer just totally just having an

3311
01:50:37,359 --> 01:50:41,359
insatiable appetite for it where do you

3312
01:50:39,439 --> 01:50:43,519
sit on the concentrates taking over the

3313
01:50:41,359 --> 01:50:46,559
market debate

3314
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:49,360
uh i mean it's it's uh like

3315
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:51,520
like i i i don't mind like a like a like

3316
01:50:49,359 --> 01:50:53,920
a nice like uh like dab especially if

3317
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:56,639
it's like you know like if it's ice wax

3318
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:58,000
or you know like uh like sauce or rosin

3319
01:50:56,639 --> 01:51:00,960
you know if it's a good product like you

3320
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:03,039
know uh i'd like i definitely like enjoy

3321
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:04,880
it and whatnot but you know as far as

3322
01:51:03,039 --> 01:51:06,079
like the pens and all that stuff it's i

3323
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:07,440
just feel like it's it's more of a

3324
01:51:06,079 --> 01:51:10,238
matter of um

3325
01:51:07,439 --> 01:51:12,479
accessibility and like uh like uh being

3326
01:51:10,238 --> 01:51:14,000
very like like inconspicuous as far as

3327
01:51:12,479 --> 01:51:15,919
you know that's why they're it's it's a

3328
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:18,399
lot of it's very popular in like other

3329
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:20,000
other states that may not be so uh

3330
01:51:18,399 --> 01:51:22,238
so privy to like you know like

3331
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,960
legalization and like things like that

3332
01:51:22,238 --> 01:51:24,879
so

3333
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:26,399
it's uh but at the end of the day like

3334
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:27,520
it does suck that there was a whole

3335
01:51:26,399 --> 01:51:29,439
issue with

3336
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:31,760
the the vape cartridges that you know

3337
01:51:29,439 --> 01:51:33,359
were all tainted and um

3338
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:36,480
and you know like people were getting

3339
01:51:33,359 --> 01:51:38,880
sick from them and things like that so

3340
01:51:36,479 --> 01:51:40,559
it's uh like you know but i like i good

3341
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:42,159
concentrates are like you know they're

3342
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:43,119
good like another day like really like

3343
01:51:42,158 --> 01:51:44,559
it's

3344
01:51:43,118 --> 01:51:47,679
it's uh it's i think it's a lot more

3345
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:50,560
healthier uh you know than actually like

3346
01:51:47,679 --> 01:51:52,239
smoking uh like like flowers or whatnot

3347
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:54,400
because uh you're smoking you know at

3348
01:51:52,238 --> 01:51:56,079
least you're smoking you know thc like

3349
01:51:54,399 --> 01:51:58,319
the majority it's gonna be thc as a for

3350
01:51:56,079 --> 01:52:00,238
as opposed like a bunch of foliage that

3351
01:51:58,319 --> 01:52:02,158
you know like you roll up and you smoke

3352
01:52:00,238 --> 01:52:03,598
but i still like smoking like weed you

3353
01:52:02,158 --> 01:52:05,519
know that that's that i'm just kind of

3354
01:52:03,599 --> 01:52:07,199
old school like that

3355
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:09,679
yeah 100

3356
01:52:07,198 --> 01:52:10,799
so let's jump into our last quickfire

3357
01:52:09,679 --> 01:52:14,840
questions

3358
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:18,560
so first one indica sativa which one for

3359
01:52:14,840 --> 01:52:20,560
you oh i mean it's uh it's

3360
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:22,719
like it like everything has its place i

3361
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:24,320
feel like it's uh like i can't i can't

3362
01:52:22,719 --> 01:52:25,760
necessarily tell you i prefer one over

3363
01:52:24,319 --> 01:52:28,079
the other there's certain teams that are

3364
01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:28,800
gonna be like panic attack inducing and

3365
01:52:28,079 --> 01:52:30,479
uh

3366
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:31,679
there's also like uh like you know

3367
01:52:30,479 --> 01:52:33,839
certain indicators are good if you're

3368
01:52:31,679 --> 01:52:36,158
gonna try to go to sleep but

3369
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:38,159
but uh like you know especially at this

3370
01:52:36,158 --> 01:52:40,079
point too like nowadays i mean

3371
01:52:38,158 --> 01:52:41,759
everything's been hybridized so

3372
01:52:40,079 --> 01:52:43,840
it's uh it's kind of you know tough to

3373
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:45,199
say exactly like what uh what i would

3374
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:46,319
prefer in a sense but everything has

3375
01:52:45,198 --> 01:52:47,359
it's that you know it's time in its

3376
01:52:46,319 --> 01:52:49,279
place

3377
01:52:47,359 --> 01:52:51,598
as far as if i wake up

3378
01:52:49,279 --> 01:52:52,479
uh i'm not gonna want to take a dab or

3379
01:52:51,599 --> 01:52:54,560
uh

3380
01:52:52,479 --> 01:52:57,118
or uh or you know smoke a joint of like

3381
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:58,800
some heavy indica uh you know obviously

3382
01:52:57,118 --> 01:53:01,279
like a sativa would probably be better

3383
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:02,719
to get my day going um but at the like

3384
01:53:01,279 --> 01:53:04,238
at the end of the day if i'm trying to

3385
01:53:02,719 --> 01:53:05,439
go to sleep or something yeah like an

3386
01:53:04,238 --> 01:53:07,919
indica is probably gonna be your you

3387
01:53:05,439 --> 01:53:09,198
know your you know your best bet

3388
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:11,440
but at the end of the day like i could

3389
01:53:09,198 --> 01:53:13,519
say too it's uh a lot of it's very just

3390
01:53:11,439 --> 01:53:14,879
very subjective you know it's all like

3391
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:16,400
everything has a time and a place and

3392
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:18,159
you just gotta you know figure out what

3393
01:53:16,399 --> 01:53:19,839
works for you

3394
01:53:18,158 --> 01:53:20,638
yeah i agree

3395
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:23,599
so

3396
01:53:20,639 --> 01:53:25,679
flower or concentrate

3397
01:53:23,599 --> 01:53:28,159
i honestly like i i like flowers like i

3398
01:53:25,679 --> 01:53:30,399
feel like the concentrate game is uh

3399
01:53:28,158 --> 01:53:33,359
is so new that like we don't

3400
01:53:30,399 --> 01:53:34,319
we don't know the negative repercussions

3401
01:53:33,359 --> 01:53:35,598
of uh

3402
01:53:34,319 --> 01:53:37,279
of like like even with the whole thing

3403
01:53:35,599 --> 01:53:39,440
with the cartridges as far as like

3404
01:53:37,279 --> 01:53:41,118
smoking concentrates and stuff there are

3405
01:53:39,439 --> 01:53:43,118
certain uh there's certain ones that are

3406
01:53:41,118 --> 01:53:45,118
definitely more pure than others but

3407
01:53:43,118 --> 01:53:46,639
but uh like yeah i mean i'm just i'm

3408
01:53:45,118 --> 01:53:48,559
super old school in a sense that i like

3409
01:53:46,639 --> 01:53:50,000
i like smoking flower you know

3410
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:51,920
i've i've had a conversation with a few

3411
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:53,599
people before where it's like i said

3412
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:55,679
it's it's just everything like certain

3413
01:53:53,599 --> 01:53:57,920
things are just so new that we don't

3414
01:53:55,679 --> 01:54:00,158
know what's gonna you know like we won't

3415
01:53:57,920 --> 01:54:02,158
know exactly how it affects people and

3416
01:54:00,158 --> 01:54:04,319
as far as their health until probably

3417
01:54:02,158 --> 01:54:06,399
like 20 or 30 years down the road you

3418
01:54:04,319 --> 01:54:09,840
know so if you're smoking cartridges

3419
01:54:06,399 --> 01:54:11,279
like all day and um

3420
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:12,960
and you know like like you know people

3421
01:54:11,279 --> 01:54:13,920
are still gonna weed you know flowers

3422
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:16,319
for

3423
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:18,560
forever at this point but uh like we'll

3424
01:54:16,319 --> 01:54:20,158
know more or less you know the

3425
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:22,480
the consequences of

3426
01:54:20,158 --> 01:54:24,799
smoking you know other other things like

3427
01:54:22,479 --> 01:54:27,118
it's like you know butane extracted uh

3428
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:27,920
concentrates uh cartridges all that

3429
01:54:27,118 --> 01:54:30,399
stuff

3430
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:31,920
it's like i said we won't know until you

3431
01:54:30,399 --> 01:54:33,839
know like i said it's gonna be years

3432
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:35,840
before we figure out like what exactly

3433
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:37,199
what um like how like how it affects

3434
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:38,639
people and like their immune systems and

3435
01:54:37,198 --> 01:54:40,719
whatnot

3436
01:54:38,639 --> 01:54:42,639
yeah for sure so

3437
01:54:40,719 --> 01:54:44,719
out of the following three strains you

3438
01:54:42,639 --> 01:54:48,800
have to pick one to smoke which one is

3439
01:54:44,719 --> 01:54:50,960
it mac gmo or skittles

3440
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:52,480
uh i mean i mean you can't really go

3441
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:53,359
wrong with either of those i mean i

3442
01:54:52,479 --> 01:54:55,678
would

3443
01:54:53,359 --> 01:54:57,519
i would probably say uh uh the skittles

3444
01:54:55,679 --> 01:54:58,960
really like the mac to me to be honest

3445
01:54:57,520 --> 01:55:01,840
like reminds me a lot like of like kind

3446
01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:04,560
of like a bubba um but it's it's it's

3447
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:06,079
it's a very good straight wrong um and i

3448
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:07,199
i tend to like more of the fruity stuff

3449
01:55:06,079 --> 01:55:09,279
to be honest

3450
01:55:07,198 --> 01:55:11,519
um so like yeah like skittles is

3451
01:55:09,279 --> 01:55:14,238
definitely you know

3452
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:17,520
probably uh the gmo is good it's it's

3453
01:55:14,238 --> 01:55:19,439
definitely super gassy

3454
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:21,119
i think i just have like uh some sort of

3455
01:55:19,439 --> 01:55:22,960
affinity as far as like

3456
01:55:21,118 --> 01:55:24,719
not wanting to smoke it just because

3457
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:26,239
really like it takes so long to finish

3458
01:55:24,719 --> 01:55:27,920
because it's a longer like flowering

3459
01:55:26,238 --> 01:55:30,000
strain

3460
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:31,440
yeah definitely

3461
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:33,679
that's just a personal thing you know

3462
01:55:31,439 --> 01:55:36,399
but uh like yeah like skittles i like i

3463
01:55:33,679 --> 01:55:38,079
like yeah i'm i'm like yeah i definitely

3464
01:55:36,399 --> 01:55:39,359
like i was definitely impressed with the

3465
01:55:38,079 --> 01:55:40,559
skittles when i when i saw it for the

3466
01:55:39,359 --> 01:55:43,118
first time

3467
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:45,039
when you saw it or when you tasted it

3468
01:55:43,118 --> 01:55:46,799
i mean both but i'm saying as far as

3469
01:55:45,039 --> 01:55:48,158
like when it like literally

3470
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:51,599
when i actually saw the real deal you

3471
01:55:48,158 --> 01:55:53,439
know so yeah okay cool so out of all the

3472
01:55:51,599 --> 01:55:55,760
way you've smoked ever what's been the

3473
01:55:53,439 --> 01:55:57,759
most memorable

3474
01:55:55,760 --> 01:55:59,599
uh i mean like like i said there's that

3475
01:55:57,760 --> 01:56:01,440
that pepper fino of the romulan and then

3476
01:55:59,599 --> 01:56:02,400
there's um uh

3477
01:56:01,439 --> 01:56:04,079
uh

3478
01:56:02,399 --> 01:56:07,439
the like like the blueberry headband

3479
01:56:04,079 --> 01:56:08,880
that i like that i crossed the og kb um

3480
01:56:07,439 --> 01:56:10,799
like there's like a certain actually

3481
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:12,239
like i saw like a

3482
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:13,920
what was it like i think it was like a

3483
01:56:12,238 --> 01:56:15,039
blue diesel when i was actually in

3484
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:16,800
illinois

3485
01:56:15,039 --> 01:56:18,399
um and i was actually pretty impressed

3486
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:19,520
with it like the it was like super

3487
01:56:18,399 --> 01:56:22,000
frosty

3488
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:24,000
and i i didn't get to smoke at those but

3489
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:26,079
as far as like you know looks wise and

3490
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:28,158
like uh like you know like the like

3491
01:56:26,079 --> 01:56:30,559
terpenes and all that it was definitely

3492
01:56:28,158 --> 01:56:31,359
uh it was i was pretty impressed with it

3493
01:56:30,560 --> 01:56:33,039
so

3494
01:56:31,359 --> 01:56:35,039
but uh but for me like it like the one

3495
01:56:33,039 --> 01:56:36,719
of the most memorable memorable strains

3496
01:56:35,039 --> 01:56:38,479
realistically is gonna be

3497
01:56:36,719 --> 01:56:39,520
like so there's like the dj like i i'm

3498
01:56:38,479 --> 01:56:42,479
just very

3499
01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:44,800
very like uh like

3500
01:56:42,479 --> 01:56:46,158
very uh i like a lot of the blueberry

3501
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:47,599
strengths but that way now so like like

3502
01:56:46,158 --> 01:56:48,879
the dj short blueberry that i had in

3503
01:56:47,599 --> 01:56:52,480
like amsterdam

3504
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:53,840
like was it's very nostalgic to me um uh

3505
01:56:52,479 --> 01:56:56,079
like the blueberry headband that i've

3506
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:56,960
had like i've only had like a few times

3507
01:56:56,079 --> 01:56:59,279
it was

3508
01:56:56,960 --> 01:57:02,560
very like yeah like it was

3509
01:56:59,279 --> 01:57:05,439
it was uh it definitely stood out so

3510
01:57:02,560 --> 01:57:06,960
so on the other hand what was a strain

3511
01:57:05,439 --> 01:57:08,879
which really kind of took off with other

3512
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:12,239
people but you were just like man i

3513
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:12,239
don't get it this is trash

3514
01:57:13,118 --> 01:57:15,920
like i said like everything kind of has

3515
01:57:14,719 --> 01:57:17,760
its uh

3516
01:57:15,920 --> 01:57:19,118
its place as far as like uh like for

3517
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:20,639
smoking there's people that you're gonna

3518
01:57:19,118 --> 01:57:21,920
talk [ __ ] about like said blue dream

3519
01:57:20,639 --> 01:57:26,319
verbal punch

3520
01:57:21,920 --> 01:57:28,079
um you know green crack um like i i at

3521
01:57:26,319 --> 01:57:29,519
the end of the day i'm actually like

3522
01:57:28,079 --> 01:57:32,000
pretty grateful to have the selection we

3523
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:34,480
have nowadays because what

3524
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:37,279
you know what i smoked

3525
01:57:34,479 --> 01:57:38,399
uh you know 15 years ago or whatever was

3526
01:57:37,279 --> 01:57:40,079
you know a lot of this stuff was just

3527
01:57:38,399 --> 01:57:42,879
garbage so

3528
01:57:40,079 --> 01:57:44,960
it's uh like you know like there's

3529
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:46,480
i mean that like yeah i've definitely i

3530
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:48,800
guess i mean i've

3531
01:57:46,479 --> 01:57:51,359
i've i've smoked out a [ __ ]

3532
01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:52,880
out of like uh aluminum cans and stuff

3533
01:57:51,359 --> 01:57:54,559
like that where it's got

3534
01:57:52,880 --> 01:57:55,840
it's kind of like uh

3535
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:57,199
you know like a

3536
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:59,520
taste is kind of irrelevant at that

3537
01:57:57,198 --> 01:58:01,678
point but uh like you know like like

3538
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:03,520
i've definitely had my fair share of

3539
01:58:01,679 --> 01:58:05,520
smoking of like a lot you know a lot of

3540
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:07,119
[ __ ] really like that's that's you

3541
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:09,360
know most people that used to smoke back

3542
01:58:07,118 --> 01:58:11,039
in the days like you know they

3543
01:58:09,359 --> 01:58:12,399
they uh like yeah

3544
01:58:11,039 --> 01:58:14,399
there was definitely a lot of stuff that

3545
01:58:12,399 --> 01:58:16,799
was going around that was you know just

3546
01:58:14,399 --> 01:58:19,039
uh like not not like what we have the

3547
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:22,000
selection of today

3548
01:58:19,039 --> 01:58:24,238
yeah thank god we are where we're at now

3549
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:26,479
so lucky last question if you could go

3550
01:58:24,238 --> 01:58:29,039
back in time any place anywhere in

3551
01:58:26,479 --> 01:58:30,959
history presumably to grab seeds or

3552
01:58:29,039 --> 01:58:33,039
maybe a clone where would you want to go

3553
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:35,760
and what would you grab

3554
01:58:33,039 --> 01:58:38,560
huh i mean there's uh i mean it's always

3555
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:41,199
nice to have land raised genetics um

3556
01:58:38,560 --> 01:58:42,800
it's i mean but at the end of the day

3557
01:58:41,198 --> 01:58:44,799
it just depends on which what you want

3558
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:46,400
like i know that like you know like

3559
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:48,159
like like uh

3560
01:58:46,399 --> 01:58:50,479
to go to africa and get like some like

3561
01:58:48,158 --> 01:58:52,719
you know some german poison scenes um

3562
01:58:50,479 --> 01:58:55,118
you know like any of those land races

3563
01:58:52,719 --> 01:58:56,079
like that like the hindu kush

3564
01:58:55,118 --> 01:58:58,000
uh

3565
01:58:56,079 --> 01:58:59,118
like things like that that are you know

3566
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:01,760
like you don't you don't see that

3567
01:58:59,118 --> 01:59:03,920
anymore but um like to be able to go

3568
01:59:01,760 --> 01:59:06,719
like go and like acquire those genetics

3569
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:07,840
would be pretty dope um i like you know

3570
01:59:06,719 --> 01:59:09,118
at the end of the day though we actually

3571
01:59:07,840 --> 01:59:12,000
have a really good selection here in

3572
01:59:09,118 --> 01:59:13,439
california just not uh like it's

3573
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:15,359
like obviously not everything's gonna be

3574
01:59:13,439 --> 01:59:16,719
like a land race genetics

3575
01:59:15,359 --> 01:59:20,238

like the middle east and whatnot so

3578
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:25,599
it's uh

3579
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:27,520
