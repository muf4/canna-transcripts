to be so popular

91
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,280
um yes I have I never expect that I

92
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,200
think

93
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,759

not a problem so the first guest we've

96
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:06,780
been asking people sorry the first

97
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,239
question we've been asking our guests

98
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,019
lately is what are you currently smoking

99
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:12,599
on

100
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:15,658
at the moment a

101
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:16,680
I have some New Caledonia boats here I

102
00:04:15,658 --> 00:04:22,800
have

103
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:26,160
a some CBD one I have some Moroccan hash

104
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:29,000
I have some a bit of Indica airport

105
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,880
across pck

106
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:37,160
and a few more and I have Chinese Cali

107
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:40,500
China and yeah a few other sativas yes

108
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,720
wow that's a really nice selection you

109
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,180
have there can you tell us a little bit

110
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:49,100
about the new Caledonian that sounds

111
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:52,079
very rare yeah yeah yeah it's um

112
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:54,419
that we worked last year and it has been

113
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:56,879
released this year

114
00:04:54,418 --> 00:04:59,459
it came from a grower through

115
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,620
interchange a swap of genetics we I did

116
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:04,079
with him

117
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:05,600
he was a very established grower there

118
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:08,819
in New Caledonia

119
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:11,220
and he was interested also in ursativa

120
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:14,040
so we did an interchange he sent me a

121
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:17,040
lot of seats from from the island the

122
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,699
sativasi grew up there

123
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,819
um

124
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:24,720
yeah I think we did the seat swap around

125
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:26,699
2012 and only at this time I I consider

126
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,740
the silver getting too old so it was

127
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:31,340
time to germinate them and explore a bit

128
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,340
the genetics

129
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:35,699
um knowing that we work with landrage

130
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:38,638
with sativas he sent me a lot of ships

131
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:41,038
toward them and to refine the line and

132
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:44,280
spread the genetics honestly I didn't

133
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:47,279
know what to expect at the beginning

134
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:49,739
um certainly was something really new I

135
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:52,138
don't know how we will link with other

136
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:56,100
genetics I'm more familiar with

137
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:57,960
and yes we grew like last year like we

138
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:01,020
still like 100 plants of the New

139
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:04,739
Caledonia from I have like three

140
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:08,099
different seed Lots uh two with more

141
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:10,860
seats it was the seed lot a and the

142
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:13,020
signal of B we took like 50 seats from

143
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:15,419
each

144
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:19,019
um and Grill all of them together

145
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:24,180
indoors and yes initially the the grill

146
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:25,279
like wolf like really tropical sativas

147
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,740
um

148
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:30,799
very slow to reach the sexual maturity

149
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:34,740
to show sex

150
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,000
indoors they grow really big very big

151
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,759
Rose

152
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,220
and yes I was thinking that uh we had

153
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:44,220
something really really tropical on

154
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:46,680
hands when we switched Switzerland to

155
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:49,139
flower they also took their street time

156
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,840
to to really start to flower

157
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:54,180
so yeah yeah they were in the really

158
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:56,939
tropical or a list of tropical yes

159
00:06:54,180 --> 00:07:00,300
because New Caledonia is around 20 in

160
00:06:56,939 --> 00:07:04,680
the South hemisphere latitude and is not

161
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:07,079
really very close to the equator but

162
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,978
it's tropical

163
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:11,698
um

164
00:07:07,978 --> 00:07:14,038
and yes once the plants start to to

165
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:16,919
flower yeah it was really tropical it

166
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:20,060
took the shooting to to flower

167
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:23,038
and we found like maybe a third pla

168
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:24,720
like a third part of the population was

169
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:27,598
a hermaphrodite

170
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,800
so here's the this is very typical when

171
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:33,300
you when you explore new land races

172
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,180
especially sativa and races from the

173
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:39,478
tropics is quite common to find a lot of

174
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:41,720
Hermes in the first P1 generation

175
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:43,918
and yeah we will eliminate the

176
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,139
airmaphrodites we saw some plants

177
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:49,379
adapting better to to in the growing

178
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:52,978
reacting better so start to form resins

179
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:56,219
so interpense also so we had the chance

180
00:07:52,978 --> 00:07:58,258
to start to evaluate which one were more

181
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:00,000
promising we clone

182
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:01,860
when we started to eliminate the

183
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,180
hermaphrodite we start to clone all the

184
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,319
rest of the plants that were sexually

185
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,959
stable

186
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:09,539
uh like it was like it's quite common

187
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:13,138
also with tropical sativas is that

188
00:08:09,538 --> 00:08:15,779
usually the the Sati the the female to

189
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:18,720
male right here is very high uh that

190
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:22,739
means that you find maybe 78 of the

191
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:25,259
males and the rest only males and within

192
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:28,319
this tool also a lot of fermis in this

193
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:30,300
case a third part so yes at the end we

194
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,759
remove like half of the plants after

195
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:35,639
eliminate the Hermes and plants that

196
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:38,218
after many many many ways didn't respond

197
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:40,918
didn't do anything or or comparing with

198
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:44,339
other were lacking of racing after pins

199
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:47,039
so yeah the MVA we came out like with 30

200
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:50,160
plus really nice females

201
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:53,639
um five sexually firm males

202
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:56,399
and then we'll open pollinate the um the

203
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:58,379
with the finals all different males at

204
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,440
the same time as I told you we had all

205
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:04,320
clones from all these more promising

206
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,480
females in the mother room or backup

207
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,480
copies

208
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,959
um yes and then the the reproduction was

209
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:16,139
a success we pollinated all the more

210
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:19,039
than 30 females that were sexually firm

211
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:22,379
that were sexually firms too

212
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:25,338
and and then when they finish the the

213
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:28,019
reproduction they're ripe I was able to

214
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:29,940
evaluate better which were were more

215
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:31,500
rationals and with better the pencil

216
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:34,200
also they were seated

217
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,720
so the most promising was I I broke

218
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,220
clones to all the growing to do uh since

219
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,639
a media cycle

220
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:43,379
that means without pollination to to

221
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:46,439
evaluate properly the flower without

222
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:49,799
seeds Outdoors which is I feel you that

223
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:52,200
this strain Express itself better

224
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:55,259
Outdoors than indoors at least in this

225
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:57,120
initial generation so yes it was

226
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:59,059
surprising because we moved the clothes

227
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,320
a bit late in August

228
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:03,179
which is a bit late for planting even

229
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,399
for tropical sativas but they catch up

230
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:07,559
very very fast the smoke clones grow up

231
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:11,639
almost like two two meters

232
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:12,859
and and around late October they were

233
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:16,019
already

234
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:18,600
finishing uh yeah maybe they will need

235
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:21,240
one two weeks more but they reacted

236
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,480
Outdoors much faster and better than

237
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:26,399
indoors yes

238
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:30,120
and another time when when they were

239
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:32,419
starting to write my God I was really

240
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:35,100
excited because I started to smell like

241
00:10:32,419 --> 00:10:38,879
incredible refined to the fruit the

242
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:41,879
Aromas the the um the reasons were very

243
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:44,399
good and normally signs in the plans we

244
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:46,578
we were testing Outdoors so our

245
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,440
selection were in the right direction

246
00:10:46,578 --> 00:10:52,078
regarding regarding quality too

247
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,600
so yes at the end we we end up with

248
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:56,519
evaluating like eight females the most

249
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,100
promising females from the silver

250
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:02,278
production we evaluate them Outdoors

251
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:04,500
without seats then we start to smoke

252
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:07,500
them we brought them to the lab for kind

253
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:10,200
of we know they enter pen analysis I

254
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,299
already did some genetic analysis a few

255
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:15,180
years back

256
00:11:11,299 --> 00:11:17,219
so yes with all the smoking tests the

257
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:19,439
smoking The Growing Experience the

258
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:22,040
silver production yeah we decided we

259
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,140
were extremely

260
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:27,179
uh excited about this news genetics when

261
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:30,419
we I when I started to smoke it I was

262
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:33,838
wow it has been so long that I don't

263
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:37,259
feel this quality of high in a sativa

264
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:41,279
like you smoke it and everything becomes

265
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:44,120
super clean Vivid you you feel like the

266
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:46,919
the colors more intense

267
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:50,100
but not with Distortion Like Everything

268
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:52,939
More Alive the the sound also you you

269
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:56,220
can hear even the father-son super

270
00:11:52,940 --> 00:12:00,240
strong then you feel like a big energy

271
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:02,579
growing up from from inside like you

272
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,940
become creative connected with your

273
00:12:02,578 --> 00:12:10,799
surroundings uh you you feel uplifted

274
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:13,980
motivated your psyche is well focused

275
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:16,519
it's a very very good quality High very

276
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,519
very good

277
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:23,039
um to be honest about the origins of the

278
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:26,179
genetics I think is not so linked really

279
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:26,179
with uh

280
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:31,980
alandres I would say the Finnish product

281
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:35,519
has

282
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:40,019
quite tight qualities in the smoke like

283
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:41,940
especially in the taste it's a soul lime

284
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:44,899
lemonade taste that is quite common on

285
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:48,899
on Time land races

286
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:50,639
and the effect is quite thai-like very

287
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:53,059
clear up

288
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:56,820
but the flower structure

289
00:12:53,059 --> 00:12:59,278
is more a bit more like a Mexican or

290
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:01,800
like American sativa it's not so Lucy

291
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:05,100
like the ties that the ties usually have

292
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:09,000
a very Lucy flower structure or very Fox

293
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:13,560
style not not dense a real pure ties

294
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:16,679
never dance but this one makes a

295
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:20,099
quite quite quite dense buds for for for

296
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:22,578
a pure sativa traits flower instructors

297
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:26,360
that I have seen more in certain

298
00:13:22,578 --> 00:13:30,179
Mexicans or even more modern Colombians

299
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:34,139
uh but there is my feeling is someone

300
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:36,419
like uh take like a Thai American sativa

301
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:39,959
mix that makes sense to the audience

302
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:41,578
regarding the Finnish blog and it's very

303
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:44,219
interesting line we have released this

304
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:47,599
year and we cannot wait to to hear the

305
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:50,420
opinion of The Growers and sativa lovers

306
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,639
about this new line yeah

307
00:13:50,419 --> 00:13:56,099
wow what an incredibly comprehensive and

308
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:57,720
detailed answer I'm very excited to ask

309
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,639
you some more questions I think this is

310
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,980
going to be a great interview

311
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:04,759
I'd love to know you mentioned kind of

312
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:08,180
how you went about weeding out the

313
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:11,578
hermaphrodites at first and sort of

314
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:15,599
stabilizing the line when you get a land

315
00:14:11,578 --> 00:14:17,759
race line from seed do you find that you

316
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,920
have to selectively breed out the

317
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:24,480
hermaphrodisms or it just over

318
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:24,479
Generations naturally stabilizes

319
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:32,958
usually it depends how domesticated is

320
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:35,519
the land race but there's usually

321
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:39,239
for example if you get cyst from a

322
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:41,578
language that has been refined and tame

323
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:44,759
but very

324
00:14:41,578 --> 00:14:46,919
properly by a grower like taking very

325
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:49,639
well care of the gene pool and all the

326
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:53,159
individuals involved in every generation

327
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:56,879
in this in these cases which are very

328
00:14:53,159 --> 00:15:00,240
rare you can expect lower hermaphrodite

329
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:02,278
rates in in these cases in these land

330
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,759
race but most of the times the land

331
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:08,399
races are grown uh

332
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,838
you must feel like many plants every

333
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:14,220
generation whether you see in

334
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:18,420
Afghanistan Pakistan or India or in

335
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:22,800
Morocco or in Colombia they grow many

336
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:26,299
many plants and not all the farmer not

337
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:30,899
all the traditional farmers are very

338
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:34,198
diligent or or very efficient to remove

339
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:36,198
to fully remove their Aphrodite traits

340
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:38,899
in in the people in their population

341
00:15:36,198 --> 00:15:42,419
that is for example because usually in

342
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:44,720
houseplant population and they don't

343
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:47,578
mind all the plants are fully seeded

344
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:51,778
whether it's in Morocco or Lebanese or

345
00:15:47,578 --> 00:15:55,259
Afghanistan or Pakistan the the plants

346
00:15:51,778 --> 00:15:58,019
get completely fully seeded so they are

347
00:15:55,259 --> 00:16:00,360
not not very worried most of the times

348
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:02,578
that they select Pro they choose a good

349
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:06,180
males that are sexually firm but

350
00:16:02,578 --> 00:16:08,578
sometimes uh some male hermaphrodite

351
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:11,458
hermaphrodites can Skype they can escape

352
00:16:08,578 --> 00:16:14,278
sorry and they can also pollinate so

353
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:19,939
yeah big populations libraries like this

354
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:22,820
usually have in some in given plants

355
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:26,880
some hermaphrodite

356
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:29,699
traits somewhere in some land races it

357
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:32,519
could be more evident in others not

358
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:35,399
but yeah most of the times when when we

359
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:39,778
receive the uh the P1 generation the P1

360
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:42,539
generation is I refer to the the first

361
00:16:39,778 --> 00:16:46,578
generation seats collected in C2 in the

362
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:46,578
place of origin of the land race okay

363
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:52,319
um usually when we start to work with

364
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:55,500
the P1 land regeneration is very typical

365
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:58,459
that I find a lot of hermaphrodites and

366
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:01,980
it's very common that I need to clean

367
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:03,059
a lot the the land race in this first

368
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,120
generation

369
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:09,298
some language tend to be more or they're

370
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:11,879
lesser and also most land race are Auto

371
00:17:09,298 --> 00:17:16,019
genetics obviously so when you bring

372
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:19,260
them to indoor for to evaluate them to

373
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:21,838
to select them and and all this

374
00:17:19,259 --> 00:17:24,119
the auto genetics that have been grown

375
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:26,458
for many many generations centuries

376
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:28,558
Outdoors they don't really like the

377
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:31,860
indoors suddenly like you put them in

378
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:34,200
with artificial light like short stable

379
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:37,639
photo periods that they are not used to

380
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:40,259
it so they they very easily show

381
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,900
more in my for the trash that they will

382
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:45,480
do outdoors in in their place of origin

383
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:48,298
so but it's a good thing because you

384
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:52,380
force the the jump pull your of the land

385
00:17:48,298 --> 00:17:55,460
race you are working with to to show any

386
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:59,419
problem any problem indoors any kind of

387
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:03,240
indoor habitability

388
00:17:59,419 --> 00:18:07,020
any army tendency you can detect them

389
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:09,839
much easier indoors and yes I try to

390
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:12,200
remove all the hermaphrodite plants from

391
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:15,959
from the first generation

392
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:18,660
only if I don't have any plans to work

393
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:20,759
with I will reproduce using maybe one is

394
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:24,538
likely hear me but it has never been the

395
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:27,839
case usually if I have no plans I remove

396
00:18:24,538 --> 00:18:31,740
Fuller me and then Focus only in the

397
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:33,899
sexually stable I I have

398
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,859
yeah great thank you so much for that

399
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:37,080
answer

400
00:18:34,859 --> 00:18:38,759
I noticed that when you were talking

401
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:40,918
about all the different things you were

402
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:44,099
smoking at the moment you mentioned

403
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:46,380
Earth or however you pronounce it it's a

404
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:49,379
it's a very interesting strain I think I

405
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:52,740
read online that it was sort of worked

406
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:55,500
on in Sweden maybe and that it has like

407
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:58,079
a strawberry flavor can you tell us what

408
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:00,599
you know about the back story yeah yeah

409
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:04,439
yeah and I know I read this

410
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:08,159
these are quite interesting story in the

411
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:11,179
the airport is a a neighbor which in

412
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:15,600
German means strawberry

413
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:18,660
it was a an Afghani an Afghanistan that

414
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:20,819
was very widely grown in Switzerland uh

415
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,200
almost 20 years ago in Switzerland they

416
00:19:20,819 --> 00:19:26,339
have like a

417
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:28,798
the Hella the the Golden Era of the

418
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:30,959
Swiss cannabis time that was almost 20

419
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:33,960
years ago they legalized for a few years

420
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,538
also the TA SQ cultivation Journey was

421
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,940
around that time when breederer Steve or

422
00:19:36,538 --> 00:19:41,579
Mr Nice and other breeders went to

423
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:43,740
Switzerland to to legally for a few

424
00:19:41,579 --> 00:19:46,439
years I think get out of control and

425
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:50,579
then the Swiss government stop it out

426
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:52,259
and now that it was Switzerland was

427
00:19:50,579 --> 00:19:56,159
quite straight for 20 years and now with

428
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:59,099
all the CBD scene they are in a new

429
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,320
golden era in Switzerland but more with

430
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:05,879
the CBD produce but at that time they

431
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:08,939
were growing uh CBD sorry DC secretive

432
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:12,000
streams and one of the Clones Afghani

433
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:14,400
clones that they work uh and grow a lot

434
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,880
it was the Herbert we was in Afghani

435
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:21,480
that they used to grow indoors in big

436
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:23,580
indoor rooms for to sell in in the

437
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:26,599
coffee shop in the Swiss officials at

438
00:20:23,579 --> 00:20:29,519
that time and it was a quite popular

439
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:32,579
Afghanistan in in Switzerland like 20

440
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:35,819
years ago also a

441
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:39,899
in at that time in Switzerland there was

442
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:41,159
also a local seed bank it was all all

443
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:44,038
seats

444
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:47,038
the breeder was Felix

445
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:49,079
and and he used to grow outdoors in

446
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:52,919
Switzerland he was a Swiss Auto grower

447
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:56,339
and and he got a purple suicidal line

448
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:59,100
from some old ladies he said that it was

449
00:20:56,339 --> 00:21:00,779
the purpurati finances okay because it

450
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:03,779
was grown in pichino

451
00:21:00,779 --> 00:21:07,379
it was purple so so it was called

452
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:11,720
corporate titianensis it was a very it

453
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:14,280
was more sativa a happy strain

454
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:16,079
the origins of the populated finances

455
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:18,119
are not clear some people say it could

456
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:20,639
be an Himalayan strain

457
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:22,678
is not clear but it was already an

458
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,500
outdoor restraint that was very adapted

459
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:27,120
to Swiss

460
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:29,700
climate and it was very purple very

461
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:32,119
early flowering very resistant so the

462
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:35,519
indoor airport

463
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:39,658
was closed with purpuria to titinances

464
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:41,579
okay uh and then it came out the airport

465
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:44,820
okay

466
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:48,599
uh when airport came out uh

467
00:21:44,819 --> 00:21:51,359
the the Golden Era of the streets THC

468
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:54,298
times and up

469
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:58,558
um I'm some Danny's breathers like has

470
00:21:54,298 --> 00:21:59,879
been a nurse and nosbe work the their

471
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:02,099
poor genetics

472
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,960
one two three generations that are in

473
00:22:02,099 --> 00:22:07,558
there in Denmark

474
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,779
and in Sven which is a friend of mine is

475
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:13,079
a great

476
00:22:08,779 --> 00:22:15,359
breeder a very kind person uh I

477
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:17,879
encourage or obvious to discover more

478
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:20,099
about his seed bank he is hybrids from

479
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,760
hell I don't know if you know about it

480
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:26,399
he's specialized in in breathing

481
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:29,700
Northern lines for yeah for called

482
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:32,100
Northern climates and he has many

483
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:34,940
interesting semi-auto flooring strains

484
00:22:32,099 --> 00:22:38,759
that finish very well in in Denmark in

485
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:40,558
northern Europe countries

486
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:42,599
um and he passed me the airport after

487
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:45,599
work with Australian outdoor two three

488
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:47,939
generation in 2000 I grew up I grew the

489
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:50,279
stream from him in 2006.

490
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:54,179
but he gave me the Cs to start to work

491
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:57,960
with them in a more serious way in 2012.

492
00:22:54,179 --> 00:23:01,259
um in 2012 we we start to work the

493
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:03,659
strain indoors Outdoors we saw some

494
00:23:01,259 --> 00:23:05,158
Aphrodite Tendencies when we brought the

495
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:06,600
line indoors is what I told you with the

496
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:09,299
land race it's very typical when you

497
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:11,639
take another line that has been work and

498
00:23:09,298 --> 00:23:13,679
selected many generation Outdoors when

499
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:17,820
you're bringing indoors is very typical

500
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:21,419
the the some some parental plans give

501
00:23:17,819 --> 00:23:24,000
some some hermaphrodite problems okay

502
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:26,280
um so we work the strain indoors a bit

503
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,179
to try to adapt the the genetic centers

504
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:31,798
to to remove this empholitism indoors

505
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:33,900
mainly

506
00:23:31,798 --> 00:23:36,240
um and and yes one thing that was never

507
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:40,500
done with airport their pool was already

508
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:43,140
a very consistent line for earliness for

509
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:46,380
cold resistant

510
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:48,960
um for very beautiful colors okay the

511
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:51,000
the airport has like two main phenoms

512
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,919
the Herbert was a green Afghani and the

513
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,619
corporation finances was a very colorful

514
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:57,659
plant so the mix between the Green

515
00:23:55,619 --> 00:24:00,839
Albert Afghani and the purpose finances

516
00:23:57,659 --> 00:24:03,240
produce like a blend of colors and some

517
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:05,699
leaning to the Green Airport so more

518
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,740
green in color and others leaning to the

519
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:10,558
very colorful to the purpley tendency

520
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:12,538
with purple red black colors and

521
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:14,099
sometimes also in between

522
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:16,740
and

523
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:21,000
and yes the qualities of this line for

524
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:23,400
earliness for cold resistant that were

525
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:27,359
clear and The Taste is quite nice like

526
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:28,940
the the colorful have a berry taste the

527
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:33,558
green Afghani

528
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:36,240
phenotypes have a more earthy has

529
00:24:33,558 --> 00:24:39,240
a taste of when it taste very classic

530
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,099
Afghani taste and these are the terpenes

531
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:44,159
that you can find in the line

532
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:48,439
but being an Afghani line

533
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:51,780
uh you know Afghanistan don't really

534
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:52,919
they could be problematic with the

535
00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:55,319
buzzword

536
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:56,480
uh in late flowering you know because in

537
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:59,519
Afghanistan

538
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,980
is a very dry climate so all the

539
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:04,200
genetics from there are used to to

540
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:07,819
flower with very dry conditions with

541
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:11,159
very strong temperature but with low

542
00:25:07,819 --> 00:25:14,658
moisture that's why a lot of the Indica

543
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:19,080
Afghani genetics are very

544
00:25:14,659 --> 00:25:22,620
uh susceptible our very prone to to

545
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:24,658
bathroom to about treating solder okay

546
00:25:22,619 --> 00:25:27,719
and that was the case also with airport

547
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:31,159
because it contains a heavy stronto of

548
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:34,500
Afghani genetics both in Denmark that is

549
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:37,500
a wet country and here in my Coastal

550
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:39,919
climate of my my climate here in Spain

551
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:42,480
is very warm but I have a lot of

552
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:45,419
moisture because I live very close to

553
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:48,000
the coast so yes we we found there put a

554
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:49,520
bit problematic with the with the

555
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:55,019
bathrooms

556
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:58,079
air since 2012 we worked like maybe

557
00:25:55,019 --> 00:26:01,500
until now we have worked like maybe four

558
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:05,119
generation indoors and three generation

559
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:08,400
outdoor in regular and feminized format

560
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:10,859
and through all these Generations we

561
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,559
brought samples to the lab and then we

562
00:26:10,859 --> 00:26:14,298
identified no one did before that the

563
00:26:13,558 --> 00:26:18,599
airport

564
00:26:14,298 --> 00:26:21,418
also have a CBD content like it's very

565
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:24,298
typical from Afghanistan language

566
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:27,419
population this is a topic that we can

567
00:26:24,298 --> 00:26:30,298
discuss later and no one knew this

568
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:33,960
before the airport whether it was a DAC

569
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:37,099
reached strain it was clearly secretive

570
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:42,538
so it had THC but we we thought

571
00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:46,278
evaluation work and study at the lab we

572
00:26:42,538 --> 00:26:49,798
conform scientifically the airport was

573
00:26:46,278 --> 00:26:54,480
also CBD Rich strain most of the

574
00:26:49,798 --> 00:26:58,980
phenotypes are a one-to-one THC CBD

575
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:04,679
chemotype balance usually with 780c to

576
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:06,778
70 A2 CBD so quite balanced it gets you

577
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:10,259
high is not the most strong Indica but

578
00:27:06,778 --> 00:27:13,859
it's not a notificative is scheduled

579
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:16,019
quite quite High and and yes there are

580
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:19,439
some we found some very rare phenotypes

581
00:27:16,019 --> 00:27:22,740
that only have CBD but a little THC but

582
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:25,259
more or less it's like a balance THC CBD

583
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:27,659
strain barriently flowering the good

584
00:27:25,259 --> 00:27:30,058
think of of the air put is that it has

585
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:33,120
the same out of semi-auto-florine trade

586
00:27:30,058 --> 00:27:36,480
from the finances what does a meal to

587
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:39,658
flowing means that it's a a concept that

588
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,519
is a bit confusing for for many it's

589
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:44,100
semi-auto flooring because it's not

590
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:46,740
fully autoflowering it means that you

591
00:27:44,099 --> 00:27:49,619
can keep clones in the mother room you

592
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:51,960
can keep them for long term you can even

593
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:53,639
try to Rebecca the plants this is

594
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:58,019
completely impossible with fully

595
00:27:53,640 --> 00:28:02,100
autofluoring genetics okay but yeah or

596
00:27:58,019 --> 00:28:05,278
monally they tend to flower at the

597
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:09,119
anytime for example when they feel Rock

598
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:11,519
bone they they try to to flower when

599
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:14,099
they feel that there's just a slight

600
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:17,339
decrease of photo parallel outers they

601
00:28:14,099 --> 00:28:22,079
try to to flower and so they have a very

602
00:28:17,339 --> 00:28:25,139
early flowering flow very early flow

603
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:26,939
flowering on set outdoor when you when

604
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:30,600
most of the Afghani in the restraint

605
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:33,960
start to flower in maybe in August in my

606
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:35,519
latitude to finish in early October the

607
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,620
airport may be starting July and

608
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:41,759
finishing late August early September

609
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:44,519
okay the flower is 45 50 days but it can

610
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:47,640
start to floor one to one month and a

611
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:49,558
half ahead and other Afghani strange

612
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:53,220
that had no similar to flowing so this

613
00:28:49,558 --> 00:28:55,500
is an advantage for call for Golden and

614
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:57,179
yeah and for an early Harvest and this

615
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,640
is more or less the quality and the the

616
00:28:57,179 --> 00:29:01,080
history of the airport we have made some

617
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:05,400
high-risk with them

618
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:09,000
song with THC some with CBD

619
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:11,700
and yes it's a very interesting plan by

620
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:15,480
itself for medical because we have both

621
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:19,860
TSC and CBD it has a very relaxing high

622
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:22,140
and good for pain good for for muscles

623
00:29:19,859 --> 00:29:24,319
for insomnia

624
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:26,640
and

625
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:28,439
yes and it's also a very useful plant

626
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,520
for breathing for alieners and for

627
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:34,500
interesting chemo types

628
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:38,339
wow what a brilliant answer thank you so

629
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:42,058
very much speaking of CBD you also

630
00:29:38,339 --> 00:29:45,418
mentioned cbd1 and I noticed you had

631
00:29:42,058 --> 00:29:47,519
made that more recently what inspired

632
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:50,278
you to make that and do you want to do

633
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:53,579
more CBD lines in the future

634
00:29:50,278 --> 00:29:56,220
when the the CBD is honestly a very

635
00:29:53,579 --> 00:29:59,220
interesting field is as you well know

636
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:01,679
that we have had 10 years or more like

637
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:02,940
uh the CBD Revolution

638
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,519
like

639
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:09,120
people realization of the medical

640
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:11,879
benefit of CBD and there's now a

641
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:15,719
completely uh boom in the industry for

642
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:18,620
for CBD products in a tall range of

643
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:22,460
products whether it's a genetic seeds

644
00:30:18,619 --> 00:30:26,939
extraction flower Edibles

645
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:30,600
for medicine and in the National Health

646
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:32,700
Systems everywhere so yes when we asked

647
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:35,459
I start with this I am not going to like

648
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:38,100
you I was more interested to get high on

649
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:41,538
the recreational side of the of the

650
00:30:38,099 --> 00:30:43,980
Cannabis like many people but yes and

651
00:30:41,538 --> 00:30:45,140
obviously understand and not all the

652
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:47,460
people

653
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:49,919
approach to cannabis from the

654
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:51,679
recreational side and some people really

655
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:55,320
need it as a medicine

656
00:30:51,679 --> 00:31:00,419
uh I I also was started to last years

657
00:30:55,319 --> 00:31:03,839
like a bit of anxiety and myself so yes

658
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:07,380
I I feel like like it was also a good

659
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:09,959
moment to to focus more on on breathing

660
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:11,700
with CBD also for myself but also for

661
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:14,340
others

662
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:16,220
um and yeah I saw that at least here in

663
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:18,839
Europe in in

664
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:20,278
United States the thing is much more

665
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:22,918
advanced because with the legalization

666
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:25,140
and all the resources and the qualified

667
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:27,899
people they have there they have a lot

668
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:30,778
they have advanced a lot in in the hand

669
00:31:27,898 --> 00:31:33,538
breathing and to develop same lines with

670
00:31:30,778 --> 00:31:35,278
CBD that are very very interesting they

671
00:31:33,538 --> 00:31:37,740
have they have done and they are doing

672
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:41,099
an amazing job there in in United States

673
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:42,960
but here in Europe the the pioneers of

674
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:46,139
the movement to

675
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:48,778
to put in that way that where Jaime from

676
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:51,659
racing seats here in Spain yeah

677
00:31:48,778 --> 00:31:53,599
curiously the the main lines the main

678
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:57,539
CBD lines

679
00:31:53,599 --> 00:32:00,298
that came out to the scene to the CBD

680
00:31:57,538 --> 00:32:01,319
game and the CBD breeding that were more

681
00:32:00,298 --> 00:32:01,859
useful

682
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:03,778
um

683
00:32:01,859 --> 00:32:05,058
I'm more appreciated that Growers came

684
00:32:03,778 --> 00:32:08,519
from Spain

685
00:32:05,058 --> 00:32:12,720
it was from Jaime from racing seats

686
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:15,119
which was the the first to identify in a

687
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:18,600
in a

688
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:21,298
you know the SL hybrid CBD and then he

689
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:23,519
call it they call it cannotonic it won a

690
00:32:21,298 --> 00:32:26,940
cannabis capture in Spain and then you

691
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:30,658
got a lot of reputation after won the

692
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:33,899
cup and after being analyzed for CBD

693
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:35,580
and then the the origins of of the

694
00:32:33,898 --> 00:32:40,019
Canada were

695
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:41,759
were not clear and finally we knew that

696
00:32:40,019 --> 00:32:45,058
it came from another Spanish event

697
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:49,319
called Dragon seats that they were also

698
00:32:45,058 --> 00:32:53,038
working with many the the SL hybrids and

699
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:56,519
Richard CBD DSL hybrids mainly

700
00:32:53,038 --> 00:33:00,000
and these were the the main source of

701
00:32:56,519 --> 00:33:01,740
the CBD richer strains that later make

702
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,259
the woman in Europe and later were

703
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:07,259
brought to United States they were very

704
00:33:04,259 --> 00:33:10,980
interesting because they taste like and

705
00:33:07,259 --> 00:33:12,558
look like the best DSL okay

706
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:17,339
DSL

707
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:19,019
and but they they contain lot of CBD

708
00:33:17,339 --> 00:33:22,619
okay

709
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:26,519
yeah so with this moment the Jaime

710
00:33:22,619 --> 00:33:30,239
created the Russian seeds offering some

711
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:32,399
CBD strains and then Jaime from Russian

712
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:35,519
sheath I think joined with is called

713
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:39,239
Blake from Santi Baba from Mr Nice to

714
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:42,899
make CBD crew and I think CBD crew were

715
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:45,798
giving a breeding CBD breathing services

716
00:33:42,898 --> 00:33:48,500
or to many other companies in Europe

717
00:33:45,798 --> 00:33:51,440
like serious cities

718
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:56,460
and that's passion

719
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:58,860
many others so yeah eventually many CBD

720
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:01,440
strains came out from all the seed banks

721
00:33:58,859 --> 00:34:03,199
but all these strains

722
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:07,679
yeah

723
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:10,440
and didn't have the the chemical type

724
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:13,200
stabilized they were very irregular in

725
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:15,780
chemo type so

726
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:17,638
when these signs were offering CBD

727
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:19,440
strains but the chemothai was not

728
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:23,838
stabilized and they say yes you could

729
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:30,780
have 50 percent of balances

730
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:33,239
CBD 25 only CBD and 25 TC with TSC and

731
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:35,419
no CBD I said well this is from the

732
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:38,939
medical point of view is crazy because

733
00:34:35,418 --> 00:34:42,179
the the grower don't know what's the

734
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:45,780
chemotype of his plants and he he or she

735
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:47,700
cannot tolerate well the THC and he or

736
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:52,440
she got that is he planned from

737
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:56,419
so-called CBD seeds is is not a good job

738
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:59,519
so yeah at that moment people were

739
00:34:56,420 --> 00:35:02,880
releasing it really strange like

740
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:04,739
Non-Stop and then I had a friend that

741
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,500
used to work for Jaime many many years

742
00:35:04,739 --> 00:35:09,299
ago and he got some kind of tonic as one

743
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,619
sits from the original clone from

744
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:14,760
cannotonic

745
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:16,980
he got sulfates or of that club my

746
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:19,440
friend got this is for for many years

747
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:20,940
and he told me lubi these things are

748
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,420
getting old do you want to do something

749
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:26,700
with them

750
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:27,539
we will check it out

751
00:35:26,699 --> 00:35:30,419
um

752
00:35:27,539 --> 00:35:33,719
and and and then we

753
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:35,220
he for me and he told me at least I

754
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:37,919
think I have some interesting things

755
00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:39,959
from these plants I was about to take a

756
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,880
flight to the holidays

757
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:43,559
okay you just give that glance when I

758
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,720
come back here from holidays we will

759
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:48,480
check it out yeah I came from holidays

760
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:50,459
we check out the plants and brought all

761
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:54,240
the samples of other plants to the lab

762
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:57,720
and then we realized scientifically that

763
00:35:54,239 --> 00:36:03,539
the catatonic original clone that was it

764
00:35:57,719 --> 00:36:06,959
had a balanced chemotype it was uh yeah

765
00:36:03,539 --> 00:36:09,719
I cannot remember maybe eight to ten THC

766
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:12,539
to 10 CBD was like this

767
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:15,419
and when you sell fit and you grow the

768
00:36:12,539 --> 00:36:19,199
S1 seats okay

769
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:23,159
and we we found out uh

770
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:27,239
uh all the main chemo types in the S1

771
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:30,719
and this one should behave like an F2

772
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:33,379
for the chemotypes in the as one sees we

773
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:36,959
found THC Rich plants

774
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:40,680
balance THC CBD plants like the original

775
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:43,500
canatonic and then we found we found

776
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:45,539
also only High CBD plants with very

777
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:48,539
little Tac

778
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:54,000
from one of them we found one that was

779
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:56,940
27 CBD content which is the the plan

780
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,358
that with a lab report not that

781
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:02,760
someone's says that no I have a 30 CBD

782
00:37:00,358 --> 00:37:05,819
plan okay so you show man analysis we

783
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:08,339
did it we have an analysis that proves

784
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:10,140
that the cannotonics as one plan we

785
00:37:08,338 --> 00:37:11,159
selected

786
00:37:10,139 --> 00:37:14,759
um

787
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:17,338
it contains 20 some percent CBD and

788
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:20,359
around one THC then we have another

789
00:37:17,338 --> 00:37:24,480
system with a similar chemotype that was

790
00:37:20,358 --> 00:37:27,719
17 18 CBD and 0.7

791
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:29,820
a THC okay the most interesting was the

792
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:31,439
CBD one the one I tell you that had 27

793
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:34,500
CBD

794
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:37,740
and the other was cbd5

795
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:40,760
and uh it's some very easy when you say

796
00:37:37,739 --> 00:37:43,259
okay we already have phone uh from the

797
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:46,200
cannotonic population the the ones we

798
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:50,220
won with the very high CBD and OTC chemo

799
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:53,159
time we just need to to cross this the

800
00:37:50,219 --> 00:37:55,500
the plants from the cannotonic as one of

801
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:58,559
the chemother we want between each other

802
00:37:55,500 --> 00:38:01,739
to stabilize this camo type okay the the

803
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:03,779
plan so someone quite easy but

804
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:07,519
unfortunately

805
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:07,519
they were infertile

806
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:14,000
this is a problem that sometimes you

807
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:14,000
find in S1

808
00:38:14,219 --> 00:38:19,679
in as one generation as one

809
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:23,480
self-pollination is the highest form of

810
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:27,000
embredding there's it's like

811
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:29,579
having kids only with yourself there's

812
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,800
not other higher form of human breathing

813
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:34,079
you maybe could have kids with your

814
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:37,320
sister it would be a very high form of

815
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:39,839
inbreeding but it's even highest in

816
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:42,599
writing to totally produce Offspring

817
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:45,420
with your genotype without introducing

818
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:49,140
any other genotype this could

819
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:51,659
this one is a very interesting tool for

820
00:38:49,139 --> 00:38:54,480
fixing trades for inbreeding very in a

821
00:38:51,659 --> 00:38:58,039
very strong way but it can also lead to

822
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:01,619
to health problems like lack of vigor

823
00:38:58,039 --> 00:39:04,259
mutations and one of the problems that

824
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:07,800
some of the S1 lines can show not all of

825
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:11,820
them is unfertility in this case was so

826
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:14,539
we try to pollinate cbd-1 with with CBD

827
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:18,260
file reversal

828
00:39:14,539 --> 00:39:22,440
we try to pollinate a

829
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:26,280
cbd5 with cbd1 reversal it didn't work

830
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:28,200
so we we had like a wall we didn't know

831
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:31,200
how to advance in in the breathing at

832
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:34,259
that time I say okay where we have the

833
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:35,598
airport which is also a CBD Rich line it

834
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:38,520
has nothing

835
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:42,539
stabilized to be only CBD

836
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:44,940
reach the airport but it's another CBD

837
00:39:42,539 --> 00:39:48,719
Rich that is fertile and we can try to

838
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:51,500
introduce to the unfertile uh canatonic

839
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:53,879
S1 plants that we cannot reproduce

840
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:56,219
unfortunately it was still a bit

841
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:58,619
infertile but we managed to do a cross

842
00:39:56,219 --> 00:40:02,639
between the CBD one and the Green

843
00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:07,320
Airport okay and this

844
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:08,940
F1 cross we it was the CBD cross Airport

845
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:13,338
uh

846
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:17,460
it had like 50 percent the the balance

847
00:40:13,338 --> 00:40:20,880
uh THC CBD chemo types like Airport

848
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:24,119
and 50 only High CBD

849
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:28,079
and low TSC chemo types like this CBD

850
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:29,220
one kind of tonic S1 parental plan we we

851
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:32,519
selected

852
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:34,858
and and the mix of the pain of the pins

853
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:37,619
and dresses was amazing the Canton it

854
00:40:34,858 --> 00:40:40,619
has very nice it'll be from from the

855
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:41,640
soul diesel Generations like a skunk and

856
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:44,640
all this

857
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:44,639
foreign

858
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:58,740
it was great so we want to focus only in

859
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:04,800
the high CBD plants

860
00:40:58,739 --> 00:41:07,259
no TSC from the cbd-1 airport cross

861
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:10,140
we selected the the once I like move the

862
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:12,420
smoke and the love have the highestivity

863
00:41:10,139 --> 00:41:13,379
we select the fourth elements of the F1

864
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:17,220
hybrid

865
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:19,140
and then we try we reverse again the CBD

866
00:41:17,219 --> 00:41:21,959
clone It produced very very very little

867
00:41:19,139 --> 00:41:23,879
and we managed to to pollinate these

868
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:26,280
four selected female of the F1 so

869
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:31,980
produce some somewhere like a back cross

870
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:36,420
okay uh CBD one airport close to 71.

871
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:39,420
okay then we grill the this back cross

872
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:43,519
the seeds and then we found that all the

873
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:43,519
seeds had stabilized the chemother

874
00:41:44,059 --> 00:41:49,259
now we did it and it was not very

875
00:41:46,739 --> 00:41:51,598
difficult obviously with you need help

876
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:54,780
from the lab or otherwise you are

877
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:58,700
selecting numbers blindly yeah but if

878
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:58,700
you have a lab and

879
00:41:58,858 --> 00:42:04,799
yes the the way to stabilize follows

880
00:42:01,739 --> 00:42:07,979
simple mandolin radius

881
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:13,320
you know it's it was the in the

882
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:16,079
canatonic S1 it is split in basic

883
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:20,460
Mandalay and radius also and when we did

884
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:23,339
the F1 cross we we cut a bit the chemo

885
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:25,858
times but also the the frequencies were

886
00:42:23,338 --> 00:42:28,559
very mentally mandolin

887
00:42:25,858 --> 00:42:30,900
uh and and finally we managed to

888
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:34,440
stabilize we we brought to the lab we

889
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:36,720
confirmed that all the plants uh were

890
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:39,420
like like we wanted then we selected

891
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:40,559
again the the four that we I like more

892
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:43,680
of the smoke

893
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:46,858
and I have a slightly more CBD than her

894
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:49,618
sisters and then we inbreed each other

895
00:42:46,858 --> 00:42:53,400
we didn't cross again to the CBD one

896
00:42:49,619 --> 00:42:55,680
clone because we wanted to make a a

897
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:57,480
commercial reproduction sometimes so

898
00:42:55,679 --> 00:43:00,899
something that we can came out with a

899
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:05,338
lot of seeds okay and if we use again

900
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:07,858
this the series one original plan it

901
00:43:05,338 --> 00:43:10,799
will ask to to very small reproduction

902
00:43:07,858 --> 00:43:12,299
to the internal infertility so it would

903
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:16,500
be impossible to make a commercial

904
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:18,200
release so we embred the the Microsoft

905
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:21,300
parental place that I like the most

906
00:43:18,199 --> 00:43:23,759
reproduce between them so in Red Line

907
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:27,240
what is embedding through the line

908
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:30,060
there was some slide fertility problem

909
00:43:27,239 --> 00:43:32,098
but we really managed to produce

910
00:43:30,059 --> 00:43:35,099
thousands and thousands of seats and

911
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:37,980
finally release the line with the

912
00:43:35,099 --> 00:43:40,680
chemothers stabilized so summing up it

913
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:43,199
takes the best from Canada tonic with a

914
00:43:40,679 --> 00:43:46,078
bit more of earliness from airports the

915
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:49,318
chemotype the best very chemo type of

916
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:51,780
the cannotonic was stabilized and this

917
00:43:49,318 --> 00:43:54,139
is the work within the the other seal

918
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:54,140
companies

919
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,880
brilliant brilliant story they are

920
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:04,019
taking us through the whole creation

921
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:06,420
process that was fantastic so take me

922
00:44:04,019 --> 00:44:10,039
back to when you were younger what was

923
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:15,059
your first experience with cannabis

924
00:44:10,039 --> 00:44:18,358
yeah it was like a classy storyline

925
00:44:15,059 --> 00:44:22,318
uh any any person could have I started

926
00:44:18,358 --> 00:44:23,460
smoking in at the school around 14 years

927
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:27,420
old

928
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:31,500
and yeah my history is my story is quite

929
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:35,039
normal because nothing but it

930
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:38,159
illustrates quite well how is the

931
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:41,400
the how we grew up the Cannabis scene

932
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:42,539
and the Cannabis industry in the last 25

933
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,838
years

934
00:44:42,539 --> 00:44:46,559
because it was quite on hand my

935
00:44:45,838 --> 00:44:50,639
um

936
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:53,699
so here in Spain in the mid 90s we are

937
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:56,039
very close to Morocco okay uh the south

938
00:44:53,699 --> 00:44:59,759
of Spanish just a few kilometers from

939
00:44:56,039 --> 00:45:02,699
north of Morocco and the plantations of

940
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:05,700
Moroccan of Morocco is also in the north

941
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:08,879
not exactly down to Spain but but it's

942
00:45:05,699 --> 00:45:12,719
very very close to Morocco and Morocco

943
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:15,180
has been since the 80s like the the

944
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:19,199
biggest fast producer in the world

945
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:21,139
so the the Cannabis culture in Spain has

946
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:25,139
been

947
00:45:21,139 --> 00:45:28,379
until this new century has been always

948
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:32,039
been harsh Moroccan has always always

949
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:34,260
always always okay so you get a big of

950
00:45:32,039 --> 00:45:36,900
the picture because here the the house

951
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:39,380
we we had all kind of quality of

952
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:44,818
Moroccan has very cheap

953
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:48,780
uh very easy to access and so

954
00:45:44,818 --> 00:45:52,199
yes for us is it was the the Cannabis

955
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:54,599
culture in in Spain the the Moroccan has

956
00:45:52,199 --> 00:45:57,838
so yes I started smoking Moroccan has

957
00:45:54,599 --> 00:46:00,000
like in most Spanish did in in the 90s

958
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:02,699
or before

959
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:07,159
um yeah I love the

960
00:46:02,699 --> 00:46:10,379
the the creative effect the relaxing

961
00:46:07,159 --> 00:46:14,039
and many many friends love it also the

962
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:16,980
Cannabis is is called as the the great

963
00:46:14,039 --> 00:46:20,460
times and memories great memories I have

964
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:22,619
from the child who I'm as a teenager

965
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:23,539
around cannabis and with my close

966
00:46:22,619 --> 00:46:27,539
friends

967
00:46:23,539 --> 00:46:29,219
is is countless so it's really a part of

968
00:46:27,539 --> 00:46:33,440
of our life

969
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:36,679
uh we we grow up with it daily daily

970
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:39,659
and many of my close friends are really

971
00:46:36,679 --> 00:46:43,379
passionate kind of his lovers so it's

972
00:46:39,659 --> 00:46:46,019
it's really in our culture you know here

973
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:49,079
and here in Spain has been always quite

974
00:46:46,019 --> 00:46:53,400
quite tolerate to smoke cannabis

975
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:54,960
so yes yeah the the Cannabis culture in

976
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:58,139
Spain regarding

977
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:00,179
regarding cannabis and specifically has

978
00:46:58,139 --> 00:47:07,039
is very very strong

979
00:47:00,179 --> 00:47:11,399
then uh yeah during my job and teenagers

980
00:47:07,039 --> 00:47:14,099
what was available was mainly has

981
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:17,160
I had a good luck to experience

982
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:20,818
in the good time of of Moroccan has all

983
00:47:17,159 --> 00:47:22,940
kinds all the good quality of hash

984
00:47:20,818 --> 00:47:26,699
and around

985
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:28,920
96 97 here in Spain they start to appear

986
00:47:26,699 --> 00:47:32,578
the Cannabis magazines and the first

987
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:35,818
Grow shops and this what this was really

988
00:47:32,579 --> 00:47:40,220
the the revolution for the Homegrown

989
00:47:35,818 --> 00:47:40,219
okay because previously

990
00:47:40,739 --> 00:47:45,000
on these are

991
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:47,579
didn't know how to grow the plants they

992
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,800
didn't know anything about genetics the

993
00:47:47,579 --> 00:47:53,339
the house was so cheap and so easy to

994
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:57,318
access the people just by has and smoke

995
00:47:53,338 --> 00:48:01,980
has cannabis in that form so very people

996
00:47:57,318 --> 00:48:03,960
agree and they grow very badly they

997
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:07,260
don't know what went to harvest they

998
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:09,780
don't know what it was a female or a

999
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:12,960
male it was not of me so but there was

1000
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:15,599
not uh good books there was not internet

1001
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:19,260
there were no good genetics

1002
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:22,680
so yeah the people also strictly has a

1003
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:24,839
few a few hippies maybe travel to India

1004
00:48:22,679 --> 00:48:26,879
and Nepal to buy some clothes or bring

1005
00:48:24,838 --> 00:48:30,059
here and they go some marijuana there

1006
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:31,619
brought the seeds grow here or some

1007
00:48:30,059 --> 00:48:33,119
people here in Spain we have a lot of

1008
00:48:31,619 --> 00:48:36,599
contacts with the Latin American

1009
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:38,818
countries and Mexico Colombia

1010
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:40,980
Etc so to to get [ __ ] from Mexico

1011
00:48:38,818 --> 00:48:44,900
Colombia it was quite common that's it

1012
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:47,099
from Morocco also so some hippies Grill

1013
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:49,619
some genetics that were from

1014
00:48:47,099 --> 00:48:51,599
displacement mainly Mexican Colombia and

1015
00:48:49,619 --> 00:48:53,460
a bit of Moroccan and also some Indian

1016
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:57,000
Nepal mainly

1017
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:59,760
they were sativas it was what and this

1018
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:03,838
genetics they were grown very badly they

1019
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:05,940
were reproduced with no criteria but

1020
00:49:03,838 --> 00:49:09,358
they had very funny effects they were

1021
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:12,119
because they were satibas and they have

1022
00:49:09,358 --> 00:49:15,059
many very funny effects but with with

1023
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:17,338
around 96.98 with the introduction of

1024
00:49:15,059 --> 00:49:20,400
this the magazines like kanyama which is

1025
00:49:17,338 --> 00:49:22,980
shrimp in English and and the first grow

1026
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:25,500
so that they were selling well all the

1027
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:28,199
cities the Lambs the fertilizer the

1028
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:29,940
books with with information about how to

1029
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:33,239
grow cannabis from books from the United

1030
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:36,659
States then and people start to travel

1031
00:49:33,239 --> 00:49:39,838
to Holland to get seats and and all this

1032
00:49:36,659 --> 00:49:42,239
so the pictures started to change the

1033
00:49:39,838 --> 00:49:43,920
the has continued to be the main thing

1034
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:47,578
but

1035
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:50,760
I I remember in my case I started to

1036
00:49:47,579 --> 00:49:52,640
grow my first seeds that I grew were

1037
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:56,940
Nepalese

1038
00:49:52,639 --> 00:50:01,199
Mexican Colombia and Moroccan yeah

1039
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:04,079
um and and so that's That's genetics the

1040
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:09,239
the first the genetics I grew was in the

1041
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:10,920
96 and was in Hawaiian skunk

1042
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:14,098
um when I harvest my friends were

1043
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:17,780
tripping they had never seen we we with

1044
00:50:14,099 --> 00:50:21,059
such quality completely organic

1045
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:22,940
we could Harvest like half kilo when you

1046
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:26,460
are 16 years old this is so much money

1047
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:29,099
and instead of buying and crafts with

1048
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:31,199
your parents money and all this then we

1049
00:50:29,099 --> 00:50:33,059
say well we may need to start to to grow

1050
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:35,059
but obviously with 16 years I was

1051
00:50:33,059 --> 00:50:37,858
dealing with with my parents my parents

1052
00:50:35,059 --> 00:50:40,500
didn't tolerate but I was so passionate

1053
00:50:37,858 --> 00:50:42,239
that they always allowed me to to put

1054
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:45,139
some plants at home

1055
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:48,299
with many many

1056
00:50:45,139 --> 00:50:50,539
discussions but yes I always had plans

1057
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:54,240
at home always always had plans at home

1058
00:50:50,539 --> 00:50:57,300
then when I go to the university I go to

1059
00:50:54,239 --> 00:50:57,959
live alone with my friends

1060
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:02,940
um

1061
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:07,679
then I already have a few goals on on my

1062
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:10,500
shoulders we grew in 1997 we grow like

1063
00:51:07,679 --> 00:51:15,118
many good lots of strains at that time

1064
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:17,760
96 97 the the Dutch bank where at the

1065
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:20,338
end of the the best time the Golden Era

1066
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:23,040
of the Dutch breathing that it ended up

1067
00:51:20,338 --> 00:51:24,259
on around 96 97 when the Dutch

1068
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:27,058
government

1069
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:30,300
stopped the the seed banks they no

1070
00:51:27,059 --> 00:51:34,920
longer can build legally

1071
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:36,720
so after 1997 The Shield guns they still

1072
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:40,559
have a lot of good sales because they

1073
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:43,858
produce before it was illegal and this

1074
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:47,099
last until the new century a few years

1075
00:51:43,858 --> 00:51:49,259
later maybe 2005 so during this year we

1076
00:51:47,099 --> 00:51:52,140
got very very nice and it is the very

1077
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:54,780
best genetics from Holland and at the

1078
00:51:52,139 --> 00:51:57,838
same time we we agree with the land

1079
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:59,460
races we we were collecting so it was

1080
00:51:57,838 --> 00:52:02,940
very interesting because in the early

1081
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:04,159
days me and my friends managed to to

1082
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:06,059
realize

1083
00:52:04,159 --> 00:52:08,039
the

1084
00:52:06,059 --> 00:52:10,440
and we have very good climate here we

1085
00:52:08,039 --> 00:52:14,400
can grow almost all kinds of tropical

1086
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:17,940
sativas and all kind of touch strain so

1087
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:20,460
we we have the chance to compare the

1088
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:24,059
super refined hybrid from the Census

1089
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:28,500
seeds done by Nebel that put a lot of

1090
00:52:24,059 --> 00:52:30,660
work and a lot of a good job on them and

1091
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:33,659
then go compare them with the land races

1092
00:52:30,659 --> 00:52:37,679
and then you see something so refined so

1093
00:52:33,659 --> 00:52:42,299
tame the the genetics and uses the the

1094
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:46,259
land Race So raw but with some very

1095
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:48,680
unique traits characteristics you know

1096
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:52,920
so so

1097
00:52:48,679 --> 00:52:54,899
we how to say we appreciate but we've

1098
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:57,960
seen since the start we we appreciated

1099
00:52:54,900 --> 00:53:01,440
both the super refined hybrid from

1100
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:04,500
Holland and the unique qualities that we

1101
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:07,019
will start to find in the land races and

1102
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:09,358
this is how how big how we started and I

1103
00:53:07,019 --> 00:53:12,719
say and I asked to myself

1104
00:53:09,358 --> 00:53:15,420
I I will be able to to bring some things

1105
00:53:12,719 --> 00:53:17,338
as good as the data strange starting

1106
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:20,519
from Land races

1107
00:53:17,338 --> 00:53:22,380
and that was a question that that arises

1108
00:53:20,519 --> 00:53:25,500
the early moment and

1109
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:27,660
and I said well if others did I'm sure

1110
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:28,858
uh I I will be able to to do it because

1111
00:53:27,659 --> 00:53:31,318
at the end

1112
00:53:28,858 --> 00:53:32,880
all the super strainers we have today

1113
00:53:31,318 --> 00:53:36,358
the course

1114
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:38,220
or gym skank they they all came from

1115
00:53:36,358 --> 00:53:41,519
Land races obviously they have been

1116
00:53:38,219 --> 00:53:45,179
refined for so many generations that

1117
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:47,519
they they are now very distant from the

1118
00:53:45,179 --> 00:53:49,159
land races but everything started from

1119
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:54,239
the land races

1120
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:57,179
so please give me uh another time the

1121
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:59,459
internet was not not sure why you spread

1122
00:53:57,179 --> 00:54:02,039
so it was not yet so easy to get

1123
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:05,519
information about land races

1124
00:54:02,039 --> 00:54:07,019
uh so I was testing both into know the

1125
00:54:05,519 --> 00:54:10,199
very very best at that time was in

1126
00:54:07,019 --> 00:54:11,280
Holland because in the mid 90s in

1127
00:54:10,199 --> 00:54:14,039
California they were starting to

1128
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:17,540
legalize but Holland was still the main

1129
00:54:14,039 --> 00:54:17,539
half for genetics

1130
00:54:17,579 --> 00:54:22,740
um

1131
00:54:18,539 --> 00:54:26,519
and just like and try to bring learn how

1132
00:54:22,739 --> 00:54:28,318
to bring and try to to to come out or

1133
00:54:26,519 --> 00:54:30,179
breathe something really different and

1134
00:54:28,318 --> 00:54:32,338
unique from Land races that I could call

1135
00:54:30,179 --> 00:54:34,739
my work

1136
00:54:32,338 --> 00:54:37,799
and that hopefully as good as the best

1137
00:54:34,739 --> 00:54:40,799
status train on American strength

1138
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:42,780
that was my my expectation when I

1139
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:45,059
started but but more with the the

1140
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:47,160
willing to learn not to achieve you know

1141
00:54:45,059 --> 00:54:49,920
that time was more like a hobby more

1142
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:52,639
like a passion there was not any

1143
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:55,440
business involved not even

1144
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:58,400
a expectation to have a business about

1145
00:54:55,440 --> 00:55:01,920
it it was just patient yeah

1146
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:05,099
fantastic you know an admirable goal to

1147
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:07,500
be trying to improve on sort of those

1148
00:55:05,099 --> 00:55:10,800
early strains that really paved the way

1149
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:14,159
for the future I guess I was wondering

1150
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:16,619
was this sort of the moment when you

1151
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:19,679
thought I would like to start Ace seeds

1152
00:55:16,619 --> 00:55:21,119
and what was it like when you first

1153
00:55:19,679 --> 00:55:24,118
started what were some of the first

1154
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:27,720
projects you were working on

1155
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:29,700
when I went to to continue connecting

1156
00:55:27,719 --> 00:55:31,379
with the previous question when I went

1157
00:55:29,699 --> 00:55:32,939
to study at the University

1158
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:37,140
uh

1159
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:41,338
uh there was it was not a big city

1160
00:55:37,139 --> 00:55:44,098
and the mangrove shop uh the the owner

1161
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:46,619
hired me to to attend the Growers to to

1162
00:55:44,099 --> 00:55:48,838
we go working on on the grow shop

1163
00:55:46,619 --> 00:55:51,119
attending the Growers at that time the

1164
00:55:48,838 --> 00:55:53,039
the this was the

1165
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:56,039
the biggest growth shop in the whole

1166
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:58,139
Province so all the Growers not only

1167
00:55:56,039 --> 00:56:01,558
from the city but from the province came

1168
00:55:58,139 --> 00:56:04,799
to the grow shop to ask about seeds

1169
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:07,800
about genetics about growing so for me

1170
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:10,619
was like I learned a lot I learned a lot

1171
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:12,059
because yeah now there are many growth

1172
00:56:10,619 --> 00:56:14,818
shops around

1173
00:56:12,059 --> 00:56:16,200
um and it is no longer the same but at

1174
00:56:14,818 --> 00:56:19,318
that time all the Growers from The

1175
00:56:16,199 --> 00:56:23,000
Province came to me so and I sell to

1176
00:56:19,318 --> 00:56:25,199
them all the genetics and and they grow

1177
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:28,440
graduate and came back to me with

1178
00:56:25,199 --> 00:56:30,659
flowers with clones so

1179
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:33,960
I managed to

1180
00:56:30,659 --> 00:56:36,779
to get the incredible clones the best

1181
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:41,760
clones the from the refinance Trend like

1182
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:44,000
the best the best skunks the best AK-47

1183
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:47,359
Kali Mist

1184
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:51,119
from magogenetes the Warlock

1185
00:56:47,358 --> 00:56:54,659
from homegrown genetics the everything

1186
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:57,300
we got everything the the very best and

1187
00:56:54,659 --> 00:57:00,960
I learned a lot because all the Growers

1188
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:03,300
came to me I had to to explain I learned

1189
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:06,358
a lot because at that time the

1190
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:08,400
information in 2000 was

1191
00:57:06,358 --> 00:57:11,639
very very short

1192
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:14,880
so after working there for a few years I

1193
00:57:11,639 --> 00:57:18,358
I learned a lot and and I get a lot of

1194
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:20,039
genetics I get a lot of contacts and it

1195
00:57:18,358 --> 00:57:24,358
was also the time that the internet

1196
00:57:20,039 --> 00:57:28,440
started okay I really uh and so and

1197
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:30,719
there were some iconic uh old forums at

1198
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:34,338
that time that were overgrow was the

1199
00:57:30,719 --> 00:57:34,338
main one and cannabis world

1200
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:41,099
that very early times of the of this in

1201
00:57:37,739 --> 00:57:43,799
21st century the the worldwide cannabis

1202
00:57:41,099 --> 00:57:46,680
community that that was on internet we

1203
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:48,539
we were posting and we were connecting

1204
00:57:46,679 --> 00:57:50,460
in mainly and overgrower and also in

1205
00:57:48,539 --> 00:57:52,318
cannabis world so it was a very

1206
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:53,639
beautiful moment because it was the

1207
00:57:52,318 --> 00:57:57,000
start of Internet

1208
00:57:53,639 --> 00:57:58,618
in in managed to connect many Growers

1209
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,559
from all around the world that

1210
00:57:58,619 --> 00:58:05,180
previously were all isolated one in in

1211
00:58:01,559 --> 00:58:08,640
North California and others in in Europe

1212
00:58:05,179 --> 00:58:13,739
others in in Latin America

1213
00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:15,900
Etc and and what that was like like a

1214
00:58:13,739 --> 00:58:18,659
wealth of information

1215
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:20,639
it was incredible exchanging genetics

1216
00:58:18,659 --> 00:58:23,460
people from

1217
00:58:20,639 --> 00:58:26,039
from countries where the land races were

1218
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:29,300
produced also started to connect to

1219
00:58:26,039 --> 00:58:32,338
these forums and we started to to to

1220
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:35,460
exchange language genetics

1221
00:58:32,338 --> 00:58:38,818
and I'm from Spain there were not many

1222
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:39,960
people interested in land races the only

1223
00:58:38,818 --> 00:58:44,519
a few

1224
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:48,059
and it was mainly me Alex manonegro it

1225
00:58:44,519 --> 00:58:52,920
was a breeder from Canary Islands

1226
00:58:48,059 --> 00:58:56,700
in Spain and then kaiki Charlie Garcia I

1227
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:59,700
I know him skyke from canabioghen

1228
00:58:56,699 --> 00:59:01,199
okay and then we all three met on the

1229
00:58:59,699 --> 00:59:02,519
forums

1230
00:59:01,199 --> 00:59:06,838
and

1231
00:59:02,519 --> 00:59:09,480
and we we really have the same

1232
00:59:06,838 --> 00:59:13,099
the same passion for the land reasons

1233
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:15,659
so we we were talking a few years

1234
00:59:13,099 --> 00:59:18,740
exchanging seats

1235
00:59:15,659 --> 00:59:21,239
maybe was around 2002 then Alex

1236
00:59:18,739 --> 00:59:24,419
manonegra came to live to my city from

1237
00:59:21,239 --> 00:59:25,798
Canary Island with his girlfriend his

1238
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:29,099
damn girlfriend

1239
00:59:25,798 --> 00:59:31,858
then I meet him in person kaiki was from

1240
00:59:29,099 --> 00:59:35,579
Madrid he had his company already there

1241
00:59:31,858 --> 00:59:39,420
Canada which was the first Spanish seed

1242
00:59:35,579 --> 00:59:41,960
bank the first Spanish cement that was

1243
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:41,960
established

1244
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:47,940
um and we all meet in person

1245
00:59:44,639 --> 00:59:49,920
and and then the the first years were

1246
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:52,920
very very nice

1247
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:54,440
we will have the same passion we have

1248
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:58,318
different characters

1249
00:59:54,440 --> 01:00:01,440
uh kaiki and Alex were one generation

1250
00:59:58,318 --> 01:00:03,960
older than me there were around 50 plus

1251
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:07,679
around that time I was just in my 20

1252
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:11,039
plus I I was very young so they could be

1253
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:12,960
always I was almost like my parents you

1254
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:14,338
know

1255
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:16,559
um I learned a lot from them because

1256
01:00:14,338 --> 01:00:19,019
obviously they have much more experience

1257
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:22,500
with me in life and with plants

1258
01:00:19,019 --> 01:00:25,199
it was very enriching experience both

1259
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:27,659
regarding cannabis and

1260
01:00:25,199 --> 01:00:30,000
friendship

1261
01:00:27,659 --> 01:00:33,779
and then we start to get in touch more

1262
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:35,519
in person like in 2002 and then we start

1263
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:38,460
to work the idea

1264
01:00:35,519 --> 01:00:40,380
to to make here in Spain like acid Bank

1265
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:41,699
working more with land race with land

1266
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:44,039
races

1267
01:00:41,699 --> 01:00:46,679
because it was our main interest not

1268
01:00:44,039 --> 01:00:49,259
many people were were doing it here the

1269
01:00:46,679 --> 01:00:52,798
the sea band that were appearing were

1270
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:55,559
just interested in replicate the the

1271
01:00:52,798 --> 01:00:58,679
business model of the Dutch company and

1272
01:00:55,559 --> 01:01:02,400
to copy their genetics saying okay why

1273
01:00:58,679 --> 01:01:06,419
we know black domino are the best seller

1274
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:09,599
in in Holland then we take lunch from

1275
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:11,639
from from there we feminize and we make

1276
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:16,619
a c bank in Spain that's how many

1277
01:01:11,639 --> 01:01:18,838
Spanish came out street series Dina fam

1278
01:01:16,619 --> 01:01:22,099
Etc okay but we wanted to make something

1279
01:01:18,838 --> 01:01:25,558
different like yeah like the the

1280
01:01:22,099 --> 01:01:28,200
planche from Holland were amazing but we

1281
01:01:25,559 --> 01:01:30,720
wanted to do something different and

1282
01:01:28,199 --> 01:01:34,259
from the scratch from the land races to

1283
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:36,118
understand with different traits we to

1284
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:38,460
to came up with something different and

1285
01:01:36,119 --> 01:01:42,079
learn through the process and

1286
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:45,298
and yes and around 2005

1287
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:48,619
the the idea of creating a seat was

1288
01:01:45,298 --> 01:01:50,179
already more mature we already have

1289
01:01:48,619 --> 01:01:53,940
collaborators

1290
01:01:50,179 --> 01:01:56,219
kaiki have a few friends collaborating

1291
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:59,280
for him I had my friends

1292
01:01:56,219 --> 01:02:03,078
I had my other friends in in the

1293
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:07,260
University I study I like his friends

1294
01:02:03,079 --> 01:02:10,740
but the the core of faces these early

1295
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:15,359
stage was Alex Mano Negra kaiki from

1296
01:02:10,739 --> 01:02:17,639
Canada and me okay that was the the

1297
01:02:15,358 --> 01:02:20,159
pillars the three

1298
01:02:17,639 --> 01:02:23,578
foundational person

1299
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:25,679
that created acids and then we came up

1300
01:02:23,579 --> 01:02:28,559
with with our first catalog

1301
01:02:25,679 --> 01:02:33,298
in 2005.

1302
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:36,000
if we if one we can talk about it

1303
01:02:33,298 --> 01:02:39,900
yeah yeah I mean what were some of the

1304
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:42,119
first projects that you were looking to

1305
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:44,700
release as a company

1306
01:02:42,119 --> 01:02:47,838
we were really a few years in touch so

1307
01:02:44,699 --> 01:02:50,759
we have some hybrids already in progress

1308
01:02:47,838 --> 01:02:52,818
so when we came up with the the first

1309
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:54,359
catalog into

1310
01:02:52,818 --> 01:02:55,798
2005

1311
01:02:54,358 --> 01:02:58,980
a

1312
01:02:55,798 --> 01:03:03,298
there were five strings okay all in

1313
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:03,298
regular seats at that time the

1314
01:03:03,719 --> 01:03:10,439
we didn't offer feminine seats yet

1315
01:03:07,318 --> 01:03:13,440
the the strange where the first six are

1316
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:15,960
quite famous and are still available it

1317
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:20,099
could be considered acids classes they

1318
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:23,338
are Banky Hayes Congo Nepal Jam Orion

1319
01:03:20,099 --> 01:03:23,338
Express Panama

1320
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:28,039
and then for more that were only

1321
01:03:26,639 --> 01:03:30,900
available

1322
01:03:28,039 --> 01:03:34,858
a very short supply in this first

1323
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:37,220
catalog they were Renata which was a

1324
01:03:34,858 --> 01:03:40,519
Brazilian Cambodia case

1325
01:03:37,219 --> 01:03:43,679
hybrid then garage

1326
01:03:40,519 --> 01:03:45,480
which was a Nepalese Commando cross

1327
01:03:43,679 --> 01:03:48,298
lesoto

1328
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:53,159
timan Firehouse this was from Alex

1329
01:03:48,298 --> 01:03:56,818
manonegra which was uh Cape Verde Mali

1330
01:03:53,159 --> 01:03:59,578
Nepalese sativa and Canela which was

1331
01:03:56,818 --> 01:04:01,318
from kaiki it was a northern Indian

1332
01:03:59,579 --> 01:04:04,980
cross Jamaica

1333
01:04:01,318 --> 01:04:07,079
and this was a first tennis streams the

1334
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:11,338
the first six

1335
01:04:07,079 --> 01:04:14,420
uh have been available for for for the

1336
01:04:11,338 --> 01:04:14,420
last 16 years

1337
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:23,579
our audience are more familiarized with

1338
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:27,180
these ones

1339
01:04:23,579 --> 01:04:29,400
yes most certainly I think almost every

1340
01:04:27,179 --> 01:04:31,259
strain you just mentioned rings a bell

1341
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:33,720
and I hope we can talk about them a

1342
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:34,799
little more I just wanted to quickly ask

1343
01:04:33,719 --> 01:04:37,500
you

1344
01:04:34,798 --> 01:04:40,679
a lot of people were saying that uh

1345
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:43,139
Charlie Garcia from Canada used to work

1346
01:04:40,679 --> 01:04:45,179
with you at Ace and I was wondering what

1347
01:04:43,139 --> 01:04:47,460
sort of projects did you do together was

1348
01:04:45,179 --> 01:04:49,558
that the first release and

1349
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:51,599
um how come you guys decided to sort of

1350
01:04:49,559 --> 01:04:54,960
end that collaboration

1351
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:58,079
it was more of what each person could

1352
01:04:54,960 --> 01:05:00,420
could offer to the project you know a

1353
01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:03,480
Alex Mano Negra um

1354
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:06,960
a had a lot of experience with a African

1355
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:11,280
sativas he lived in Canary Islands which

1356
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:14,539
is is it belongs to Spain but is an

1357
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:18,780
island that are quite far from Spain

1358
01:05:14,539 --> 01:05:21,358
very close to the African continent is

1359
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:24,440
closer to Senegal than than to spend to

1360
01:05:21,358 --> 01:05:24,440
say it in that way

1361
01:05:28,699 --> 01:05:34,919
tropical is is like Hawaii for example

1362
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:37,858
so you can grow excellent

1363
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:40,920
sativas there the soil is volcanic the

1364
01:05:37,858 --> 01:05:43,858
radiation is strong the the temperatures

1365
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:46,559
are warm the whole year there's still a

1366
01:05:43,858 --> 01:05:50,519
bit of photo period

1367
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:51,740
so it's even better than than Thailand

1368
01:05:50,519 --> 01:05:54,659
or

1369
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:56,219
or or Congo that there's no photo period

1370
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:59,460
at all it's the whole year exactly the

1371
01:05:56,219 --> 01:06:03,179
same uh so he had a lot of experience

1372
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:05,519
with with African land races sativas he

1373
01:06:03,179 --> 01:06:09,440
grew I don't know one of his most famous

1374
01:06:05,519 --> 01:06:14,099
words the angerless angerless red liamba

1375
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:16,679
he also agrees from Senegal from Mali

1376
01:06:14,099 --> 01:06:19,680
from Cape Verde

1377
01:06:16,679 --> 01:06:19,679
Congolese

1378
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:25,559
Mozambique

1379
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:28,619
he was the African expert

1380
01:06:25,559 --> 01:06:30,960
and and kaiki he was one of the

1381
01:06:28,619 --> 01:06:33,420
foreigners Charlie Garcia is the person

1382
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:36,059
that you you recommend he was one of the

1383
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:38,338
founders of carnaviohen

1384
01:06:36,059 --> 01:06:41,160
and kind of your hand with when they

1385
01:06:38,338 --> 01:06:43,858
came out they already have like a few a

1386
01:06:41,159 --> 01:06:45,538
few strings that were very very very

1387
01:06:43,858 --> 01:06:48,960
good so

1388
01:06:45,539 --> 01:06:51,480
kaiki it was not new on the game to to

1389
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:54,780
say in some way he has his parents he

1390
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:56,760
already had lines there he has all the

1391
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:59,760
with Canary handle really really strange

1392
01:06:56,760 --> 01:07:01,579
that were extremely good at that point

1393
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:05,099
so

1394
01:07:01,579 --> 01:07:07,160
each of us contribute with what what we

1395
01:07:05,099 --> 01:07:10,019
had at that time was when I was starting

1396
01:07:07,159 --> 01:07:11,038
I was working with the Nepalese and the

1397
01:07:10,019 --> 01:07:13,139
Chinese

1398
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:15,140
and the Vietnam Black so my

1399
01:07:13,139 --> 01:07:18,719
contributions were in the first catalog

1400
01:07:15,139 --> 01:07:19,920
were a Orient Express which is my first

1401
01:07:18,719 --> 01:07:23,279
hybrid

1402
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:25,920
is Vietnam Black Cross China unan

1403
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:29,119
and also to the Galleria hybrid

1404
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:33,059
which is a

1405
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:36,740
Nepalese Commando The Nepalese with the

1406
01:07:33,059 --> 01:07:36,740
Lesotho from Canada

1407
01:07:37,159 --> 01:07:44,219
is also a hybrid that I did with a

1408
01:07:40,858 --> 01:07:46,858
Brazilian by a sativa

1409
01:07:44,219 --> 01:07:48,358
pollinated with Cambodia Hayes from

1410
01:07:46,858 --> 01:07:50,639
brieferman

1411
01:07:48,358 --> 01:07:53,578
and the other restraints

1412
01:07:50,639 --> 01:07:56,519
for example the Banky case was a

1413
01:07:53,579 --> 01:08:01,519
Congolese hybrid that came out from Alex

1414
01:07:56,519 --> 01:08:05,298
Mano Negra it was a a very

1415
01:08:01,519 --> 01:08:05,298
very energetic

1416
01:08:06,059 --> 01:08:12,059
sativa hybrid with congoles genetics

1417
01:08:09,659 --> 01:08:13,798
but the problem is it was still a long

1418
01:08:12,059 --> 01:08:16,980
longer flowering

1419
01:08:13,798 --> 01:08:20,819
and the effect the effect was great but

1420
01:08:16,979 --> 01:08:23,519
it wasn't fertile okay and as time is it

1421
01:08:20,819 --> 01:08:26,219
was a colleague of of Charlie Garcia of

1422
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:29,600
kaiki like a lot this clone from Mano

1423
01:08:26,219 --> 01:08:29,600
Negra and agree with

1424
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:39,060
they told me was a an Annapolis

1425
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:42,838
I managed to get some seeds and and with

1426
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:45,120
this they managed to stay used to

1427
01:08:42,838 --> 01:08:47,698
breathe in in Galicia which is the north

1428
01:08:45,119 --> 01:08:51,358
of Spain is a very rainy part it's

1429
01:08:47,698 --> 01:08:54,479
colder the weather is not very good so

1430
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:58,500
he managed to adapt this or original

1431
01:08:54,479 --> 01:09:01,439
long flowering Congolese hybrid to his

1432
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:03,479
colder climate Okay in a fast flower in

1433
01:09:01,439 --> 01:09:06,599
sativa he also adapted to indoor growing

1434
01:09:03,479 --> 01:09:08,579
it making it smaller faster flowing 19

1435
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:10,380
weeks

1436
01:09:08,579 --> 01:09:13,198
um but still capturing the hydration

1437
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:16,980
production and a very electric effect of

1438
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:19,099
the Congolese hybrid from Mano Negra and

1439
01:09:16,979 --> 01:09:22,259
he establized it

1440
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:23,819
uh chainsaw big the conf the concept of

1441
01:09:22,259 --> 01:09:26,819
the plan agreed

1442
01:09:23,819 --> 01:09:29,400
the faster flooring more cold resistant

1443
01:09:26,819 --> 01:09:32,819
better adapt to indoor growing after

1444
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:35,579
showing after free for generation

1445
01:09:32,819 --> 01:09:38,039
it came up with Banky case that's the

1446
01:09:35,579 --> 01:09:40,198
name they give to to the Australia each

1447
01:09:38,039 --> 01:09:42,960
one was free to to name his his

1448
01:09:40,198 --> 01:09:46,379
strengths in the in the way they wanted

1449
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:49,259
so yes but you guys started from

1450
01:09:46,380 --> 01:09:52,199
Congolese hybrid from Mano Negra then it

1451
01:09:49,259 --> 01:09:54,899
was worked by a style a friend

1452
01:09:52,198 --> 01:09:56,579
of of kaiki

1453
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:58,500
and

1454
01:09:56,579 --> 01:10:02,039
in

1455
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:07,198
years later he was working by by Charlie

1456
01:10:02,039 --> 01:10:10,560
Garcia and since 2012 until now I wore

1457
01:10:07,198 --> 01:10:13,859
the line myself so yes the history of

1458
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:16,140
the line if I tell you is a bit long and

1459
01:10:13,859 --> 01:10:19,259
we have contributed

1460
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:22,980
each in different stages on a different

1461
01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:24,719
moments yes then we have the the Congo

1462
01:10:22,979 --> 01:10:26,839
the Congo was

1463
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:31,560
uh uh

1464
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:33,539
Charlie Garcia had a Congolese sativa

1465
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:36,659
not from Mano Negra from another person

1466
01:10:33,539 --> 01:10:40,319
uh he crosses with the the chitrala and

1467
01:10:36,658 --> 01:10:43,679
Canada he made a Congolese Pakistani

1468
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:45,719
traveler hybrid he worked and he left to

1469
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:49,859
a free generation

1470
01:10:45,719 --> 01:10:53,399
and then to this Congolese

1471
01:10:49,859 --> 01:10:57,139
[ __ ] F2 F3 hybrid I cannot remember it

1472
01:10:53,399 --> 01:10:57,139
was the 3D spot

1473
01:10:59,779 --> 01:11:02,779
reduce

1474
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:08,640
which is Congo

1475
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:10,619
it's a Congolese that is that has a

1476
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:15,179
shorter flower in time okay

1477
01:11:10,619 --> 01:11:19,260
and um so Congo was originally a

1478
01:11:15,179 --> 01:11:23,640
a hybrid that was 75 congoles

1479
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:27,239
and 25 percent Pakistani

1480
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:29,340
and and yes it was work mainly with

1481
01:11:27,238 --> 01:11:31,139
genetics from Charlie Garcia and a bit

1482
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:33,179
from Mano Negra

1483
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:36,239
okay

1484
01:11:33,179 --> 01:11:38,760
um yes it was very very very nice it was

1485
01:11:36,238 --> 01:11:43,039
not so electric like the

1486
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:47,840
like the banking case it had a more warm

1487
01:11:43,039 --> 01:11:47,840
foreign effect with a bit more of body

1488
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:57,060
for both Australians were mainly Congo

1489
01:11:54,960 --> 01:12:00,380
is a strain but both are quite different

1490
01:11:57,060 --> 01:12:04,380
to each other okay

1491
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:07,079
and um yeah uh later I never understand

1492
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:08,219
why my colleagues wanted to name bangi

1493
01:12:07,079 --> 01:12:11,760
Hayes

1494
01:12:08,219 --> 01:12:14,939
like haste when the magical was not

1495
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:18,659
infancy or didn't contain his at all

1496
01:12:14,939 --> 01:12:21,119
or why they wanted to call Congo I know

1497
01:12:18,658 --> 01:12:23,698
to Congo Pakistan when the hybrid was

1498
01:12:21,119 --> 01:12:27,000
originally a Congo Pakistan highway but

1499
01:12:23,698 --> 01:12:30,059
I was just a job man it was not my

1500
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:34,380
strengths and everyone can name their

1501
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:36,659
sins it's up to them so if they came up

1502
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:38,699
with his name and until today

1503
01:12:36,658 --> 01:12:40,379
yeah we had some people ask sort of

1504
01:12:38,698 --> 01:12:42,539
about that but that answers a lot of the

1505
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:44,880
questions so that's great I was

1506
01:12:42,539 --> 01:12:48,539
wondering though do you remember much

1507
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:50,400
about what the Nepalese was like in its

1508
01:12:48,539 --> 01:12:52,560
pure form like do you remember how it

1509
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:56,399
grew and what it smelled like or not

1510
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:59,880
really the the stabilization of Bankers

1511
01:12:56,399 --> 01:13:02,039
was all done by a style the colleague of

1512
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:04,440
of Charlie Garcia told you

1513
01:13:02,039 --> 01:13:07,079
what happened there

1514
01:13:04,439 --> 01:13:08,460
Cornelia I asked a few times

1515
01:13:07,079 --> 01:13:10,260
[Music]

1516
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:13,679
they were not very very very very

1517
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:15,119
concrete you know it was not my strain I

1518
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:16,980
was very young at that time I didn't

1519
01:13:15,119 --> 01:13:19,800
want to be

1520
01:13:16,979 --> 01:13:24,359
but but yeah the strain that came out

1521
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:26,159
was really something different it was

1522
01:13:24,359 --> 01:13:28,380
it was something something really you

1523
01:13:26,158 --> 01:13:31,079
know but yeah to answer the question I

1524
01:13:28,380 --> 01:13:34,500
don't know exactly what Nepalese train

1525
01:13:31,079 --> 01:13:36,658
go into the banks and how it went this

1526
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:38,219
is a detail I escaped to my knowledge

1527
01:13:36,658 --> 01:13:41,039
yeah sorry

1528
01:13:38,219 --> 01:13:42,779
yeah no that's fine that's fine I was

1529
01:13:41,039 --> 01:13:45,119
hoping I could ask you a little bit

1530
01:13:42,779 --> 01:13:48,238
about the different Thai strains you

1531
01:13:45,119 --> 01:13:50,460
work with I had noticed many of them

1532
01:13:48,238 --> 01:13:54,359
looked really nice and I was interested

1533
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:56,219
in how you would say the The Mao Thai is

1534
01:13:54,359 --> 01:13:58,259
a little different to maybe some of the

1535
01:13:56,219 --> 01:14:01,739
others

1536
01:13:58,260 --> 01:14:04,800
yeah the the Thai strengths

1537
01:14:01,738 --> 01:14:08,099
well as you know that that is

1538
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:10,260
for for the sativa lovers is

1539
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:13,920
one of the most important sativa land

1540
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:17,159
race of all times regarding quality so

1541
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:20,520
when we started to investigate and

1542
01:14:17,158 --> 01:14:22,738
looking for high quality peer sativa

1543
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:26,219
land races from tropical origin

1544
01:14:22,738 --> 01:14:30,658
obviously the thighs were the ones that

1545
01:14:26,219 --> 01:14:32,460
interest as the the most in the in in

1546
01:14:30,658 --> 01:14:34,738
the first place

1547
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:36,679
and yes

1548
01:14:34,738 --> 01:14:38,879
at the beginning

1549
01:14:36,679 --> 01:14:41,399
we have like

1550
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:45,600
four to five

1551
01:14:41,399 --> 01:14:48,539
ties I like the Taiko Chang then we have

1552
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:51,120
the Melody from Canada

1553
01:14:48,539 --> 01:14:54,899
that he was the one that was used used

1554
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:56,420
by kind of your hand Destroyer a string

1555
01:14:54,899 --> 01:14:59,158
then

1556
01:14:56,420 --> 01:15:02,399
lately in the last decade has been

1557
01:14:59,158 --> 01:15:04,979
working with uh another from

1558
01:15:02,399 --> 01:15:08,639
from Chennai

1559
01:15:04,979 --> 01:15:10,559
and I used to grow another one that it

1560
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:14,820
was terrible I did in my early days

1561
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:18,060
there was this car very early on and I

1562
01:15:14,819 --> 01:15:19,859
feel that was called I-79 but I think it

1563
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:23,760
was a highway this one came from

1564
01:15:19,859 --> 01:15:25,259
Australian grower called 20 Thai I have

1565
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:27,000
the feeling that was a high will I

1566
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:28,079
thought it was fantastic but not really

1567
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:31,859
pure time

1568
01:15:28,079 --> 01:15:33,719
so here's the the three times the high

1569
01:15:31,859 --> 01:15:35,599
quality ties that we have been working

1570
01:15:33,719 --> 01:15:38,000
with acids

1571
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:40,880
the kochan

1572
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:44,939
the male type from Canada

1573
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:47,039
and and lately more more Detachment you

1574
01:15:44,939 --> 01:15:49,678
can see really a lot of similar

1575
01:15:47,039 --> 01:15:54,019
similarities with between them and if

1576
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:55,619
you compare with other green Vietnamese

1577
01:15:54,020 --> 01:15:58,780
or

1578
01:15:55,619 --> 01:16:00,059
or older Cambodian

1579
01:15:58,779 --> 01:16:04,880
[Music]

1580
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:08,820
is what I call the green

1581
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:14,359
stuff Asian sativa archetype

1582
01:16:08,819 --> 01:16:16,759
okay you can find in in the lowlands of

1583
01:16:14,359 --> 01:16:20,158
Laos Thailand

1584
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:21,320
Vietnam Cambodia

1585
01:16:20,158 --> 01:16:27,238
a

1586
01:16:21,319 --> 01:16:30,299
genotype of greens solar station sativa

1587
01:16:27,238 --> 01:16:33,238
that is spread in in all those in all

1588
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:37,140
these areas of these countries and they

1589
01:16:33,238 --> 01:16:40,799
share a lot of similar traits they are

1590
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:42,360
green even with colder terms they remain

1591
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:45,360
green

1592
01:16:42,359 --> 01:16:47,479
they have a long flowering time usually

1593
01:16:45,359 --> 01:16:52,500
four months or more

1594
01:16:47,479 --> 01:16:56,339
and they have a rich THC chemotype with

1595
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:59,158
zero or with perilita or no CBD

1596
01:16:56,340 --> 01:17:01,260
that the terpene profile is also very

1597
01:16:59,158 --> 01:17:03,359
common in in

1598
01:17:01,260 --> 01:17:06,060
you know the different strains that

1599
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:08,658
belong to to this archetype there are

1600
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:13,739
Woody spicy

1601
01:17:08,658 --> 01:17:16,738
sore lime lemonade okay and the effects

1602
01:17:13,738 --> 01:17:20,218
and they are very cerebral not body

1603
01:17:16,738 --> 01:17:24,479
effects some are more nervous like would

1604
01:17:20,219 --> 01:17:27,420
be the male Thai some are pure joy super

1605
01:17:24,479 --> 01:17:31,559
clean uplifting refreshing

1606
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:34,020
uh good energy goodbye like it was like

1607
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:37,500
the kochang and others are more in the

1608
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:40,320
middle like like the Titan mine

1609
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:43,140
um yeah these are the three that that

1610
01:17:40,319 --> 01:17:45,658
I've been that we have been working more

1611
01:17:43,140 --> 01:17:47,579
we started first

1612
01:17:45,658 --> 01:17:49,920
with the

1613
01:17:47,579 --> 01:17:52,640
the multi

1614
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:52,640
from Canada

1615
01:17:53,698 --> 01:17:59,279
um

1616
01:17:55,579 --> 01:18:02,579
gave us one a clone of a male that he

1617
01:17:59,279 --> 01:18:04,679
had of the pure milk Thai and I am and

1618
01:18:02,579 --> 01:18:08,760
where they have a lot of many crazy

1619
01:18:04,679 --> 01:18:11,219
sativas so in 2008

1620
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:15,300
with the help of a friend of a colleague

1621
01:18:11,219 --> 01:18:18,239
we put the the pure Meal toy mail

1622
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:22,100
to pollinate all of our best sativas the

1623
01:18:18,238 --> 01:18:25,819
green case the Purple Haze the taikochan

1624

Vietnam Black

1628
01:18:33,198 --> 01:18:39,719
uh many interesting sativas and then the

1629
01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:43,500
next the next year we came up with

1630
01:18:39,719 --> 01:18:45,420
many interesting F1 type hybrids as

1631
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:47,939
limited edition that were green high

1632

1638
01:19:07,079 --> 01:19:13,859
they're extremely good uh sativa hybrids

1639
01:19:10,140 --> 01:19:18,060
and around 2015

1640
01:19:13,859 --> 01:19:19,859
I started to to grow some old tights on

1641
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:23,280
my seats I had

1642
01:19:19,859 --> 01:19:25,198
I like it I like it a lot

1643
01:19:23,279 --> 01:19:29,219

1644
01:19:25,198 --> 01:19:32,639
um with Kali China it came probably one

1645
01:19:29,219 --> 01:19:36,420
of it came out taichi which is probably

1646
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:37,920
one of the hybrids I'm film or sprawled

1647
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:42,420
off

1648
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:43,859

1649
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:45,719
it's amazing

1650
01:19:43,859 --> 01:19:47,880
and yeah we would these are the the time

1651
01:19:45,719 --> 01:19:50,640
we have been working lately

1652
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:52,619
and we and also similar plans like the

1653
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:58,320
green Vietnamese

1654
01:19:52,619 --> 01:20:01,140
and yeah if you go to to Northern Laos

1655
01:19:58,319 --> 01:20:04,099
the the strains are different are more

1656
01:20:01,140 --> 01:20:06,960
purple strings the effects are different

1657
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:09,300
uh and if you go to Philippines the

1658
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:10,760
strings are slightly different also if

1659
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:14,279
you go to

1660
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:16,440
Banda chain or Sumatra or the very

1661
01:20:14,279 --> 01:20:18,119
famous I'd say goal is slightly

1662
01:20:16,439 --> 01:20:20,939
different

1663
01:20:18,119 --> 01:20:24,260
yeah so I I believe the the green ties

1664
01:20:20,939 --> 01:20:24,259
the what people

1665
01:20:24,679 --> 01:20:31,460
recognize more or as Thai is belongs to

1666
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:35,100
the green

1667
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:36,359
suggestion archetype I describe

1668
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:39,300
just now

1669
01:20:36,359 --> 01:20:41,698
yeah brilliant again just really did how

1670
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:45,179
it answer thank you so much one of our

1671
01:20:41,698 --> 01:20:47,460
listeners wanted to ask the question

1672
01:20:45,179 --> 01:20:50,520
they're looking for a recommendation

1673
01:20:47,460 --> 01:20:53,460
from you that's either a tie or a Thai

1674
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:56,940
hybrid that's got that really sort of

1675
01:20:53,460 --> 01:20:59,340
archetypal soaring soaring nice tie high

1676
01:20:56,939 --> 01:21:02,099
but something that's a little bit on the

1677
01:20:59,340 --> 01:21:03,360
shorter flowering side if possible what

1678
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:07,320
would you recommend

1679
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:10,799
oh yeah yeah we have a Tai Chi the the

1680
01:21:07,319 --> 01:21:12,139
date is amazing the

1681
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:15,420
um

1682
01:21:12,140 --> 01:21:18,600
how to describe this

1683
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:22,140
it has the the most exotic intense

1684
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:23,960
Aromas from the Cali China is extremely

1685
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:27,719
intense

1686
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:29,420
exotic like liver roasted meat in terms

1687
01:21:27,719 --> 01:21:34,698
hash

1688
01:21:29,420 --> 01:21:38,658
with Violet flowers with tropical fruits

1689
01:21:34,698 --> 01:21:42,238
mangoes a creamy

1690
01:21:38,658 --> 01:21:44,879
sweet and short like a taste of a

1691
01:21:42,238 --> 01:21:47,698
Chinese restaurant is super completely

1692
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:51,500
the terpene profile of a good college

1693
01:21:47,698 --> 01:21:55,859
China and when close with the Titan mine

1694
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:58,500
uh in the Kali China is my my best

1695
01:21:55,859 --> 01:22:01,019
Chinese hybrid it's a Chinese Indica

1696
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:04,640
very fast flowering I added a bit of

1697
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:07,380
Cali Mist to reinforce the the intense

1698
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:08,640
Aromas and a bit more sativa effect on

1699
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:11,940
Kali China

1700
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:14,219
and I find the Cali China with thus

1701
01:22:11,939 --> 01:22:18,599
wonders when grows with with good

1702
01:22:14,219 --> 01:22:22,020
sativas because the Kali China is not so

1703
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:23,820
it has the the very low infants that

1704
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:26,159
many people is looking inside the best

1705
01:22:23,819 --> 01:22:28,920
strength or it faces strange but in an

1706
01:22:26,158 --> 01:22:34,619
Indica strain the high is very positive

1707
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:36,480
not a stone no intoxicating nor narcotic

1708
01:22:34,619 --> 01:22:39,198
like it's like our afghanian strains

1709
01:22:36,479 --> 01:22:42,839
most of the people have tried to to grow

1710
01:22:39,198 --> 01:22:45,960
to to lower down the an Adaptive

1711
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:47,699
genetics with Afghani I think is a

1712
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:51,239
complete failure because the secret

1713
01:22:47,698 --> 01:22:53,158
activity they are completely opposite

1714
01:22:51,238 --> 01:22:56,218
make a complete opposite you can come

1715
01:22:53,158 --> 01:22:59,460
out with a very potent hybrid but it

1716
01:22:56,219 --> 01:23:01,640
will be a a hybrid a hybrid of hybrid

1717
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:01,640
effect

1718
01:23:02,279 --> 01:23:06,300
so the Italian mind for me is my

1719
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,219
um

1720
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:12,119
[Music]

1721
01:23:08,219 --> 01:23:15,960
best success on capturing the the sativa

1722
01:23:12,119 --> 01:23:19,019
qualities in a an enhance

1723
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:21,539
the Exotic the Exotic sativa side with

1724
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:24,360
the intents of the Kali China and the

1725
01:23:21,539 --> 01:23:27,000
positive sativa side and awareness of

1726
01:23:24,359 --> 01:23:29,519
the effect from the Cali China

1727
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:32,399
and with all these qualities making it

1728
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:35,760
easy to to flower indoors and in

1729
01:23:32,399 --> 01:23:37,139
temperate latitudes I think my more

1730
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:38,880
successful is

1731
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:40,739
is

1732
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:44,400
tight tight

1733
01:23:40,738 --> 01:23:46,678
and another that people like a lot is

1734
01:23:44,399 --> 01:23:50,579
Thai cross Panama

1735
01:23:46,679 --> 01:23:53,460
this is also very very nice is the same

1736
01:23:50,579 --> 01:23:55,738
Titan may I use for taichi but it's

1737
01:23:53,460 --> 01:23:59,219
instead of Crossing it with kalichina F4

1738
01:23:55,738 --> 01:24:01,859
I cross it with my Panama goddess Elite

1739
01:23:59,219 --> 01:24:05,579
F10 which isn't

1740
01:24:01,859 --> 01:24:07,679
in the best Panama I have seen in after

1741
01:24:05,579 --> 01:24:10,198
20 years working with Panama 10th

1742
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:11,880
Generation Panama the Thai cross Panama

1743
01:24:10,198 --> 01:24:15,539
is is also

1744
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:19,679
you you can find a lot of Thai qualities

1745
01:24:15,539 --> 01:24:21,359
the Panama and Haze enhance the the

1746
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:24,480
lemonade

1747
01:24:21,359 --> 01:24:27,359
Thai bouquet so they match very well

1748
01:24:24,479 --> 01:24:32,099
that the Panama helps with a lot of GL

1749
01:24:27,359 --> 01:24:35,099
but still keeping the 100 sativa

1750
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:37,860
personality okay no Indica these two are

1751
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:39,719
very very nice for people that want to

1752
01:24:37,859 --> 01:24:42,238
to grow

1753
01:24:39,719 --> 01:24:44,939
Thai with the Thai qualities and don't

1754
01:24:42,238 --> 01:24:47,759
wait more than three months of flowering

1755
01:24:44,939 --> 01:24:50,698
yeah brilliant answer while we're on the

1756
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:53,820
topic of Thai I'll also quickly ask you

1757
01:24:50,698 --> 01:24:57,119
what were the different time others you

1758
01:24:53,819 --> 01:25:00,539
used in the golden tiger cross

1759
01:24:57,119 --> 01:25:04,500
okay okay there the first golden tiger

1760
01:25:00,539 --> 01:25:07,859
it came out with the the the multi

1761
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:13,380
fibers I commented you in in previous

1762
01:25:07,859 --> 01:25:13,380
question it was Malawi cross okay

1763
01:25:13,679 --> 01:25:17,219
um

1764
01:25:14,939 --> 01:25:19,738
yes it came up very very well that was

1765
01:25:17,219 --> 01:25:23,880
the first version of of golden tiger

1766
01:25:19,738 --> 01:25:26,218
and the goal with that Highway was to

1767
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:28,980
yeah to to come up with something with a

1768
01:25:26,219 --> 01:25:32,579
extreme potency of the Malawi

1769
01:25:28,979 --> 01:25:34,979
but make it a bit more up from from the

1770
01:25:32,579 --> 01:25:38,399
time more energetic more more cerebral

1771
01:25:34,979 --> 01:25:42,059
because the the Malawi has a body stone

1772
01:25:38,399 --> 01:25:44,819
that is incredibly strong and it came

1773
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:46,739
out very very very well the when it came

1774
01:25:44,819 --> 01:25:48,420
out quite well but I was not fully

1775
01:25:46,738 --> 01:25:52,500
satisfied with the

1776
01:25:48,420 --> 01:25:54,600
with other pimper files of the Malawi of

1777
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:57,779
the golden tiger first version which was

1778
01:25:54,600 --> 01:26:01,139
Malawi mother Malawi all Malawi killer

1779
01:25:57,779 --> 01:26:05,099
crossed with a military male okay

1780
01:26:01,139 --> 01:26:09,060
so after a few years I was working with

1781
01:26:05,100 --> 01:26:12,600
a double tie which was a kochan

1782
01:26:09,060 --> 01:26:13,739
close to meltai okay you have a pure

1783
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:16,980
time

1784
01:26:13,738 --> 01:26:18,359
and then I selected a female that I like

1785
01:26:16,979 --> 01:26:20,218
a lot

1786
01:26:18,359 --> 01:26:23,519
and I said uh

1787
01:26:20,219 --> 01:26:28,560
I think the golden tiger can be a remake

1788
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:30,900
in status Malawi Thai as Thai Malawi

1789
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:33,900
and instead of including one time

1790
01:26:30,899 --> 01:26:37,738
including the the two types of double

1791
01:26:33,899 --> 01:26:40,500
type because regarding pure type feel or

1792
01:26:37,738 --> 01:26:42,479
best job was double time double time F1

1793
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:45,020
generation it's not something I've been

1794
01:26:42,479 --> 01:26:49,459
able to replicate again

1795
01:26:45,020 --> 01:26:52,560
the timel is no longer alive

1796
01:26:49,460 --> 01:26:55,439
and so so yes I wanted to do something

1797
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:58,020
better with a golden tiger making it

1798
01:26:55,439 --> 01:27:00,299
more Thai improving the the terpene

1799
01:26:58,020 --> 01:27:02,880
profiles and in

1800
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:05,400
um putting putting

1801
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:07,440
breathing Duvel tie into golden tiger

1802
01:27:05,399 --> 01:27:13,079
not just the military

1803
01:27:07,439 --> 01:27:15,359
okay so what I call Golden Tiger 2 2.0

1804
01:27:13,079 --> 01:27:21,179
is double time

1805
01:27:15,359 --> 01:27:25,259
then grows with Malawi killer okay

1806
01:27:21,179 --> 01:27:28,980
then I I have selected a

1807
01:27:25,260 --> 01:27:31,800
d i I selected different phenotypes one

1808
01:27:28,979 --> 01:27:33,899
one more question one more male tie one

1809
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:37,500
more Malawi's

1810
01:27:33,899 --> 01:27:40,259
and and lately I'm introducing the the

1811
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:43,020
more Thai phenotypes I'm inbred between

1812
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:44,699
them to produce golden tiger so it's

1813
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:48,540
basically

1814
01:27:44,698 --> 01:27:52,678
do Dual tie with all Malawi killer

1815
01:27:48,539 --> 01:27:54,719
what a Powerhouse combo right there the

1816
01:27:52,679 --> 01:27:56,699
I'm definitely going to come back and

1817
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:58,439
we'll talk some more about some Malawi

1818
01:27:56,698 --> 01:28:00,299
stuff but I just wanted to finish on the

1819
01:27:58,439 --> 01:28:02,939
ties by asking you

1820
01:28:00,300 --> 01:28:06,360
I noticed that you used to sell a strain

1821
01:28:02,939 --> 01:28:08,099
called Thai stick do you still sell that

1822
01:28:06,359 --> 01:28:10,439
one and was that one one we've already

1823
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:11,340
spoken about or a different tie

1824
01:28:10,439 --> 01:28:13,439
foreign

1825
01:28:11,340 --> 01:28:18,539
this is a different type and this was

1826
01:28:13,439 --> 01:28:22,439
from Gypsy do you know yeah I think in

1827
01:28:18,539 --> 01:28:23,939
2008 he made a a trip to the station and

1828
01:28:22,439 --> 01:28:25,439
brought back to

1829
01:28:23,939 --> 01:28:27,899
uh

1830
01:28:25,439 --> 01:28:31,019
three so the station land race it was

1831
01:28:27,899 --> 01:28:35,460
the Laos prabang

1832
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:38,820
Thai stick and Camargo

1833
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:42,139
and at that time he he had some problems

1834
01:28:38,819 --> 01:28:46,380
with the law in Philippines and all that

1835
01:28:42,139 --> 01:28:49,380
so I I held them to to his Partners in

1836
01:28:46,380 --> 01:28:51,900
UK the one that had I see Maxi Boutique

1837
01:28:49,380 --> 01:28:56,819
and see they to distribute through

1838
01:28:51,899 --> 01:28:58,979
through a seats the the disease that

1839
01:28:56,819 --> 01:29:01,799
Egyptian Nirvana collected these three

1840
01:28:58,979 --> 01:29:03,779
strengths and the Thai stick was one of

1841
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:07,739
them to be honest

1842
01:29:03,779 --> 01:29:10,500
I didn't find it as good as or ties

1843
01:29:07,738 --> 01:29:14,638
it was extremely long flowing

1844
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:16,158
super hermi and I I I'm not saying it

1845
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:17,880
doesn't have potential

1846
01:29:16,158 --> 01:29:21,119
but

1847
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:26,699
I I prefer the times that we already

1848
01:29:21,119 --> 01:29:30,859
have over the the Gypsy State yeah sure

1849
01:29:26,698 --> 01:29:34,500
so I've been wondering for a long time

1850
01:29:30,859 --> 01:29:37,920
what is the mile like as a line itself

1851
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:41,939
it's you don't get to xaml you don't get

1852
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:46,100
to try it pure how would you describe

1853
01:29:41,939 --> 01:29:46,099
the hive the xaml

1854
01:29:51,020 --> 01:29:57,320
it was thanks indeed thanks to Egyptian

1855
01:29:54,539 --> 01:30:01,859
Urbana the the introduced

1856
01:29:57,319 --> 01:30:06,179
to to the cannabisco community because

1857
01:30:01,859 --> 01:30:08,339
around 2000 it was a strain that it was

1858
01:30:06,179 --> 01:30:11,359
only known in Reunion Island by the

1859
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:11,360
French people living there

1860
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:18,120
however for our audience that don't know

1861
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:20,820
about Tamil family an African gray

1862
01:30:18,119 --> 01:30:24,779
strain that comes from reunion Iceland

1863
01:30:20,819 --> 01:30:28,079
Leon Iceland is a French Colony that is

1864
01:30:24,779 --> 01:30:30,658
close to Mauritius islands and

1865
01:30:28,079 --> 01:30:34,698
Madagascar okay it's a very beautiful

1866
01:30:30,658 --> 01:30:37,979
volcanic island isolated and

1867
01:30:34,698 --> 01:30:40,339
and the local people not the French but

1868
01:30:37,979 --> 01:30:43,138
the the the the the

1869
01:30:40,340 --> 01:30:45,719
local indigenous African people from the

1870
01:30:43,139 --> 01:30:48,480
Island used to grow

1871
01:30:45,719 --> 01:30:53,039
a very very strong

1872
01:30:48,479 --> 01:30:56,579
um 3pa exotic sativas in in the most

1873
01:30:53,039 --> 01:30:58,198
isolated parts of of the volcanoes in in

1874
01:30:56,579 --> 01:31:00,600
Reunion Island

1875
01:30:58,198 --> 01:31:03,599
uh and that's the tamales

1876
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:03,600
subtropical

1877
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:11,100
wise is one of the three pieces sativas

1878
01:31:10,020 --> 01:31:13,320
in the world

1879
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:16,079
is

1880
01:31:13,319 --> 01:31:19,679
I I find it consistently more trippy

1881
01:31:16,079 --> 01:31:24,238
than for example dice

1882
01:31:19,679 --> 01:31:26,940
or Colombians the the song The some

1883
01:31:24,238 --> 01:31:28,319
sativa lovers considering like the old

1884
01:31:26,939 --> 01:31:30,119
Colombians and they all die like the

1885
01:31:28,319 --> 01:31:32,460
very very very very best

1886
01:31:30,119 --> 01:31:35,158
I have I have found someone else that

1887
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:37,198
are much more trippy than that yeah and

1888
01:31:35,158 --> 01:31:39,059
it was you know first early days at that

1889
01:31:37,198 --> 01:31:41,719
time we didn't

1890
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:45,420
we didn't have much resources

1891
01:31:41,719 --> 01:31:48,239
uh knowledge but with its own early

1892
01:31:45,420 --> 01:31:52,819
thermal hybrids and they were a scary

1893
01:31:48,238 --> 01:31:55,500
trippy like almost like the closest

1894
01:31:52,819 --> 01:31:58,679
a psychedelic experience I have had with

1895
01:31:55,500 --> 01:32:01,399
cannabis similar to LSD or something

1896
01:31:58,679 --> 01:32:03,658
like that or something like that is

1897
01:32:01,399 --> 01:32:05,638
incredible but there are also some

1898
01:32:03,658 --> 01:32:07,979
famous super strains

1899
01:32:05,639 --> 01:32:12,260
the most trippy ones are the the booty

1900
01:32:07,979 --> 01:32:15,299
ones that have the the Less Pleasant

1901
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:18,739
terpene profiles okay

1902
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:23,400
then you have the

1903
01:32:18,738 --> 01:32:27,619
the the the colorful ones which are very

1904
01:32:23,399 --> 01:32:30,839
very very nervous energetic almost like

1905
01:32:27,619 --> 01:32:33,840
cocaine a lot of coffee type of high

1906
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:36,600
okay and then you have the mango carrot

1907
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:38,760
which is the fruity mango

1908
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:42,300
but this this is the one I use for the

1909
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:47,340
modelica yes this is is

1910
01:32:42,300 --> 01:32:49,860
cerebral barbaricas a more kind and warm

1911
01:32:47,340 --> 01:32:52,500
effect than the the others that are

1912
01:32:49,859 --> 01:32:56,219
super trippy or too nervous or whatever

1913
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:57,600
the mangoca road has the most refined

1914
01:32:56,219 --> 01:32:59,158
pins

1915
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:02,340
um the kind there are

1916
01:32:59,158 --> 01:33:03,379
and best focus is not so dripping also

1917
01:33:02,340 --> 01:33:06,779
aggressive

1918
01:33:03,380 --> 01:33:08,940
still are you ever gonna release the

1919
01:33:06,779 --> 01:33:10,759
really nervous one like I want to smoke

1920
01:33:08,939 --> 01:33:12,259
some weed that makes me scared

1921
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:15,000
[Laughter]

1922
01:33:12,260 --> 01:33:18,119
the the scary type is there the purple

1923
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:21,539
tamale is what we call the purple

1924
01:33:18,119 --> 01:33:24,000
thermal and we we selected a purple from

1925
01:33:21,539 --> 01:33:27,840
our mother like five to six years ago

1968
01:35:23,399 --> 01:35:29,039
I found it a bit in English

1969
01:35:26,279 --> 01:35:31,319
I found it uh

1970
01:35:29,039 --> 01:35:33,779
Congolese

1984
01:36:07,859 --> 01:36:11,579
also received some of the original

1985
01:36:09,179 --> 01:36:14,520
pharmacies from gypsy

1986
01:36:11,579 --> 01:36:16,880
but if he was working Marcus was working

1987
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:20,820
more Dutch strain like warlock which was

1988
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:23,579
a skunk a planning or

1989
01:36:20,819 --> 01:36:26,099
or or others that have not realized so

1990
01:36:23,579 --> 01:36:28,380
why we don't so he grew a bit of the

1991
01:36:26,100 --> 01:36:30,179
samal but it was not his style and

1992
01:36:28,380 --> 01:36:33,420
knowing that I was a

1993
01:36:30,179 --> 01:36:36,960
quite a sativa man he he sent me the the

1994
01:36:33,420 --> 01:36:39,840
clones from Holland to Spain in in Korea

1995
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:42,060
company uh the first two time they

1996
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:45,360
arrived completely rotten

1997
01:36:42,060 --> 01:36:49,260
but at the third time they make it um

1998
01:36:45,359 --> 01:36:51,960
and I got uh uh a very nice summer clone

1999
01:36:49,260 --> 01:36:53,820
that he selective also with the man

2000
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:56,460
Walker rotor pins

2001
01:36:53,819 --> 01:37:00,000
it maybe was not so trippy and strong

2002
01:36:56,460 --> 01:37:02,340
like the ones we had but little pins and

2003
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,719
the quality it was very good it's the

2004
01:37:02,340 --> 01:37:07,199
one I decided to use for tamale

2005
01:37:03,719 --> 01:37:09,779
samadelica is this thermal mango Carol

2006
01:37:07,198 --> 01:37:12,599
that Jared from magogenetics give me in

2007
01:37:09,779 --> 01:37:15,359
Chrome 4 and I pollinate it with uh

2008
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:17,340
golden tiger F1 hybrid the golden tiger

2009
01:37:15,359 --> 01:37:20,339
first person so is

2010
01:37:17,340 --> 01:37:20,340
okay

2011
01:37:22,639 --> 01:37:29,279
fantastic so I wanted to ask you if you

2012
01:37:27,359 --> 01:37:32,519
could give us a little bit of the back

2013
01:37:29,279 --> 01:37:35,279
story on how you obtained your Malawi

2014
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:38,280
stock it's very famous

2015
01:37:35,279 --> 01:37:38,279
is

2016
01:37:42,300 --> 01:37:49,800
quite mysterious extreme because when I

2017
01:37:44,279 --> 01:37:53,300
was a study uh at the University uh

2018
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:56,579
it was a small town so more or less they

2019
01:37:53,300 --> 01:38:00,239
I had a lot of friends we have a cycle

2020
01:37:56,579 --> 01:38:01,760
where we sell a lot of clothes okay

2021
01:38:00,238 --> 01:38:06,479
at that time

2022
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:09,139
we every one grower had a clone of of

2023
01:38:06,479 --> 01:38:13,619
Malawi that he said that it was engraved

2024
01:38:09,139 --> 01:38:15,539
powerful this and that say okay then he

2025
01:38:13,619 --> 01:38:18,359
gave to us and some friends that were

2026
01:38:15,539 --> 01:38:19,679
collaborating with me at this is uh at

2027
01:38:18,359 --> 01:38:23,099
that time

2028
01:38:19,679 --> 01:38:24,960
and my one of them was a very very good

2029
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:27,780
in the grower and he grew the Malawi

2030
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:30,840
indoors and we could couldn't believe

2031
01:38:27,779 --> 01:38:34,019
what it was it was

2032
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:36,860
so sticky that you you cannot

2033
01:38:34,020 --> 01:38:36,860
uh

2034
01:38:37,698 --> 01:38:43,259
I like that I don't like the greenness I

2035
01:38:40,079 --> 01:38:45,600
always do it by hand so I can toast

2036
01:38:43,260 --> 01:38:47,940
everything's to be in contact with the

2037
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:50,280
plant with Malawi it was impossible it

2038
01:38:47,939 --> 01:38:51,178
was like complete the hand completely

2039
01:38:50,279 --> 01:38:55,619
black

2040
01:38:51,179 --> 01:38:59,158
the pieces of of bad stick to your

2041
01:38:55,619 --> 01:39:00,719
fingers it was incredible and then you

2042
01:38:59,158 --> 01:39:03,719
made a joint

2043
01:39:00,719 --> 01:39:05,880
do you smoke like yeah oh yeah I have

2044
01:39:03,719 --> 01:39:08,039
high tolerance I can smoke a lot of

2045
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:09,600
people smoke have joint you can you see

2046
01:39:08,039 --> 01:39:12,779
his face

2047
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:16,020
and I have so many stories of a strong

2048
01:39:12,779 --> 01:39:18,599
smokers with Malawi like I could I could

2049
01:39:16,020 --> 01:39:21,659
be I was talking about them but it's

2050
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:25,739
completely devastating is like maybe

2051
01:39:21,658 --> 01:39:28,319
eight to 12 hours High you do you go to

2052
01:39:25,738 --> 01:39:32,000
sleep you you wake up still high

2053
01:39:28,319 --> 01:39:32,000
like you cannot drive

2054
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:39,659
you cannot move you you you have a panic

2055
01:39:36,539 --> 01:39:42,238
attack and you want to go to the to the

2056
01:39:39,658 --> 01:39:45,119
hospital you fall asleep and you didn't

2057
01:39:42,238 --> 01:39:49,198
know what happened things like that very

2058
01:39:45,119 --> 01:39:52,260
strange methods very extreme and then

2059
01:39:49,198 --> 01:39:54,479
it was the the what I call the old

2060
01:39:52,260 --> 01:39:55,500
Malawi killer clone it was that it was

2061
01:39:54,479 --> 01:39:58,738
that clone

2062
01:39:55,500 --> 01:40:02,639
and then I asked where did this clone

2063
01:39:58,738 --> 01:40:06,000
came out is from Antonio he's a crazy

2064
01:40:02,639 --> 01:40:08,819
grower that now is living in Japan and

2065
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:11,520
he was crazy with the Africans and this

2066
01:40:08,819 --> 01:40:14,579
and that and the Malawi from Anthony was

2067
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:18,120
for us like then we grow it we brought

2068
01:40:14,579 --> 01:40:20,639
it to and all the people that trail say

2069
01:40:18,119 --> 01:40:23,460
what the [ __ ] is this I haven't tried

2070
01:40:20,639 --> 01:40:26,900
anything so strong in my life

2071
01:40:23,460 --> 01:40:30,179
this was the the consensus from many it

2072
01:40:26,899 --> 01:40:33,138
was that that their princes very rude he

2073
01:40:30,179 --> 01:40:38,100
was everything

2074
01:40:33,139 --> 01:40:43,139
Dusty bully turpins oily is not

2075
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:45,659
nothing refined no fruit to be nothing

2076
01:40:43,139 --> 01:40:49,260
it's very very rude interpense but the

2077
01:40:45,658 --> 01:40:50,339
effect was so strong so long lasting so

2078
01:40:49,260 --> 01:40:52,560
profound

2079
01:40:50,340 --> 01:40:55,020
that we can never

2080
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:57,659
only a few times in my life I have seen

2081
01:40:55,020 --> 01:41:01,560
something like this

2082
01:40:57,658 --> 01:41:04,638
and and then again a lot of

2083
01:41:01,560 --> 01:41:07,980
popularity the Malawi clone

2084
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:09,719
then I start breeding with it and then

2085
01:41:07,979 --> 01:41:13,198
coming up with golden tiger with some

2086
01:41:09,719 --> 01:41:16,639
adelica then I release him when we

2087
01:41:13,198 --> 01:41:16,638
release the the Malawi

2088
01:41:16,939 --> 01:41:25,500
2012 in 2012 because we we were growing

2089
01:41:21,060 --> 01:41:28,020
this this club since 2000 for so for 10

2090
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:31,500
years we only grow it

2091
01:41:28,020 --> 01:41:34,980
um but not much into breathing but uh

2092
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:37,319
I I just I decided that Malawi would be

2093
01:41:34,979 --> 01:41:40,379
a really really interesting line to

2094
01:41:37,319 --> 01:41:43,859
dwell to the assist catalog so around

2095
01:41:40,380 --> 01:41:46,679
2012 with the last original seats I I

2096
01:41:43,859 --> 01:41:48,299
have from

2097
01:41:46,679 --> 01:41:50,760
that were

2098
01:41:48,300 --> 01:41:53,100
the siblings of the Clone or the old man

2099
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:55,020
I will clear killer clone

2100
01:41:53,100 --> 01:41:59,639
I've reproduced them

2101
01:41:55,020 --> 01:42:01,560
I I get to know other females

2102
01:41:59,639 --> 01:42:03,420
siblings of the old Malawi clear that

2103
01:42:01,560 --> 01:42:07,800
we're not so strong but I found karate

2104
01:42:03,420 --> 01:42:10,139
types in Malawi okay that is like what I

2105
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:12,320
call the fruity Malawi and if you go to

2106
01:42:10,139 --> 01:42:14,940
the Malawi breeder packs is the only

2107
01:42:12,319 --> 01:42:16,559
Malawi line that have

2108
01:42:14,939 --> 01:42:19,678
quarter pins

2109
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:22,500
say in some way okay and then I

2110
01:42:19,679 --> 01:42:26,279
reproduce the the Malawi yeah and it was

2111
01:42:22,500 --> 01:42:29,100
loud released in regular season 2012.

2112
01:42:26,279 --> 01:42:30,679
later he came there

2113
01:42:29,100 --> 01:42:33,780
the the

2114
01:42:30,679 --> 01:42:35,819
feminized version

2115
01:42:33,779 --> 01:42:37,639
and it was

2116
01:42:35,819 --> 01:42:42,299
around

2117
01:42:37,639 --> 01:42:44,940
2014 two years later in the

2118
01:42:42,300 --> 01:42:48,600
peace regeneration

2119
01:42:44,939 --> 01:42:51,658
well the the grandsons

2120
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:53,940
on ground and ground doctors of the old

2121
01:42:51,658 --> 01:42:55,079
Malawi killer when I found a new Malawi

2122
01:42:53,939 --> 01:42:57,658
killer

2123
01:42:55,079 --> 01:42:59,059
which is the the second most important

2124
01:42:57,658 --> 01:43:02,219
plan

2125
01:42:59,060 --> 01:43:06,360
in my Malawi reading okay

2126
01:43:02,219 --> 01:43:07,679
and with these two the iPhone also in

2127
01:43:06,359 --> 01:43:11,099
the P3

2128
01:43:07,679 --> 01:43:12,600
generation the another freaky Malawi

2129
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:16,260
that reminds me

2130
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:17,960
a lot of the 3D types I found in the p1s

2131
01:43:16,260 --> 01:43:21,659
that I couldn't Preserve at that time

2132
01:43:17,960 --> 01:43:23,939
and a colorful Malawi in the second

2133
01:43:21,658 --> 01:43:24,899
generation that was the the park on my

2134
01:43:23,939 --> 01:43:27,059
hallway

2135
01:43:24,899 --> 01:43:29,939
there were the ones that only that were

2136
01:43:27,060 --> 01:43:32,880
killer for FX was the old Malawi killer

2137
01:43:29,939 --> 01:43:36,439
and the new Malawi killer okay the

2138
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:39,719
fruity was nice but just for terpenes

2139
01:43:36,439 --> 01:43:43,319
and and the purple was nice but for

2140
01:43:39,719 --> 01:43:45,899
colors the the winners for potency and

2141
01:43:43,319 --> 01:43:49,139
jail where the old killer and the new

2142
01:43:45,899 --> 01:43:52,319
killer and then I start to to breathe

2143
01:43:49,139 --> 01:43:55,020
the new killer into the old killer to

2144
01:43:52,319 --> 01:43:59,219
make the the latest feminized versions

2145
01:43:55,020 --> 01:44:02,159
so so I make sure that I combine my

2146
01:43:59,219 --> 01:44:04,639
strongest Malawi killer phenotypes in a

2147
01:44:02,158 --> 01:44:08,460
single frame line

2148
01:44:04,639 --> 01:44:10,920
uh so the The Growers can buy a three

2149
01:44:08,460 --> 01:44:13,380
five pen pack and we'll get

2150
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:17,039
killer phenotypes that are outstanding

2151
01:44:13,380 --> 01:44:19,440
just by germinating one two three seats

2152
01:44:17,039 --> 01:44:22,679
are we a few years later here the

2153
01:44:19,439 --> 01:44:24,299
Antonio the the source of the United

2154
01:44:22,679 --> 01:44:27,420
from Japan

2155
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:30,000
he he lost all during these years in

2156
01:44:27,420 --> 01:44:32,279
Japan or his genetic library and was

2157
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:34,380
very happy that I used to represent his

2158
01:44:32,279 --> 01:44:38,099
malawian clone phone and I have been

2159
01:44:34,380 --> 01:44:40,980
working the line to keep the the line

2160
01:44:38,100 --> 01:44:42,480
healthy not only as a clone but of all

2161
01:44:40,979 --> 01:44:45,419
sorts of seed line

2162
01:44:42,479 --> 01:44:47,698
I give back to him the clones and the

2163
01:44:45,420 --> 01:44:49,440
seals so he can work again and

2164
01:44:47,698 --> 01:44:52,259
unfortunately he passed away two years

2165
01:44:49,439 --> 01:44:54,479
later of a heart attack

2166
01:44:52,260 --> 01:44:57,179
that's unfortunate to hear

2167
01:44:54,479 --> 01:44:59,939
the Malawi it has been one of our

2168
01:44:57,179 --> 01:45:02,100
flagships or

2169
01:44:59,939 --> 01:45:04,738
most important is training in the last

2170
01:45:02,100 --> 01:45:08,520
decade and I have created many many good

2171
01:45:04,738 --> 01:45:11,279
Malawi hybrids many many like Malawi PC

2172
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:14,119
games Malawi Pakistan Malawi cross

2173
01:45:11,279 --> 01:45:17,759
Panama is excellent

2174
01:45:14,118 --> 01:45:20,519
a golden tiger samadelica are very

2175
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:24,060
popular they are very cool

2176
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:26,699
I I have many many many lovely life is

2177
01:45:24,060 --> 01:45:28,560
and they are very good

2178
01:45:26,698 --> 01:45:31,439
yeah we might go with them allowing

2179
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:33,900
hybrids was keep the potency of the

2180
01:45:31,439 --> 01:45:36,359
Malawi hybrids of the Malawi sorry with

2181
01:45:33,899 --> 01:45:39,000
the Malawi killer but try to improve the

2182
01:45:36,359 --> 01:45:41,399
terpene profile of the Malawi for

2183
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:43,560
example with the Pakistani that works

2184
01:45:41,399 --> 01:45:44,779
great for that the Panama is also very

2185
01:45:43,560 --> 01:45:49,440
therapy

2186
01:45:44,779 --> 01:45:53,219
and yes awesome so one of the listeners

2187
01:45:49,439 --> 01:45:55,319
was wondering what is the strongest land

2188
01:45:53,219 --> 01:45:58,139
race you sell and it sounds to me like

2189
01:45:55,319 --> 01:46:00,840
maybe that old Malawi cross new Malawi

2190
01:45:58,139 --> 01:46:04,260
might be that but just for clarity what

2191
01:46:00,840 --> 01:46:05,579
is the strongest land race you sell

2192
01:46:04,260 --> 01:46:08,039
what are we

2193
01:46:05,579 --> 01:46:10,319
yeah

2194
01:46:08,039 --> 01:46:14,158
yeah so another one of our listeners was

2195
01:46:10,319 --> 01:46:16,279
wondering how rare is the purple Malawi

2196
01:46:14,158 --> 01:46:19,019
phenotype

2197
01:46:16,279 --> 01:46:20,880
very very very rare

2198
01:46:19,020 --> 01:46:23,040
it was very rare

2199
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:25,440
um honestly I

2200
01:46:23,039 --> 01:46:28,079
I only found it in the in the second

2201
01:46:25,439 --> 01:46:31,678
generation I never saw it again

2202
01:46:28,079 --> 01:46:32,939
I never saw it again and I I selected

2203
01:46:31,679 --> 01:46:34,859
one

2204
01:46:32,939 --> 01:46:37,198
and I pollinated with the purple

2205
01:46:34,859 --> 01:46:40,738
Pakistan chitral and then I created

2206
01:46:37,198 --> 01:46:41,719
Violetta which is a

2207
01:46:40,738 --> 01:46:46,439
uh

2208
01:46:41,719 --> 01:46:50,399
yeah like a improved purple Pakistan

2209
01:46:46,439 --> 01:46:54,178
version where the Malawi improves the

2210
01:46:50,399 --> 01:46:56,698
the bigger the gel the potency but

2211
01:46:54,179 --> 01:46:58,560
keeping all the consistently the colors

2212
01:46:56,698 --> 01:47:01,138
and that are pimprofiles of the purple

2213
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:04,139
Pakistan

2214
01:47:01,139 --> 01:47:07,260
so I noticed that some of your crosses

2215
01:47:04,139 --> 01:47:08,719
are regular and some are feminized and

2216
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:12,360
it made me wonder

2217
01:47:08,719 --> 01:47:14,819
what sort of traits or outcomes from

2218
01:47:12,359 --> 01:47:19,219
across make you think it's better suited

2219
01:47:14,819 --> 01:47:19,219
for feminized versus regular

2220
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:23,639
yeah

2221
01:47:21,238 --> 01:47:27,138
we are only there one of the few

2222
01:47:23,639 --> 01:47:30,118
seedbanks the that is still offer

2223
01:47:27,139 --> 01:47:31,199
regular and Femme so I think the people

2224
01:47:30,118 --> 01:47:34,139
is

2225
01:47:31,198 --> 01:47:36,899
two extra minutes uh you have one side

2226
01:47:34,139 --> 01:47:37,679
of the big sellers events that they say

2227
01:47:36,899 --> 01:47:40,439
no

2228
01:47:37,679 --> 01:47:42,539
to to sell well must be only Fame and

2229
01:47:40,439 --> 01:47:45,238
they are right because what people

2230
01:47:42,539 --> 01:47:47,219
mostly want is is feminizing

2231
01:47:45,238 --> 01:47:49,079
and then there's other extra images that

2232
01:47:47,219 --> 01:47:50,100
say no no true reading they're real

2233
01:47:49,079 --> 01:47:53,039
breathing

2234
01:47:50,100 --> 01:47:54,119
is only regular with classic males and

2235
01:47:53,039 --> 01:47:58,859
this and that

2236
01:47:54,118 --> 01:48:01,019
and usually the the reality or

2237
01:47:58,859 --> 01:48:03,599
or that

2238
01:48:01,020 --> 01:48:06,179
interesting position is is more in the

2239
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:10,860
middle you know you can breathe a line

2240
01:48:06,179 --> 01:48:13,739
in regular and in feminize and moreover

2241
01:48:10,859 --> 01:48:15,658
this can complement each other

2242
01:48:13,738 --> 01:48:18,539
okay the problem

2243
01:48:15,658 --> 01:48:20,698
if for example a

2244
01:48:18,539 --> 01:48:24,260
people that say only the regular

2245
01:48:20,698 --> 01:48:24,259
breathing is there is the right thing

2246
01:48:24,359 --> 01:48:30,539
no scientific evidence sayings that you

2247
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:33,480
cannot fully bring fully breathe doing

2248
01:48:30,539 --> 01:48:35,399
it only feminize okay

2249
01:48:33,479 --> 01:48:37,319
and when you are breathing in that

2250
01:48:35,399 --> 01:48:39,019
regular way you are including males

2251
01:48:37,319 --> 01:48:41,158
obviously

2252
01:48:39,020 --> 01:48:43,739
and when you are breathing only with

2253
01:48:41,158 --> 01:48:47,539
feminized only female plants are

2254
01:48:43,738 --> 01:48:51,419
involved it means that although you are

2255
01:48:47,539 --> 01:48:56,118
in a breathing for in the same strain

2256
01:48:51,420 --> 01:48:56,118
and even with similar parental plans

2257
01:48:56,179 --> 01:49:00,840
examples that will create different

2258
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:03,600
lines

2259
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:06,319
you know even when breathing let's put

2260
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:06,320
our example

2261
01:49:08,658 --> 01:49:15,719
okay

2262
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:18,780
you can continue with with the the Kali

2263
01:49:15,719 --> 01:49:21,118
China regular and maybe you find some

2264
01:49:18,779 --> 01:49:24,599
traits in the regular and you continue

2265
01:49:21,118 --> 01:49:27,299
with the feminist and you are more

2266
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:30,239
successful in racing and fixing other

2267
01:49:27,300 --> 01:49:32,699
trades in the feminis then you can take

2268
01:49:30,238 --> 01:49:35,218
a male from the regular line and

2269
01:49:32,698 --> 01:49:38,899
pollinate the financial deferment all

2270
01:49:35,219 --> 01:49:41,880
the feminine or the FML line you know

2271
01:49:38,899 --> 01:49:44,759
and you can combine the the success you

2272
01:49:41,880 --> 01:49:46,560
have made in in one of the branches of

2273
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:48,539
the feminized breathing you you can

2274
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:51,239
combine with your

2275
01:49:48,539 --> 01:49:55,079
success on the regular lines so they

2276
01:49:51,238 --> 01:49:56,879
complement each other you we we want we

2277
01:49:55,079 --> 01:49:59,698
don't need to be so extra missile black

2278
01:49:56,880 --> 01:50:01,800
and white people say no no no only

2279
01:49:59,698 --> 01:50:05,698
regular seeds is the only good breathing

2280
01:50:01,800 --> 01:50:08,219
because other ways they become a muffler

2281
01:50:05,698 --> 01:50:09,479
that is not true there's no scientific

2282
01:50:08,219 --> 01:50:12,000
evidence

2283
01:50:09,479 --> 01:50:14,399
that if you breathe with feminized

2284
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:16,618
breathing the lines became hermy this is

2285
01:50:14,399 --> 01:50:19,799
if you breathe using Army parental

2286
01:50:16,618 --> 01:50:21,719
plants but if you breathe regular

2287
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:24,360
classic breathing with my with family

2288
01:50:21,719 --> 01:50:26,460
males and you don't select well your

2289
01:50:24,359 --> 01:50:29,279
males and your females you will breathe

2290
01:50:26,460 --> 01:50:32,639
regular lines that are hermaphrodite too

2291
01:50:29,279 --> 01:50:34,979
so that if a line is hermaphrodite it

2292
01:50:32,639 --> 01:50:38,460
doesn't depend whether it's regular or

2293
01:50:34,979 --> 01:50:41,099
feminized it depends on the work and the

2294
01:50:38,460 --> 01:50:43,500
less on the genetics and the work and

2295
01:50:41,100 --> 01:50:45,900
selection of the of the Breather Quality

2296
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:49,979
quality is the same you can breathe

2297
01:50:45,899 --> 01:50:52,379
excellent mediocre and nasty regular

2298
01:50:49,979 --> 01:50:54,238
lines the same for the feminized lines

2299
01:50:52,380 --> 01:50:57,560
you can breathe

2300
01:50:54,238 --> 01:51:00,779
excellent quality feminized lines

2301
01:50:57,560 --> 01:51:03,539
normals and terrible

2302
01:51:00,779 --> 01:51:06,960
people mix things and they take

2303
01:51:03,539 --> 01:51:08,939
absolutes like it was a fact and it's

2304
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:11,698
not I tell you from my business

2305
01:51:08,939 --> 01:51:14,879
experience Fair first-hand experience

2306
01:51:11,698 --> 01:51:16,979
that you can fully breathe a line

2307
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:19,800
through feminized breathing and only

2308
01:51:16,979 --> 01:51:22,379
with the males you can do it also with a

2309
01:51:19,800 --> 01:51:25,260
regular and if you do it both sides you

2310
01:51:22,380 --> 01:51:28,920
will have more success more expression

2311
01:51:25,260 --> 01:51:30,360
more genetic variability more lines of

2312
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:32,940
the family

2313
01:51:30,359 --> 01:51:36,719
it means long term is more successful

2314
01:51:32,939 --> 01:51:40,079
for breathing that if you only do one

2315
01:51:36,719 --> 01:51:42,359
regular or only as one or only by cross

2316
01:51:40,079 --> 01:51:44,760
into one one one one or only selfie

2317
01:51:42,359 --> 01:51:47,819
selfie that's where the problem creates

2318
01:51:44,760 --> 01:51:50,639
but if you embrace

2319
01:51:47,819 --> 01:51:52,920
with different parental lines in its in

2320
01:51:50,639 --> 01:51:55,859
Reading step it creates different lines

2321
01:51:52,920 --> 01:51:59,219
regular feminine you combine one with

2322
01:51:55,859 --> 01:52:02,639
others at the after three four five six

2323
01:51:59,219 --> 01:52:06,359
seven generations you create a very big

2324
01:52:02,639 --> 01:52:09,359
family with many different branches

2325
01:52:06,359 --> 01:52:11,460
and you can combine the best parental

2326
01:52:09,359 --> 01:52:14,219
plans from different branches in mid

2327
01:52:11,460 --> 01:52:17,039
long term to avoid inbreeding the

2328
01:52:14,219 --> 01:52:18,480
depression after many generations of

2329
01:52:17,039 --> 01:52:20,279
breathing

2330
01:52:18,479 --> 01:52:21,658
yeah that's some awesome information

2331
01:52:20,279 --> 01:52:24,899
there

2332
01:52:21,658 --> 01:52:28,198
I wanted to ask you I see that you have

2333
01:52:24,899 --> 01:52:31,079
been working with the A5 Haze and the C5

2334
01:52:28,198 --> 01:52:34,500
Haze I've been lucky enough to have

2335
01:52:31,079 --> 01:52:37,260
tried both of them and I really like the

2336
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:40,859
hive the C5 but I feel like most people

2337
01:52:37,260 --> 01:52:42,780
say they prefer the A5 which one do you

2338
01:52:40,859 --> 01:52:44,179
prefer and what's your thoughts on the

2339
01:52:42,779 --> 01:52:47,639

01:52:51,179 --> 01:52:55,560
say I was lucky I got to try them when I

2343
01:52:53,579 --> 01:52:58,859
was hanging out with Bodie

2344
01:52:55,560 --> 01:53:02,400

2345
01:52:58,859 --> 01:53:04,679
story The behind but maybe we can

2346
01:53:02,399 --> 01:53:07,259
comment about it to put a a bidding

2347
01:53:04,679 --> 01:53:10,859
costs or audience

2348
01:53:07,260 --> 01:53:14,159
yes well as you know uh Neville

2349
01:53:10,859 --> 01:53:16,259
in the latest this make the First Legacy

2350
01:53:14,158 --> 01:53:18,420
Bank of the world in Holland called the

2351
01:53:16,260 --> 01:53:21,780
seed bank

2352
01:53:18,420 --> 01:53:23,779
moreover he was a very very talented

2353
01:53:21,779 --> 01:53:27,899
breather

2354
01:53:23,779 --> 01:53:30,840
adapting he managed to to get excellent

2355
01:53:27,899 --> 01:53:33,420
lines from some school man to breathe

2356
01:53:30,840 --> 01:53:35,279
with him legally from the seed bank

2357
01:53:33,420 --> 01:53:39,600
he got the

2358
01:53:35,279 --> 01:53:42,179
the haze and the skunk and dual Vans and

2359
01:53:39,600 --> 01:53:46,440
Afghani one from samuskong man

2360
01:53:42,179 --> 01:53:49,980
and he also like to work a lot the

2361
01:53:46,439 --> 01:53:52,019
with with other Indica strains the

2362
01:53:49,979 --> 01:53:54,479
northern lights and the house plan and

2363
01:53:52,020 --> 01:53:57,360
the gd13

2364
01:53:54,479 --> 01:54:01,399
and the police from

2365
01:53:57,359 --> 01:54:03,839
from Wilson these were basically the the

2366
01:54:01,399 --> 01:54:06,599
indicates he liked most and the sativa

2367
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:09,900
that he liked most the case

2368
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:12,119
and enable was also the

2369
01:54:09,899 --> 01:54:14,279
authorities

2370
01:54:12,118 --> 01:54:16,920
credit what is the where is deal and

2371
01:54:14,279 --> 01:54:20,158
obviously without some without some

2372
01:54:16,920 --> 01:54:22,560
scanman we won't have the scam

2373
01:54:20,158 --> 01:54:23,759
Revolution that happened in Holland or

2374
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:25,619
the race Revolution that happened

2375
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:29,039
worldwide

2376
01:54:25,618 --> 01:54:31,880
so but it's true that Neville was the

2377
01:54:29,039 --> 01:54:36,060
one that through the seed bank

2378
01:54:31,880 --> 01:54:38,400
make a spread make the name of the haze

2379
01:54:36,060 --> 01:54:41,000
really big and well-known worldwide with

2380
01:54:38,399 --> 01:54:42,679
his head with his head hybrids

2381
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:46,319
surprisingly

2382
01:54:42,679 --> 01:54:48,719
didn't have much his plans from the

2383
01:54:46,319 --> 01:54:49,738
original stock from some school month to

2384
01:54:48,719 --> 01:54:52,859
choose from

2385
01:54:49,738 --> 01:54:57,059
he only had one Superior he I think he

2386
01:54:52,859 --> 01:54:58,979
had the beef two two females one that

2387
01:54:57,060 --> 01:55:01,619
was a bitterly flowering and he thought

2388
01:54:58,979 --> 01:55:04,138
it was a gross and he avoided one Ultra

2389
01:55:01,618 --> 01:55:07,319
long flowing a female that I think he

2390
01:55:04,139 --> 01:55:09,719
called a b female that was so Ultra long

2391
01:55:07,319 --> 01:55:12,179
flowering I think he was not used to and

2392
01:55:09,719 --> 01:55:15,920
he avoid that plant but I think

2393
01:55:12,179 --> 01:55:15,920
she will later

2394
01:55:16,939 --> 01:55:22,439
rejected of of that moment of kill that

2395
01:55:20,579 --> 01:55:25,198
plant because probably there was fire in

2396
01:55:22,439 --> 01:55:29,698
that plant so he ended up having only

2397
01:55:25,198 --> 01:55:34,379
two two males the male a and the male C

2398
01:55:29,698 --> 01:55:37,879
uh as a sign told you uh when I was a

2399
01:55:34,380 --> 01:55:41,520
kid I smoked a lot of hybrid from senses

2400
01:55:37,880 --> 01:55:43,760
from all the naval work because since

2401
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:46,619
you see both the feedback from Neville

2402
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:48,539
many people many seed banks were using

2403
01:55:46,618 --> 01:55:51,000
their face Harvest vulnerable to to

2404
01:55:48,539 --> 01:55:53,939
develop their face hybrids

2405
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:56,399
so yes I smoked the very best from

2406
01:55:53,939 --> 01:55:59,059
Neville and even in Hollande Hawaiian

2407
01:55:56,399 --> 01:56:03,299
chase the Mexican Haze the

2408
01:55:59,060 --> 01:56:04,920
Northern Lakes everything and and a few

2409
01:56:03,300 --> 01:56:08,520
years back

2410
01:56:04,920 --> 01:56:11,639
and Neville gave developed some face

2411
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:16,380
hybrids the the most famous is Northern

2412
01:56:11,639 --> 01:56:19,020
La Hayes and Super Silver Haze or later

2413
01:56:16,380 --> 01:56:21,600
but he also had some other direct

2414
01:56:19,020 --> 01:56:23,699
everyone has hybrid that are not so

2415
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:26,159
famous like the Northern Lights

2416
01:56:23,698 --> 01:56:29,359
it was the husband face

2417
01:56:26,158 --> 01:56:31,939
the G13 case

2418
01:56:29,359 --> 01:56:35,698
and the

2419
01:56:31,939 --> 01:56:40,079
well the the Neville case we was a naval

2420
01:56:35,698 --> 01:56:43,019
Haze and the and two Northern Light case

2421
01:56:40,079 --> 01:56:46,738
one one was Northern Light five clone

2422
01:56:43,020 --> 01:56:49,260
pollinated with the Hayes male a

2423
01:56:46,738 --> 01:56:51,599
and the other was Northern Light

2424
01:56:49,260 --> 01:56:54,840
five phase number sorry Northern Light

2425
01:56:51,600 --> 01:56:58,920
five clone pollinated with hairy female

2426
01:56:54,840 --> 01:57:01,980
okay he also lost the the male a barrier

2427
01:56:58,920 --> 01:57:05,100
Leon so he never released commercially

2428
01:57:01,979 --> 01:57:06,718
the northern life fight crosses with his

2429
01:57:05,100 --> 01:57:09,360
a

2430
01:57:06,719 --> 01:57:11,460
but this one is the one that that

2431
01:57:09,359 --> 01:57:14,519
produced the loader in fence

2432
01:57:11,460 --> 01:57:17,359
they're they're very low in fence that a

2433
01:57:14,520 --> 01:57:21,480
lot of people in Holland

2434
01:57:17,359 --> 01:57:25,859
relates to to the best case

2435
01:57:21,479 --> 01:57:29,279
came from the day from the eight that

2436
01:57:25,859 --> 01:57:31,019
the the the see that for I have

2437
01:57:29,279 --> 01:57:34,079
experience

2438
01:57:31,020 --> 01:57:37,320
in in the in the Clones view command

2439
01:57:34,079 --> 01:57:39,300
that you also have a small Jordan

2440
01:57:37,319 --> 01:57:41,579
I I think is

2441
01:57:39,300 --> 01:57:43,380
more a tie like

2442
01:57:41,579 --> 01:57:45,899
the that their pins are more lime

2443
01:57:43,380 --> 01:57:47,279
lemonade and the effect is more

2444
01:57:45,899 --> 01:57:49,138
uplifting

2445
01:57:47,279 --> 01:57:52,859
Crossing with northern light is still

2446
01:57:49,139 --> 01:57:55,800
quite dirty to my to my taste but it's

2447
01:57:52,859 --> 01:57:59,939
correct the the

2448
01:57:55,800 --> 01:58:03,719
from the enable gave to to some growers

2449
01:57:59,939 --> 01:58:06,899
in the south of Holland uh some selected

2450
01:58:03,719 --> 01:58:10,260
clones of his fibroid face hybrids

2451
01:58:06,899 --> 01:58:13,679
it was the A5 case the C5 case

2452
01:58:10,260 --> 01:58:16,639
the mother of super silver haze

2453
01:58:13,679 --> 01:58:16,639
the one you smoke

2454
01:58:19,618 --> 01:58:24,779
the Neville house which is A5 has

2455
01:58:22,460 --> 01:58:29,639
crossed racy mail

2456
01:58:24,779 --> 01:58:31,679
and the GE 13 which was G13 cross we

2457
01:58:29,639 --> 01:58:34,440
Haze a ml

2458
01:58:31,679 --> 01:58:37,139
and after smoking the The Flash from

2459
01:58:34,439 --> 01:58:40,259
Holland and now I which I know with this

2460
01:58:37,139 --> 01:58:43,859
understand our descendant from the case

2461
01:58:40,260 --> 01:58:47,579
email and the Hasty I can

2462
01:58:43,859 --> 01:58:51,000
really appreciate the difference the the

2463
01:58:47,579 --> 01:58:53,880
terpene signature of the female the

2464
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:55,039
turpent signature of the a male the a

2465
01:58:53,880 --> 01:58:57,420
male is

2466
01:58:55,039 --> 01:59:00,420
people was confused

2467
01:58:57,420 --> 01:59:02,099
they may lose more intense and some and

2468
01:59:00,420 --> 01:59:06,539
the intense comes from the American

2469
01:59:02,099 --> 01:59:09,420
sativa so the a male is more Colombian

2470
01:59:06,539 --> 01:59:10,819
or maybe Colombia Mexican but

2471
01:59:09,420 --> 01:59:14,819
Americans

2472
01:59:10,819 --> 01:59:18,840
This the sea male or thousands come and

2473
01:59:14,819 --> 01:59:22,559
say that origin original Haze never have

2474
01:59:18,840 --> 01:59:26,400
a tie that it was all Colombian

2475
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:30,840
it's indeed I like I'm not saying the

2476
01:59:26,399 --> 01:59:33,059
the the Hasty malius original with Thai

2477
01:59:30,840 --> 01:59:36,360
that could be because in later

2478
01:59:33,060 --> 01:59:38,039
generation of original Haze same

2479
01:59:36,359 --> 01:59:41,238
schoolman also

2480
01:59:38,039 --> 01:59:44,639
this song has Thai hybrids in Indian

2481
01:59:41,238 --> 01:59:49,198
face hybrids

2482
01:59:44,639 --> 01:59:52,380
but I qualify the the haze female and

2483
01:59:49,198 --> 01:59:55,279
it's office spring as style like

2484
01:59:52,380 --> 01:59:59,880
no no Thai Domino because I don't have

2485
01:59:55,279 --> 02:00:01,319
the the proof that is study but it's

2486
01:59:59,880 --> 02:00:03,779
very tight like interpense and effect

2487
02:00:01,319 --> 02:00:05,698
that's true

2488
02:00:03,779 --> 02:00:10,380
um the good thing is that I was in touch

2489
02:00:05,698 --> 02:00:12,178
with yosemi we was part or was is part

2490
02:00:10,380 --> 02:00:14,880
of the member of this group of people

2491
02:00:12,179 --> 02:00:18,359
from Holland that have been preserving

2492
02:00:14,880 --> 02:00:19,980
the the highest hybrids from Neville for

2493
02:00:18,359 --> 02:00:22,920
30 years

2494
02:00:19,979 --> 02:00:25,399
maybe I'll lose them when he left

2495
02:00:22,920 --> 02:00:25,399
Holland

2496
02:00:26,819 --> 02:00:30,599
and

2497
02:00:28,460 --> 02:00:32,880
they said

2498
02:00:30,599 --> 02:00:35,460
many with us and we have been

2499
02:00:32,880 --> 02:00:37,859
introducing for men's like a dream come

2500
02:00:35,460 --> 02:00:42,000
true like to have the parental plans

2501
02:00:37,859 --> 02:00:45,000
that maybe used to develop the the super

2502
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:47,960
hybrid that changed my life and that had

2503
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:50,880
such an impact over me

2504
02:00:47,960 --> 02:00:53,279
and to have them now in my library of

2505
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:55,500
genetics and to be able to combine with

2506
02:00:53,279 --> 02:00:59,460
my sativa because I don't want to

2507
02:00:55,500 --> 02:01:01,859
embrace or try to replicate or something

2508
02:00:59,460 --> 02:01:04,980
that hasn't been already done

2509
02:01:01,859 --> 02:01:08,539
I think with what I can contribute in

2510
02:01:04,979 --> 02:01:12,359
this field is more like to cross

2511
02:01:08,539 --> 02:01:15,060
having his habit from Neville with my

2512
02:01:12,359 --> 02:01:18,059
own different ideas and try to bring it

2513
02:01:15,060 --> 02:01:21,080
to a more sativa Direction and with

2514
02:01:18,060 --> 02:01:21,080
