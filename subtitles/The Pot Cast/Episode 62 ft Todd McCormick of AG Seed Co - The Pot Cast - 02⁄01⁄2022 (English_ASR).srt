joining us today

104
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,858
good afternoon thank you for having me

105
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,720
on

106
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:20,279
my friend first question we'd love to

107
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,160
ask our guests what are you smoking on

108
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:24,779
at the moment

109
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,780
that's funny this is actually a haze

110
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:29,638
combination I have a lot of uh the

111
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:31,739
original older genetics and I really

112
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:33,960
love original Haze and I've kind of

113
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,759
crossed it with everything I have and

114
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:38,638
this is one of those concoctions it's an

115
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:41,100
on Haze which is a an old Neville taste

116
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,500
that I used uh I crossed it against in

117
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,600
our original Haze male and I made

118
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,100
something called on Haze and then I took

119
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,020
that and I've crossed this with

120
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:51,900
something called a super glue which was

121
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:54,180
like an Afghan Northern Lights uh it's

122
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:56,879
really nice it I some ways I was trying

123
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,978
to recreate that old nl5 Haze that we

124
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,860
all used to love so much

125
00:04:58,978 --> 00:05:06,139
uh lovely and like how do you feel this

126
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,139
one compares to the old nl5 Haze

127
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,600
um

128
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:11,519
it's different you know because every

129
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,320
phenotype tweet we pick are different

130
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:15,060
even if the plants are brothers and

131
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:16,978
sister seeds

132
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,780
um there you can still get a lot of

133
00:05:16,978 --> 00:05:21,060
variation between them too you know you

134
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:22,439
can have one brother or one sister who's

135
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,939
kind of overweight another one that's

136
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:25,918
really skinny another super smart

137
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:28,500
another one that can't do math so it's

138
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:31,500
like that with plants and it's similar

139
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:35,220
the original Haze is really the smell

140
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:38,339
and the taste that defines Haze and

141
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:41,639
everything else is like Fruity or gassy

142
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:43,679
uh that leathery kind of Afghan uh

143
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:44,478
sticky skunky smell we call it in North

144
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,579
America

145
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:49,800
is very different from the terpenes that

146
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:53,099
you find in the that Colombian original

147
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:56,400
Haze mixture it's truly unique and I

148
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:58,979
love it so I I really like it however it

149
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:01,739
comes out because I I just favor the

150
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:04,500
scent and the flavor so much

151
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:06,660
yeah lovely lovely and do you find

152
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,000
incorporating some of those more modern

153
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:11,340
genetics brings a little something extra

154
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,399
to the table or it maybe just takes it a

155
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:16,138
little different place so to speak

156
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:18,899
uh well it's kind of the other way

157
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:20,699
around because original Haze is really

158
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:22,258
the first hybrid it was the first bread

159
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:26,100
in the Santa Cruz mountains over here

160
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:27,960
near where I live back in 1969. uh came

161
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,160
along around five six years before skunk

162
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:33,899
one which is what I would call the

163
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:36,300
second uh real hybrid that that was bred

164
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:36,839
and then became kind of famous

165
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,740
um

166
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:43,079
and later on when I first got exposed to

167
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:45,360
Haze it was in the early 90s I visited

168
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:47,758
the Cannabis Castle in 1994 with Jack

169
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,139
Herer I was standing next to Jack when

170
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,180
Ben dronkers

171
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:53,460
um

172
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:56,459
gave the Jack hero variety its name and

173
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:57,779
in christened it um and I was able to

174
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:59,339
smoke some of the northern lights and

175
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:01,918
the haze crosses that were at the castle

176
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:03,538
at that time I also lived in Amsterdam

177
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:06,899
for over a year after that and visited

178
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:08,639
numerous times after this but it it

179
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:10,258
really was different for me because I

180
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,019
had been growing for 10 years at that

181
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:16,560
time but I'd never experienced Haze

182
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:18,180
so it was just it was a wow and I had

183
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,220
never experienced cannabis that gave me

184
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:23,038
like a coffee a morning coffee effect

185
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:25,919
where I felt like invigorated and

186
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:28,439
talkative and engaged I usually a lot of

187
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:31,019
the varieties of cannabis are more like

188
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:33,180
you know you relax you nod out you you

189
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:35,399
know you're in your own little world

190
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:38,340
um but not so much with Haze and I was

191
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:40,258
really intrigued and it took me years I

192
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:41,818
I picked up seeds I grew in Northern

193
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,560
Lights Number Five by Hayes I grew the

194
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:45,300
Jack Herer seeds that

195
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,418
um they gave Jack at the time I wish I

196
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:50,340
still had them and when I lived in

197
00:07:48,418 --> 00:07:52,918
Holland I was able to get a really nice

198
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:55,258
Northern Lights number five clone it was

199
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:58,620
technically the plant that won the 1996

200
00:07:55,259 --> 00:08:00,840
Cannabis Cup as a dirt grown pot but it

201
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,939
has a hydroponically grown pop and it

202
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:05,399
was really dirt grown it was truly

203
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:08,219
exceptional and I loved it and then

204
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:10,138
years and years go by uh 2012 I was in

205
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:14,120
Amsterdam receiving the Cannabis culture

206
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:17,340
award along with Dr Lester

207
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:20,160
Richard Branson of all people and Skunk

208
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:22,019
Man Sam came to the event and I used the

209
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,080
opportunity to ask him and I'd known him

210
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:26,459
since 94. I I actually was very silly

211
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:28,139
and was like hey will you sell me the

212
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:31,918
original hay seeds that you sold Neville

213
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:34,379
and after he got finished laughing at me

214
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:36,418
um he told me that he'd consider it and

215
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:38,038
then he asked me what else I wanted and

216
00:08:36,418 --> 00:08:40,259
I felt like a dummy and I thought I was

217
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:42,360
like you know I don't know what to say

218
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:43,918
he says I think you want all the seeds I

219
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,720
saved for myself and I don't sell to

220
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:48,240
anybody and I was like oh that's exactly

221
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,860
the seeds I was looking for and he said

222
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,899
bring over your best option come over

223
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,120
and uh we'll talk about it so I went

224
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:55,799
over there and it was really a wonderful

225
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,139
experience you know Skunk Man Sam is

226
00:08:55,799 --> 00:09:01,379
credited with saving original Haze

227
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:04,139
um he he his home was next to the

228
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:06,720
gentleman who I only know is the the

229
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:10,379
letter G who was the surfer who first

230
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,959
bred Hayes and they were neighbors and

231
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:15,838
the guy down the street was uh his uh

232
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:18,958
two initials were RL he went on to make

233
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,860
the 1976 original Haze poster that

234
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:24,479
became really famous and um

235
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:25,980
and also uh the other neighbor they had

236
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,860
down the street was the guy that wrote

237
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:30,959
the Psychedelic encyclopedia so it was

238
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:34,500
quite quite the block over there back in

239
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:37,739
the day so like uh but he uh skunked

240
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:41,458
Mansion realized that the original Haze

241
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:43,080
was a unique cultivar and he he saved it

242
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:45,778
by not

243
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,580
um losing it most breeders cross what

244
00:09:45,778 --> 00:09:48,958
they have with what they've got and they

245
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,339
make new varieties and they think

246
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:52,500
they're improving it but they get

247
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:54,300
further and further and further from

248
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,879
that original creation and it's not

249
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:58,919
always for the better unfortunately

250
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:01,139
um so what Sam did which was unique is

251
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:03,299
he kept it through IBL breeding which is

252
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:05,399
only allowing the males and females from

253
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:07,319
that particular variety to breed with

254
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:10,679
each other so that he could capture

255
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:12,899
those genetics and work with them as as

256
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:15,059
the generations passed

257
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:18,539
um he took selected plants and he

258
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:22,559
created varieties like skunk by Haze uh

259
00:10:18,539 --> 00:10:25,079
By Thai uh he calls that one uh

260
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:26,759
um then he has a he has a whole shitload

261
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,620
of in all reality I feel like a Fool's

262
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:31,080
listing them all off but what he did is

263
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:32,839
he gave me the original Hayes seeds and

264
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:35,580
then he gave me all of his favorite

265
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:36,839
outcrosses with it like uh which was

266
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,759
really quite beautiful because think of

267
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:40,380
it like colors it's like getting a

268
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:42,659
primary color and then all his favorite

269
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:45,720
secondary colors and you can go home and

270
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:48,059
do art uh so I was really happy and um

271
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,399
when I realized this I realized that I

272
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:52,500
had brother and sister seeds of the

273
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,778
plants that Neville had and Neville had

274
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,339
two male Haze plants that he used to

275
00:10:54,778 --> 00:10:59,100
breed with everything that's quite

276
00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:00,839
famous he had his hay and Hayes c

277
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,540
um those two plants came originally

278
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:05,459
through Skunk Man Sam and

279
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:06,958
um the seeds that he gave me were

280
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:10,500
essentially brothers and sisters to

281
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:13,199
those males so when I got home I took a

282
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:15,778
cutting I had of uh Neville's Haze and

283
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,700
then back crossed it if you will to a

284
00:11:15,778 --> 00:11:20,100
male original Haze plant because I

285
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:24,240
wanted uh to turn up the haze I wanted

286
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:26,339
more Haze you know uh so I liked it and

287
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,139
um what made Neville's Hayes unique to

288
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:30,180
original Haze is that touch of Northern

289
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:31,860
Lights which was a little bit of Afghan

290
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:34,739
that it had

291
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,480
um because the recipe for for Neville's

292
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,360
Hayes was Northern Lights Number Five by

293
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,339
Hayes uh Hey C I think crossed back to

294
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,560
Haze a which was his other or not

295
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:45,240
crossed back to but crossed out to his

296
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:46,919
other Haze and that was what he called

297
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,019
Neville taze and then he took that plant

298
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:51,120
later on across it with skunk one and

299
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:52,560
called that super silver haze

300
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,139
um but

301
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:56,819
that little bit of Northern Lights uh

302
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:59,939
really is something that I always just

303
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:02,579
loved and um at the time I didn't have

304
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:05,040
original Northern Lights I just had you

305
00:12:02,578 --> 00:12:07,739
know things like OG Kush and super glue

306
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:09,719
which are very reminiscent um in in all

307
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,180
reality so

308
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,800
I you know what I was doing is trying to

309
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:16,500
kind of recreate what I had with with

310
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:18,479
some of these genetics because going

311
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:21,000
back to Skunk Man Sam is like going back

312
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,980
to to the original Source he's the guy

313
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,860
that initially sold the seeds to Neville

314
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:28,079
in the first place and um you know he's

315
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,120
he's really the genius behind skunk one

316
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:32,338
and quite a few other varieties even

317
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:35,519
hemp varieties such as vanilla just

318
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:38,100
really quite incredible yeah I mean the

319
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:41,278
the breadth of his work is is phenomenal

320
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:43,620
and I mean on a personal curiosity how

321
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:44,700
did your Haze back cross end up turning

322
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:47,278
out for you

323
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:50,759
I loved on Hayes I've used it quite a

324
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:52,620
bit um in 2019 I used the mail from that

325
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:54,299
variety that I created

326
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,500
um and I crossed it against most of

327
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:57,419
these

328
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,578
um like clone only cultivars floating

329
00:12:57,419 --> 00:13:01,019
around California because when I was

330
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:02,638
working with it

331
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:04,259
um I was realizing that you know when

332
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,700
you do a breed uh when you're breeding

333
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:08,879
with cannabis a lot of times the female

334
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:11,519
is a more dominant uh on in The Prodigy

335
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:13,860
than the male so I was able to kind of

336
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,620
use my on Haze as almost like a neon

337
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:19,259
filter where you where there's there's

338
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:21,060
no real color neon but uh you because

339
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:22,860
when you take red blue green and you

340
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:24,958
want to make it neon it's still red blue

341
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,639
green and what I wanted to do with a lot

342
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:29,039
of these clone only cultivars such as

343
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,079
green crack and OG Kush and train wreck

344
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:33,360
and others is I wanted to retain that

345
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:35,399
red blue green but I wanted to add a

346
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,500
little bit of spiciness to it which was

347
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:41,879
on Haze and um

348
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:44,159
happy 420 from California and uh I

349
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:46,439
always stop at 420 and then later join

350
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:49,559
and take a little breath and it's like a

351
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,300
little moment of a meditation but

352
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:53,219
um but that's what I did in it and it

353
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:55,740
worked out really well and then

354
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:58,560
you know as twist of fate would have it

355
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:00,120
I you know after Neville passed away I

356
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:02,879
wrote an article called Legacy of a

357
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:05,940
legend and um because he most certainly

358
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:08,458
was a legend and

359
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:11,399
um I got this comment from a guy named

360
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:13,259
Greg and he alluded to like Northern

361
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:16,860
Lights living on through Neville's work

362
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:18,240
and I I knew Greg's name I knew that the

363
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,919
guy that supposedly brought Northern

364
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,778
Lights to Neville was named Craig and

365
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:24,838
that he was from Seattle and we've heard

366
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:28,078
the story and uh I couldn't imagine he

367
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:31,320
was commenting on my my post so I

368
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:33,778
messaged him and said hi and uh tried to

369
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,278
introduce myself and he just said you

370
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:38,578
know Todd I've been following you from

371
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:40,379
since the 90s you know like like I know

372
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:42,179
exactly who you are it says why I'm

373
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:44,399
following your Facebook page and we

374
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:47,519
started talking and and it was really

375
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,500
nice and uh he told me that uh he always

376
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,120
wanted to get original skunk one and he

377
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,500
always wanted original Haze but he

378
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,720
couldn't get him through Neville and

379
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,059
that unfortunately him and Neville had a

380
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,220
falling out I'd say about a year and a

381
00:14:57,059 --> 00:15:01,439
half after they started doing business

382
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,879
you could say uh Neville kind of went

383
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,860
behind his back try to buy some of the

384
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:06,539
seeds from another party and that was

385
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:08,879
that was that and it's interesting

386
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:11,159
because I am a collector of books about

387
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:12,659
cannabis and I have all the old Neville

388
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:14,879
catalogs and there's actually a

389
00:15:12,659 --> 00:15:17,458
paragraph and one of the pre-catalog

390
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:19,500
letters that he wrote saying bad news my

391
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:22,259
Northern Light supplier is cut off and

392
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:24,360
and I was just it just stunned me a

393
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:26,338
little to get it from Greg you know and

394
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,560
what had happened and why that happened

395
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:30,120
why you got cut off and it's just like

396
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:32,638
wow and um

397
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,379
at the time I I sent Greg over the

398
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,480
original Haze and skunk just to be

399
00:15:34,379 --> 00:15:38,759
courteous you know he's a legend he

400
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,980
deserves it let him enjoy these genetics

401
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:43,139
uh for sure

402
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:45,899
um and then I bought a um maybe a year

403
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:48,299
plus later almost two uh we had been

404
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:50,698
staying in contact and none he called me

405
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:53,338
and said hey my uh my sister passed away

406
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:55,679
and I I said wow I'm really sorry Lisa

407
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:57,899
will thank you but not why I'm calling

408
00:15:55,679 --> 00:16:00,179
um I wanted your address want to return

409
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:01,679
the favor my family found some of my old

410
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:04,138
Northern Light seeds and one of her

411
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:06,419
freezers and they're from the early 80s

412
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:08,879
from even before I met Neville and uh

413
00:16:06,419 --> 00:16:10,919
I'm getting germination out of him and

414
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:13,379
I'd like to see what you get so I was

415
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:15,240
like blown away and uh send them my

416
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:17,159
address and he sent me Northern Lights

417
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,079
Number Two he sent me one lights number

418
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:22,740
five he sent me what is called purest

419
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:24,719
Indica which is the Afghan that he got

420
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:28,139
from this gentleman named um Murphy

421
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,120
Stevens and he Murphy Stevens wrote a

422
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:32,940
book called how to grow marijuana indoor

423
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:35,220
is under lights one of the best cannabis

424
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,959
cultivation books and I I literally have

425
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:40,620
every cannabis cultivation book in the

426
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:43,500
70s really quite incredible he explains

427
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:45,179
um like cloning he explained CO2 he

428
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,799
explains

429
00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:49,138
some of the things that have become

430
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:51,899
Mainstay like taking mothers and and

431
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:55,339
doing Selections in in our work of today

432
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:57,778
but was kind of unheard of back then and

433
00:16:55,339 --> 00:17:00,600
they were friends because of this under

434
00:16:57,778 --> 00:17:02,039
indoor Sun Shop it was called uh and

435
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,939
they he'd go in there and buy equipment

436
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:07,438
and I guess uh Steve Murphy uh Murphy

437
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:08,519
Stevens was his pen name but his real

438
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,160
name was the other way around Steve

439
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:13,798
Murphy gave Greg some of these Afghan

440
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:18,000
seeds gave him four of them in the 70s

441
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:20,759
and that is what became uh the Northern

442
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,099
Lights lines and then uh so what he did

443
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:25,259
is he you know Greg f2d them you know

444
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:26,759
which would be to mix the brothers and

445
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:28,558
sister scenes together and made a whole

446
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:30,960
bunch of them and he called that purist

447
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:33,000
Indica because that was the one he got

448
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,220
from Murphy Stevens and then what he

449
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,440
started to do is cross outcross it to

450
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:40,200
other Afghans that he got from Oregon

451
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,058
California and then more tropical plants

452
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,400
and I asked him what the numbers

453
00:17:42,058 --> 00:17:47,099
represented when he sent them to Neville

454
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:51,538
and he said the numbers were one through

455
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:53,899
like 11 or 12 were based on how close

456
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:57,419
they were to that purist Indica you know

457
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:59,700
one uh being like pierced Indica would

458
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:01,440
more be like zero because if you're

459
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,779
counting it would be like oh comes first

460
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,820
periodica first hybrid is number one

461
00:18:03,779 --> 00:18:08,099
second hybrid is number two third fourth

462
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:11,038
and so on like number five he told me

463
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:13,740
was actually it crossed with what at the

464
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:15,359
time they thought was a Hawaiian but he

465
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:18,960
has always believed was a northern

466
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:20,699
Mexican variety and uh it was a little

467
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,360
more tropical so each of the plant

468
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:26,220
numbers became more tropical and truly

469
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:29,399
fascinating I mean from my perspective

470
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:31,679
uh as a historian and then just an

471
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:34,200
overall cannabis geek you know I started

472
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,179
growing in 1984 and I was reading High

473
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:39,240
Times back then like we all were and uh

474
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:40,620
and it I don't know it just like a

475
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,480
little boy's dream to now be in

476
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:44,699
communication with this guy and you know

477
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,759
he's in his 70s a retired Marine he's

478
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:50,100
you know just incredible and so I

479
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:51,538
started growing them out and I had these

480
00:18:50,099 --> 00:18:53,939
old books and I have these old photos

481
00:18:51,538 --> 00:18:56,579
and later on I'll send you some pictures

482
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:59,279
it's truly remarkable because

483
00:18:56,579 --> 00:19:02,339
it looks exactly like the first page in

484
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:05,038
America Murphy Stevens book uh it just

485
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:06,779
blows blew my mind and um so it's been

486
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:09,240
really wild to now have these original

487
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:10,918
Northern Lights and now I'm starting to

488
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,440
play with those and the original Haze

489
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:15,538
and the original skunk and it's quite

490
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,360
the palette uh if you were thinking of

491
00:19:15,538 --> 00:19:20,220
it like like art it's it's quite the

492
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:22,979
color palette to start with and I

493
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:25,500
actually have more of these original

494
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:28,558
colors than even was given to Neville at

495
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:30,480
the time because Neville never received

496
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:32,579
all of Skunk Man Sam's favorite

497
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,798
outcrosses with Hayes

498
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:37,259
um he never received a batch of original

499
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:39,418
hay seeds he only got a couple males so

500
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:42,720
he was unable to do what I did which was

501
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:43,919
reproduce as an F2 or an IBL original

502
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,380
Haze

503
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,660
um and basically unlock it and share the

504
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:51,120
genetics he had to actually use them as

505
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:53,160
hybrids which uh started appearing in

506
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:54,899
the the Holland seed bank catalog in

507
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:57,779
1988

508
00:19:54,900 --> 00:20:00,419
um prior to 88 to 85 six seven there's

509
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:02,160
not even the word Haze mentioned in any

510
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:04,080
of those catalogs

511
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,179
um and there's not even the hey the word

512
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:08,339
Haze isn't even mentioned in the super

513
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:11,700
long High Times article that was uh

514
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:13,980
published in March of 87

515
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,538
um because I came to the conclusion that

516
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:18,058
Neville just didn't have Haze at the

517
00:20:15,538 --> 00:20:20,179
time and Greg told me that too and then

518
00:20:18,058 --> 00:20:23,579
I've heard it from other people as well

519
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:25,440
but I think it's a real opportunity I

520
00:20:23,579 --> 00:20:29,519
mean there's been a lot of

521
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:32,340
you know reading uh done in the past 30

522
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:34,440
years plus since the 80s and

523
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:36,839
unfortunately I don't think a lot of it

524
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:40,019
was for the best I think that a lot of

525
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:43,439
people were breeding for uh for for

526
00:20:40,019 --> 00:20:46,200
yields and and and for quickness rather

527
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,480
than overall quality and terpenes and

528
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:51,779
unfortunately I think we

529
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:54,360
um somewhat lost our way with some of

530
00:20:51,779 --> 00:20:56,579
these older varieties and now that I

531
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:58,139
have thick original skunk one and

532
00:20:56,579 --> 00:21:03,000
original Haze and original Northern

533
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:04,919
Lights uh in various forms I am it's

534
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,538
like a time machine to me because I was

535
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:08,340
growing back in the 80s and now to have

536
00:21:06,538 --> 00:21:10,740
to be able to grow these again it's just

537
00:21:08,339 --> 00:21:13,918
truly quite remarkable

538
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:16,440
sorry that was so long-winded uh that

539
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,360
was incredible and I uh I already have

540
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,860
that feeling in the back of my neck I'm

541
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:22,558
like this is gonna be a good one I can

542
00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:24,719
tell really yeah a myriad of different

543
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:27,298
Avenues we could choose to go in after

544
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,159
you gave me so many good little leads I

545
00:21:27,298 --> 00:21:32,339
could pull on I guess something I wanted

546
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:34,559
to discuss is this topic of Neville

547
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:36,000
being a bit disliked it's an interesting

548
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:37,440
one because I've spoken to a lot of

549
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,500
people who know him and the most

550
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:43,440
consistent thing I hear is he was a bit

551
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:46,019
disliked that he was a complex man and

552
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,000
although undeniably he did some of the

553
00:21:46,019 --> 00:21:50,279
best breeding we've ever seen he also

554
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,259
burnt a lot of bridges and I guess my

555
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:53,819
question is do you feel like in a case

556
00:21:52,259 --> 00:21:55,379
like Neville he's sort of one of those

557
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:57,480
people where you've got to separate the

558
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:59,940
art from the artist and did you ever

559
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:02,099
have any personal interactions with him

560
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:03,779
that's a beautiful way to put it

561
00:22:02,099 --> 00:22:06,899
um I did have interactions with Neville

562
00:22:03,779 --> 00:22:08,879
he was always nice to me when I met him

563
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:13,679
um I played chess with him once uh we

564
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:16,440
smoked Haze um I enjoyed it I I you know

565
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:19,320
I grew up around drugs as a kid I was a

566
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:21,480
little biker kid and um my cousin Kathy

567
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:23,399
died from a heroin overdose way back in

568
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:26,220
the early 90s before I ever met Neville

569
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:30,298
and I grew up around people that

570
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:33,480
unfortunately uh did abuse alcohol and

571
00:22:30,298 --> 00:22:35,158
were flirting with heroin and

572
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,839
um you know when when you grow up around

573
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:39,419
it as a little kid you kind of feel it

574
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:41,639
and you know I'm not I'm I I don't do

575
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:44,640
hard drugs I don't drink I smoke hash I

576
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:47,340
smoke grass uh kind of square in a way

577
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,020
um but you know other than cannabis we

578
00:22:47,339 --> 00:22:51,779
didn't have what we get high on in

579
00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:55,079
common and unfortunately

580
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:56,819
you know Neville you know what I what I

581
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:58,079
respect about Neville and I'd like to

582
00:22:56,819 --> 00:23:00,538
say up front is when you read that

583
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:02,460
article back in 1987 he's not a victim

584
00:23:00,538 --> 00:23:04,379
he's never been a victim of his own

585
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:06,840
circumstance he doesn't portray himself

586
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:09,600
as a victim he deals with his addiction

587
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:11,639
issues like an adult and you know he's

588
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:13,678
remorseful for him he's realistic about

589
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,780
trying to struggle to deal with it I

590
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,298
have nothing but empathy for someone

591
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:20,279
who's dealing with alcohol uh and and

592
00:23:18,298 --> 00:23:22,079
drug addiction it's like it's like a

593
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:24,960
disease I get people say well it's a

594
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:26,879
it's a consensual disease you you smoke

595
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,759
the stuff you drink the stuff this is

596
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,220
your fault but chemically it gets a

597
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:34,019
little deeper than that and

598
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:36,720
unfortunately I believe that that

599
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:38,879
you know his substance abuse absolutely

600
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,860
compromised his personal relationships

601
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,720
with a lot of good people and

602
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:44,759
unfortunately when I was writing Legacy

603
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,140
of the legend I know a lot of people

604
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:48,119
that knew Neville that was in business

605
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:50,340
with Neville that like really close to

606
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:53,399
novel none of them wanted to say a damn

607
00:23:50,339 --> 00:23:55,619
thing and uh and unfortunate you know

608
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:57,360
because you know it's is it so much

609
00:23:55,619 --> 00:23:59,699
cheaper at the bridges or it was his

610
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:02,339
addictions that caused him to burn the

611
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:04,140
bridges I mean you you know but he did

612
00:24:02,339 --> 00:24:06,959
burn Bridges I I've interviewed Skunk

613
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:08,820
Man Sam I've interviewed Greg uh and and

614
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,440
they told similar stories around the

615
00:24:08,819 --> 00:24:12,658
same time about how Neville ripped them

616
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,460
off knocked off their seeds went behind

617
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:17,940
their back it killed their relationships

618
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:19,980
with them and um you know Greg and Sam

619
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:22,019
don't know each other so so they're not

620
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:23,880
there's they they didn't meet until

621
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:25,319
recently when I gave each other their

622
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,820
numbers and said hey you guys you know

623
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:29,339
they're both in your 70s you're both

624
00:24:26,819 --> 00:24:31,439
Legends you should talk to each other uh

625
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:33,839
but up until now they never had

626
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,960
communication so it's interesting for me

627
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:39,839
a journalist to hear these unedited you

628
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,298
know versions of of events from the

629
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:45,359
people who who were really in in touch

630
00:24:42,298 --> 00:24:49,740
and have the genetics now and and had

631
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:51,599
the genetics then and um you know

632
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:54,779
and then you know and as far as Neville

633
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:56,519
I and I don't mean to to bash uh you

634
00:24:54,779 --> 00:24:59,460
know has a someone who grew up in the

635
00:24:56,519 --> 00:25:01,798
80s he was a hero to me in all reality

636
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:04,038
like like a rock star Led Zeppelin there

637
00:25:01,798 --> 00:25:06,298
was there was the Holland feed bank and

638
00:25:04,038 --> 00:25:07,798
unfortunately though the more you get

639
00:25:06,298 --> 00:25:10,558
into the history of it you know like

640
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:13,319
Neville only picked up a Mel Frank row

641
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:16,139
book in 1981. uh he was inspired by it

642
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:19,200
uh and he started the the Holland seed

643
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:20,640
bank 84. uh initially started selling

644
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,798
seeds he was collecting from Dutch

645
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,360
coffee shops that he hadn't grown and he

646
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:26,278
literally had a disclaimer saying I

647
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:28,199
can't vouch for these I didn't make them

648
00:25:26,278 --> 00:25:29,159
I think he was selling for like 25 cents

649
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,960
each

650
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:33,360
um and His World changed when he met

651
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:36,538
Skunk Man Sam and got that whole catalog

652
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:39,058
of really worked California genetics um

653
00:25:36,538 --> 00:25:42,058
California Orange skunk one Hindu Kush

654
00:25:39,058 --> 00:25:44,819
Afghani one turban poison none of those

655
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:47,158
never never had anything to do with and

656
00:25:44,819 --> 00:25:48,839
um and realistically at the time with

657
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:50,640
the drug war and everything you know a

658
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:52,678
lot of people weren't really stepping up

659
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:57,360
to say oh yeah that's me that I did that

660
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:59,159
and uh he he begot these genetics 1984

661
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:01,979
1985

662
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:04,320
and kind of took credit for the work of

663
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:06,058
many people that came before him and I

664
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:09,058
don't believe now in today's cannabis

665
00:26:06,058 --> 00:26:10,980
economy or or or community that if

666
00:26:09,058 --> 00:26:12,599
somebody was growing wheat for two or

667
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:15,298
three or four years even let's give them

668
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:18,839
81 which I understand he wasn't growing

669
00:26:15,298 --> 00:26:21,058
in 81 82 or 83. he did grow in 84

670
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:23,220
outside of his apartment before he got

671
00:26:21,058 --> 00:26:25,200
the Cannabis Castle uh and it didn't

672
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:27,419
work out it was Outdoors it you know

673
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,759
that the winner came it was just a in

674
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:31,500
the backyard type of thing and it wasn't

675
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:33,000
until he moved into the castle that they

676
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,319
started growing indoors and he started

677
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,880
getting help from people that went to

678
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:37,859
the university

679
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:40,320
um so really he had no experience

680
00:26:37,859 --> 00:26:41,879
breathing he was a heroin addict who was

681
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:43,980
trying to get off heroin got a loan from

682
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:46,980
the government started selling seeds

683
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:49,079
bought seeds that were really good and

684
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:52,798
started mixing them together and I don't

685
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:54,418
want to say I mean it's like these DJs

686
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:55,859
that take really good music from One

687
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:57,778
artist and really good music from

688
00:26:55,859 --> 00:26:59,099
another artist and mash it together and

689
00:26:57,778 --> 00:27:01,200
it sounds great on the dance floor but

690
00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:03,359
they're not musicians man they can't

691
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,100
they they can't write Love Me Do they

692
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:07,139
they're not making these beats they

693
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:09,480
they're just taking somebody else's work

694
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:11,340
and jingling it together and and their

695
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,960
little rock stars on their own Merit but

696
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:15,240
on their own they're really not

697
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,220
musicians and and I and I hate to say

698
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,538
this but I don't see Neville as much of

699
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:20,700
a breeder

700
00:27:18,538 --> 00:27:23,240
um because he was handed such fantastic

701
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:26,640
varieties and he crossed them together

702
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:29,120
mainly because he wasn't paying the

703
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,799
people for their seeds anymore so

704
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:34,079
unfortunately we saw things like skunk

705
00:27:31,798 --> 00:27:35,759
number two and and him selling a

706
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:37,678
half-price seeds from and then literally

707
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:41,220
in the catalog it says you know there

708
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:43,620
was like a an unexpected pollination and

709
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:45,900
I'm selling these at half price and you

710
00:27:43,619 --> 00:27:47,339
know if if Mr Jack Daniels went to a

711
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:49,559
Distillery and sold them his number

712
00:27:47,339 --> 00:27:52,199
Seven whiskey recipe and then you know a

713
00:27:49,558 --> 00:27:54,240
year or so The Distillery realized you

714
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:56,159
know what don't need Jack anymore we can

715
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,380
knock off this whiskey recipe and send

716
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,760
it out the door tell him to beat feet I

717
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:01,559
don't think it would be a good energy

718
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:03,119
and that's exactly what Neville did to

719
00:28:01,558 --> 00:28:07,918
Greg it's exactly what he did this on

720
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:10,139
plant Sam so unfortunately yeah things

721
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,179
went the way they did and and then when

722
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:14,640
you get into the the Handover of the

723
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:17,940
Holland seed bank to Scentsy seeds it

724
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,860
was continued in all reality I mean you

725
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:21,419
know initially when Ben bought the

726
00:28:19,859 --> 00:28:24,240
Holland seed bank he attempted to

727
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:28,380
trademark all of the super skunk skunk

728
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:30,000
one Haze names uh and sent cease and

729
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:32,760
desist letters to other seed companies

730
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:37,079
telling them you can't use my names

731
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:39,778
and uh Skunk Man Sam got a letter and

732
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:41,579
unfortunately for Ben he had already

733
00:28:39,778 --> 00:28:43,919
registered these varieties with the

734
00:28:41,579 --> 00:28:47,939
plant registry and technically was the

735
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:50,520
legal breeder of them in the EU and sent

736
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:52,259
Ben a letter saying no you don't have

737
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:54,658
the right you can use the name skunk one

738
00:28:52,259 --> 00:28:56,640
on a lighter or on a t-shirt but as it

739
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:58,559
comes to cannabis I own that and if you

740
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,620
try to stop other people from using a

741
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:04,379
name that I came up with in the 70s I

742
00:29:01,619 --> 00:29:07,199
will go into court and block you so Ben

743
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:10,620
lost the ability to uh basically

744
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:13,798
trademark and register these these names

745
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:16,079
that are now very much public domain you

746
00:29:13,798 --> 00:29:18,599
know as as were the genetics in all

747
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:21,538
reality because Skunk Man Sam had been

748
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:22,678
selling seeds by the kilo long before he

749
00:29:21,538 --> 00:29:26,579
met Neville

750
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:28,620
uh and um plenty of people had skunk one

751
00:29:26,579 --> 00:29:31,019
seeds and or you know California Orange

752
00:29:28,619 --> 00:29:33,178
and you know originally it was Mel Frank

753
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:36,418
who made Durban Poison and Afghan number

754
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:39,298
one so it was really a lot of other

755
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:41,759
people you know that that really were

756
00:29:39,298 --> 00:29:43,798
the reason why the the Holland seed bank

757
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:46,798
had such great varieties in the first

758
00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:48,240
place you know uh in a really in one of

759
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:50,298
his last interviews if not his last

760
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:54,120
interview Neville is in mishka's book

761
00:29:50,298 --> 00:29:56,398
and uh he talks about how he was never

762
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:59,519
able to make anything worth anything

763
00:29:56,398 --> 00:30:01,859
from Land race varieties of cannabis and

764
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:05,058
he gives credit to the Breeders who came

765
00:30:01,859 --> 00:30:07,740
before him who took things like Afghan

766
00:30:05,058 --> 00:30:10,379
you know Colombian gold and Acapulco

767
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:12,419
Gold and turned it into skunk one and

768
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:15,240
you know Colombian genetics and turned

769
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:17,778
it into Haze and in the first place and

770
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:20,700
I honestly don't know how spectacular

771
00:30:17,778 --> 00:30:23,579
the Holland seed bank would have been if

772
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:26,220
he hadn't gotten those American genetics

773
00:30:23,579 --> 00:30:28,500
from Sam and Greg and others through the

774
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:30,899
80s on reality if he was just left to

775
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:32,880
the Jamaican Colombians and Thai seeds

776
00:30:30,898 --> 00:30:35,459
coming in through the coffee shops it

777
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:38,940
might have been a very different story

778
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:40,380
yeah very very intriguing and very

779
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:42,179
interesting to hear sort of a more

780
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:45,179
inside take on it all because I think

781
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:47,640
that was I wouldn't say a pet peeve but

782
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:49,500
something which I always felt uneasy

783
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,120
about was how yeah people always said oh

784
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,980
you know Neville's had a shady pass but

785
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:54,599
no one would ever say to me what so it's

786
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:56,819
good to hear like you know this is some

787
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:58,439
of what it boiled down to and I guess

788
00:30:56,819 --> 00:31:02,099
the natural question which comes to mind

789
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:04,620
for me is in my mind I always thought a

790
00:31:02,099 --> 00:31:07,859
lot of those raw bass genetics never

791
00:31:04,619 --> 00:31:10,079
used to make the crosses came from like

792
00:31:07,859 --> 00:31:11,939
one of those mythical land race trips he

793
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:13,859
did but are you sort of more of the

794
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:15,360
opinion that it was more given to him

795
00:31:13,859 --> 00:31:17,398
for the most part

796
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:19,619
well Northern Lights was sent to him as

797
00:31:17,398 --> 00:31:22,259
seeds one through eleven I believe one

798
00:31:19,619 --> 00:31:24,058
through twelve and um and he made some

799
00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:25,679
of them very famous the number five he

800
00:31:24,058 --> 00:31:28,019
used the number six he used the number

801
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:30,059
two he used extensively

802
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:33,179
um Greg did send tell me that he never

803
00:31:30,058 --> 00:31:35,879
sent Neville the purest Indica the the

804
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:37,440
zero if you will the original egg of

805
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,700
Northern Lights because he didn't want

806
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,558
Neville to have

807
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,778
something better than what he had he

808
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:45,839
sent Neville to hybrids

809
00:31:42,778 --> 00:31:47,579
um so you know I think that growers in

810
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:49,619
some ways have been wise to the fact

811
00:31:47,579 --> 00:31:51,418
that they're going to get burned head to

812
00:31:49,619 --> 00:31:53,759
a degree and uh they've wanted to

813
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:56,640
protect their IP in various ways and

814
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:58,859
Simon Schmidt who's Dutch who knows uh

815
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,620
serious seeds he's a good friend of mine

816
00:31:58,859 --> 00:32:03,599
absolute hero of mine really

817
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:04,918
um but when he first started serious

818
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:06,000
seeds he only started with three

819
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:09,179
varieties

820
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,460
um AK-47 chronic and Cali mist and they

821
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:13,380
were all f1s and he held the parent

822
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:15,480
plants to each of those three varieties

823
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:17,520
and he could make those seeds forever

824
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,899
and ever and ever and if somebody bought

825
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,599
those seeds and then crossed them

826
00:32:18,898 --> 00:32:24,298
together or outcross them now you've got

827
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:26,819
something different and um and because

828
00:32:24,298 --> 00:32:29,398
of that you would always go back for

829
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:31,619
that F1 Cali mist from serious seeds

830
00:32:29,398 --> 00:32:34,139
because it was exactly what it was last

831
00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:36,298
time you bought the seeds and that was a

832
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:38,759
way that he protected his intellectual

833
00:32:36,298 --> 00:32:42,298
property if you will nobody could really

834
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:45,359
make an F1 of Cali Mist but Simon

835
00:32:42,298 --> 00:32:47,579
um so you know as this is when you look

836
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:49,199
at it that way uh that was happening

837
00:32:47,579 --> 00:32:50,639
even with Greg that's why Greg didn't

838
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,679
send him the original purist Indica

839
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:55,200
that's why Skunk Man Sam didn't give

840
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:57,899
that's why that's why Neville never got

841
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,640
original AC is because he didn't want

842
00:32:57,898 --> 00:33:01,918
him to be able to have two of them and

843
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:03,960
and make seeds of them he he wanted to

844
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,640
kind of keep control of the variety a

845
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:08,700
little bit because

846
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:10,559
you know I get it uh and you know in all

847
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:12,960
reality Neville had to wait for the haze

848
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:16,079
he didn't get it or even offered to him

849
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:18,960
in 85 or 84 when he first bought the

850
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:22,079
seeds from from Sand but also there

851
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,600
wasn't much desire for them because here

852
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:27,000
there are these long flowering you know

853
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:29,879
not even great yielding comparatively

854
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,278
you know the the Dutch and indoor

855
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:34,799
Growers were looking for quick flowering

856
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:37,259
short plants that yielded that heavy

857
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:39,418
resin that made indoor growing practical

858
00:33:37,259 --> 00:33:41,759
and Haze sure the hell didn't make

859
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:44,399
indoor growing practical it was quite

860
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:46,859
the opposite so not there wasn't really

861
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:50,398
a demand for them even when I was living

862
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:52,918
there in 1996 people I mean Cali missed

863
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:55,619
sure nl5a is sure but were people

864
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:57,659
growing original Haze no and very few

865
00:33:55,619 --> 00:34:00,000
people were actually breeding with it

866
00:33:57,659 --> 00:34:03,480
because not that many people actually

867
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,298
had you know an interest in dealing with

868
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:09,300
these long flowering finicky plants and

869
00:34:06,298 --> 00:34:10,858
uh in 1996 I was living in Amsterdam and

870
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,679
I was working at positronics which is

871
00:34:10,858 --> 00:34:16,739
owned by Bernard and the gentleman named

872
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,960
old Ed who originally taught uh Bernard

873
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:21,898
how to grow seedless cannabis in the 70s

874
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,639
was over there and um he and I worked

875
00:34:21,898 --> 00:34:25,980
together for a year growing out various

876
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:28,619
varieties of ponzi's genetics and

877
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:31,139
unfortunately you know after 10 years of

878
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:33,539
you know politely I'll say haphazard

879
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:36,599
breeding or breeding that wasn't for

880
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:39,539
let's say overall potency or or flavor

881
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:43,320
or scent but instead quickness and yield

882
00:34:39,539 --> 00:34:44,699
a lot of them didn't have that they

883
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,500
weren't that they were kind of watered

884
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:49,138
down or muddied up would be a polite way

885
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:52,320
to say it and uh what me and Ed were

886
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:54,599
trying to do was make selections and

887
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,460
then try to make some f1s that could

888
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:59,280
kind of bring back some hybrid figure in

889
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:02,400
uniformity and consistency to the seeds

890
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:05,099
that posi was selling and

891
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,019
you know I I part of what I wanted to do

892
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:10,079
when I started my seed company was jump

893
00:35:07,019 --> 00:35:12,059
a way back and get seeds directly from

894
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:15,060
Skunk Man Sam and Skip Neville skip

895
00:35:12,059 --> 00:35:15,719
Bernard skip the whole Dutch scene you

896
00:35:15,059 --> 00:35:17,900
know

897
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:20,699
um because

898
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:22,440
nothing against I mean I got nothing but

899
00:35:20,699 --> 00:35:24,899
love and respect for a lot of my my

900
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:27,119
friends in Holland but but realistically

901
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:29,099
the the purpose of what they were making

902
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,140
seeds for was not necessarily the

903
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:32,940
purpose of what the California people

904
00:35:31,139 --> 00:35:35,578
who were breeding which was quality over

905
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:37,200
quantity and everything else then they

906
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:41,220
got out there and it was about you know

907
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:42,480
quantity quickness and quality kind of

908
00:35:41,219 --> 00:35:44,639
went down and I think a lot of people

909
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,440
that were visiting the Netherlands

910
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:48,900
coffee shop scene through the 90s would

911
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:51,300
attest that the the Cannabis wasn't

912
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:54,300
getting better over the years it was

913
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:57,780
kind of getting more and more uh

914
00:35:54,300 --> 00:36:01,980
homogeneous and uh and and lackluster

915
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:04,019
and just very similar to each other and

916
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:06,420
a lot of that was because of a lot of

917
00:36:04,019 --> 00:36:09,300
inbreeding and uh

918
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:11,460
you know I hopefully what I'm doing now

919
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:13,440
is kind of taking it back to the heart

920
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:15,599
of it and going for the quality and

921
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,780
going for those terpenes and going for

922
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:22,140
that scent and that taste over the

923
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:24,300
potency even because like I I feel that

924
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:26,460
if you have a good joint like this one

925
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:28,680
is getting me totally stoned a hard time

926
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:30,420
getting through it but uh if you have a

927
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:32,219
good joint even if it's not that potent

928
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:33,900
you'll go back and roll a second or if

929
00:36:32,219 --> 00:36:35,459
it's good hash you'll go back and and

930
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,980
pack another dab

931
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:39,659
um but if it's not that good it doesn't

932
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:41,579
matter how potent it is

933
00:36:39,659 --> 00:36:43,019
you know it's like when you drink you

934
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:44,700
know you don't drink straight alcohol to

935
00:36:43,019 --> 00:36:46,920
get drunk you kind of like the nuances

936
00:36:44,699 --> 00:36:49,019
of the wine or the beer or whatever it

937
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:51,480
is you're drinking so I think that's the

938
00:36:49,019 --> 00:36:53,940
same with cannabis and I think as as we

939
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:56,579
get back into that quality over quantity

940
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:58,858
and quickness we're gonna see a lot

941
00:36:56,579 --> 00:37:01,619
better cannabis hitting the scene and

942
00:36:58,858 --> 00:37:04,858
unfortunately because of like that quick

943
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:06,960
mat you know mindset all the varieties

944
00:37:04,858 --> 00:37:08,880
that were 10 weeks and you know 10 to 16

945
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,579
weeks really don't get grown by people

946
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,440
anymore but they're still around and

947
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:15,960
think of it like a box of crayons that

948
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,780
have 16 crayons we're only playing with

949
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:22,260
the first 10 crayons there's crayons

950
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:24,119
number 11 12 13 14 15 and 16 there and

951
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:26,640
people aren't even doing art with them

952
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:28,440
yet and and that's in a sense why I'm

953
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:30,779
really excited to be bringing the

954
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,400
original Haze genetics back and and kind

955
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:34,619
of moving towards these equatorial

956
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,480
varieties that used to be shunned

957
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:38,760
because of bag of Peel and growth

958
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,380
characteristics but were really great I

959
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:43,200
mean once you started smoking it you'd

960
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:44,820
love it you know but would you get past

961
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:47,338
the bag appeal

962
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:49,800
to get your joint rolled up and a lot of

963
00:37:47,338 --> 00:37:52,019
people don't they they they eat with

964
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:54,300
their eyes rather than with their taste

965
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:56,099
buds and I think that that's going to

966
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:58,560
change as we move towards concentrates

967
00:37:56,099 --> 00:38:00,240
and extracts and people are doing dabs

968
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:02,699
and you're feeling the terpenes and

969
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:05,578
feeling the the Synergy of cannabinoids

970
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:07,259
if you will and I I think people will

971
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:10,260
start buying cannabis based on how it

972
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:12,119
makes them feel over how it looks

973
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:15,300
in a bag

974
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:17,460
yeah I I certainly hope so myself and

975
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:19,140
you know so many Avenues we could go off

976
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,940
onto with that one I guess the first

977
00:38:19,139 --> 00:38:23,159
thing I wanted to quickly run by you was

978
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:24,838
you mentioned this idea of Growers

979
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:26,399
protecting their intellectual property

980
00:38:24,838 --> 00:38:27,900
and I think that's still a relevant

981
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,019
discussion in today's market

982
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:33,960
specifically we hear some breeders not

983
00:38:31,019 --> 00:38:36,420
many but some who are quite vocal about

984
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,740
even if you buy their seeds you still

985
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:39,119
need to ask them if you're going to

986
00:38:37,739 --> 00:38:41,759
breed with it or something to that

987
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,140
effect whereas a good number of breeders

988
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,339
take the opposite point of view and

989
00:38:43,139 --> 00:38:46,319
they're like man if you bought them

990
00:38:44,338 --> 00:38:47,880
they're yours where do you stand on that

991
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,980
issue

992
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,838
some strange I stand on both sides of

993
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:54,900
the fence I completely I call it public

994
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:57,119
domain genetics nobody invented cannabis

995
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:59,160
I wouldn't have this wonderful joint of

996
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:01,140
haze if it wasn't for you know some guy

997
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:03,838
named G that was playing with it a year

998
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:05,699
before I was born so I'm grateful for

999
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:07,739
the you know soldiers of the Giants I

1000
00:39:05,699 --> 00:39:10,319
stand upon and I try to give credit

1001
00:39:07,739 --> 00:39:11,399
where credits do it at every corner of

1002
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,940
this

1003
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,858
um

1004
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:15,838
but that said

1005
00:39:13,858 --> 00:39:18,719
um you know when somebody like Simon you

1006
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:20,400
use serious seeds as an example uh wants

1007
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:23,159
to put a company together and put out a

1008
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,660
product like Cali Mr AK or chronic

1009
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:26,399
um I think they should have a right to

1010
00:39:24,659 --> 00:39:29,039
be able to try to make something unique

1011
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:31,858
and it and by doing it the way Simon did

1012
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:33,960
it which was so intelligent it gives his

1013
00:39:31,858 --> 00:39:36,239
customers a reason to go back and get

1014
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:39,179
those F1 seeds from him because they

1015
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:40,559
know why they they have a reason to

1016
00:39:39,179 --> 00:39:42,659
um because they know it's authentic and

1017
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:44,940
he's the only one that held the parents

1018
00:39:42,659 --> 00:39:48,358
um now the way it works in plant

1019
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:50,880
breeding uh if you buy seeds and you

1020
00:39:48,358 --> 00:39:55,139
outcross with them the prodigies your

1021
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:57,420
creation okay but uh you know to take

1022
00:39:55,139 --> 00:40:00,118
somebody's seeds and just mix them

1023
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:03,420
together and end up and to like you know

1024
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:06,960
do what so many did which is to F2 them

1025
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:09,800
without permission is not so cool I I

1026
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:12,960
had original haze from 2012 till 2019

1027
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:15,119
and I was growing it and playing with it

1028
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,800
and it wasn't until I started my seed

1029
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:19,440
company that I called up Skunk Man Sam

1030
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:23,099
and formally asked his permission to

1031
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:25,260
make seeds of it and uh you know within

1032
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:28,260
his good graces I did he even consulted

1033
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:30,839
on how he recommended I reproduce those

1034
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:33,240
original seeds that he gave me so that I

1035
00:40:30,838 --> 00:40:35,119
would get the best you know quality out

1036
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:38,279
of The Prodigy and have the most

1037
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:40,619
variability in selection and I

1038
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:42,240
appreciated that and he he did too and

1039
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:45,300
when I got the original Northern Light

1040
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:48,118
seeds from Greg I again I asked his

1041
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:49,920
permission and um and not only did he

1042
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:52,320
give me his permission he gave me his

1043
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,300
encouragement because his goal has been

1044
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:57,420
to share the genetics with people and

1045
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:59,400
you know to spread the medicine and uh

1046
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:01,200
and it's beautiful I mean a lot of

1047
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:04,440
people don't know Skunk Man Sam's goal

1048
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:06,179
in 1970s was to create a true beating or

1049
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:09,059
a relatively true breeding variety

1050
00:41:06,179 --> 00:41:11,338
because he was an acid-eating hippie and

1051
00:41:09,059 --> 00:41:13,619
he wanted his friends to be able to get

1052
00:41:11,338 --> 00:41:15,119
the seeds and to be able to mix them

1053
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:17,160
together the brothers and sisters

1054
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:19,920
together and to have the Prodigy come

1055
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:21,838
out relatively close to the parents and

1056
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,519
normally that doesn't happen like when

1057
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:25,500
you mix quality related genetics

1058
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:28,320
together you get like a dog's breakfast

1059
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:30,420
you get you know a lot of variation the

1060
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,920
haze has got a lot of variation in its

1061
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:34,019
genetics it's not relatively true

1062
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:37,200
breeding at all it's the opposite of

1063
00:41:34,019 --> 00:41:39,358
skunk one and when I asked man Sam you

1064
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:41,879
know why how did you do that he said I

1065
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:44,519
didn't nature did he said I just had to

1066
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:46,280
cross together enough plants to find the

1067
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:49,739
ones that when I crossed them together

1068
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:52,140
they had the effect of being able to be

1069
00:41:49,739 --> 00:41:54,000
a relatively true breeding plant and I

1070
00:41:52,139 --> 00:41:56,279
was just like wow and it kind of went to

1071
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,500
show how humble he was there's a great

1072
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:02,579
article that we republi in our magazine

1073
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:05,460
grow called Sun soil seeds in Seoul and

1074
00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:08,579
he wrote it for what was called blotter

1075
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:10,320
magazine which was an LSD magazine that

1076
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:12,359
was published by the gentleman who would

1077
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:14,519
go on to publish the Psychedelic

1078
00:42:12,358 --> 00:42:16,500
encyclopedia and he wrote this really

1079
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:18,659
long breakdown of how people can learn

1080
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:20,280
how to breed and how we created things

1081
00:42:18,659 --> 00:42:21,000
like skunk one

1082
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,859
um

1083
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,480
and he was trying to share the

1084
00:42:22,858 --> 00:42:26,098
information I mean anybody who's done a

1085
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,139
lot of acid would understand that kind

1086
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:30,900
of like feeling the Oneness with uh all

1087
00:42:28,139 --> 00:42:32,819
of humanity and that was his goal his

1088
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:35,400
goal was to turn skunk one into this

1089
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:37,320
massive public domain genetic that would

1090
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:39,780
only create good cannabis for the rest

1091
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:42,838
of the world once they got the seeds and

1092
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:45,300
that's why skunk one has been bred and

1093
00:42:42,838 --> 00:42:47,219
into everything because it adds this

1094
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:49,500
consistency and uniform to practically

1095
00:42:47,219 --> 00:42:53,219
everything that you cross it with uh

1096
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:53,880
it's Unique in the Cannabis Kingdom and

1097
00:42:53,219 --> 00:42:56,578
um

1098
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:58,318
yeah that's in a way why it became so

1099
00:42:56,579 --> 00:43:00,660
famous

1100
00:42:58,318 --> 00:43:02,699
yeah truly one of the most famous

1101
00:43:00,659 --> 00:43:04,379
friends of all time and interesting to

1102
00:43:02,699 --> 00:43:06,659
hear the back story yeah that's that's

1103
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:08,700
cool the way Sam's quite humble about it

1104
00:43:06,659 --> 00:43:10,259
I was interested to quickly loop back

1105
00:43:08,699 --> 00:43:12,779
for a moment and ask you you know you

1106
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:15,900
spoke about the Holland seed bank and

1107
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:18,060
positronics and serious seeds and one of

1108
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:20,400
the seed banks besides the seed bank

1109
00:43:18,059 --> 00:43:22,019
itself the Holland seed bank um like

1110
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,539
yourself you know a lot of reverence for

1111
00:43:22,019 --> 00:43:26,759
them I also really really looked up to

1112
00:43:24,539 --> 00:43:29,099
Super sativa seed Club where did you

1113
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,700
rank them

1114
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:31,859
um

1115
00:43:29,699 --> 00:43:34,199
you know

1116
00:43:31,858 --> 00:43:37,440
I believe that Carl got the inspiration

1117
00:43:34,199 --> 00:43:39,000
to create sssc out of what Neville was

1118
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,579
doing with seed bank

1119
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,219
um and uh Carl also went and purchased

1120
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:46,560
seeds from uh Skunk Man Sam as well

1121
00:43:44,219 --> 00:43:48,059
everybody did really when Sam moved

1122
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:50,159
there and started working we're not on

1123
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:51,900
the green team they were providing seeds

1124
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:54,659
to all of these you know the Flying

1125
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:57,720
Dutchman and others that started up even

1126
00:43:54,659 --> 00:43:59,879
before Scentsy seeds with Scentsy seeds

1127
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:00,980
it was the Scentsy seed Club it was

1128
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:05,220
technically

1129
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:07,679
SSC and not sssc which was a super city

1130
00:44:05,219 --> 00:44:11,098
of C club and um they were all doing

1131
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:13,500
this uh to a degree and uh sscc was cool

1132
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:15,359
I mean they got you know some of the

1133
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:17,159
haze genetics and some of the skunk and

1134
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:18,900
and some of the stuff that Sam had at

1135
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:20,338
the time and they made some cool things

1136
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:23,039
with it but I would say they probably

1137
00:44:20,338 --> 00:44:26,219
lost most of it like many of my friends

1138
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:29,338
did over there by not being mindful like

1139
00:44:26,219 --> 00:44:31,439
Sam was and keeping it isolated from all

1140
00:44:29,338 --> 00:44:34,019
the other work he was out Crossing and

1141
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:36,179
making sure that he created an IBL line

1142
00:44:34,019 --> 00:44:38,039
that was vast enough that you could go

1143
00:44:36,179 --> 00:44:39,480
back to the original genetics and they

1144
00:44:38,039 --> 00:44:40,920
didn't have the Afghan and they didn't

1145
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,838
have Hindu Kush and they didn't have

1146
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:44,818
Thai didn't have anything else it was

1147
00:44:42,838 --> 00:44:46,318
just that three-way Colombian and

1148
00:44:44,818 --> 00:44:47,940
unfortunately a lot of them lost it and

1149
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:49,559
when I started up my seed company one of

1150
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:52,800
the first orders I received was from

1151
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:55,980
sssc so I you know they wanted the

1152
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,539
original hazeback and uh unfortunately

1153
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:58,980
their seeds got sent back to me because

1154
00:44:57,539 --> 00:45:01,199
I didn't have a photo sanitary

1155
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:03,719
certificate and Amsterdam was being a

1156
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:05,818
kind of rude that day I guess at Customs

1157
00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:07,439
but I'm sure I'll be able to get them

1158
00:45:05,818 --> 00:45:09,480
the seeds in the future

1159
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:12,179
you know but I I think they played a

1160
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:14,818
great role in this too you know um I

1161
00:45:12,179 --> 00:45:17,759
think these seed banks were the first

1162
00:45:14,818 --> 00:45:19,800
Heroes because they were the brave ones

1163
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:22,800
that made them available to everybody

1164
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:24,599
and we all benefited from it

1165
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,339
um to a large degree you know

1166
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:29,099
unfortunately Neville worked with some

1167
00:45:26,338 --> 00:45:31,619
you know shitty people and he was turned

1168
00:45:29,099 --> 00:45:33,480
in by the guy that was actually sending

1169
00:45:31,619 --> 00:45:36,539
his seeds for him

1170
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:39,000
um from Michigan so the story in a short

1171
00:45:36,539 --> 00:45:40,619
way goes that um somebody called Neville

1172
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,079
up back when Neville was answering the

1173
00:45:40,619 --> 00:45:45,358
phone and drummed up a friendship over

1174
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:46,859
the phone with Neville from Michigan and

1175
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:50,400
Neville invited him out to the castle

1176
00:45:46,858 --> 00:45:52,619
and this guy um Anthony Ray kogo went

1177
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,960
out there numerous times and something

1178
00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:57,180
happened with the seed sender that

1179
00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:01,079
Neville had in America Neville would

1180
00:45:57,179 --> 00:46:03,059
send cans of seeds to the Americas and

1181
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:05,700
then um in bulk and then somebody in

1182
00:46:03,059 --> 00:46:08,159
America would get addresses and

1183
00:46:05,699 --> 00:46:10,199
quantities of which variety to send to

1184
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:12,598
these addresses and they would package

1185
00:46:10,199 --> 00:46:14,879
it up in America and send 10 in 2015

1186
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:16,859
whatever seeds out at the time and

1187
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,000
unfortunately

1188
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:21,480
um

1189
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:25,019
Anthony rayco was was jealous was angry

1190
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:26,760
something at Neville and unfortunately

1191
00:46:25,019 --> 00:46:29,880
um he had been sending Neville seeds for

1192
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:31,800
about 18 months and he got busted for

1193
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:34,260
bringing from what I understand hashish

1194
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:37,140
into a jail to one of his friends in

1195
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:41,220
Michigan and got arrested for it Neville

1196
00:46:37,139 --> 00:46:43,379
on sent money to him to help him on the

1197
00:46:41,219 --> 00:46:45,899
bequest of his wife I've read this in

1198
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:47,579
the court paperwork the interesting

1199
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:50,460
story is a little bit is that after

1200
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:52,619
Neville passed away uh right before he

1201
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:54,358
passed away actually about two weeks I

1202
00:46:52,619 --> 00:46:57,358
was arguing with somebody on Instagram

1203
00:46:54,358 --> 00:47:00,659
that was claiming that sunk man Sam

1204
00:46:57,358 --> 00:47:02,960
turned in Neville and it wasn't true it

1205
00:47:00,659 --> 00:47:05,940
isn't true it there's no truth to it

1206
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:08,940
whatsoever and uh the guy that I was

1207
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:11,280
arguing with that was making this point

1208
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:15,539
um fancied himself an attorney so he

1209
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:18,480
went to a court website and

1210
00:47:15,539 --> 00:47:20,460
um downloaded Neville's paperwork he

1211
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:22,920
downloaded the two indictments he

1212
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:24,800
downloaded the statements from the

1213
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:28,858
witnesses and the police

1214
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:31,440
and uh contacted me and said hey you're

1215
00:47:28,858 --> 00:47:33,838
right Skunk Man Sam had nothing to do

1216
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:36,119
with Neville getting busted it was this

1217
00:47:33,838 --> 00:47:38,460
guy named Ray Anthony cogo that used to

1218
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:40,440
send his Siege and I said how can you be

1219
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:44,099
so certain and he said I'll send you the

1220
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:45,780
paperwork I paid 29.60 and and I

1221
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:48,180
downloaded all the paperwork anybody can

1222
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:50,220
and I was a little shocked so he sent

1223
00:47:48,179 --> 00:47:51,419
over the the court paperwork and I got

1224
00:47:50,219 --> 00:47:53,399
and I'll send it to you afterwards

1225
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:54,838
actually you can it's quite intriguing

1226
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,700
um but it was the whole statement of

1227
00:47:54,838 --> 00:48:00,719
Anthony rayco the statement was taken in

1228
00:47:56,699 --> 00:48:02,818
uh January of 1994 and um it starts in I

1229
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:05,818
would say March or April May of 1989

1230
00:48:02,818 --> 00:48:09,539
when Anthony Ray Coco willfully went

1231
00:48:05,818 --> 00:48:12,539
into the DEA with all of these addresses

1232
00:48:09,539 --> 00:48:14,759
that he had saved even though Neville

1233
00:48:12,539 --> 00:48:17,579
told him to destroy the addresses after

1234
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:20,700
he sent the seeds this SOB saved the

1235
00:48:17,579 --> 00:48:23,760
address is brawl the addresses to the

1236
00:48:20,699 --> 00:48:26,338
DEA and turned in Neville turned in all

1237
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,720
these people at the same time and cut a

1238
00:48:26,338 --> 00:48:30,779
deal for himself

1239
00:48:27,719 --> 00:48:33,179
incredible and um

1240
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:35,220
truly amazing because unfortunately

1241
00:48:33,179 --> 00:48:37,500
Neville was paying him to send the seeds

1242
00:48:35,219 --> 00:48:40,559
but they made a deal that Neville sold

1243
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:42,599
him the recipe to his nutrients and this

1244
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:44,460
guy came back and started selling Coco's

1245
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:47,039
nutrients this is still for sale today

1246
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:50,220
and brags about the fact that he got the

1247
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:52,318
recipe from the Netherlands and and once

1248
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:54,598
he had that recipe and his and he was

1249
00:48:52,318 --> 00:48:56,279
making the fertilizer he really didn't

1250
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:58,260
need Neville anymore he didn't need to

1251
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:00,960
work for Neville anymore so he turned

1252
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:05,640
him in and he acted as a undercover

1253
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:07,260
witness if you will 1989 90 91 92 93

1254
00:49:05,639 --> 00:49:10,440
because they didn't take his sworn

1255
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:13,140
statement until January of 94. so poor

1256
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:15,659
Neville didn't even know

1257
00:49:13,139 --> 00:49:19,559
who did it for the at first you know you

1258
00:49:15,659 --> 00:49:21,299
you take 1990 91 92 93. it was a it was

1259
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:23,159
a mystery to Neville all the way up

1260
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:26,818
until the case was dismissed in I think

1261
00:49:23,159 --> 00:49:28,799
O2 uh and only then was this paperwork

1262
00:49:26,818 --> 00:49:30,440
made public and then there was no

1263
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:33,180
internet like this so you couldn't go to

1264
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:36,599
pacer.net or got dot gov and download

1265
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:38,338
the court file so so it took a long time

1266
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:40,800
I think for Neville to truly find out

1267
00:49:38,338 --> 00:49:42,539
who was really behind turning in the

1268
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,460
seed bank and what the real story was

1269
00:49:42,539 --> 00:49:47,579
but unfortunately it was this guy

1270
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:50,039
Anthony rayco and um and that's

1271
00:49:47,579 --> 00:49:52,859
inevitably what took Neville down

1272
00:49:50,039 --> 00:49:55,920
it's so interesting you know what's the

1273
00:49:52,858 --> 00:49:58,019
saying I remember skunk VA said it uh

1274
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:00,300
real life is always more interesting

1275
00:49:58,019 --> 00:50:02,880
Than Fiction or something like that but

1276
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:04,859
it sort of holds true and the the

1277
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:07,740
general question that comes to mind for

1278
00:50:04,858 --> 00:50:10,019
me after hearing that is we often see a

1279
00:50:07,739 --> 00:50:13,919
lot of people blaming a lot of stuff on

1280
00:50:10,019 --> 00:50:15,358
Dave Watson and I've had Ryan Lee um

1281
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,519
Chimera who you're probably familiar

1282
00:50:15,358 --> 00:50:19,440
with I like Ryan a lot Ryan stayed at my

1283
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:21,659
house before yeah there you go right and

1284
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:23,700
and Ryan is adamant that you know the

1285
00:50:21,659 --> 00:50:26,159
same as you Sam's another never done any

1286
00:50:23,699 --> 00:50:28,318
of this [ __ ] so my question is why

1287
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:30,420
do you think he's the scapegoat for all

1288
00:50:28,318 --> 00:50:33,119
the bad stuff that happens

1289
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:35,460
you know when I I don't think he is a

1290
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:38,579
scapegoat for any of it I think Neville

1291
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:40,079
I you know I I to put it in plain

1292
00:50:38,579 --> 00:50:41,640
English I think Neville's a [ __ ]

1293
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:43,680
[ __ ] for starting the room as he

1294
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:45,960
started about David Watson you know

1295
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:48,118
calling somebody a de agent who's akin

1296
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:49,619
to calling him a pedophile it was the

1297
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:52,740
most horrible thing you could do it's

1298
00:50:49,619 --> 00:50:55,619
the biggest Trader in the world and um

1299
00:50:52,739 --> 00:50:58,379
and and and he knew it wasn't true he

1300
00:50:55,619 --> 00:51:01,019
knew he was lying he knew it he knew it

1301
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:04,140
and he lied anyway and he did it to

1302
00:51:01,019 --> 00:51:06,119
bolster his own reputation and he and he

1303
00:51:04,139 --> 00:51:08,818
was bolstering the work his own work

1304
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:10,858
based on the work of of company Sam

1305
00:51:08,818 --> 00:51:13,318
David Watson I mean there's no two shits

1306
00:51:10,858 --> 00:51:15,719
about it I mean David was the genius I

1307
00:51:13,318 --> 00:51:17,400
mean David still is a genius I mean you

1308
00:51:15,719 --> 00:51:19,259
know talk about stability he just

1309
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:21,900
celebrated I think his 52nd wedding

1310
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:24,599
anniversary the same woman I mean you go

1311
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:26,220
back to David's history in 1970 him and

1312
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:28,800
his girlfriend sold all their personal

1313
00:51:26,219 --> 00:51:31,618
possessions and and took a hippie trip

1314
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:33,660
from London to Morocco to Germany and

1315
00:51:31,619 --> 00:51:35,880
hitchhiked all the way across to India

1316
00:51:33,659 --> 00:51:38,399
and through Afghanistan and push

1317
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:40,680
mountains and and they lived in India

1318
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,300
for a year David collected the genetics

1319
00:51:40,679 --> 00:51:44,039
he brought them back to Santa Cruz he

1320
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:46,200
started his breeding three or four years

1321
00:51:44,039 --> 00:51:47,940
later he came up with skunk one and all

1322
00:51:46,199 --> 00:51:50,159
along the way he was collecting genetics

1323
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:52,079
if it wasn't for him I wouldn't be

1324
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:54,420
smoking Haze it would have been log lost

1325
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:57,599
40 45 years ago

1326
00:51:54,420 --> 00:52:00,780
um you know he was really a savior of

1327
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:03,420
the seed and on a level that no one else

1328
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:05,280
really has ever reached I mean to me

1329
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:07,920
David's one of my heroes I mean people

1330
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:11,160
don't really know the depth of the

1331
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:13,260
genius he was but uh more people are

1332
00:52:11,159 --> 00:52:17,098
starting to realize it and you know for

1333
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:20,460
the longest time I respected his wishes

1334
00:52:17,099 --> 00:52:22,559
and didn't uh I I separated his hippie

1335
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:25,199
identity from his professional identity

1336
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:27,960
because his Skunk Man Sam was the acid

1337
00:52:25,199 --> 00:52:29,338
eating hippie you know that was trying

1338
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:31,920
to make the world better getting him

1339
00:52:29,338 --> 00:52:34,858
good seats and then when he grew up

1340
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:36,960
had a couple daughters you know became

1341
00:52:34,858 --> 00:52:39,000
kind of square and uh started following

1342
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:41,818
the progress of Marinol which is a

1343
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,858
synthetic version of of THC and saw

1344
00:52:41,818 --> 00:52:48,179
there being an opportunity to create a

1345
00:52:43,858 --> 00:52:50,578
generic version of THC he literally

1346
00:52:48,179 --> 00:52:53,399
country shopped realized he could start

1347
00:52:50,579 --> 00:52:55,859
a company in the Netherlands called

1348
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:59,420
Florida farm and he could become the

1349
00:52:55,858 --> 00:53:02,159
very first private commercial

1350
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:05,519
cannabinoid pharmaceutical company in

1351
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:07,618
the world and he did it and you know

1352
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:11,880
part of the anger that my Dutch friends

1353
00:53:07,619 --> 00:53:14,579
Ben Bernard Neville a few others have

1354
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:16,858
had against him is that they didn't

1355
00:53:14,579 --> 00:53:19,500
understand how he got a license to grow

1356
00:53:16,858 --> 00:53:23,039
cannabis in the Netherlands and they

1357
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:26,099
didn't know how to and the truth is they

1358
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:29,039
could have all gotten licenses to start

1359
00:53:26,099 --> 00:53:30,780
a cannabinoid pharmaceutical company if

1360
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:33,539
one they knew what they were freaking

1361
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:35,059
doing or if they saw the market the

1362
00:53:33,539 --> 00:53:37,558
international market for medical

1363
00:53:35,059 --> 00:53:39,480
cannabinoids but they they weren't on

1364
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:41,460
that trip you know I'm actually writing

1365
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:43,740
an article called ants under the

1366
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:45,720
skyscraper which is actually about the

1367
00:53:43,739 --> 00:53:49,318
formation of the Dutch seed companies

1368
00:53:45,719 --> 00:53:52,078
and I and I labeled it that because I

1369
00:53:49,318 --> 00:53:53,759
feel as if these guys were like the ants

1370
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:55,920
under a skyscraper that cannot

1371
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,420
comprehend the engineering or the

1372
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,400
building that they live under they can't

1373
00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:01,500
comprehend the sophistication that's

1374
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:04,318
happening on the penthouse floor they

1375
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:07,260
they they just don't get it and those

1376
00:54:04,318 --> 00:54:09,179
guys didn't get medical cannabis for a

1377
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:10,800
very long time they didn't know what

1378
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:12,179
terpenes were

1379
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,980
um you know look at the pollinator

1380
00:54:12,179 --> 00:54:16,919
nothing against Mila I think she's

1381
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:18,659
incredible but she named her resin

1382
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:22,260
extraction machine

1383
00:54:18,659 --> 00:54:23,940
male pollen because like lack of better

1384
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:26,460
understanding should have been called

1385
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:28,318
the resonator because realistically she

1386
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:30,358
was tumbling female flowers and

1387
00:54:28,318 --> 00:54:32,159
extracting the resin heads from it she

1388
00:54:30,358 --> 00:54:34,440
wasn't tumbling male flowers and

1389
00:54:32,159 --> 00:54:36,358
extracting the pollen from it but that's

1390
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:39,900
the kind of misunderstanding I saw when

1391
00:54:36,358 --> 00:54:42,000
I moved there you know and I you know

1392
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:44,280
and I and I got where why there was a

1393
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,719
mystery and unfortunately you know what

1394
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:48,300
people don't understand they often

1395
00:54:45,719 --> 00:54:50,399
condemn and I think that a lot of these

1396
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:52,318
people condemned it and when hoarder

1397
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:54,720
Farm hit the scene and suddenly there

1398
00:54:52,318 --> 00:54:57,119
was this David Watson a lot of the

1399
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:59,519
people that had met Skunk Man Sam under

1400
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:03,140
his fake name Sam

1401
00:54:59,519 --> 00:55:06,358
um and his last name was his hippie acid

1402
00:55:03,139 --> 00:55:09,000
nickname Jingles just spelled backwards

1403
00:55:06,358 --> 00:55:10,679
which is really kind of funny so he's a

1404
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,960
big dude he's over six foot tall and he

1405
00:55:10,679 --> 00:55:15,058
used to wear these gesture hats that had

1406
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,280
bells on it when he would there'd be

1407
00:55:15,059 --> 00:55:19,500
these like legendary acid parties in the

1408
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:22,680
60s before it was you know illegal and

1409
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:24,599
and in the 70s still and and they were

1410
00:55:22,679 --> 00:55:26,460
heavy into psychedelics this is where

1411
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:28,140
the Grateful Dead was born these are the

1412
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:30,119
Santa Cruz mountains where Ken kisi was

1413
00:55:28,139 --> 00:55:32,279
and the Mary pranksters were this is

1414
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:34,318
this is what was going on back then and

1415
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:36,240
he used to wear a Jesters cap that fit

1416
00:55:34,318 --> 00:55:38,818
jingled and uh so his nickname was

1417
00:55:36,239 --> 00:55:41,519
jingles and when he moved over there it

1418
00:55:38,818 --> 00:55:43,318
was also Skunk Man Sam and when he moved

1419
00:55:41,519 --> 00:55:46,440
over there it just became Sam seldenidge

1420
00:55:43,318 --> 00:55:47,940
which was Jingles backwards and um and I

1421
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:49,679
guess that I mean my friend who

1422
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:52,200
publishes grow magazine when you meet

1423
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:54,598
him he usually says his name's Guy it's

1424
00:55:52,199 --> 00:55:56,818
not it's Steve but he has a wife and a

1425
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:58,380
kids and he's you know trying to create

1426
00:55:56,818 --> 00:56:01,139
a little bit of division between his

1427
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:03,059
family and the and the BS and I get it

1428
00:56:01,139 --> 00:56:05,219
and it was no different back then and

1429
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:07,079
then when people discovered that skunk

1430
00:56:05,219 --> 00:56:09,179
man Sam was David Watson they turned it

1431
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:12,180
into a big conspiracy and it really

1432
00:56:09,179 --> 00:56:14,239
wasn't and you know unfortunately just

1433
00:56:12,179 --> 00:56:17,639
because of their own lack of imagination

1434
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:20,399
they didn't start cannabinoid research

1435
00:56:17,639 --> 00:56:22,558
you know companies uh because they

1436
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,720
didn't know anything about it and they

1437
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:26,099
didn't see the market potential they

1438
00:56:24,719 --> 00:56:28,799
didn't have multi-million dollar

1439
00:56:26,099 --> 00:56:31,019
investors that wanted to invest into

1440
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:33,180
what could become a multi-billion dollar

1441
00:56:31,019 --> 00:56:35,280
company in the future I mean I think

1442
00:56:33,179 --> 00:56:37,078
these guys were forward-looking and when

1443
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:40,140
you look at the work they put out like

1444
00:56:37,079 --> 00:56:43,260
hashish hemp diseases and pests later

1445
00:56:40,139 --> 00:56:45,118
cannabis Evolution enough no botany uh

1446
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:48,059
you know even the hemp Industries

1447
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:51,960
Association that put out a peer-reviewed

1448
00:56:48,059 --> 00:56:54,420
journal printed on 100 hemp paper and

1449
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:58,500
provided educational kits made out of

1450
00:56:54,420 --> 00:57:01,318
like hemp wax crayons and Plastics and

1451
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:03,599
like you name it hemp seeds fabric all

1452
00:57:01,318 --> 00:57:06,659
of it paper and then sent it to

1453
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:08,818
universities so that the academics at

1454
00:57:06,659 --> 00:57:10,679
the universities would get a better

1455
00:57:08,818 --> 00:57:13,199
understanding of cannabis like to to

1456
00:57:10,679 --> 00:57:15,899
call these people de agents is the most

1457
00:57:13,199 --> 00:57:18,480
ridiculous [ __ ] you could ever call them

1458
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:21,539
because it's like if you think the eea

1459
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:24,539
is gonna let their [ __ ] Rogue agents

1460
00:57:21,539 --> 00:57:27,300
write these incredible volumes of

1461
00:57:24,539 --> 00:57:30,960
cannabis history and practical at

1462
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:32,880
utility you're crazy man I mean they're

1463
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,440
they're spending billions of dollars to

1464
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:36,119
go against cannabis and you think

1465
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:38,280
they're going to plant these two guys in

1466
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:41,039
the Netherlands so that they can pursue

1467
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:42,900
cannabinoid research and then write

1468
00:57:41,039 --> 00:57:45,300
about it and then send this damn

1469
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:47,700
information to the universities which is

1470
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:49,559
only going to work to subvert the

1471
00:57:47,699 --> 00:57:52,199
propaganda that the DEA is putting out

1472
00:57:49,559 --> 00:57:55,019
in the first place so I take great

1473
00:57:52,199 --> 00:57:57,058
offense at the lies and the rumors that

1474
00:57:55,019 --> 00:57:59,579
were not only started by Neville that

1475
00:57:57,059 --> 00:58:02,099
were continued and circulated by Bent

1476
00:57:59,579 --> 00:58:04,079
ronkers by we're not Bruning and others

1477
00:58:02,099 --> 00:58:06,660
who knew that they were [ __ ] lying

1478
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:08,760
but were lying to benefit their own

1479
00:58:06,659 --> 00:58:11,098
reputation and I still think they should

1480
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:12,480
be condemned for doing so because I

1481
00:58:11,099 --> 00:58:14,940
wouldn't want somebody calling me a d

1482
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:16,500
agent after I self-surrendered and did a

1483
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:19,679
five-year prison sentence rather than

1484
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:21,838
cooperate I mean I mean it's the worst

1485
00:58:19,679 --> 00:58:23,519
thing you can say to somebody that has a

1486
00:58:21,838 --> 00:58:26,460
clear conscience you know what I mean

1487
00:58:23,519 --> 00:58:28,440
and now I'm glad that skunk man Sam has

1488
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:30,780
outlived a lot of these people and that

1489
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:32,960
the truth has come out and that his

1490
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:35,819
reputation is being you know

1491
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:37,679
for what it really is you know not based

1492
00:58:35,818 --> 00:58:40,139
on some heroin addicts fantasy of what

1493
00:58:37,679 --> 00:58:42,598
he wished it was but on the reality of

1494
00:58:40,139 --> 00:58:45,298
of of a lifelong's worth of work

1495
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:47,579
basically protecting the seed sharing

1496
00:58:45,298 --> 00:58:50,759
the information and doing good for for

1497
00:58:47,579 --> 00:58:52,619
the world around him and and that's I I

1498
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:54,900
feel really passionate about Skunk Man

1499
00:58:52,619 --> 00:58:56,579
Sam and David Watson he's one of the

1500
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:59,160
nicest people I've ever known I've known

1501
00:58:56,579 --> 00:59:01,559
him since 1994 one of the most solid

1502
00:58:59,159 --> 00:59:03,358
people I've ever known you know I mean a

1503
00:59:01,559 --> 00:59:06,559
lot of us don't have relationships with

1504
00:59:03,358 --> 00:59:09,420
our loved ones that last 51 two years

1505
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:12,599
and you know it really goes to show what

1506
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:15,000
kind of a person he is everybody that I

1507
00:59:12,599 --> 00:59:17,760
know that knows him really loves him and

1508
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:20,460
has respect and admiration for him and

1509
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:22,079
you know I after known him for so long I

1510
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:23,940
understand why he's never done a bad

1511
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:27,660
thing he's never said a bad thing he's

1512
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:30,980
never lied to me and to me that matters

1513
00:59:27,659 --> 00:59:33,598
yeah very impassionate and informative

1514
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:35,400
answer there and I I would agree

1515
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:37,680
everyone who I've spoken to who knows

1516
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:39,900
him personally has echoed your sentiment

1517
00:59:37,679 --> 00:59:42,000
and I guess I've just got two final

1518
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:43,980
little questions on Nell before we sort

1519
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,539
of talk about some other stuff and I

1520
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:47,519
guess I'm interested for the last few

1521
00:59:45,539 --> 00:59:49,739
years before Neville passed away because

1522
00:59:47,519 --> 00:59:51,780
he he did pass away a few years ago now

1523
00:59:49,739 --> 00:59:53,578
he was actually a little bit active on

1524
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:55,380
the Mr Nice Guy forums and he was

1525
00:59:53,579 --> 00:59:57,119
causing a bit of waves over there with

1526
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:58,440
some of the stuff he posted I was

1527
00:59:57,119 --> 00:59:59,460
wondering did you ever get around to

1528
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:01,260
reading that and did you have any

1529
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:03,240
thoughts on any of it because some of

1530
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:05,880
the stuff he posted went very much

1531
01:00:03,239 --> 01:00:08,039
against the grain of what the stories

1532
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:09,900
that were circulating sort of said do

1533
01:00:08,039 --> 01:00:11,699
you think maybe he was just a bit unwell

1534
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:13,280
or do you think there was maybe some

1535
01:00:11,699 --> 01:00:15,719
truth to it all

1536
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:19,980
unfortunately I think Neville was one of

1537
01:00:15,719 --> 01:00:21,779
the you know first cannabis uh people to

1538
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:24,240
like reinvent the stories and put out

1539
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:26,099
misinformation to benefit himself and

1540
01:00:24,239 --> 01:00:28,259
you know when he broke up with Aryan

1541
01:00:26,099 --> 01:00:30,780
very publicly you know for those that

1542
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:33,839
read forums back then it wasn't a pretty

1543
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:36,059
divorce uh he took his genetics and he

1544
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:38,159
sold them to Scotty he didn't move to

1545
01:00:36,059 --> 01:00:40,980
Switzerland he didn't follow Scotty he

1546
01:00:38,159 --> 01:00:43,078
didn't go do breeding he said here you

1547
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:45,059
go give me money and he helped Market

1548
01:00:43,079 --> 01:00:46,920
the genetics that Scotty was making in

1549
01:00:45,059 --> 01:00:49,319
Switzerland until the point where Scotty

1550
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:51,059
got busted and unfortunately Scotty also

1551
01:00:49,318 --> 01:00:52,739
went to jail for five years I believe it

1552
01:00:51,059 --> 01:00:55,380
was quite a while

1553
01:00:52,739 --> 01:00:57,058
um and you know Neville was already out

1554
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:59,460
of the picture at that point and I don't

1555
01:00:57,059 --> 01:01:02,940
know what of those genetics were saved

1556
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:04,980
or lost because I wasn't there I um

1557
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:07,380
Scotty is Shanti Baba by the way I mean

1558
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:10,199
I knew Scotty as the guy that worked for

1559
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:12,480
Aryan when I first went to uh Amsterdam

1560
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:15,239
Aryan and Scotty where you know Scotty

1561
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:17,880
was like his assistant if you will and

1562
01:01:15,239 --> 01:01:19,979
um and I like Scotty I've always thought

1563
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:22,619
Scotty was really cool I I didn't know

1564
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:24,119
him around the name change I I'm you

1565
01:01:22,619 --> 01:01:27,119
know I don't know where the Shanti Baba

1566
01:01:24,119 --> 01:01:29,039
came from but whatever and uh you know

1567
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:31,200
and I think Scotty's a good brother man

1568
01:01:29,039 --> 01:01:33,298
he did a lot of experience and stuff uh

1569
01:01:31,199 --> 01:01:35,519
but he inherited the genetics that he

1570
01:01:33,298 --> 01:01:37,619
got from Neville and you know Neville

1571
01:01:35,519 --> 01:01:39,420
pulled the same thing with uh Aryan that

1572
01:01:37,619 --> 01:01:42,180
he pulled with Ben I mean when him and

1573
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:44,099
Ben broke up he took his genetics he had

1574
01:01:42,179 --> 01:01:47,039
people that he knew that worked it since

1575
01:01:44,099 --> 01:01:49,798
since he destroyed the genetics and even

1576
01:01:47,039 --> 01:01:51,539
worse I mean I know firsthand that the

1577
01:01:49,798 --> 01:01:54,838
person that supposedly was supposed to

1578
01:01:51,539 --> 01:01:56,880
destroy the plants stole the plants and

1579
01:01:54,838 --> 01:02:00,659
then years later offered them back for

1580
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:03,780
sale to Scentsy uh which is just

1581
01:02:00,659 --> 01:02:06,358
such double cross that's just like

1582
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:09,000
but you saw a lot of it back then and uh

1583
01:02:06,358 --> 01:02:10,558
you know but he broke up with Ben and

1584
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,880
you know talk [ __ ] about Ben and then he

1585
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:14,220
broke up with learning talk [ __ ] about

1586
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:15,900
Aryan uh you know and I don't know what

1587
01:02:14,219 --> 01:02:18,779
his relationship with Scotty was towards

1588
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:21,420
the end but he was using the Forum as a

1589
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:24,599
soapbox and unfortunately a lot of the

1590
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:26,639
stuff that I've seen uh it doesn't go

1591
01:02:24,599 --> 01:02:28,380
with the stories Greg's told me the

1592
01:02:26,639 --> 01:02:30,719
stories Rob Clark's told me the stories

1593
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:32,880
that skunk man Sam told me uh the story

1594
01:02:30,719 --> 01:02:35,399
that Ben's told me and Alan dronkers

1595
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:39,298
I've spent time with all these people

1596
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:41,760
um and you know Unfortunately they they

1597
01:02:39,298 --> 01:02:43,739
sing a similar song and they're not in

1598
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:45,240
the same room together and unfortunately

1599
01:02:43,739 --> 01:02:47,039
it doesn't paint a very pretty picture

1600
01:02:45,239 --> 01:02:48,539
you know it paints a picture of people

1601
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:50,880
that were disappointed in somebody that

1602
01:02:48,539 --> 01:02:52,139
they tried to like a lot you know but

1603
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:53,880
somebody that was dealing with the

1604
01:02:52,139 --> 01:02:55,379
Demons of addiction and unfortunately

1605
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:58,680
that was spilling into the rest of their

1606
01:02:55,380 --> 01:03:01,019
life so Neville was haunted in a polite

1607
01:02:58,679 --> 01:03:02,460
way and who knows what kind of a person

1608
01:03:01,019 --> 01:03:04,920
he would have been if you take the

1609
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:05,940
heroin and the alcohol that way you know

1610
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:07,260
could have been a whole different world

1611
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:09,838
for him he could still be alive today

1612
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:11,400
but it's not the not the Neville that he

1613
01:03:09,838 --> 01:03:13,920
was and you just got to accept people

1614
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:16,139
for what they are and you know give

1615
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:18,358
sympathy and pity where where it belongs

1616
01:03:16,139 --> 01:03:21,598
to me anybody who's a drug addict I feel

1617
01:03:18,358 --> 01:03:23,279
for them I unfortunately not one but I I

1618
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:25,140
have nothing but empathy for people that

1619
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:26,700
are struggling with addiction but it

1620
01:03:25,139 --> 01:03:28,558
doesn't give them a free pass to be able

1621
01:03:26,699 --> 01:03:29,939
to try to destroy the reputations of

1622
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:31,140
good people

1623
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:32,818
um especially when they know they're

1624
01:03:31,139 --> 01:03:35,159
lying you know especially when they know

1625
01:03:32,818 --> 01:03:38,519
with what they're saying is is not true

1626
01:03:35,159 --> 01:03:40,259
yeah in that form I kind of condemn one

1627
01:03:38,519 --> 01:03:42,539
yeah no I understand where you're coming

1628
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:44,040
from and I think maybe the saddest part

1629
01:03:42,539 --> 01:03:45,420
about what you just said is that I think

1630
01:03:44,039 --> 01:03:47,219
you banged it on their head in that

1631
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:49,260
Neville probably likely would still be

1632
01:03:47,219 --> 01:03:50,219
around if he didn't have those demons on

1633
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:51,480
the other end of the spectrum the

1634
01:03:50,219 --> 01:03:54,298
question has to be asked would we have

1635
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:56,579
had the same offerings from him and yeah

1636
01:03:54,298 --> 01:03:57,960
well it was the addiction that caused

1637
01:03:56,579 --> 01:04:00,059
him to start the seed company don't

1638
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:01,798
forget it was a grant from the Dutch

1639
01:04:00,059 --> 01:04:04,500
government because he was dealing with

1640
01:04:01,798 --> 01:04:06,000
uh addiction maintenance and they were

1641
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:07,920
trying to get them onto starting a

1642
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,199
business and the Dutch government gave

1643
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:13,440
them a loan to start the hall and seed

1644
01:04:10,199 --> 01:04:16,558
bank back in 1984 which is quite

1645
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:18,838
astonishing you know only only in the

1646
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:20,700
Netherlands could could this story be

1647
01:04:18,838 --> 01:04:22,219
what what the reality the reality is

1648
01:04:20,699 --> 01:04:25,798
always much Stranger Than conviction

1649
01:04:22,219 --> 01:04:27,480
yeah well to Loop it back I guess I sort

1650
01:04:25,798 --> 01:04:29,818
of wanted to ended the Neville

1651
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:32,099
discussion on a more brighter note and

1652
01:04:29,818 --> 01:04:34,019
something which I've always suspected is

1653
01:04:32,099 --> 01:04:35,818
that the point you made about how he's

1654
01:04:34,019 --> 01:04:37,440
like a DJ you know he's sort of mixing

1655
01:04:35,818 --> 01:04:39,298
and mashing other people's work that

1656
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:41,220
kind of resonated with me and what I

1657
01:04:39,298 --> 01:04:43,559
thought is if we're going to use those

1658
01:04:41,219 --> 01:04:45,239
terms to keep it simple I sort of get

1659
01:04:43,559 --> 01:04:47,519
the feeling they haven't really been as

1660
01:04:45,239 --> 01:04:49,318
many DJs on the same level as Neville

1661
01:04:47,519 --> 01:04:51,420
like as much as I agree with what you're

1662
01:04:49,318 --> 01:04:53,099
saying he didn't create the music so to

1663
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:55,440
speak so it's he shouldn't be credited

1664
01:04:53,099 --> 01:04:58,019
with that but I also feel like he did a

1665
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:59,220
pretty darn good job as a DJ would you

1666
01:04:58,019 --> 01:05:00,719
agree with that and do you think there

1667
01:04:59,219 --> 01:05:03,058
are any other people who are in that

1668
01:05:00,719 --> 01:05:05,219
same Echelon of mixing and matching and

1669
01:05:03,059 --> 01:05:07,920
creating really standout work

1670
01:05:05,219 --> 01:05:09,659
sure uh you know Kenny Kenny Morrow

1671
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:11,880
trichrome technologies that poster

1672
01:05:09,659 --> 01:05:13,920
behind me over here I think Kenny uh

1673
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:15,298
ultraviolet which was the what became

1674
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:17,760
purple passion Granddaddy Purple

1675
01:05:15,298 --> 01:05:19,500
everything else uh was his work back in

1676
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:21,240
the mid 90s he released that he's

1677
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:22,559
released quite a few varieties over the

1678
01:05:21,239 --> 01:05:24,358
course of time

1679
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:25,798
um Simon Schmidt I think is a phenomenal

1680
01:05:24,358 --> 01:05:28,440
breeder I mean he went to school for

1681
01:05:25,798 --> 01:05:31,739
plants he's he's his his company's been

1682
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:34,019
around now I think 30 years almost uh 94

1683
01:05:31,739 --> 01:05:36,479
I think it started so he's coming close

1684
01:05:34,019 --> 01:05:38,219
to around his 30-year anniversary

1685
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:40,318
um and you know there's Skunk Man Sam

1686
01:05:38,219 --> 01:05:42,058
who's really a God over devil I mean

1687
01:05:40,318 --> 01:05:44,639
Neville used to really kind of attack

1688
01:05:42,059 --> 01:05:46,920
Sam all the time but Neville never made

1689
01:05:44,639 --> 01:05:49,980
a skunk one never Neville never made any

1690
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:52,260
of the varieties that Sam gave and sold

1691
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:54,719
to him and that he built his business

1692
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:56,099
upon and he always tried to steal the

1693
01:05:54,719 --> 01:05:58,798
credit from where the credit was due

1694
01:05:56,099 --> 01:06:00,420
which is something I don't do uh you

1695
01:05:58,798 --> 01:06:02,280
know but then again when you look at a

1696
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:03,180
lot of these California varieties

1697
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:06,000
um

1698
01:06:03,179 --> 01:06:08,818
you know sour diesel train wreck Green

1699
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,920
Crack God bud you know I could go on and

1700
01:06:08,818 --> 01:06:13,259
on who made California Orange I don't

1701
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:15,059
know but it was really good weed and uh

1702
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:16,980
you know unfortunately through the drug

1703
01:06:15,059 --> 01:06:19,559
war we didn't get a lot of people who

1704
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:21,838
had the courage that Neville really had

1705
01:06:19,559 --> 01:06:24,839
to stick his head above the water and

1706
01:06:21,838 --> 01:06:26,639
say yeah I did that and then and I and

1707
01:06:24,838 --> 01:06:29,219
I'll give him credit to this day I mean

1708
01:06:26,639 --> 01:06:31,739
I think we should you know I wanted to

1709
01:06:29,219 --> 01:06:34,259
emulate him I was when I met him he was

1710
01:06:31,739 --> 01:06:37,500
still a hero to me you know I his his

1711
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:40,799
courage to do something that was you

1712
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:42,599
know wrong uh was right you know he is

1713
01:06:40,798 --> 01:06:45,179
selling the seed to the community was a

1714
01:06:42,599 --> 01:06:47,880
good thing unfortunately operation green

1715
01:06:45,179 --> 01:06:51,000
Merchant came out of it and he got a lot

1716
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:52,858
of people busted uh because of his poor

1717
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,539
relationships or his poor picking of

1718
01:06:52,858 --> 01:06:56,880
relationships

1719
01:06:54,539 --> 01:06:58,859
um but you know you can't go back and

1720
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:01,260
fix the people that screw you over I

1721
01:06:58,858 --> 01:07:03,719
sometimes wonder if that guy was a cop

1722
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:05,940
the whole time and that that was a full

1723
01:07:03,719 --> 01:07:08,639
engagement because why else would he

1724
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:11,099
have saved all those addresses if he

1725
01:07:08,639 --> 01:07:13,798
didn't plan on using those addresses at

1726
01:07:11,099 --> 01:07:16,380
a later time to his benefit so there was

1727
01:07:13,798 --> 01:07:18,000
clearly a back door that he was

1728
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:20,460
leveraging

1729
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,679
um at the time he was also growing and

1730
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:24,720
doing his own thing so maybe he just

1731
01:07:22,679 --> 01:07:27,659
like if you did get popped he would just

1732
01:07:24,719 --> 01:07:29,098
turn over which he did but if you read

1733
01:07:27,659 --> 01:07:31,318
when you get it you'll see what I mean

1734
01:07:29,099 --> 01:07:33,298
when you read it he went willingly to

1735
01:07:31,318 --> 01:07:36,000
the DEA and turned in Neville and turned

1736
01:07:33,298 --> 01:07:37,798
in all of his customers so

1737
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,960
you know there's there's two sides of

1738
01:07:37,798 --> 01:07:43,139
every sword I guess and uh unfortunately

1739
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:45,720
uh a lot of people got sliced by it but

1740
01:07:43,139 --> 01:07:48,358
it created a new opportunity and look at

1741
01:07:45,719 --> 01:07:50,578
all the seed companies sssc uh the

1742
01:07:48,358 --> 01:07:52,558
Flying Dutchman Paradise seed Luke is

1743
01:07:50,579 --> 01:07:54,480
awesome you know he's a really good one

1744
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:57,000
too Lucas maintained a long time since

1745
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:58,559
these Stars a great variety

1746
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,000
um you know there's other people like

1747
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:01,920
you know the guy that made white widow

1748
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,019
his name was igmar

1749
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:06,240
um not much of a greeter but he made a

1750
01:08:04,019 --> 01:08:09,480
variety that a lot of people you know to

1751
01:08:06,239 --> 01:08:10,500
this day recognize you know uh so I

1752
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:12,659
think there has been a lot of people

1753
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:15,059
along the way I mean Greg is another one

1754
01:08:12,659 --> 01:08:18,238
the guys Murphy Stevens that really

1755
01:08:15,059 --> 01:08:20,759
started all this with this Afghan is

1756
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:24,599
also very underrated to a large degree

1757
01:08:20,759 --> 01:08:27,359
we're all smoking uh Prodigy from from

1758
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:29,039
what he started you know way back when I

1759
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:31,020
asked gunkman Sam before what would have

1760
01:08:29,039 --> 01:08:32,819
been the most popular cannabis variety

1761
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:35,640
had you not really skunk one and without

1762
01:08:32,819 --> 01:08:37,500
a hiccup he said oh Northern Lights you

1763
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:40,619
know so Northern Lights was that

1764
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:43,198
impactive and it was it was you know

1765
01:08:40,619 --> 01:08:45,539
those Afghans that Murphy Stevens Indica

1766
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:48,059
was was floating around in the 70s and

1767
01:08:45,539 --> 01:08:49,679
80s long before Neville ever started a

1768
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:52,319
seed company so how many of these other

1769
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:54,480
varieties also have it we don't know you

1770
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:57,239
know and uh you know the truth is is

1771
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:59,698
that unless we really get good genetic

1772
01:08:57,238 --> 01:09:02,218
testing DNA testing and we get better

1773
01:08:59,698 --> 01:09:05,099
samples in we're not going to know the

1774
01:09:02,219 --> 01:09:06,838
relations of these plants and uh you

1775
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:08,100
know I I once asked Ben dronkers I said

1776
01:09:06,838 --> 01:09:10,439
hey are you going to send your samples

1777
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:12,060
in to get DNA tested he looked at me we

1778
01:09:10,439 --> 01:09:14,460
were sitting together getting high and

1779
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:17,060
he said why so we can prove all these

1780
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:21,119
genetics came from Rob and Dave

1781
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:23,160
and I was like I get it I get it and he

1782
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:25,140
and and I get it I get it if you've made

1783
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:28,318
a living making millions of dollars

1784
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:29,759
selling Jack Daniels whiskey in your

1785
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:32,100
Distillery and you ain't never had to

1786
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:34,020
pay Jack I don't think you wanna I don't

1787
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:35,940
think you wanna who is the daddy test

1788
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:37,440
you know because do you really wanted to

1789
01:09:35,939 --> 01:09:41,039
come back can say you're not the father

1790
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:42,719
Ben actually it's him you know and you

1791
01:09:41,039 --> 01:09:43,979
know and I think that's what a lot of

1792
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:45,659
them don't want to see happen and

1793
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:47,459
unfortunately when you even look at

1794
01:09:45,659 --> 01:09:48,899
philos which is interesting on a lot of

1795
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:51,119
levels I don't agree with what they did

1796
01:09:48,899 --> 01:09:53,338
with community and conception nurseries

1797
01:09:51,119 --> 01:09:55,800
and all that aside

1798
01:09:53,338 --> 01:09:57,840
um but when you when you look at what

1799
01:09:55,800 --> 01:10:01,079
they were doing uh and you look at them

1800
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:02,579
using Goji Kush as like a backbone to

1801
01:10:01,079 --> 01:10:05,698
all these other varieties I think it's

1802
01:10:02,579 --> 01:10:07,859
misplaced if you take out OG Kush and

1803
01:10:05,698 --> 01:10:10,198
you put normal lights number two then it

1804
01:10:07,859 --> 01:10:12,599
would make sense because I remember life

1805
01:10:10,198 --> 01:10:15,178
before rogie cush it was it was Northern

1806
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:17,579
Lights and because philos didn't have a

1807
01:10:15,179 --> 01:10:20,340
good Northern Light sample they didn't

1808
01:10:17,579 --> 01:10:23,640
have anything other than OG Kush forward

1809
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:27,440
to go on and for those I mean OG kush's

1810
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:32,159
1996 1997. it's not that old I mean

1811
01:10:27,439 --> 01:10:33,719
original Haze 69 skunk 176 a lot of you

1812
01:10:32,158 --> 01:10:36,779
know Northern Lights Northern Lights was

1813
01:10:33,719 --> 01:10:40,260
named Northern Lights when he said sent

1814
01:10:36,779 --> 01:10:42,420
the seeds to Neville up to that point he

1815
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:44,219
was just keeping track of the crosses

1816
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:47,100
being made by the people within the

1817
01:10:44,219 --> 01:10:49,980
circle that he was sharing The Afghani

1818
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:52,980
seeds from Murphy Stevens with so he

1819
01:10:49,979 --> 01:10:54,539
Greg does not take credit for making uh

1820
01:10:52,979 --> 01:10:58,019
Northern Lights number five he said that

1821
01:10:54,539 --> 01:11:00,179
it was a herbie I think that worked at

1822
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:02,400
the sunset shop the sun This indoor Sun

1823
01:11:00,179 --> 01:11:04,319
Shop that worked for Murphy Stevens made

1824
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:05,399
it but because they were all sharing

1825
01:11:04,319 --> 01:11:09,658
genetics

1826
01:11:05,399 --> 01:11:11,519
Greg had some of those hybrid seeds and

1827
01:11:09,658 --> 01:11:13,819
um and initially when he sent it over

1828
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:16,560
his Northern Lights he he spelled to

1829
01:11:13,819 --> 01:11:18,599
l-i-t-e-s like a light bulb like turn

1830
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:21,480
the light on because it was all being

1831
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:24,179
grown in the north under lights and uh

1832
01:11:21,479 --> 01:11:26,819
and you know because uh you know Lite is

1833
01:11:24,179 --> 01:11:28,739
more like illumination l-i-g-h-t it's

1834
01:11:26,819 --> 01:11:32,219
more like the weight of something so he

1835
01:11:28,738 --> 01:11:35,218
was going with Lites and Neville changed

1836
01:11:32,219 --> 01:11:37,500
it Neville jammed it to leghts Lig HCS

1837
01:11:35,219 --> 01:11:39,658
and called it known the lights but

1838
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:41,760
um the little the little funnies in the

1839
01:11:39,658 --> 01:11:43,259
story have always intrigued me but these

1840
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:45,119
genetics were floating around quite a

1841
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:47,159
while before Neville took him and

1842
01:11:45,119 --> 01:11:49,500
broadcast them and realistically I don't

1843
01:11:47,158 --> 01:11:51,599
think Neville was so much a great DJ as

1844
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:53,939
he had a great platform I mean he was

1845
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:56,039
like the first due to the Visa with you

1846
01:11:53,939 --> 01:11:58,799
know two turntables and a microphone and

1847
01:11:56,039 --> 01:12:00,539
everybody's like whoa and that and you

1848
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:02,880
know a lot of people have come since and

1849
01:12:00,539 --> 01:12:05,880
probably been better DJs but he was the

1850
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:08,579
first one to to seed bank it turned on

1851
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:11,219
print catalogs and then send Seas all

1852
01:12:08,579 --> 01:12:12,658
over the world so he deserves credit for

1853
01:12:11,219 --> 01:12:15,600
being one courageous person and

1854
01:12:12,658 --> 01:12:17,399
unfortunately he paid dearly for his

1855
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:20,579
courage

1856
01:12:17,399 --> 01:12:22,198
yeah a brilliant answer there and I

1857
01:12:20,579 --> 01:12:23,158
might just take us back a little bit

1858
01:12:22,198 --> 01:12:24,238
because you just brought it up we'll

1859
01:12:23,158 --> 01:12:26,099
talk a little bit more about the

1860
01:12:24,238 --> 01:12:28,919
Northern Lights stuff and I guess one of

1861
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:30,600
the questions I was wondering was as you

1862
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:33,119
mentioned there were sort of different

1863
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:35,159
tropical males being crossed to this

1864
01:12:33,119 --> 01:12:37,198
purest indica and yet that's generating

1865
01:12:35,158 --> 01:12:39,839
the different numbers one two three four

1866
01:12:37,198 --> 01:12:41,639
five up hold up it's not just a female

1867
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:43,500
because they had the seeds of the peer

1868
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:45,600
authentica so as they would grow out the

1869
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:47,819
purest intricacies I have boys and girls

1870
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:50,579
of purist Indica downstairs so I could

1871
01:12:47,819 --> 01:12:53,759
go either way so it wasn't just uh girls

1872
01:12:50,579 --> 01:12:56,579
being married to Tropical males it was

1873
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:59,460
uh you know and uh when I interviewed

1874
01:12:56,579 --> 01:13:01,800
Greg he he's really humble too man he's

1875
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:03,119
like Sam when I asked him you know what

1876
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:06,840
the genetics were he's like well we'll

1877
01:13:03,119 --> 01:13:08,698
never really no will we and it's just a

1878
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:10,260
beauty it's a beautiful honesty that I

1879
01:13:08,698 --> 01:13:11,698
really appreciate because one of the

1880
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:13,619
things I don't like about the Cannabis

1881
01:13:11,698 --> 01:13:15,539
Community is how certain people are

1882
01:13:13,619 --> 01:13:17,399
about you know things they don't know

1883
01:13:15,539 --> 01:13:19,859
and even now everything I'm saying is

1884
01:13:17,399 --> 01:13:21,960
from my journalistic research some of

1885
01:13:19,859 --> 01:13:23,880
it's from my personal interactions but

1886
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:26,640
you know most of it's from research and

1887
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:28,980
me they're trying to gather stories from

1888
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:31,140
different parties and and finding the

1889
01:13:28,979 --> 01:13:33,059
threat of Truth through it all it's

1890
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:35,579
always been my goal I'm really not

1891
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:38,100
biased to what the truth is I just would

1892
01:13:35,579 --> 01:13:40,380
like to know what it really is yeah

1893
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:42,780
beautiful sentiment there I guess it did

1894
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:45,900
make me wonder did Greg ever mention

1895
01:13:42,779 --> 01:13:47,939
anything about any of the other parents

1896
01:13:45,899 --> 01:13:49,500
being kept in a pure form or was it just

1897
01:13:47,939 --> 01:13:51,178
the purest indica and then they would

1898
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:53,100
just cross it but never keep the other

1899
01:13:51,179 --> 01:13:55,560
things pure as well

1900
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:57,060
well if you know the way I look at it is

1901
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:58,980
this if you had groups of people like

1902
01:13:57,060 --> 01:14:01,860
you know you have one guy playing with

1903
01:13:58,979 --> 01:14:04,619
what was a Hawaiian maybe neither

1904
01:14:01,859 --> 01:14:06,359
Mexican and Crossing it with it and he

1905
01:14:04,619 --> 01:14:07,738
had his genetics and then there was the

1906
01:14:06,359 --> 01:14:09,899
guy that they referred to as the Indian

1907
01:14:07,738 --> 01:14:12,479
who lived out on an island he had his

1908
01:14:09,899 --> 01:14:14,099
genetics and he crossed it together so

1909
01:14:12,479 --> 01:14:15,658
what I see is like

1910
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:17,179
uh

1911
01:14:15,658 --> 01:14:21,059
uh uh

1912
01:14:17,179 --> 01:14:23,100
a Pure Color a primary color and then

1913
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:24,780
the colors shared and then some people

1914
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:26,520
are mixing a little yellow some people

1915
01:14:24,779 --> 01:14:28,859
are mixing a little blue some are mixing

1916
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:30,900
a little brown some have yellow and and

1917
01:14:28,859 --> 01:14:32,099
some have orange and they're all coming

1918
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:36,119
out with something slightly different

1919
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:39,420
and then they're sharing again and uh

1920
01:14:36,119 --> 01:14:40,198
that's how Greg kind of described it and

1921
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:43,380
um

1922
01:14:40,198 --> 01:14:45,599
it makes sense to me as somebody that

1923
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:47,760
has friends and Loosely shares genetics

1924
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:49,260
and then Jets don't go you've got to

1925
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:52,260
have these seeds back I made them from

1926
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:54,300
your variety it's kind of like that and

1927
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:55,860
you know Greg initially sent seeds to

1928
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:57,420
Neville because he wanted a trade but

1929
01:14:55,859 --> 01:14:59,099
now but he wanted some of the varieties

1930
01:14:57,420 --> 01:15:00,658
Neville had

1931
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:01,980
um he made a comment though he goes

1932
01:15:00,658 --> 01:15:04,639
Neville never sent me back anything

1933
01:15:01,979 --> 01:15:09,178
nearly as good as we said

1934
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:10,980
you know and uh and and I get it I get

1935
01:15:09,179 --> 01:15:13,440
where he's coming from too you know

1936
01:15:10,979 --> 01:15:15,359
because if he's experiencing the f1s

1937
01:15:13,439 --> 01:15:17,779
from his friends who are first making

1938
01:15:15,359 --> 01:15:20,399
them he's going to get more robust

1939
01:15:17,779 --> 01:15:23,219
Prodigy because they're gonna have the

1940
01:15:20,399 --> 01:15:25,738
the hybridized effect of you know

1941
01:15:23,219 --> 01:15:28,198
consistency uniformity and bigger more

1942
01:15:25,738 --> 01:15:31,379
so than the plants that are being maybe

1943
01:15:28,198 --> 01:15:33,178
inbred and bred again or being bred with

1944
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:35,159
genetics more closely related to one

1945
01:15:33,179 --> 01:15:36,960
another uh you know which I'm sure

1946
01:15:35,158 --> 01:15:38,460
Chimera talked about when he was on

1947
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:40,020
because he's he's brilliant when it

1948
01:15:38,460 --> 01:15:42,179
comes to breeding

1949
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:43,920
um but you know normally like humans

1950
01:15:42,179 --> 01:15:46,260
we're not trying to you know have sex

1951
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:48,600
with our cousins because you know babies

1952
01:15:46,260 --> 01:15:51,060
don't come out so good and uh and it's

1953
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:54,000
kind of similar with cannabis and

1954
01:15:51,060 --> 01:15:55,920
uh you know I I think this is also why a

1955
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,899
lot of Neville's initial offerings were

1956
01:15:55,920 --> 01:16:00,239
so good because he was making these F1

1957
01:15:57,899 --> 01:16:02,639
hybrids with um distinctly different

1958
01:16:00,238 --> 01:16:05,158
genetics original Haze males and

1959
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:06,659
Northern Lights females or skunk which

1960
01:16:05,158 --> 01:16:09,119
didn't have any Northern Lights in it

1961
01:16:06,658 --> 01:16:11,759
Skunk Man Sam never had Northern Lights

1962
01:16:09,119 --> 01:16:13,319
genetics he never he never got them he

1963
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:15,119
never worked with them

1964
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:17,158
um and on the other side of it Greg

1965
01:16:15,119 --> 01:16:18,658
never could get his Hands-On original

1966
01:16:17,158 --> 01:16:20,819
skunk and never got his hands on

1967
01:16:18,658 --> 01:16:22,619
original Haze until you know some

1968
01:16:20,819 --> 01:16:24,658
[ __ ] kid like me comes along and

1969
01:16:22,619 --> 01:16:28,380
sends him to him in his retirement

1970
01:16:24,658 --> 01:16:32,039
sometime in like 20 2018 I think I sent

1971
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:34,319
him those seeds you know so you know

1972
01:16:32,039 --> 01:16:37,140
it's it you never know how it's gonna

1973
01:16:34,319 --> 01:16:40,738
work out but you know Greg was in

1974
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:42,719
Vietnam from 1965 and 1969 joined when

1975
01:16:40,738 --> 01:16:45,839
he was 17 because he was going to be

1976
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:47,698
drafted and um started smoking cannabis

1977
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:50,640
when he was in Vietnam

1978
01:16:47,698 --> 01:16:54,238
and uh brought back the habit or the

1979
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:56,340
Hobby and started growing in 1969 as

1980
01:16:54,238 --> 01:16:59,359
soon as he got home and he was taking

1981
01:16:56,340 --> 01:17:02,340
Horticultural classes at the University

1982
01:16:59,359 --> 01:17:04,319
in Seattle and the University of

1983
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:07,319
Washington and it's funny because he's

1984
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:10,738
in his 70s now and he is still taking

1985
01:17:07,319 --> 01:17:13,198
university courses online and he shares

1986
01:17:10,738 --> 01:17:15,718
with me links constantly about you know

1987
01:17:13,198 --> 01:17:18,238
testing sugar content in your plants and

1988
01:17:15,719 --> 01:17:21,060
like how to avoid different diseases and

1989
01:17:18,238 --> 01:17:23,759
like light penetration and he's such an

1990
01:17:21,060 --> 01:17:26,699
avid learner and I absolutely adore it I

1991
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:30,179
absolutely hope I have his uh Vigor for

1992
01:17:26,698 --> 01:17:32,279
Life uh when um his age I guess it's not

1993
01:17:30,179 --> 01:17:34,020
that long I'm [ __ ] 50 now so I'm

1994
01:17:32,279 --> 01:17:37,198
gonna just keep up with the health food

1995
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:39,120
but it's it's really cool and uh and he

1996
01:17:37,198 --> 01:17:42,359
just kept it up I mean I think he met

1997
01:17:39,119 --> 01:17:45,179
Murphy Stevens in around sometime in the

1998
01:17:42,359 --> 01:17:46,920
70s mid 70s after the book came out and

1999
01:17:45,179 --> 01:17:49,619
he said to me that he first got those

2000
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:52,199
four seeds from her therapy Stevens in

2001
01:17:49,619 --> 01:17:55,198
1979 and it was one of the you know the

2002
01:17:52,198 --> 01:17:56,879
best Afghans that he had ever gotten up

2003
01:17:55,198 --> 01:17:58,799
to that point

2004
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:01,739
um because a lot of the hippies

2005
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:03,539
initially were breeding with more

2006
01:18:01,738 --> 01:18:06,238
tropical varieties that were coming in

2007
01:18:03,539 --> 01:18:08,219
Thai Vietnam Mexican Colombian these are

2008
01:18:06,238 --> 01:18:09,599
all semi-tropical it wasn't until the

2009
01:18:08,219 --> 01:18:11,819
hippies started coming back from the

2010
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:15,000
hippie trail with the Afghan varieties

2011
01:18:11,819 --> 01:18:18,719
in the mid 70s that these uh skunky

2012
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:20,760
stinky uh earthy uh tones were kind of

2013
01:18:18,719 --> 01:18:24,119
brought in and these fast flowering

2014
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:26,520
heavy yielding broad leaflet varieties

2015
01:18:24,119 --> 01:18:29,158
where we're starting to get brought into

2016
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:30,900
it original skunk one started as one of

2017
01:18:29,158 --> 01:18:34,379
these Afghans crossed with Colombian

2018
01:18:30,899 --> 01:18:36,179
gold and that was skunk and then he took

2019
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:38,520
that plant and crossed it with

2020
01:18:36,179 --> 01:18:40,260
everything he had until he realized that

2021
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:43,320
when he crossed it with Acapulco Gold

2022
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:45,719
the dot combination of genetics when you

2023
01:18:43,319 --> 01:18:47,639
grew out the Prodigy and you spread The

2024
01:18:45,719 --> 01:18:50,340
Prodigy together would be consistent

2025
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:52,079
uniform so he did that with all of the

2026
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:54,420
different ones he had and through the

2027
01:18:52,079 --> 01:18:56,880
Muay once you realize oh this is the

2028
01:18:54,420 --> 01:18:59,340
right genetic lock in order to go with

2029
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:01,500
what I'm doing uh really unique I mean a

2030
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:03,480
lot of people won't spend the time well

2031
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:05,340
you know he always if you ever could

2032
01:19:03,479 --> 01:19:07,399
talk to him he'll say you know he kills

2033
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:09,719
plants more than he grows them

2034
01:19:07,399 --> 01:19:11,939
but I get it you know what I mean

2035
01:19:09,719 --> 01:19:13,439
because you can't get attached man if it

2036
01:19:11,939 --> 01:19:15,178
doesn't meet the standards poop out of

2037
01:19:13,439 --> 01:19:17,639
the garden it goes and that's what

2038
01:19:15,179 --> 01:19:20,699
really makes great cannabis and uh and I

2039
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:22,260
think that a lot of the unfortunately uh

2040
01:19:20,698 --> 01:19:24,539
you know people that came along later

2041
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:26,280
weren't really working on the scale that

2042
01:19:24,539 --> 01:19:28,380
he was working on you know tens of

2043
01:19:26,279 --> 01:19:31,500
thousands of plants at a time you know

2044
01:19:28,380 --> 01:19:34,260
uh 50 000 skunk seats or 50 000 original

2045
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:35,939
acids in a single 50 000 square meter

2046
01:19:34,260 --> 01:19:39,739
Greenhouse going off at once and

2047
01:19:35,939 --> 01:19:42,479
creating you know more seeds of its own

2048
01:19:39,738 --> 01:19:45,178
varieties something a lot of us don't

2049
01:19:42,479 --> 01:19:47,698
get the opportunity to do so he was in a

2050
01:19:45,179 --> 01:19:49,020
position to kind of maintain his genetic

2051
01:19:47,698 --> 01:19:52,198
gene pool

2052
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:54,000
on a level that few others were and when

2053
01:19:52,198 --> 01:19:56,639
he you know from my interviews with him

2054
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:58,079
my conversations uh when he was doing

2055
01:19:56,640 --> 01:20:00,300
order form

2056
01:19:58,079 --> 01:20:02,219
there's no limit on seeds nobody cared

2057
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:04,679
about the seeds you know there's no drug

2058
01:20:02,219 --> 01:20:07,020
content on the seeds and of course you

2059
01:20:04,679 --> 01:20:09,420
need to save the seeds because you need

2060
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:13,380
to grow more plants so the one thing he

2061
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:16,199
could do was really intense reading and

2062
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:20,420
saving of genetics so he was in a really

2063
01:20:16,198 --> 01:20:24,419
unique position uh that unfortunately

2064
01:20:20,420 --> 01:20:26,520
small scale seed companies you know any

2065
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:27,899
name any of them just weren't in a

2066
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:31,199
position to do

2067
01:20:27,899 --> 01:20:32,759
yeah the position a few of us will

2068
01:20:31,198 --> 01:20:35,039
probably ever be able to find ourselves

2069
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:37,140
in sadly I just wanted to bring you back

2070
01:20:35,039 --> 01:20:40,979
for a moment to the Steve Murphy's

2071
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:43,199
Afghani the purest Indica did they ever

2072
01:20:40,979 --> 01:20:45,119
have a cutting they kept or they just

2073
01:20:43,198 --> 01:20:47,279
used the seeds every year and as a

2074
01:20:45,119 --> 01:20:48,539
follow-up what type of Afghani do you

2075
01:20:47,279 --> 01:20:51,658
think it is do you think it was just

2076
01:20:48,539 --> 01:20:54,238
like a a hash plant or like more akin to

2077
01:20:51,658 --> 01:20:56,519
Afghani number one

2078
01:20:54,238 --> 01:20:58,259
um Afghani number one I got Afghani

2079
01:20:56,520 --> 01:21:00,540
number one you know I sell Mel Frank's

2080
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:03,719
seeds Mel Frank is 77 years old now

2081
01:21:00,539 --> 01:21:05,819
we've been friends for since 96 I met

2082
01:21:03,719 --> 01:21:07,020
him at positronics in Amsterdam one day

2083
01:21:05,819 --> 01:21:09,238
when he was walking through and he was

2084
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:11,460
complimenting some plants and I was the

2085
01:21:09,238 --> 01:21:14,099
one that was growing the plants

2086
01:21:11,460 --> 01:21:15,600
um and we got to talking and it was just

2087
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:17,400
a really good connection and we became

2088
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:22,560
friends we were best friends to this day

2089
01:21:17,399 --> 01:21:25,519
and um the Afghan number one is okay uh

2090
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:25,520
it's not

2091
01:21:25,859 --> 01:21:31,500
uh the Northern Lights purist Indica is

2092
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:32,719
really exceptional and the The Afghani

2093
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:36,179
number one

2094
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:38,640
has in my opinion some more tropical

2095
01:21:36,179 --> 01:21:42,300
influence in it it's not pure Afghan

2096
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:44,100
like the pierced Indica is and uh it's

2097
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:46,739
it's okay

2098
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:50,039
um it you know maybe I'm really sticky

2099
01:21:46,738 --> 01:21:52,379
too though because like you know like uh

2100
01:21:50,039 --> 01:21:54,420
you know when you have one thing and you

2101
01:21:52,380 --> 01:21:55,800
think it's great it's because sometimes

2102
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:58,440
you don't have things to compare it to

2103
01:21:55,800 --> 01:22:00,539
and then when I had other things I when

2104
01:21:58,439 --> 01:22:03,299
I had an Afghan one initially I thought

2105
01:22:00,539 --> 01:22:04,800
it was great you know but then I got all

2106
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:06,779
these Northern Lights plants and these

2107
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:08,640
Afghans the purest Indica from Greg and

2108
01:22:06,779 --> 01:22:10,800
I thought whoa that's really incredible

2109
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:12,420
so it changed my perspective of

2110
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:13,679
afghaning number one

2111
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:15,840
um

2112
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:17,819
but you know I I'm gonna sound like a

2113
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:18,840
jerk too but I don't really like driven

2114
01:22:17,819 --> 01:22:20,819
poison

2115
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:24,119
um I sell the seeds because it's

2116
01:22:20,819 --> 01:22:25,679
authentic Urban Poison and it has a real

2117
01:22:24,119 --> 01:22:28,079
it's got a great bud structure it's

2118
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:30,359
super fast it's got great resin a lot of

2119
01:22:28,079 --> 01:22:32,819
people smoke it love it so you know

2120
01:22:30,359 --> 01:22:35,639
Screw my opinion but it's it's not one

2121
01:22:32,819 --> 01:22:37,079
of my favorite varieties uh but you know

2122
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:38,760
what I've been trying to do with the sea

2123
01:22:37,079 --> 01:22:42,960
company is really make these available

2124
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:44,000
to people because I don't know the you

2125
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:46,560
know

2126
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:48,000
the cannabinoids that'll be fine or the

2127
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:50,340
terpene combinations that will be found

2128
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:52,079
and I think there's still a lot to be

2129
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:55,199
found in these genetics and I think all

2130
01:22:52,079 --> 01:22:57,719
of the genetics are medically uh useful

2131
01:22:55,198 --> 01:23:00,359
it's just a matter of of identifying

2132
01:22:57,719 --> 01:23:02,698
them and uh and finding them into

2133
01:23:00,359 --> 01:23:04,799
medical utility and I think that's

2134
01:23:02,698 --> 01:23:06,899
starting to happen and I'm

2135
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:08,820
you know there'll come a day I believe

2136
01:23:06,899 --> 01:23:10,559
when when people will go in and they'll

2137
01:23:08,819 --> 01:23:12,179
have their endocannabinoid system tested

2138
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:13,560
and they'll be able to just look like

2139
01:23:12,179 --> 01:23:14,699
they look at your blood and they can

2140
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:17,400
tell you what vitamins and minerals

2141
01:23:14,698 --> 01:23:19,019
you're deficient in and they'll be able

2142
01:23:17,399 --> 01:23:21,059
to you know pull off the shelf all of

2143
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:23,699
these various

2144
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:27,480
um single cannabinoids put them together

2145
01:23:23,698 --> 01:23:30,000
and maybe add some terpenes uh for uh

2146
01:23:27,479 --> 01:23:32,099
you know a bit of an uh

2147
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:34,260
I hate to use the word entourage but

2148
01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:37,199
it's it's it's more of an ensemble

2149
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:38,940
effect and uh and and the way they

2150
01:23:37,198 --> 01:23:40,859
synergistically work together will be

2151
01:23:38,939 --> 01:23:43,799
how we use it to battle once our

2152
01:23:40,859 --> 01:23:45,839
endocannabinoid system and um the more

2153
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:47,699
we have these genetics available and the

2154
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:50,340
more people can start to grow them and

2155
01:23:47,698 --> 01:23:52,559
test them and and discover them you know

2156
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:54,600
the more we're going to have more colors

2157
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:56,400
we're gonna have to pull from when we're

2158
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:58,380
turning around and trying to you know

2159
01:23:56,399 --> 01:24:00,479
color in our life and make it make it

2160
01:23:58,380 --> 01:24:01,920
better you know because I you know

2161
01:24:00,479 --> 01:24:04,500
obviously I've had cancer a bunch of

2162
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:06,119
times I'm pretty certain we're all gonna

2163
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:08,520
die at the end of this wonderfully short

2164
01:24:06,119 --> 01:24:11,039
trip but it's about our quality of life

2165
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:13,380
it's really about you know the time

2166
01:24:11,039 --> 01:24:15,060
you're present and being present and

2167
01:24:13,380 --> 01:24:17,940
treating you know time like it's a

2168
01:24:15,060 --> 01:24:20,760
present and really appreciating it and I

2169
01:24:17,939 --> 01:24:23,639
think cannabis plays this really key

2170
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:25,140
fundamental role in our wellness and I

2171
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:27,600
think this really becomes a conversation

2172
01:24:25,140 --> 01:24:29,520
about Wellness uh more than it's a

2173
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:31,860
conversation about you know getting high

2174
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:34,140
on a Friday night you know and feeling

2175
01:24:31,859 --> 01:24:36,000
good and I think more people are going

2176
01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:38,159
to start to understand that as they come

2177
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,899
to understand they that they have an

2178
01:24:38,158 --> 01:24:41,339
endocannabinoid system and that it can

2179
01:24:39,899 --> 01:24:43,738
help balance them better than

2180
01:24:41,340 --> 01:24:45,480
Pharmaceuticals or better than heroin or

2181
01:24:43,738 --> 01:24:47,279
better than alcohol or better than

2182
01:24:45,479 --> 01:24:48,899
smoking cigarettes

2183
01:24:47,279 --> 01:24:51,719
um a lot of people I think are going to

2184
01:24:48,899 --> 01:24:54,658
turn to cannabis like you and I have

2185
01:24:51,719 --> 01:24:56,219
um and uh really help help their life

2186
01:24:54,658 --> 01:24:58,679
considerably

2187
01:24:56,219 --> 01:25:01,079
yeah here here hopefully hopefully the

2188
01:24:58,679 --> 01:25:03,260
medical sort of improvements lead to

2189
01:25:01,079 --> 01:25:06,000
exactly that it would be fantastic

2190
01:25:03,260 --> 01:25:06,960
something a little left of field but I

2191
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,420
thought you might have a good

2192
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:11,640
perspective on was often when we talk to

2193
01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:14,760
guests about the really old school

2194
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:16,739
genetics they reference how they really

2195
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:18,539
like them because there was no ceiling

2196
01:25:16,738 --> 01:25:20,639
you know weed these days it only gets

2197
01:25:18,539 --> 01:25:22,679
you so high and I guess I'd be

2198
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:25,260
interested in hearing your thoughts on

2199
01:25:22,679 --> 01:25:27,359
the ceiling effect and what it is like

2200
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:29,460
how does it occur is it just do it is it

2201
01:25:27,359 --> 01:25:31,019
just land races have no ceiling and we

2202
01:25:29,460 --> 01:25:32,520
hybridize things they get ceilings

2203
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:34,260
what's your thoughts

2204
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:35,760
I get what they're saying I mean I've

2205
01:25:34,260 --> 01:25:37,140
been sitting here for an hour and 32

2206
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:38,640
minutes too and I've only managed to

2207
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:41,340
smoke half a joint of this stuff and

2208
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:43,260
it's a lot because with the haze you

2209
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:44,880
feel it you know like you hit it and you

2210
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:46,079
feel it and you can put it down for a

2211
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:47,760
minute because you're like self

2212
01:25:46,079 --> 01:25:51,960
titration happens quickly when you're

2213
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:54,659
smoking this and I I I get it I mostly I

2214
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:56,579
feel like with the haze varieties that

2215
01:25:54,658 --> 01:25:58,379
this that you can keep getting higher

2216
01:25:56,579 --> 01:25:59,819
and higher and higher but I feel like

2217
01:25:58,380 --> 01:26:01,380
you end up doing what I'm doing which is

2218
01:25:59,819 --> 01:26:02,819
you hit it a little bit and go whoa whoa

2219
01:26:01,380 --> 01:26:05,219
I'm doing an interview I gotta keep my

2220
01:26:02,819 --> 01:26:07,380
[ __ ] and you end up putting it down

2221
01:26:05,219 --> 01:26:09,539
um I find half joints of haze all over

2222
01:26:07,380 --> 01:26:11,340
my head hurts all the time and I think

2223
01:26:09,539 --> 01:26:13,679
that's because I get really hyped and I

2224
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:16,500
put them down and then I get distracted

2225
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:19,139
and I am so high I forget I leave the

2226
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:21,539
joint there and um I don't do that as

2227
01:26:19,139 --> 01:26:23,460
much with uh more of the modern

2228
01:26:21,539 --> 01:26:26,158
varieties unfortunately if I go to the

2229
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:28,560
store in California buy some pot I'm not

2230
01:26:26,158 --> 01:26:31,379
that impressed and uh I've been

2231
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:33,360
fortunate enough to be a Cannabis Cup uh

2232
01:26:31,380 --> 01:26:35,579
judge for high times for the emblem cup

2233
01:26:33,359 --> 01:26:37,738
uh for the secret cup I've been a

2234
01:26:35,579 --> 01:26:40,198
photographer for them uh for chalice

2235
01:26:37,738 --> 01:26:41,339
I've been a judge uh so I've had some

2236
01:26:40,198 --> 01:26:43,979
exposure

2237
01:26:41,340 --> 01:26:45,600
um to cannabis unfortunately a lot of

2238
01:26:43,979 --> 01:26:49,198
the Cannabis floating around California

2239
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:51,360
is quite homogeneous and it's very

2240
01:26:49,198 --> 01:26:54,299
similar there's not a lot of standouts

2241
01:26:51,359 --> 01:26:57,359
what they call Haze isn't really Haze

2242
01:26:54,300 --> 01:27:00,659
um I was judging concentrates and I sat

2243
01:26:57,359 --> 01:27:02,579
down next to the gentleman that owns um

2244
01:27:00,658 --> 01:27:04,738
I would I'll just say a gentleman that

2245
01:27:02,579 --> 01:27:07,198
was one of the bigger extraction

2246
01:27:04,738 --> 01:27:09,059
companies and um he always gives me what

2247
01:27:07,198 --> 01:27:11,638
a little jar with everybody smoking and

2248
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:13,679
uh I gave him mine and I had made some

2249
01:27:11,639 --> 01:27:16,199
extract out of haze and he opened it and

2250
01:27:13,679 --> 01:27:19,260
he smelled it and he was like

2251
01:27:16,198 --> 01:27:20,638
what is this and I was like that's

2252
01:27:19,260 --> 01:27:23,039
original Haze

2253
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:24,659
um and he was just like holy [ __ ] and we

2254
01:27:23,039 --> 01:27:26,760
were sent with maybe a hundred plus

2255
01:27:24,658 --> 01:27:27,960
samples in front of us and I made the

2256
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:29,880
comment and I said you know what's weird

2257
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:33,420
after smoking all this stuff I feel like

2258
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:35,400
I could put this Haze jar down and it

2259
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:38,399
would stand out out of all of these and

2260
01:27:35,399 --> 01:27:40,559
he goes oh it's a it's absolutely unlike

2261
01:27:38,399 --> 01:27:43,738
everything else here and we had I think

2262
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:45,739
119 samples in front of us that year and

2263
01:27:43,738 --> 01:27:47,698
it's just because

2264
01:27:45,738 --> 01:27:48,899
Growers didn't want to spend the extra

2265
01:27:47,698 --> 01:27:50,819
time I mean you take Northern California

2266
01:27:48,899 --> 01:27:52,738
into an example you know when you get

2267
01:27:50,819 --> 01:27:54,719
North or San Francisco it's not the most

2268
01:27:52,738 --> 01:27:58,079
hospitable place to grow cannabis your

2269
01:27:54,719 --> 01:28:00,480
ability of variety is limited uh by your

2270
01:27:58,079 --> 01:28:03,000
early Winters your early rain your heavy

2271
01:28:00,479 --> 01:28:04,799
humidity that Coastal fog it's a

2272
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:06,658
challenge I mean I have hats off to

2273
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:08,039
everybody in Northern California that

2274
01:28:06,658 --> 01:28:09,719
can turn out really high quality

2275
01:28:08,039 --> 01:28:11,158
cannabis and there are a lot of people

2276
01:28:09,719 --> 01:28:13,079
who do

2277
01:28:11,158 --> 01:28:14,879
um but they're not growing no three-way

2278
01:28:13,079 --> 01:28:18,000
Columbia Haze up there until December

2279
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:20,100
with that weather and so they're limited

2280
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:21,899
so because they're limited to their

2281
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:23,699
environment we see the limit to their

2282
01:28:21,899 --> 01:28:25,920
genetics that they offer as well the

2283
01:28:23,698 --> 01:28:27,960
emerald cup is my favorite event in the

2284
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:30,480
world and everybody should visit it but

2285
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:32,939
when you go to the animal cup most of

2286
01:28:30,479 --> 01:28:35,759
all those varieties have always been

2287
01:28:32,939 --> 01:28:37,439
under 10 week varieties only last year

2288
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:39,480
when I was there taking photos for Girl

2289
01:28:37,439 --> 01:28:41,519
magazine and they had all of the

2290
01:28:39,479 --> 01:28:45,359
varieties separated by their dominant

2291
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:48,360
terpene it is the future man and and so

2292
01:28:45,359 --> 01:28:50,219
now now you've got orange competing with

2293
01:28:48,359 --> 01:28:52,259
orange and you've got gas competing with

2294
01:28:50,219 --> 01:28:54,239
gas and you've got sweet tropical with

2295
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:56,639
sweet tropical and you've got you know

2296
01:28:54,238 --> 01:28:58,738
hazy you know train wreck type varieties

2297
01:28:56,639 --> 01:29:00,239
competing with hazy train wreck type

2298
01:28:58,738 --> 01:29:02,759
varieties and you're not trying to

2299
01:29:00,238 --> 01:29:06,539
compare you know California Orange to OG

2300
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:08,520
Kush which are completely different and

2301
01:29:06,539 --> 01:29:10,380
um by breaking it down into your

2302
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:11,699
dominant terpene category you're

2303
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:13,619
starting to get a better understanding

2304
01:29:11,698 --> 01:29:15,599
of which like let's go back to Colors

2305
01:29:13,619 --> 01:29:17,939
which primary color group did that

2306
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:20,480
variety happens to fall into because if

2307
01:29:17,939 --> 01:29:23,460
it's pinene or if it's terpineline or

2308
01:29:20,479 --> 01:29:26,099
Mercy dominant it's going to fall into

2309
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:29,100
that group you know aligning dominant

2310
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:31,920
terpene plant is going to smell lemony

2311
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:34,500
period so group them together judge them

2312
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:37,440
for what they are and I think that's

2313
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:39,179
really neat unfortunately it wasn't very

2314
01:29:37,439 --> 01:29:41,039
much when it came to really hazy

2315
01:29:39,179 --> 01:29:43,380
varieties offered at the time because

2316
01:29:41,039 --> 01:29:46,619
again it's an organic Northern

2317
01:29:43,380 --> 01:29:49,199
California event and when they move down

2318
01:29:46,619 --> 01:29:50,880
to maybe you know

2319
01:29:49,198 --> 01:29:52,439
they're not really growing it in Santa

2320
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:54,840
Barbara yet either but when you see

2321
01:29:52,439 --> 01:29:57,719
Growers starting to grow cannabis in

2322
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:59,300
areas that are more warm and they can

2323
01:29:57,719 --> 01:30:02,760
leave plants in the ground until

2324
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:04,560
November December you know uh when you

2325
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:06,360
start getting south of Santa Cruz and

2326
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:08,280
California you start to experience this

2327
01:30:06,359 --> 01:30:10,738
type of you know summer all the time

2328
01:30:08,279 --> 01:30:12,960
weather and there's really two

2329
01:30:10,738 --> 01:30:15,359
distinctly different weather patterns in

2330
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:18,420
Northern California that split around

2331
01:30:15,359 --> 01:30:21,119
Pismo Beach North of of Santa Barbara

2332
01:30:18,420 --> 01:30:23,520
and Santa Barbara South you've got hot

2333
01:30:21,119 --> 01:30:25,619
sunny days you know all year long and

2334
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:27,480
then north of Santa Barbara you start to

2335
01:30:25,619 --> 01:30:30,179
get more wintry as you get more North

2336
01:30:27,479 --> 01:30:31,138
and you know people are going to start

2337
01:30:30,179 --> 01:30:33,420
growing

2338
01:30:31,139 --> 01:30:35,219
you know these long flowering varieties

2339
01:30:33,420 --> 01:30:37,560
in places like Northern Santa Barbara

2340
01:30:35,219 --> 01:30:39,600
and Santa Barbara and L.A and and

2341
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:41,400
further south and it's going to be

2342
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:43,860
fantastic and I think you're going to

2343
01:30:41,399 --> 01:30:46,799
experience cannabis like we haven't

2344
01:30:43,859 --> 01:30:48,599
experienced in decades because a lot of

2345
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:50,940
the Cannabis coming in in the 50s and

2346
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:52,920
60s was coming in from tropical

2347
01:30:50,939 --> 01:30:54,839
semi-tropical places

2348
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:57,119
um that changed when we started getting

2349
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:59,639
stuff from Afghan and then the 70s when

2350
01:30:57,119 --> 01:31:01,319
the hippies and others started mixing

2351
01:30:59,639 --> 01:31:03,119
together hippies and the soldiers

2352
01:31:01,319 --> 01:31:04,859
started greeting together various

2353
01:31:03,119 --> 01:31:06,899
varieties of cannabis and coming out

2354
01:31:04,859 --> 01:31:09,420
with the hybrids that we the haze the

2355
01:31:06,899 --> 01:31:12,299
skunk the Hindu Kush the Calio The

2356
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:14,880
Afghani one uh the Durban you know we

2357
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:17,340
could go on and on about what became of

2358
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:18,840
those land race varieties that those

2359
01:31:17,340 --> 01:31:20,940
guys originally got in the first place

2360
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:22,860
and then morphed them into the varieties

2361
01:31:20,939 --> 01:31:24,960
that we know today and then those

2362
01:31:22,859 --> 01:31:26,880
primary varieties were crossed together

2363
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:29,340
to make a lot of the wedding cakes and

2364
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:30,900
the the Skittles and the runts and the

2365
01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:32,940
stuff that we are now referencing to

2366
01:31:30,899 --> 01:31:35,279
today okay because none of that stuff

2367
01:31:32,939 --> 01:31:37,799
was bred from brand new land race

2368
01:31:35,279 --> 01:31:40,019
crosses it was all bred from you know

2369
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:43,020
the seeds they got on you know vacation

2370
01:31:40,020 --> 01:31:45,300
to you know Amsterdam or through a

2371
01:31:43,020 --> 01:31:48,000
friend who was already growing and you

2372
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:50,100
know quality was just passed on passed

2373
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:52,139
on because you know why go through all

2374
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:54,000
that [ __ ] and try to you know recreate

2375
01:31:52,139 --> 01:31:57,119
the work others have done successfully

2376
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:59,219
when you can take skunk one seeds grow

2377
01:31:57,119 --> 01:32:01,500
them out and then take another variety

2378
01:31:59,219 --> 01:32:03,840
grow them out mix them together and

2379
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:05,639
everybody claps at you because you know

2380
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:07,500
you're a DJ and they didn't think of

2381
01:32:05,639 --> 01:32:09,239
mixing Together the Beatles White Album

2382
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:10,679
in the Jay-Z Black Album until they

2383
01:32:09,238 --> 01:32:13,439
heard your gray album and then they're

2384
01:32:10,679 --> 01:32:17,399
like oh that's the [ __ ] you know and

2385
01:32:13,439 --> 01:32:18,960
and um again not musicians but still

2386
01:32:17,399 --> 01:32:20,279
you know I think the best thing these

2387
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:22,020
seed breeders today could do is give

2388
01:32:20,279 --> 01:32:23,460
credit where credits do the reason you

2389
01:32:22,020 --> 01:32:26,400
don't see me making up a lot of funny

2390
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:27,840
names on my seed website is because I'm

2391
01:32:26,399 --> 01:32:30,000
just trying to give credit where credits

2392
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:32,520
do I'm not trying to come in and pretend

2393
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:34,619
like you know you know I'm not you know

2394
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:36,780
Reinventing the wheel I mean I do make

2395
01:32:34,619 --> 01:32:39,238
varieties that are unique to me that are

2396
01:32:36,779 --> 01:32:41,219
unique to my company but usually those

2397
01:32:39,238 --> 01:32:43,259
in those cases I just call them what I

2398
01:32:41,219 --> 01:32:45,239
made it out of because I want to leave

2399
01:32:43,260 --> 01:32:47,820
breadcrumbs for the people who buy my

2400
01:32:45,238 --> 01:32:49,799
seeds so that they'll kind of know where

2401
01:32:47,819 --> 01:32:51,960
to go with their crosses because then it

2402
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:53,699
gives them it's like a dog or pedigree

2403
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:56,399
information and if they have the

2404
01:32:53,698 --> 01:32:58,979
pedigree information you know maybe they

2405
01:32:56,399 --> 01:33:00,299
can make a better cross after they get

2406
01:32:58,979 --> 01:33:02,459
my seeds and they cross them with

2407
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:04,139
something they have and I encourage it I

2408
01:33:02,460 --> 01:33:06,840
think it's great where I think it's kind

2409
01:33:04,139 --> 01:33:09,060
of shady is when you know I sent I sent

2410
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:11,100
a company seeds in February seven months

2411
01:33:09,060 --> 01:33:12,840
later they knocked off those seeds

2412
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:15,179
claiming that now they finally have

2413
01:33:12,840 --> 01:33:17,760
skunk and then they they told a brand

2414
01:33:15,179 --> 01:33:20,460
new story about skunk one said Sam the

2415
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:23,119
skunk man got out of jail in 1981 and

2416
01:33:20,460 --> 01:33:26,698
the these seeds came to France in like

2417
01:33:23,119 --> 01:33:29,639
1974 kilo and it's all [ __ ] man like

2418
01:33:26,698 --> 01:33:31,019
Sam didn't even make skunk one in 1974.

2419
01:33:29,639 --> 01:33:33,179
it didn't come around till after that

2420
01:33:31,020 --> 01:33:34,980
and these people that come and they try

2421
01:33:33,179 --> 01:33:37,859
to reinvent the history to benefit

2422
01:33:34,979 --> 01:33:39,658
themselves I think that [ __ ] and I think

2423
01:33:37,859 --> 01:33:41,698
that's shady and I think they should get

2424
01:33:39,658 --> 01:33:44,039
called out for it because I think that

2425
01:33:41,698 --> 01:33:47,339
you know the Cannabis Community deserves

2426
01:33:44,039 --> 01:33:50,158
an authentic and and and real history

2427
01:33:47,340 --> 01:33:53,760
and not a history that's been maligned

2428
01:33:50,158 --> 01:33:55,198
by marketing uh people you know that

2429
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:57,659
we're trying to Market their seeds or

2430
01:33:55,198 --> 01:34:00,000
Market their company and trying to you

2431
01:33:57,658 --> 01:34:01,619
know you know basically steal the wind

2432
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:04,698
out of the sales of others because

2433
01:34:01,619 --> 01:34:07,380
they're still doing it to this day

2434
01:34:04,698 --> 01:34:08,939
this is invariably uh one of the

2435
01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:10,199
discussion points I thought we were

2436
01:34:08,939 --> 01:34:11,879
going to have to touch on which

2437
01:34:10,198 --> 01:34:14,819
hopefully give people a bit more

2438
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:16,800
background but yeah as you just alluded

2439
01:34:14,819 --> 01:34:19,079
to you know that there has been some

2440
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:20,520
sort of ongoing what's the word they use

2441
01:34:19,079 --> 01:34:23,698
in the news there's been robust

2442
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:27,780
conversations between yourself and

2443
01:34:23,698 --> 01:34:30,479
Aficionado around a skunk release I was

2444
01:34:27,779 --> 01:34:32,340
just wondering if you could give us a

2445
01:34:30,479 --> 01:34:34,799
little bit more of the back story on

2446
01:34:32,340 --> 01:34:37,619
that I mean simply put they contacted me

2447
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:40,079
uh actually way back in July of 2020

2448
01:34:37,619 --> 01:34:42,359
asking me proceeds uh because they were

2449
01:34:40,079 --> 01:34:43,198
following what I was doing and I told

2450
01:34:42,359 --> 01:34:45,179
them they weren't going to be available

2451
01:34:43,198 --> 01:34:46,198
yet I told them they'd be available in

2452
01:34:45,179 --> 01:34:49,079
probably like seven eight months

2453
01:34:46,198 --> 01:34:51,119
February of 2021 they contacted me

2454
01:34:49,079 --> 01:34:54,019
saying hey can you know we saw them on

2455
01:34:51,119 --> 01:34:55,920
your website can we get some and

2456
01:34:54,020 --> 01:34:57,360
unfortunately or fortunately you know

2457
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:59,699
it's weird I almost didn't sell them the

2458
01:34:57,359 --> 01:35:01,319
seeds because I I they have it bad they

2459
01:34:59,698 --> 01:35:02,759
have a reputation we'll just say of

2460
01:35:01,319 --> 01:35:05,279
doing this with other varieties and

2461
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:08,579
other people and I I've had words with

2462
01:35:05,279 --> 01:35:12,539
Leo uh who's Aficionado here in

2463
01:35:08,579 --> 01:35:15,300
California in the past and um you know

2464
01:35:12,539 --> 01:35:17,158
it is what it is but they contacted me

2465
01:35:15,300 --> 01:35:19,800
through Frenchie cannoli and I just I

2466
01:35:17,158 --> 01:35:21,839
adore Frenchie he's since we met we were

2467
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:23,159
friends like I got nothing but love for

2468
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:24,779
him I think he was one of the most

2469
01:35:23,158 --> 01:35:28,019
authentic

2470
01:35:24,779 --> 01:35:30,479
people who had such a true passion and

2471
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:34,320
for cannabis and I will miss him forever

2472
01:35:30,479 --> 01:35:36,238
and I I'm crushed that he's gone and I

2473
01:35:34,319 --> 01:35:37,799
you know I've absolutely got nothing but

2474
01:35:36,238 --> 01:35:40,799
love for Frenchie

2475
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:42,719
for sure but they were looking for the

2476
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:44,880
skunk genetics and they were very

2477
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:47,039
upfront about that and they contacted me

2478
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:48,779
and I you know this is why after he said

2479
01:35:47,039 --> 01:35:50,760
I was a liar I posted the conversation

2480
01:35:48,779 --> 01:35:52,859
up on Instagram because I'm not a liar

2481
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:54,900
and I would never misinterpret the truth

2482
01:35:52,859 --> 01:35:57,000
and I'm just not it's not my thing and

2483
01:35:54,899 --> 01:35:59,039
uh I'm not afraid of the ramifications

2484
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:01,319
of Truth so I don't have to lie so

2485
01:35:59,039 --> 01:36:03,359
anyone who has to lie can go for

2486
01:36:01,319 --> 01:36:06,000
themselves in my opinion so that's just

2487
01:36:03,359 --> 01:36:07,439
how I feel and uh so I got him the

2488
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,479
genetics I sent him some seeds I sent

2489
01:36:07,439 --> 01:36:11,158
him roadkill I sent them skunk one I

2490
01:36:09,479 --> 01:36:12,718
even sent them extra C's I sent some for

2491
01:36:11,158 --> 01:36:14,939
Frenchie so he'd have some to grow in

2492
01:36:12,719 --> 01:36:18,239
his house

2493
01:36:14,939 --> 01:36:20,519
um and uh yeah and uh then

2494
01:36:18,238 --> 01:36:22,799
they get the seeds like February 26th

2495
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:25,020
and then you know end of August end of

2496
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:29,279
August they released that bam they got

2497
01:36:25,020 --> 01:36:31,500
skunk one seeds now they f2'd their 1974

2498
01:36:29,279 --> 01:36:33,000
seeds from a kilo and told this

2499
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:36,000
elaborate story that was not such

2500
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:38,340
[ __ ] and people in the community I

2501
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:39,719
think also recognized it as [ __ ] and

2502
01:36:38,340 --> 01:36:41,940
started calling it out because I mean

2503
01:36:39,719 --> 01:36:44,698
skunk one of all the freaking varieties

2504
01:36:41,939 --> 01:36:46,019
to lie about why pick skunk one it's so

2505
01:36:44,698 --> 01:36:47,939
documented

2506
01:36:46,020 --> 01:36:50,159
um but he did and uh

2507
01:36:47,939 --> 01:36:51,960
and it was weird so I called them out on

2508
01:36:50,158 --> 01:36:53,698
it I mean I woke up that morning called

2509
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:55,619
the mud on it it actually happened a

2510
01:36:53,698 --> 01:36:57,658
little earlier though because when I got

2511
01:36:55,619 --> 01:37:00,000
the rks it was from that guy Jaime in

2512
01:36:57,658 --> 01:37:01,799
Alaska who's another great guy he's an

2513
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:04,500
old biker that's been growing forever in

2514
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:06,119
a day and um people gave him nothing but

2515
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:10,920
[ __ ] for saying that he had roadkill

2516
01:37:06,119 --> 01:37:10,920
skunk and uh he sent it to me and

2517
01:37:11,639 --> 01:37:17,819
you know it is it it is it is really

2518
01:37:15,060 --> 01:37:20,460
what he says it is it's just it's not as

2519
01:37:17,819 --> 01:37:23,158
strong as people would would

2520
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:25,020
uh want it to be and I said this to him

2521
01:37:23,158 --> 01:37:26,460
and I've been really upfront and honest

2522
01:37:25,020 --> 01:37:28,800
about this to a lot of people I said

2523
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:31,198
it's there but you're gonna have to look

2524
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:33,060
through plants to really find that one

2525
01:37:31,198 --> 01:37:34,859
that is going to blow you away and stink

2526
01:37:33,060 --> 01:37:37,679
out the car and you know be smelled down

2527
01:37:34,859 --> 01:37:39,479
the street but you know since this

2528
01:37:37,679 --> 01:37:41,039
conversation has started you know I

2529
01:37:39,479 --> 01:37:44,419
don't know how much you're into the

2530
01:37:41,039 --> 01:37:47,639
files so files are what I now believe

2531
01:37:44,420 --> 01:37:50,520
are the cause of the skunk acrid smell

2532
01:37:47,639 --> 01:37:53,039
in these plants humans can detect files

2533
01:37:50,520 --> 01:37:54,960
and parts per trillion and it makes it

2534
01:37:53,039 --> 01:37:57,600
hard for machines to even be able to

2535
01:37:54,960 --> 01:38:01,800
detect it in measurable amounts as well

2536
01:37:57,600 --> 01:38:03,960
so thiols are what I believe a lot of

2537
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:07,139
these Afghan varieties that smelled like

2538
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:09,899
urine and acrid dead flesh and and

2539
01:38:07,139 --> 01:38:11,639
skunks to Americans

2540
01:38:09,899 --> 01:38:13,259
um that's where a lot of this came from

2541
01:38:11,639 --> 01:38:16,619
because when you talk to Robert Clark

2542
01:38:13,260 --> 01:38:18,300
who is to me the foremost historian on

2543
01:38:16,619 --> 01:38:20,158
cannabis in the world

2544
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:23,579
um a lot of the more tropical varieties

2545
01:38:20,158 --> 01:38:27,000
have sweeter sense and a lot of these

2546
01:38:23,579 --> 01:38:28,738
more you know lemony and citrusy and

2547
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:31,319
Flowery tones we're getting are coming

2548
01:38:28,738 --> 01:38:34,979
from the Acapulco Gold the Colombians

2549
01:38:31,319 --> 01:38:37,019
the the Thais the Mexicans and such

2550
01:38:34,979 --> 01:38:38,939
um so these thiols are what I believe

2551
01:38:37,020 --> 01:38:41,639
initially when everybody started

2552
01:38:38,939 --> 01:38:44,519
breeding with the Afghans they all took

2553
01:38:41,639 --> 01:38:46,440
on this heavy scent but because the way

2554
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:49,080
humans work is that this is something

2555
01:38:46,439 --> 01:38:52,379
that when we smell makes my our brain

2556
01:38:49,079 --> 01:38:54,960
think oh this is going bad avoid it we

2557
01:38:52,380 --> 01:38:56,699
slowly bred away from it and bred

2558
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:58,380
towards the sense that we're more

2559
01:38:56,698 --> 01:39:02,158
appealing which were the fruity

2560
01:38:58,380 --> 01:39:03,719
flavorful tasty dessert type you know

2561
01:39:02,158 --> 01:39:05,339
when you walk go for a walk down the

2562
01:39:03,719 --> 01:39:07,679
street you do not stick your nose in a

2563
01:39:05,340 --> 01:39:10,920
pile of dog [ __ ] you stick your nose in

2564
01:39:07,679 --> 01:39:12,359
a rose you you smell flowers and and I

2565
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:14,760
think for cannabis cultivators

2566
01:39:12,359 --> 01:39:18,000
especially considering that that stench

2567
01:39:14,760 --> 01:39:21,420
of [ __ ] would get them busted they just

2568
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:24,479
all may be subconsciously be bred away

2569
01:39:21,420 --> 01:39:27,658
from the thiols and move towards the

2570
01:39:24,479 --> 01:39:29,399
more aromatic plants and

2571
01:39:27,658 --> 01:39:31,138
um I think that's what happened to

2572
01:39:29,399 --> 01:39:33,119
cannabis and I'm not even telling people

2573
01:39:31,139 --> 01:39:34,260
this but the purest Indica because I

2574
01:39:33,119 --> 01:39:37,198
don't want to see their heads explode

2575
01:39:34,260 --> 01:39:39,360
again really smells like [ __ ] skunk I

2576
01:39:37,198 --> 01:39:41,099
grew up I'm in California they get dead

2577
01:39:39,359 --> 01:39:43,439
skunks on my street my dogs come home

2578
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:45,000
skunks sometimes I've lived with skunk

2579
01:39:43,439 --> 01:39:46,079
since I was a little kid we have them in

2580
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:49,198
New England

2581
01:39:46,079 --> 01:39:52,079
um funny enough though their only North

2582
01:39:49,198 --> 01:39:54,658
American animals there are no skunks in

2583
01:39:52,079 --> 01:39:56,939
Europe none of them and none of my this

2584
01:39:54,658 --> 01:39:59,279
is what weirded me out when guys like

2585
01:39:56,939 --> 01:40:01,138
Ben were like oh I called it skunk I was

2586
01:39:59,279 --> 01:40:04,139
like Ben you've never visited America

2587
01:40:01,139 --> 01:40:07,679
how have you I asked have you ever seen

2588
01:40:04,139 --> 01:40:10,079
a skunk outside of Pepe Le Pew

2589
01:40:07,679 --> 01:40:12,658
like you mean a person yeah do you even

2590
01:40:10,079 --> 01:40:15,300
have them at your zoos no I don't think

2591
01:40:12,658 --> 01:40:17,158
we do okay so how would you know what a

2592
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:20,219
skunk smells like and if you spelled a

2593
01:40:17,158 --> 01:40:22,500
plant that smelled nasty like in the UK

2594
01:40:20,219 --> 01:40:23,880
they refer to it as cheese because if

2595
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:25,619
you go to the UK and you smell that

2596
01:40:23,880 --> 01:40:28,139
canasty ass [ __ ] that they probably can

2597
01:40:25,619 --> 01:40:30,179
eat and that nasty act that I didn't

2598
01:40:28,139 --> 01:40:32,460
call it cheese they wouldn't call it a

2599
01:40:30,179 --> 01:40:34,319
skunk because they don't have skunks in

2600
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:35,698
England so they wouldn't call it

2601
01:40:34,319 --> 01:40:38,340
something they don't have in the

2602
01:40:35,698 --> 01:40:40,198
Netherlands either so it makes sense to

2603
01:40:38,340 --> 01:40:41,639
an American when you smell it it smells

2604
01:40:40,198 --> 01:40:44,339
like [ __ ] smells like that skunk smells

2605
01:40:41,639 --> 01:40:47,940
like hacker and rancid nasty which also

2606
01:40:44,340 --> 01:40:50,639
contains thiols in the skunk spray so

2607
01:40:47,939 --> 01:40:52,799
the relationship to me makes sense and

2608
01:40:50,639 --> 01:40:54,779
these you know the skunk one seeds that

2609
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:58,020
I currently have I have only been

2610
01:40:54,779 --> 01:41:00,479
reproduced twice since the 1980s Skunk

2611
01:40:58,020 --> 01:41:02,460
Man Sam gave them to Mel Frank in 1988

2612
01:41:00,479 --> 01:41:05,819
he put them in the refrigerator until

2613
01:41:02,460 --> 01:41:07,560
1996 and then reproduced them in 96 put

2614
01:41:05,819 --> 01:41:10,139
those reproductions in the refrigerator

2615
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:12,539
and left him there until he took him out

2616
01:41:10,139 --> 01:41:14,219
in 2019 and gave him to me I started

2617
01:41:12,539 --> 01:41:17,039
growing them out and realized [ __ ] these

2618
01:41:14,219 --> 01:41:19,319
things all still smell accurate they

2619
01:41:17,039 --> 01:41:20,880
don't smell sweet so I did a selection

2620
01:41:19,319 --> 01:41:22,799
of the most accurate plants filled my

2621
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:24,359
Greenhouse reproduced the seeds

2622
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:25,560
um they came out great people have been

2623
01:41:24,359 --> 01:41:27,599
loving them

2624
01:41:25,560 --> 01:41:29,639
um the people who don't grow them hate

2625
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:31,500
on me and say I don't really have scum

2626
01:41:29,639 --> 01:41:33,600
and the people who do grow them love

2627
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:36,300
them and say that they that skunk

2628
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:38,520
doesn't even as much skunk smell sweeter

2629
01:41:36,300 --> 01:41:40,860
than these plants one guy said you know

2630
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:43,440
so and I get it though because these

2631
01:41:40,859 --> 01:41:45,479
genetics are literally old they're

2632
01:41:43,439 --> 01:41:48,118
literally from the 80s they're literally

2633
01:41:45,479 --> 01:41:50,939
from way back when and then I got the

2634
01:41:48,118 --> 01:41:53,158
ones from Greg they're from what he says

2635
01:41:50,939 --> 01:41:55,799
from the earlier 80s

2636
01:41:53,158 --> 01:41:57,779
they still have these like files that

2637
01:41:55,800 --> 01:42:00,360
are present they still smell skunky to

2638
01:41:57,779 --> 01:42:02,460
me and I think that as we do more

2639
01:42:00,359 --> 01:42:04,979
selections the we are going to be able

2640
01:42:02,460 --> 01:42:07,920
to bring the funk back in much of these

2641
01:42:04,979 --> 01:42:10,259
Afghans if if we're looking for it if

2642
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:12,480
we're breeding towards

2643
01:42:10,260 --> 01:42:15,360
flavor and taste and you know trying to

2644
01:42:12,479 --> 01:42:17,218
make dessert recipe type flavors we're

2645
01:42:15,359 --> 01:42:19,799
obviously going to move away from thials

2646
01:42:17,219 --> 01:42:21,719
but if but if if people consciously do

2647
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:23,460
what I did which was throw out all the

2648
01:42:21,719 --> 01:42:25,679
sweet plants and breed together all the

2649
01:42:23,460 --> 01:42:28,079
stinky plants I think over time just

2650
01:42:25,679 --> 01:42:30,239
like we can manipulate uh terpene levels

2651
01:42:28,079 --> 01:42:33,000
and cannabinoid levels we could

2652
01:42:30,238 --> 01:42:35,819
manipulate thiol levels and raise them

2653
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:37,500
in future generations of plants and kind

2654
01:42:35,819 --> 01:42:41,238
of Bring It Back bring it back bring it

2655
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:44,219
back a little bit at a time so um

2656
01:42:41,238 --> 01:42:45,479
yeah it's been an interesting uh it's

2657
01:42:44,219 --> 01:42:47,880
been an interesting Journey because when

2658
01:42:45,479 --> 01:42:49,500
I first released Haze I had a lot of

2659
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:51,900
people saying you don't really have Haze

2660
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:54,300
and I was like [ __ ] you and then I

2661
01:42:51,899 --> 01:42:56,579
really skunk one and oh you really don't

2662
01:42:54,300 --> 01:42:59,699
have skunk nobody has skunk

2663
01:42:56,579 --> 01:43:01,380
ah you know and it was like whatever and

2664
01:42:59,698 --> 01:43:04,439
fortunately now with Northern Lights

2665
01:43:01,380 --> 01:43:06,719
nobody's giving me a hard time you know

2666
01:43:04,439 --> 01:43:08,698
but Greg is a little more uh active on

2667
01:43:06,719 --> 01:43:10,920
social media and it's a little different

2668
01:43:08,698 --> 01:43:13,500
but

2669
01:43:10,920 --> 01:43:15,300
um yeah I had a lot of naysayers at

2670
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:17,399
first and even skunk band Sam's been on

2671
01:43:15,300 --> 01:43:20,219
shows like Ashford said yeah Todd has my

2672
01:43:17,399 --> 01:43:22,439
seeds that's they're real and you know

2673
01:43:20,219 --> 01:43:24,600
and I don't know why it's so hard for a

2674
01:43:22,439 --> 01:43:26,939
lot of people to wanna that don't want

2675
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:29,039
to believe that you know I mean it's a

2676
01:43:26,939 --> 01:43:31,738
little ridiculous I actually saw like a

2677
01:43:29,039 --> 01:43:34,500
disparaging comment by uh what's the guy

2678
01:43:31,738 --> 01:43:36,718
that got the uh he got the

2679
01:43:34,500 --> 01:43:39,899
Tom Hill Hayes or whatever you got the

2680
01:43:36,719 --> 01:43:41,880
positronic seeds in 1996 and he brought

2681
01:43:39,899 --> 01:43:43,500
him home he made some seeds and he named

2682
01:43:41,880 --> 01:43:46,739
the haze after himself

2683
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:48,600
and I was living practically at posi I

2684
01:43:46,738 --> 01:43:51,959
had [ __ ] keys in my own office of

2685
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:54,000
Posse and I grew out those seeds and

2686
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:56,399
unfortunately they weren't that great at

2687
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:58,198
the time and and he bought them and

2688
01:43:56,399 --> 01:44:00,299
thinks they're awesome and I think

2689
01:43:58,198 --> 01:44:01,919
that's great but then I saw him on one

2690
01:44:00,300 --> 01:44:03,779
of the forums basically talking [ __ ]

2691
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:05,279
about he doesn't know what I have but

2692
01:44:03,779 --> 01:44:07,500
they can't be as good as what he had and

2693
01:44:05,279 --> 01:44:09,719
I'm thinking really I skipped over 10

2694
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:11,939
years of Bernard's breeding and went

2695
01:44:09,719 --> 01:44:14,219
right back to Skunk Man Sam and got the

2696
01:44:11,939 --> 01:44:15,839
original hay seeds from him and you

2697
01:44:14,219 --> 01:44:18,060
think the ones that I got from Sam are

2698
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:22,020
not as good as the ones you picked up

2699
01:44:18,060 --> 01:44:25,920
from positronics on a trip to High Times

2700
01:44:22,020 --> 01:44:29,699
I just blows my mind and I doubt

2701
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:32,158
honestly that Tom picked up thousands of

2702
01:44:29,698 --> 01:44:34,198
original hay seeds at positronics at the

2703
01:44:32,158 --> 01:44:36,479
time because one we didn't sell them in

2704
01:44:34,198 --> 01:44:38,638
very big packages and two most of the

2705
01:44:36,479 --> 01:44:40,919
people there were not buying thousands

2706
01:44:38,639 --> 01:44:43,380
of seeds when they got there and I have

2707
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:46,199
had thousands of original ACS to do my

2708
01:44:43,380 --> 01:44:48,359
selections through and I would tend to

2709
01:44:46,198 --> 01:44:49,799
believe it's like a lottery ticket the

2710
01:44:48,359 --> 01:44:51,899
more lottery tickets you have the more

2711
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:54,840
of a chance you have to win you know if

2712
01:44:51,899 --> 01:44:56,879
you went home with even a hundred seeds

2713
01:44:54,840 --> 01:44:58,679
I I can't imagine how you would get

2714
01:44:56,880 --> 01:45:00,118
selections as good as somebody who went

2715
01:44:58,679 --> 01:45:04,139
through thousands of seats looking for

2716
01:45:00,118 --> 01:45:06,179
selection so it's it's it's what it is I

2717
01:45:04,139 --> 01:45:08,100
think a lot of people wanna I don't know

2718
01:45:06,179 --> 01:45:10,560
they get on a high horse and they really

2719
01:45:08,100 --> 01:45:12,360
feel like they deserve credit for things

2720
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:13,679
that really they don't you know just

2721
01:45:12,359 --> 01:45:15,359
because you went and bought some seeds

2722
01:45:13,679 --> 01:45:16,980
at positronics man doesn't mean you're

2723
01:45:15,359 --> 01:45:18,539
doing anything just because you bought

2724
01:45:16,979 --> 01:45:20,279
some Caesar positronics and mixed them

2725
01:45:18,539 --> 01:45:22,079
together and then sold those seeds

2726
01:45:20,279 --> 01:45:26,340
doesn't mean you're doing anything and

2727
01:45:22,079 --> 01:45:29,399
like me I am trying to not influence the

2728
01:45:26,340 --> 01:45:31,199
haze genetics in a sense like like I am

2729
01:45:29,399 --> 01:45:33,299
out Crossing and making my own varieties

2730
01:45:31,198 --> 01:45:36,178
but that's not original Haze and and I'm

2731
01:45:33,300 --> 01:45:38,039
trying to not [ __ ] it up by listening to

2732
01:45:36,179 --> 01:45:40,380
Skunk Man Sam and doing the breeding the

2733
01:45:38,039 --> 01:45:42,179
way that he recommends I do it because I

2734
01:45:40,380 --> 01:45:43,859
want other generations to get the

2735
01:45:42,179 --> 01:45:45,960
opportunity to go through these seeds as

2736
01:45:43,859 --> 01:45:47,519
pure as possible and to be able to find

2737
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:50,219
their own selections and and and

2738
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:52,199
hopefully you know become great DJs you

2739
01:45:50,219 --> 01:45:53,880
know that's kind of what I'm I'm kind of

2740
01:45:52,198 --> 01:45:56,339
feeling like I'm the bridge between the

2741
01:45:53,880 --> 01:45:58,618
older generation and then the younger

2742
01:45:56,340 --> 01:46:00,239
generation of newer breeders and I kind

2743
01:45:58,618 --> 01:46:02,399
of feel like I'm the anti-cannabis

2744
01:46:00,238 --> 01:46:03,959
Cannabis company because I'm really

2745
01:46:02,399 --> 01:46:06,479
trying to get the genetics into the

2746
01:46:03,960 --> 01:46:09,000
hands of of of the community before

2747
01:46:06,479 --> 01:46:11,759
these big corporates show up and try to

2748
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:14,340
turn it into IP and once they get their

2749
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:16,020
hands on a you know purple passion or a

2750
01:46:14,340 --> 01:46:17,460
[ __ ] OG Kush they're never going to

2751
01:46:16,020 --> 01:46:19,139
release it they're not going to cut

2752
01:46:17,460 --> 01:46:20,639
clones and sell them at the shop so you

2753
01:46:19,139 --> 01:46:23,940
can grow the [ __ ] that they're selling

2754
01:46:20,639 --> 01:46:26,179
never in a million years so I think this

2755
01:46:23,939 --> 01:46:29,638
genetic preservation is super important

2756
01:46:26,179 --> 01:46:32,039
and you know I I wish more people like

2757
01:46:29,639 --> 01:46:33,719
Tom would see that we're all you know

2758
01:46:32,039 --> 01:46:35,819
trying to benefit the community and and

2759
01:46:33,719 --> 01:46:37,618
it's not a [ __ ] quarter mile race

2760
01:46:35,819 --> 01:46:39,899
it's not about you know who's got the

2761
01:46:37,618 --> 01:46:43,279
best of What It's Like These are plants

2762
01:46:39,899 --> 01:46:46,319
we're talking about and you know

2763
01:46:43,279 --> 01:46:48,118
they're all unique every single plant in

2764
01:46:46,319 --> 01:46:50,039
a sense is a unique fingerprint on the

2765
01:46:48,118 --> 01:46:52,319
planet and you don't know its benefits

2766
01:46:50,039 --> 01:46:53,939
or it's you know until you grow it out

2767
01:46:52,319 --> 01:46:56,039
and experience it and I wish more people

2768
01:46:53,939 --> 01:46:57,539
would be open-minded to that and I wish

2769
01:46:56,039 --> 01:47:00,179
more people would

2770
01:46:57,539 --> 01:47:03,179
you know kind of have that open-minded

2771
01:47:00,179 --> 01:47:06,118
approach to breeding and looking for the

2772
01:47:03,179 --> 01:47:08,520
best quality and and and looking for the

2773
01:47:06,118 --> 01:47:10,738
you know best medicine rather than you

2774
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:13,139
know looking for an ego stroke

2775
01:47:10,738 --> 01:47:15,419
yeah look I can understand how

2776
01:47:13,139 --> 01:47:17,039
understandably frustrating it must have

2777
01:47:15,420 --> 01:47:19,800
been to have to deal with all the

2778
01:47:17,039 --> 01:47:22,139
questions about validity of stock and

2779
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:23,820
whatnot I mean it's it's interesting and

2780
01:47:22,139 --> 01:47:25,319
coincidental you bring up Tom Hill

2781
01:47:23,819 --> 01:47:27,118
because I was I actually had a question

2782
01:47:25,319 --> 01:47:29,460
I was going to ask you about him so we

2783
01:47:27,118 --> 01:47:31,738
may as well do it right now on the

2784
01:47:29,460 --> 01:47:34,439
photos I've seen you post of uh the

2785
01:47:31,738 --> 01:47:36,599
purest Indica it looks obviously like

2786
01:47:34,439 --> 01:47:38,759
Northern Lights but it also kind of

2787
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:41,100
reminded me a bit of deep chunk with the

2788
01:47:38,760 --> 01:47:43,079
way like that resin's so thick like you

2789
01:47:41,100 --> 01:47:46,679
can tell like this has got some serious

2790
01:47:43,079 --> 01:47:48,420
Afghan hash plant type Vibes to it have

2791
01:47:46,679 --> 01:47:50,158
you ever grown out any of Tom's lines

2792
01:47:48,420 --> 01:47:51,359
like specifically the Deep chunk I mean

2793
01:47:50,158 --> 01:47:54,539
it's not really his lines they're just

2794
01:47:51,359 --> 01:47:55,979
land races but um what's your thoughts I

2795
01:47:54,539 --> 01:47:57,238
don't think they are land races I mean

2796
01:47:55,979 --> 01:47:58,439
just because you bought some seeds from

2797
01:47:57,238 --> 01:48:00,839
positronics doesn't mean you're working

2798
01:47:58,439 --> 01:48:03,178
with land races and uh you know the the

2799
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:04,619
thing is is these Afghan genetics are

2800
01:48:03,179 --> 01:48:06,179
dominant in a lot of this stuff I mean

2801
01:48:04,618 --> 01:48:07,979
Neville did a lot what normally it's

2802
01:48:06,179 --> 01:48:10,380
number two Northern Lights Number Two is

2803
01:48:07,979 --> 01:48:13,559
one of my favorites right now it's so OG

2804
01:48:10,380 --> 01:48:15,359
cushion crazy I asked Greg years ago if

2805
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:17,880
he ever smoked OG Kush and he said to me

2806
01:48:15,359 --> 01:48:19,738
he said yeah yeah it's just nl2 he made

2807
01:48:17,880 --> 01:48:21,420
a joke he said Todd we used to grow the

2808
01:48:19,738 --> 01:48:24,118
nl5 and sell it and we used to grow the

2809
01:48:21,420 --> 01:48:26,760
nl2 and smoke it and I thought oh that's

2810
01:48:24,118 --> 01:48:29,939
hilarious man and uh you know and it's

2811
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:32,460
because the nl2 was funky and heavy and

2812
01:48:29,939 --> 01:48:34,979
[ __ ] you know dank as [ __ ] but then

2813
01:48:32,460 --> 01:48:37,500
the nl5 was more of that tropical kind

2814
01:48:34,979 --> 01:48:40,079
of like kind of light High you know

2815
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:41,880
better yielding and [ __ ] like that so

2816
01:48:40,079 --> 01:48:43,618
quicker growing because it had a little

2817
01:48:41,880 --> 01:48:47,100
more of the more tropical equatorial

2818
01:48:43,618 --> 01:48:49,799
genetics in it and uh I got what he

2819
01:48:47,100 --> 01:48:53,039
meant you know and and you know a lot of

2820
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:55,260
this stuff you know Neville was a

2821
01:48:53,039 --> 01:48:57,479
blessing man Neville spread the seeds

2822
01:48:55,260 --> 01:48:59,699
around and Neville got these genetics

2823
01:48:57,479 --> 01:49:01,559
into the hands of many people that then

2824
01:48:59,698 --> 01:49:04,618
was had an opportunity to breed with

2825
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:06,360
them you know it Neville did it is was

2826
01:49:04,618 --> 01:49:09,839
it was a beautiful thing for the world

2827
01:49:06,359 --> 01:49:11,579
and uh and he should always be revered

2828
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:13,739
for that because it put the genetics

2829
01:49:11,579 --> 01:49:14,698
into the hands of many people

2830
01:49:13,738 --> 01:49:17,039
um

2831
01:49:14,698 --> 01:49:18,960
and I I think it made a big difference

2832
01:49:17,039 --> 01:49:21,179
in the in the overall quality of

2833
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:22,679
cannabis you know in all reality by

2834
01:49:21,179 --> 01:49:24,779
going through these selections and

2835
01:49:22,679 --> 01:49:26,399
getting you know these like Afghans and

2836
01:49:24,779 --> 01:49:28,319
different things you know out so that

2837
01:49:26,399 --> 01:49:30,839
you can mix it with your hazes and stuff

2838
01:49:28,319 --> 01:49:32,698
it was just an absolute you know

2839
01:49:30,840 --> 01:49:34,260
blessing to the world in the way you

2840
01:49:32,698 --> 01:49:37,319
know not having to go through you know

2841
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:40,020
land race tie or land race Afghan or

2842
01:49:37,319 --> 01:49:41,819
land race anything you know to to start

2843
01:49:40,020 --> 01:49:44,239
at the bottom and try to work your way

2844
01:49:41,819 --> 01:49:48,059
back up sharing the genetics was like

2845
01:49:44,238 --> 01:49:50,158
starting on you know the top floor after

2846
01:49:48,060 --> 01:49:52,440
all these people had done selections and

2847
01:49:50,158 --> 01:49:55,198
breeding and and made seeds and like

2848
01:49:52,439 --> 01:49:57,359
every single time hopefully was an

2849
01:49:55,198 --> 01:50:00,059
improvement and and that's why I think

2850
01:49:57,359 --> 01:50:02,099
in a weird way that there was the first

2851
01:50:00,060 --> 01:50:04,199
wave of breeding was all about quality

2852
01:50:02,100 --> 01:50:06,659
the second wave of breeding was all

2853
01:50:04,198 --> 01:50:10,919
about quantity meaning either quantity

2854
01:50:06,658 --> 01:50:12,439
of seeds or uh the fastness and like the

2855
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:14,639
the the the the

2856
01:50:12,439 --> 01:50:16,379
amount of cannabis you get and I'm sure

2857
01:50:14,639 --> 01:50:18,239
short amount of time because you know

2858
01:50:16,380 --> 01:50:20,159
people wanted that they wanted quick

2859
01:50:18,238 --> 01:50:21,658
they wanted heavy you know they really

2860
01:50:20,158 --> 01:50:23,759
didn't they didn't ask you for the

2861
01:50:21,658 --> 01:50:25,198
highest quality you know when you were

2862
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:26,460
selling seeds and all and I mean

2863
01:50:25,198 --> 01:50:28,919
everybody was like what's the fastest

2864
01:50:26,460 --> 01:50:31,079
heaviest yield you got I was like okay

2865
01:50:28,920 --> 01:50:33,359
you want big bud those who wants to

2866
01:50:31,079 --> 01:50:35,698
smoke big bud I mean I used to work for

2867
01:50:33,359 --> 01:50:38,639
Simon at Serious Eats in the day clean

2868
01:50:35,698 --> 01:50:41,638
in the seeds and stuff and um you know

2869
01:50:38,639 --> 01:50:43,739
chronic was cool to grow but if there

2870
01:50:41,639 --> 01:50:46,199
was chronic AK and Cali saying in front

2871
01:50:43,738 --> 01:50:48,059
of me I smoked the Cali then I smoked

2872
01:50:46,198 --> 01:50:50,759
the AK and I'd probably give away a

2873
01:50:48,060 --> 01:50:52,619
little chronic but you know like that

2874
01:50:50,760 --> 01:50:55,560
would be the last of the pot to smoke

2875
01:50:52,618 --> 01:50:57,420
you know because it was the least

2876
01:50:55,560 --> 01:50:59,400
effective in my opinion but it was the

2877
01:50:57,420 --> 01:51:00,500
heaviest guilder we we offered I mean

2878
01:50:59,399 --> 01:51:03,238
big bud

2879
01:51:00,500 --> 01:51:05,698
big big bud wasn't the biggest winner of

2880
01:51:03,238 --> 01:51:07,979
any of the Cannabis cups I ever remember

2881
01:51:05,698 --> 01:51:09,539
you know but a lot of people went over

2882
01:51:07,979 --> 01:51:12,599
there trying to get big bud seeds

2883
01:51:09,539 --> 01:51:15,658
because they wanted heavy fast you know

2884
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:17,460
the prohibition Market demanded it

2885
01:51:15,658 --> 01:51:19,679
you know if you could turn over six

2886
01:51:17,460 --> 01:51:21,658
crops a year in your house uh growing

2887
01:51:19,679 --> 01:51:24,480
you know an eight week or or you could

2888
01:51:21,658 --> 01:51:26,460
turn you know four crops or even worse

2889
01:51:24,479 --> 01:51:28,859
you know two crops a year growing

2890
01:51:26,460 --> 01:51:31,079
something that was four to six months

2891
01:51:28,859 --> 01:51:33,238
what were you going to do you know what

2892
01:51:31,079 --> 01:51:36,420
I mean at the pure economics drove the

2893
01:51:33,238 --> 01:51:37,379
conversation to where it was so you know

2894
01:51:36,420 --> 01:51:39,539
I

2895
01:51:37,380 --> 01:51:41,639
the funny thing is I got I always hope

2896
01:51:39,539 --> 01:51:44,158
to meet Tom Hill actually when I when I

2897
01:51:41,639 --> 01:51:45,779
was younger I you know I had reverence

2898
01:51:44,158 --> 01:51:47,519
for all these breeders that I heard of

2899
01:51:45,779 --> 01:51:49,319
you know I went to the Canvas Cup place

2900
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:51,179
to enjoy meeting everybody it wasn't a

2901
01:51:49,319 --> 01:51:53,759
big you know

2902
01:51:51,179 --> 01:51:56,340
who's got the highest THC game it was

2903
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:57,840
just about making friends uh so I was a

2904
01:51:56,340 --> 01:52:01,199
little bummed when I saw him talking

2905
01:51:57,840 --> 01:52:02,699
crap but and uh I'm sure he has good

2906
01:52:01,198 --> 01:52:04,379
genetics I'm sure he's done good

2907
01:52:02,698 --> 01:52:06,658
selections I'm sure he's put out some

2908
01:52:04,380 --> 01:52:08,340
good stuff you know if I had the

2909
01:52:06,658 --> 01:52:10,079
opportunity to smoke weed that he grew

2910
01:52:08,340 --> 01:52:12,360
I'd be happy about it I would love to

2911
01:52:10,079 --> 01:52:15,300
try some of Tom Hill's Hayes and stuff

2912
01:52:12,359 --> 01:52:17,759
especially because I've been able to get

2913
01:52:15,300 --> 01:52:19,860
original haze from Skunk Man Sam and

2914
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:21,360
grow it and I've because I've had great

2915
01:52:19,859 --> 01:52:23,219
cuttings of the northern light of

2916
01:52:21,359 --> 01:52:25,259
Neville's Hayes and smoked and loved it

2917
01:52:23,219 --> 01:52:27,239
because I worked at pausing was growing

2918
01:52:25,260 --> 01:52:29,400
[ __ ] Haze for the whole year of 1996

2919
01:52:27,238 --> 01:52:31,019
and and trying to go through different

2920
01:52:29,399 --> 01:52:33,420
varieties to figure out which ones I

2921
01:52:31,020 --> 01:52:35,880
like best uh I have a lot of experience

2922
01:52:33,420 --> 01:52:38,158
with it and I would love to see you know

2923
01:52:35,880 --> 01:52:40,500
his secondary color and what he's made

2924
01:52:38,158 --> 01:52:42,899
with it I think it would be cool you

2925
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:44,880
know but I don't know personally I would

2926
01:52:42,899 --> 01:52:46,439
rather have the seeds that you know Sam

2927
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:48,300
keeps for himself and doesn't sell to

2928
01:52:46,439 --> 01:52:50,638
anybody then the seeds you can buy at

2929
01:52:48,300 --> 01:52:54,000
positronics so

2930
01:52:50,639 --> 01:52:55,800
personal preference of course I think

2931
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:57,899
I'm there with you don't worry and I

2932
01:52:55,800 --> 01:53:00,239
mean you touched on OG in that answer

2933
01:52:57,899 --> 01:53:02,279
and I guess I'd be interested to hear a

2934
01:53:00,238 --> 01:53:04,079
little more about your thoughts on OG in

2935
01:53:02,279 --> 01:53:05,819
general is it a strain you like like

2936
01:53:04,079 --> 01:53:07,500
would you ever grow it and smoke it or

2937
01:53:05,819 --> 01:53:09,118
do you feel like it's just superseded by

2938
01:53:07,500 --> 01:53:11,340
the NL

2939
01:53:09,118 --> 01:53:14,519
uh you'll laugh but when I got out of

2940
01:53:11,340 --> 01:53:17,460
prison in 2004 I didn't have any money

2941
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:19,440
kind of in debt and everything and uh my

2942
01:53:17,460 --> 01:53:21,118
friends at guruji Kush gave me back

2943
01:53:19,439 --> 01:53:23,219
because I kind of had it before I went

2944
01:53:21,118 --> 01:53:25,618
to prison too uh they shared the Clone

2945
01:53:23,219 --> 01:53:27,600
with me prior to prison but I can't I

2946
01:53:25,618 --> 01:53:28,979
wasn't really talking about that and I

2947
01:53:27,600 --> 01:53:30,600
won't say you gave it to me but then

2948
01:53:28,979 --> 01:53:32,819
when I got out of prison again

2949
01:53:30,600 --> 01:53:35,400
um it was offered back to me again in

2950
01:53:32,819 --> 01:53:37,618
2004 and I when I got out of prison

2951
01:53:35,399 --> 01:53:39,839
started uh select strains which was a

2952
01:53:37,618 --> 01:53:43,559
little nursery and what is on the cover

2953
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:45,900
but OG Kush and uh it was my number one

2954
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:48,480
cutting Scentsy star super silver A's

2955
01:53:45,899 --> 01:53:51,420
Romney and purple I'm 39.

2956
01:53:48,479 --> 01:53:54,059
um and uh I sold the [ __ ] out of them I

2957
01:53:51,420 --> 01:53:57,060
think I was the very first person to

2958
01:53:54,060 --> 01:54:00,780
sell OG Kush cuttings in La starting at

2959
01:53:57,060 --> 01:54:03,719
the end of uh 2004 November December

2960
01:54:00,779 --> 01:54:06,179
probably December 2004 was my first sale

2961
01:54:03,719 --> 01:54:08,639
of OG Kush cuttings and um

2962
01:54:06,179 --> 01:54:10,679
maybe a little later maybe January but

2963
01:54:08,639 --> 01:54:11,340
not much later after Christmas

2964
01:54:10,679 --> 01:54:13,618
um

2965
01:54:11,340 --> 01:54:16,739
around that time the guy that offered it

2966
01:54:13,618 --> 01:54:18,359
to me uh I inquired to my friend who

2967
01:54:16,738 --> 01:54:19,859
gave it to me and I went to him and said

2968
01:54:18,359 --> 01:54:21,359
hey may I sell cuttings of this because

2969
01:54:19,859 --> 01:54:24,000
again I just didn't want to be an

2970
01:54:21,359 --> 01:54:26,698
[ __ ] and um he came back to me said

2971
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:29,579
Todd the person who wanted you to have

2972
01:54:26,698 --> 01:54:31,198
it died and I don't think it matters you

2973
01:54:29,579 --> 01:54:32,939
could do whatever you want with it you

2974
01:54:31,198 --> 01:54:35,759
know and I was like

2975
01:54:32,939 --> 01:54:38,158
whoa bro and I didn't realize that and

2976
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:38,940
then years and years later

2977
01:54:38,158 --> 01:54:41,939
um

2978
01:54:38,939 --> 01:54:44,158
Adam Dunn had a show that he was doing

2979
01:54:41,939 --> 01:54:46,079
uh and he was telling this he was

2980
01:54:44,158 --> 01:54:48,479
letting people tell this real [ __ ]

2981
01:54:46,079 --> 01:54:50,100
story about the origin of OG Kush and

2982
01:54:48,479 --> 01:54:52,319
unfortunately he had this guy that was

2983
01:54:50,100 --> 01:54:54,420
someone I knew and that snitched on me

2984
01:54:52,319 --> 01:54:57,840
he was one of the government informants

2985
01:54:54,420 --> 01:54:59,819
in my case his name was Dave and uh I've

2986
01:54:57,840 --> 01:55:02,460
known Adam since 94 and we're friends

2987
01:54:59,819 --> 01:55:03,719
and uh Adam is from the East Coast we

2988
01:55:02,460 --> 01:55:05,698
both grew up a little bit in Rhode

2989
01:55:03,719 --> 01:55:09,658
Island we're both kind of smart asses

2990
01:55:05,698 --> 01:55:11,279
and um while the guy was talking Adam uh

2991
01:55:09,658 --> 01:55:12,658
joked with them that oh you should have

2992
01:55:11,279 --> 01:55:14,880
just went to the cops and told him that

2993
01:55:12,658 --> 01:55:17,099
you only grew it at one house and not

2994
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:20,639
all these other houses and the dumb son

2995
01:55:17,100 --> 01:55:22,560
of a [ __ ] said I did I went to the DEA

2996
01:55:20,639 --> 01:55:25,260
and told him I was only growing here in

2997
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:27,480
Laurel Canyon and not to charge me with

2998
01:55:25,260 --> 01:55:29,100
all these other houses and I always knew

2999
01:55:27,479 --> 01:55:31,379
that he cooperated but I couldn't

3000
01:55:29,100 --> 01:55:34,980
believe that he told on himself on Adam

3001
01:55:31,380 --> 01:55:36,539
Dunn's show and after that happened I I

3002
01:55:34,979 --> 01:55:38,519
heard from all these people that were

3003
01:55:36,539 --> 01:55:42,238
like you got to listen to this and I was

3004
01:55:38,520 --> 01:55:44,580
just like sweet Jesus and um and then

3005
01:55:42,238 --> 01:55:46,799
when that happened Josh d uh who's now

3006
01:55:44,579 --> 01:55:49,198
pretty famous for for being the guy from

3007
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:51,480
La that had it at that time he was still

3008
01:55:49,198 --> 01:55:53,819
underground about it uh he hadn't made

3009
01:55:51,479 --> 01:55:55,500
an Instagram for it or anything and he

3010
01:55:53,819 --> 01:55:57,359
contacted me

3011
01:55:55,500 --> 01:55:59,100
and he said uh

3012
01:55:57,359 --> 01:56:00,839
you know in a text message like how did

3013
01:55:59,100 --> 01:56:04,260
you get OG Kush and I wasn't going to

3014
01:56:00,840 --> 01:56:06,420
answer so I called him on video and uh

3015
01:56:04,260 --> 01:56:09,000
he answered and I said

3016
01:56:06,420 --> 01:56:10,679
you tell me if you if you think you know

3017
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:13,618
me and you think you know how I got it

3018
01:56:10,679 --> 01:56:15,600
you tell me who I got it through and uh

3019
01:56:13,618 --> 01:56:18,299
the first name you mentioned he got it

3020
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:20,460
right and I said whoa wait a minute was

3021
01:56:18,300 --> 01:56:22,920
there really somebody named Mad Dog and

3022
01:56:20,460 --> 01:56:24,658
he goes Todd that was my roommate and he

3023
01:56:22,920 --> 01:56:25,920
held up this picture of his friend who

3024
01:56:24,658 --> 01:56:28,500
passed away from pharmaceutical

3025
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:32,158
complications and uh he didn't know D or

3026
01:56:28,500 --> 01:56:34,079
anything he had medical condition and um

3027
01:56:32,158 --> 01:56:35,879
I was just it was a really touching

3028
01:56:34,079 --> 01:56:38,100
moment and he said you know Todd he used

3029
01:56:35,880 --> 01:56:39,840
to cut out articles about you from the

3030
01:56:38,100 --> 01:56:41,940
newspaper because this was before the

3031
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:43,739
internet and he used to like put them on

3032
01:56:41,939 --> 01:56:44,939
magnets on our refrigerator so when I

3033
01:56:43,738 --> 01:56:47,339
would come home from work I could read

3034
01:56:44,939 --> 01:56:48,658
the article about you uh you know

3035
01:56:47,340 --> 01:56:51,000
because we were both you know thought

3036
01:56:48,658 --> 01:56:53,099
what you were doing was cool and that's

3037
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:55,380
how in the 90s he found out I had

3038
01:56:53,100 --> 01:56:56,280
friends and he got me a cutting through

3039
01:56:55,380 --> 01:56:57,840
friends

3040
01:56:56,279 --> 01:56:59,519
um but he but I didn't know who I didn't

3041
01:56:57,840 --> 01:57:01,739
know who it was he didn't give me the

3042
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:04,500
nickname and then after I got out of

3043
01:57:01,738 --> 01:57:06,899
prison uh he the same dude went through

3044
01:57:04,500 --> 01:57:10,319
friends different friends this time and

3045
01:57:06,899 --> 01:57:12,839
and offered it back to me and I said I

3046
01:57:10,319 --> 01:57:14,639
would love it and um and then when I

3047
01:57:12,840 --> 01:57:16,560
went back to ask I found out he passed

3048
01:57:14,639 --> 01:57:18,118
away but then Josh kind of put it all

3049
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:19,920
together for me

3050
01:57:18,118 --> 01:57:21,539
um and the the conversation I had with

3051
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:22,880
Josh was really sincere like there was

3052
01:57:21,539 --> 01:57:26,039
no questioning

3053
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:28,618
Josh's like the authenticity of what he

3054
01:57:26,039 --> 01:57:31,738
was saying I was in LA at the time you

3055
01:57:28,618 --> 01:57:32,698
know I I I know it I I was there you

3056
01:57:31,738 --> 01:57:35,339
know so

3057
01:57:32,698 --> 01:57:36,479
I knew more than I should you know and

3058
01:57:35,340 --> 01:57:37,860
uh and that's why I went to prison

3059
01:57:36,479 --> 01:57:40,618
because I wouldn't talk about it I

3060
01:57:37,859 --> 01:57:42,299
wouldn't cooperate just lock me up you

3061
01:57:40,618 --> 01:57:43,618
know and that's what they did

3062
01:57:42,300 --> 01:57:45,179
um but then when I got out of prison all

3063
01:57:43,618 --> 01:57:47,158
my friends were still there and I had

3064
01:57:45,179 --> 01:57:49,739
nothing but love so I got a lot of good

3065
01:57:47,158 --> 01:57:50,879
things given back to me like I had you

3066
01:57:49,738 --> 01:57:52,618
know all my friends were still there

3067
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:54,900
when I came home so it was really warm

3068
01:57:52,618 --> 01:57:57,359
to come home to it and then I just uh so

3069
01:57:54,899 --> 01:57:59,339
I got OG Kush I love it I've always been

3070
01:57:57,359 --> 01:58:01,859
a fan of OG Kush it's been a go-to mine

3071
01:57:59,340 --> 01:58:04,020
for medicine for a long time I used it

3072
01:58:01,859 --> 01:58:05,158
in the net 2019 breeding against my on

3073
01:58:04,020 --> 01:58:07,380
Hayes

3074
01:58:05,158 --> 01:58:10,198
um it's done really well for me uh

3075
01:58:07,380 --> 01:58:12,179
people seem to really love it and

3076
01:58:10,198 --> 01:58:14,279
you know but now that I have known life

3077
01:58:12,179 --> 01:58:16,260
number two and I just did a greenhouse

3078
01:58:14,279 --> 01:58:19,198
run of middle life number two I can

3079
01:58:16,260 --> 01:58:22,139
absolutely see who the daddy mommy daddy

3080
01:58:19,198 --> 01:58:24,238
of of the OG Kush was and when I spoke

3081
01:58:22,139 --> 01:58:26,219
to the guy who who supposedly originally

3082
01:58:24,238 --> 01:58:28,198
made the seeds in Florida that the

3083
01:58:26,219 --> 01:58:30,420
cutting came from he told me that you

3084
01:58:28,198 --> 01:58:32,579
know in 89 we went to the Netherlands

3085
01:58:30,420 --> 01:58:34,319
and we bought Hindu Kush and Northern

3086
01:58:32,579 --> 01:58:36,359
Light seeds from Neville so that's all

3087
01:58:34,319 --> 01:58:37,500
it can be because when I talk to him I

3088
01:58:36,359 --> 01:58:39,479
said man I think it's Northern Lights

3089
01:58:37,500 --> 01:58:42,118
because I remembered

3090
01:58:39,479 --> 01:58:44,819
so my first experience with Northern

3091
01:58:42,118 --> 01:58:46,559
with with OG Kush was in 1997 when I

3092
01:58:44,819 --> 01:58:48,779
came back from Amsterdam when I smoked

3093
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:50,460
it in January of 97 I was like oh this

3094
01:58:48,779 --> 01:58:52,198
is Northern Lights because I had just

3095
01:58:50,460 --> 01:58:54,300
come back from hanging out with Alan

3096
01:58:52,198 --> 01:58:56,219
dronkers and going to the castle in 96

3097
01:58:54,300 --> 01:58:58,320
and and being there smoking Northern

3098
01:58:56,219 --> 01:59:00,118
Lights varieties that they had stuff

3099
01:58:58,319 --> 01:59:03,000
that they agreed with stuff that you

3100
01:59:00,118 --> 01:59:04,380
know the stuff that they grow so so I

3101
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:06,300
got to smoke a lot of different [ __ ]

3102
01:59:04,380 --> 01:59:08,719
with Alan Helen's a real pothead Alan

3103
01:59:06,300 --> 01:59:10,980
loves to smoke loves his house he's he's

3104
01:59:08,719 --> 01:59:13,319
really into it you know so we used to

3105
01:59:10,979 --> 01:59:15,479
get high I've I've had the opportunity

3106
01:59:13,319 --> 01:59:16,679
of sleeping over at the castle and you

3107
01:59:15,479 --> 01:59:18,479
know getting high with Alan all night

3108
01:59:16,679 --> 01:59:21,658
long and smoking the stuff that was in

3109
01:59:18,479 --> 01:59:23,339
the basement so I I feel like I've I'm

3110
01:59:21,658 --> 01:59:26,819
very fortunate to have the experience

3111
01:59:23,340 --> 01:59:28,679
that I've had with you know the Cannabis

3112
01:59:26,819 --> 01:59:29,939
that I've been around so when I got here

3113
01:59:28,679 --> 01:59:31,260
and smoked it I just thought it was

3114
01:59:29,939 --> 01:59:33,839
Northern Lights and then when I asked

3115
01:59:31,260 --> 01:59:35,280
Greg about it he kind of reinforce that

3116
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:37,560
yeah there's just Northern Lights and

3117
01:59:35,279 --> 01:59:38,759
now that I've grown it I definitely

3118
01:59:37,560 --> 01:59:40,080
think the parents were knowing the

3119
01:59:38,760 --> 01:59:41,820
lights so

3120
01:59:40,079 --> 01:59:44,399
you know that's why I think that in

3121
01:59:41,819 --> 01:59:47,340
philos uh

3122
01:59:44,399 --> 01:59:49,198
if if if in the six different types or

3123
01:59:47,340 --> 01:59:51,779
five different types that they list out

3124
01:59:49,198 --> 01:59:55,019
because they lift up like have uh wild

3125
01:59:51,779 --> 01:59:57,840
berry skunk and uh something like that

3126
01:59:55,020 --> 02:00:00,119
uh and uh one of them's OG Kush if that

3127
01:59:57,840 --> 02:00:01,440
was Northern Lights then it would make

3128
02:00:00,118 --> 02:00:03,000
sense for me because that would be

3129
02:00:01,439 --> 02:00:04,979
Northern Lights and skunk one and then

3130
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:07,380
all the other things that came from it

3131
02:00:04,979 --> 02:00:10,500
but to put OG Kush up there with skunk

3132
02:00:07,380 --> 02:00:12,359
one when there's like 20 years you got

3133
02:00:10,500 --> 02:00:15,060
to go back to the 70s if you're really

3134
02:00:12,359 --> 02:00:18,420
gonna get under the varieties that we

3135
02:00:15,060 --> 02:00:20,340
have now and those don't go to OG Kush

3136
02:00:18,420 --> 02:00:21,359
they go back to this Steve Murphy purist

3137
02:00:20,340 --> 02:00:22,619
Indica

3138
02:00:21,359 --> 02:00:24,420
um and I don't know if you've have you

3139
02:00:22,618 --> 02:00:26,039
seen the book I'm talking about have you

3140
02:00:24,420 --> 02:00:28,500
seen the picture I mean yeah yeah yeah

3141
02:00:26,039 --> 02:00:30,000
yeah so yeah and and I think the

3142
02:00:28,500 --> 02:00:32,760
genetics don't lie when you look at the

3143
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:36,060
photo and you look at the The 1975 photo

3144
02:00:32,760 --> 02:00:39,060
it's like freaking twins

3145
02:00:36,060 --> 02:00:42,000
yeah 100 yeah it looks it looks the same

3146
02:00:39,060 --> 02:00:44,039
I definitely agree with that I guess my

3147
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:46,319
mind then asks the question

3148
02:00:44,039 --> 02:00:48,359
I'm not sure how familiar you are in

3149
02:00:46,319 --> 02:00:50,039
terms of growing out the different chem

3150
02:00:48,359 --> 02:00:52,559
dog varieties but the same sort of

3151
02:00:50,039 --> 02:00:54,840
question often lingers around chemdog do

3152
02:00:52,560 --> 02:00:57,179
you think there's an L in that yeah for

3153
02:00:54,840 --> 02:00:59,159
sure 100 I've often thought cam like

3154
02:00:57,179 --> 02:01:01,500
chem 91 they call it an OG Kush are

3155
02:00:59,158 --> 02:01:03,118
closely related without question I've

3156
02:01:01,500 --> 02:01:05,760
also grants grown stuff that came from

3157
02:01:03,118 --> 02:01:08,639
the hog farm uh the way to gravy

3158
02:01:05,760 --> 02:01:11,460
Northern California and uh it was very

3159
02:01:08,639 --> 02:01:12,960
uh non-lights as well to me Northern

3160
02:01:11,460 --> 02:01:15,779
Lights has been Northern Lights Number

3161
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:18,719
Two is the is the mystery

3162
02:01:15,779 --> 02:01:21,300
between Afghan and

3163
02:01:18,719 --> 02:01:22,618
uh just because it was an Afghan when I

3164
02:01:21,300 --> 02:01:25,260
asked him what not only it's number two

3165
02:01:22,618 --> 02:01:28,259
was he said it was mixed with

3166
02:01:25,260 --> 02:01:30,360
um the Afghans that they got from uh

3167
02:01:28,260 --> 02:01:32,280
Oregon and California and when he said

3168
02:01:30,359 --> 02:01:33,719
and California it made me think okay

3169
02:01:32,279 --> 02:01:36,000
this makes more sense because if you

3170
02:01:33,719 --> 02:01:39,239
have zero mixed with like a California

3171
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:40,618
or Oregon Afghan and then you take Z you

3172
02:01:39,238 --> 02:01:41,939
know number one because that becomes

3173
02:01:40,618 --> 02:01:44,939
number one and then you mix that with

3174
02:01:41,939 --> 02:01:47,399
the California uh Afghan or Oregon

3175
02:01:44,939 --> 02:01:49,138
Afghan you get NL number two you're

3176
02:01:47,399 --> 02:01:51,960
still pretty close to that purest indica

3177
02:01:49,139 --> 02:01:53,819
and as they were bumping up

3178
02:01:51,960 --> 02:01:55,618
um that's where you know in his in

3179
02:01:53,819 --> 02:01:57,238
Greg's opinion it was simply growth

3180
02:01:55,618 --> 02:01:59,698
characteristics the leaves became

3181
02:01:57,238 --> 02:02:02,519
narrower the plants became taller the

3182
02:01:59,698 --> 02:02:05,039
finishing times grew longer so he just

3183
02:02:02,520 --> 02:02:08,400
numbered them from closest to Murphy

3184
02:02:05,039 --> 02:02:10,319
Murphy's Afghan to the most tropical

3185
02:02:08,399 --> 02:02:12,839
ones that he had and when you think

3186
02:02:10,319 --> 02:02:15,599
about it it makes sense why none of the

3187
02:02:12,840 --> 02:02:18,360
numbers over five really became popular

3188
02:02:15,599 --> 02:02:21,779
to Neville because Neville once he got

3189
02:02:18,359 --> 02:02:25,500
those male hazes everything was with the

3190
02:02:21,779 --> 02:02:29,460
male hazes it's as if nothing he didn't

3191
02:02:25,500 --> 02:02:33,179
he he didn't have any other Haze plants

3192
02:02:29,460 --> 02:02:35,579
to use he says he had a female but

3193
02:02:33,179 --> 02:02:38,340
he says he killed it because it wasn't

3194
02:02:35,579 --> 02:02:40,079
that good so I don't I don't believe he

3195
02:02:38,340 --> 02:02:40,980
actually had it to be really honest with

3196
02:02:40,079 --> 02:02:43,319
you

3197
02:02:40,979 --> 02:02:45,238
um but it it doesn't matter at the end

3198
02:02:43,319 --> 02:02:47,399
of the conversation he stated many times

3199
02:02:45,238 --> 02:02:49,279
that he only had two males

3200
02:02:47,399 --> 02:02:52,079
um and

3201
02:02:49,279 --> 02:02:55,079
I I just think that that's why in a

3202
02:02:52,079 --> 02:02:57,300
sense you get just a limited amount of

3203
02:02:55,079 --> 02:02:58,979
secondary colors from what he could do

3204
02:02:57,300 --> 02:03:01,560
with that primary color because if that

3205
02:02:58,979 --> 02:03:03,718
those Haze males were his primaries it

3206
02:03:01,560 --> 02:03:06,119
would have a good signature on every

3207
02:03:03,719 --> 02:03:07,800
other color he mixed it with you know

3208
02:03:06,118 --> 02:03:09,960
you know just to use an analogy that

3209
02:03:07,800 --> 02:03:11,159
people that maybe don't breed can easily

3210
02:03:09,960 --> 02:03:12,899
understand

3211
02:03:11,158 --> 02:03:14,158
yeah no look I I agree with you I think

3212
02:03:12,899 --> 02:03:15,899
if you had a female he would have

3213
02:03:14,158 --> 02:03:17,460
definitely made f2s and hunted through

3214
02:03:15,899 --> 02:03:20,158
them and we would have heard about it

3215
02:03:17,460 --> 02:03:21,658
but interesting nonetheless Lou we've

3216
02:03:20,158 --> 02:03:23,819
been having so much fun we skipped over

3217
02:03:21,658 --> 02:03:26,399
the question we normally jump back to it

3218
02:03:23,819 --> 02:03:28,380
around like 15 minutes in but we ask

3219
02:03:26,399 --> 02:03:30,598
everyone what was your first experience

3220
02:03:28,380 --> 02:03:31,319
with cannabis

3221
02:03:30,599 --> 02:03:35,099
um

3222
02:03:31,319 --> 02:03:36,658
I was sick I was my mom was a hippie and

3223
02:03:35,099 --> 02:03:38,819
I was going through chemotherapy and

3224
02:03:36,658 --> 02:03:41,339
radiation and I have a big scar on the

3225
02:03:38,819 --> 02:03:43,559
side of my body from uh I had a tumor

3226
02:03:41,340 --> 02:03:45,000
between my left lung and my heart for

3227
02:03:43,560 --> 02:03:47,580
the first time I had it in soft tissue

3228
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:50,158
only it was inside a bone marrow and it

3229
02:03:47,579 --> 02:03:51,840
would break my bone my spine is fused I

3230
02:03:50,158 --> 02:03:53,579
had three locations in my skull I had

3231
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:55,139
two more in my right ear I had two

3232
02:03:53,579 --> 02:03:56,399
locations in my left hip I was in a

3233
02:03:55,139 --> 02:03:58,319
wheelchair for over six months when I

3234
02:03:56,399 --> 02:04:00,658
was a little kid and then after all that

3235
02:03:58,319 --> 02:04:03,238
I got it again in between my left lung

3236
02:04:00,658 --> 02:04:05,879
and my heart and my mom had read in Good

3237
02:04:03,238 --> 02:04:08,158
Housekeeping that cannabis was being

3238
02:04:05,880 --> 02:04:10,560
used for cancer patients and she

3239
02:04:08,158 --> 02:04:12,118
inquired with my pediatrician and he

3240
02:04:10,560 --> 02:04:15,300
felt like man you have nothing to lose

3241
02:04:12,118 --> 02:04:17,098
in so uh she being a hippie already had

3242
02:04:15,300 --> 02:04:19,739
weed and

3243
02:04:17,099 --> 02:04:21,900
when we drove home that day

3244
02:04:19,738 --> 02:04:23,698
um she had me slip down I was only nine

3245
02:04:21,899 --> 02:04:25,439
years old she had me slip down into like

3246
02:04:23,698 --> 02:04:28,079
the front seat of the car and she had

3247
02:04:25,439 --> 02:04:30,899
the air conditioning on and she gave me

3248
02:04:28,079 --> 02:04:33,779
a joint and she told me to like uh she

3249
02:04:30,899 --> 02:04:36,299
told me to sip it like it was a straw

3250
02:04:33,779 --> 02:04:38,819
and uh so I got down in the little thing

3251
02:04:36,300 --> 02:04:41,279
and I was I was sipping it like it was a

3252
02:04:38,819 --> 02:04:43,139
store and I started getting and feeling

3253
02:04:41,279 --> 02:04:44,579
pretty good and mind you I just went

3254
02:04:43,139 --> 02:04:45,719
through chemo I just not only went

3255
02:04:44,579 --> 02:04:47,698
through chemo that I went through

3256
02:04:45,719 --> 02:04:48,960
radiation therapy because I was getting

3257
02:04:47,698 --> 02:04:51,059
chemical therapy and then they were

3258
02:04:48,960 --> 02:04:54,020
sending me to radiation so it really

3259
02:04:51,060 --> 02:04:57,599
sucked and um when we got home that day

3260
02:04:54,020 --> 02:05:00,119
I uh I wanted spinach I was a big Popeye

3261
02:04:57,599 --> 02:05:03,360
fan and I wanted like a sauteed spinach

3262
02:05:00,118 --> 02:05:05,219
and butter and um my mom was high and

3263
02:05:03,359 --> 02:05:07,500
thought well what I do to my kid you

3264
02:05:05,219 --> 02:05:09,779
know and uh she called my pediatrician

3265
02:05:07,500 --> 02:05:12,000
and he said you know feed them you know

3266
02:05:09,779 --> 02:05:13,979
and uh tomorrow don't give them any and

3267
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:16,500
see if it's different so the next day we

3268
02:05:13,979 --> 02:05:18,359
drove home and it sucked and I got home

3269
02:05:16,500 --> 02:05:20,639
and I was being sick I was up in my room

3270
02:05:18,359 --> 02:05:23,158
[ __ ] crying and puking and having a

3271
02:05:20,639 --> 02:05:25,618
[ __ ] moment and uh she came up with a

3272
02:05:23,158 --> 02:05:27,839
joint and said hey it's a bit like it's

3273
02:05:25,618 --> 02:05:30,658
a straw let's try this again and we sat

3274
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:33,779
on the floor in my bedroom and I had a

3275
02:05:30,658 --> 02:05:35,759
Don McLean American Pie 45

3276
02:05:33,779 --> 02:05:38,460
and you'd have to flip the [ __ ] song

3277
02:05:35,760 --> 02:05:40,199
over halfway through and me and my mom

3278
02:05:38,460 --> 02:05:42,420
sat there and she had a joint and I had

3279
02:05:40,198 --> 02:05:44,519
a joy and I was smoking it getting high

3280
02:05:42,420 --> 02:05:46,500
and I got so high and I was so into the

3281
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:48,599
song and she hated it because you know

3282
02:05:46,500 --> 02:05:50,698
they sing now is a good day today's the

3283

02:05:58,618 --> 02:06:02,698
so it was just really amusing and uh

3289

3290

experience getting hot with my mom and I

3291
02:06:05,219 --> 02:06:10,319

3292
02:06:07,198 --> 02:06:13,439
into an avid student and uh

3293
02:06:10,319 --> 02:06:15,238

02:06:23,579 --> 02:06:27,479
know as usual sort of smoking as a

3299
02:06:25,198 --> 02:06:29,819
teenager and when did you develop the

3300
02:06:27,479 --> 02:06:34,439
urge to First grow

3301
02:06:29,819 --> 02:06:36,000
um well uh in a twist of fate I uh I

3302
02:06:34,439 --> 02:06:37,500
started some good pot and I stopped

3303
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:39,658
smoking part after the cancer for a

3304
02:06:37,500 --> 02:06:42,960
while but then when I was 12

3305
02:06:39,658 --> 02:06:45,299
um my my my steps I was a biker a big

3306
02:06:42,960 --> 02:06:47,158
six foot five Monster uh you know

3307
02:06:45,300 --> 02:06:49,679
tattoos down to the wrist and the

3308
02:06:47,158 --> 02:06:51,238
Harleys and everything and uh when I was

3309
02:06:49,679 --> 02:06:54,420
eight I got a motorcycle and when I was

3310
02:06:51,238 --> 02:06:56,638
12 I got another motorcycle and um I had

3311
02:06:54,420 --> 02:06:59,520
a helmet on and my spine is fused my

3312
02:06:56,639 --> 02:07:02,520
first five vertebrae a few solid so I'm

3313
02:06:59,520 --> 02:07:04,199
a 12 year old kid riding trails on a

3314
02:07:02,520 --> 02:07:05,760
motorcycle that was too big for me I

3315
02:07:04,198 --> 02:07:10,738
weighed like 70 pounds and they gave me

3316
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:13,320
100 CC Suzuki ETS 100 and uh I was just

3317
02:07:10,738 --> 02:07:15,178
a terror and I my head would be bouncing

3318
02:07:13,319 --> 02:07:17,219
around and it started to hurt so I

3319
02:07:15,179 --> 02:07:18,658
wasn't seeing my doctor and I said hey

3320
02:07:17,219 --> 02:07:20,880
you got to give me something from my

3321
02:07:18,658 --> 02:07:22,920
neck he said no he said you're next

3322
02:07:20,880 --> 02:07:24,840
fused and it's not going to get better

3323
02:07:22,920 --> 02:07:26,219
and the only thing I could prescribe for

3324
02:07:24,840 --> 02:07:28,079
you is opiates and they'll become

3325
02:07:26,219 --> 02:07:29,520
physically or mentally addicted and

3326
02:07:28,079 --> 02:07:30,840
it'll ruin your life and I'm not going

3327
02:07:29,520 --> 02:07:34,020
to do it so you got to learn how to deal

3328
02:07:30,840 --> 02:07:37,139
with it and I was like that sucks and I

3329
02:07:34,020 --> 02:07:38,280
was 12 you know and um and I said [ __ ]

3330
02:07:37,139 --> 02:07:40,260
what do I do he goes well you could try

3331
02:07:38,279 --> 02:07:42,059
smoking your mom's pot and I was just

3332
02:07:40,260 --> 02:07:44,760
like ha ha and he's like no I'm serious

3333
02:07:42,060 --> 02:07:48,500
because of my help and um and I was just

3334
02:07:44,760 --> 02:07:51,300
like it was 1982 and uh and probably

3335
02:07:48,500 --> 02:07:53,399
October and I was just like so I went to

3336
02:07:51,300 --> 02:07:55,980
my mom and was like hey Peter Peter

3337
02:07:53,399 --> 02:07:58,019
Smith was my pediatrician I said he told

3338
02:07:55,979 --> 02:07:59,939
me maybe I could smoke some pot and it

3339
02:07:58,020 --> 02:08:04,080
would help my neck feel better and she

3340
02:07:59,939 --> 02:08:06,178
was like really and I was like ask him

3341
02:08:04,079 --> 02:08:07,559
and she was so she did because she

3342
02:08:06,179 --> 02:08:09,060
believed me though and she gave me some

3343
02:08:07,560 --> 02:08:10,800
on the spot but we did have a

3344
02:08:09,060 --> 02:08:13,020
conversation about it when we went back

3345
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:15,900
to the hospital because if I had lied it

3346
02:08:13,020 --> 02:08:18,000
would have been the end of me and uh so

3347
02:08:15,899 --> 02:08:20,158
when we got there and she said did you

3348
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:22,020
tell him smoke pot and he's like yeah

3349
02:08:20,158 --> 02:08:23,579
how did it work out did you try it then

3350
02:08:22,020 --> 02:08:25,320
it was just like okay you weren't full

3351
02:08:23,579 --> 02:08:27,059
of [ __ ] you know because like how many

3352
02:08:25,319 --> 02:08:29,039
doctors back then were brave enough but

3353
02:08:27,060 --> 02:08:30,900
he had been my pediatrician since I was

3354
02:08:29,039 --> 02:08:33,238
like two or three years old so he had

3355
02:08:30,899 --> 02:08:36,238
like had such a close relationship with

3356
02:08:33,238 --> 02:08:38,218
me and my family and my mom and dad were

3357
02:08:36,238 --> 02:08:40,559
bikers so they weren't exactly going to

3358
02:08:38,219 --> 02:08:42,179
go to the cops like you know they may

3359
02:08:40,560 --> 02:08:44,280
have been Outlaws but you could trust

3360
02:08:42,179 --> 02:08:46,500
them I know that sounds funny to say but

3361
02:08:44,279 --> 02:08:49,800
like they would there was like dignity

3362
02:08:46,500 --> 02:08:51,779
and within that so like uh so he was

3363
02:08:49,800 --> 02:08:54,599
cool with it and um I started getting

3364
02:08:51,779 --> 02:08:56,639
bags of weed from my mom and one day we

3365
02:08:54,599 --> 02:08:59,699
were we were and I was sworn to secrecy

3366
02:08:56,639 --> 02:09:00,840
unfortunately but uh I stopped with all

3367
02:08:59,698 --> 02:09:03,359
the big kids because all the kids who

3368
02:09:00,840 --> 02:09:06,659
had motorcycles were like [ __ ] 17 18

3369
02:09:03,359 --> 02:09:09,118
uh 16 at least and I was just like the

3370
02:09:06,658 --> 02:09:11,519
odd man out and uh I walked up to the

3371
02:09:09,118 --> 02:09:13,979
man and they had a little bag of brown

3372
02:09:11,520 --> 02:09:16,619
pot and I never saw a brown pop before

3373
02:09:13,979 --> 02:09:19,259
in my life my mom never had Brown weed

3374
02:09:16,618 --> 02:09:21,299
and I was like why is it brown and they

3375
02:09:19,260 --> 02:09:24,119
were like because it comes that way and

3376
02:09:21,300 --> 02:09:26,219
I said does it grow that way and they

3377
02:09:24,118 --> 02:09:28,198
were like what do you know and I had

3378
02:09:26,219 --> 02:09:30,779
gotten a 20 back from my mom that day

3379
02:09:28,198 --> 02:09:33,539
and I had split it I'd rolled a couple

3380
02:09:30,779 --> 02:09:35,460
joints split it in half left half of it

3381
02:09:33,539 --> 02:09:36,960
at home took half of it with me in case

3382
02:09:35,460 --> 02:09:39,599
I wanted more weed and took the two

3383
02:09:36,960 --> 02:09:41,039
joints with me and uh so I went back and

3384
02:09:39,599 --> 02:09:42,480
grabbed a little half a bag of weed

3385
02:09:41,039 --> 02:09:45,238
which is now like a six dollar bag of

3386
02:09:42,479 --> 02:09:47,519
pot and uh and and a joint and I lit it

3387
02:09:45,238 --> 02:09:49,678
and I passed it around to all the big

3388
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:52,260
kids and every one of them bro started

3389
02:09:49,679 --> 02:09:54,118
coughing their ass off and my one friend

3390
02:09:52,260 --> 02:09:55,860
was like is he's coughing he was like

3391
02:09:54,118 --> 02:09:59,000
well this is what it's supposed to feel

3392
02:09:55,859 --> 02:10:01,500
like it was just really hilarious and um

3393
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:03,420
the kid John next to me was just like

3394
02:10:01,500 --> 02:10:04,920
where'd you get this pot and I was like

3395
02:10:03,420 --> 02:10:06,779
can't tell you and he was like will you

3396
02:10:04,920 --> 02:10:08,158
sell it to me and I was like yeah I was

3397
02:10:06,779 --> 02:10:10,319
like how much will you give me for it

3398
02:10:08,158 --> 02:10:12,118
and he was like if I gave you 20 would

3399
02:10:10,319 --> 02:10:13,880
you feel like I ripped you off I said no

3400
02:10:12,118 --> 02:10:16,500
I'll sell you that for twenty dollars

3401
02:10:13,880 --> 02:10:18,420
because I got more than twice that and

3402
02:10:16,500 --> 02:10:19,920
two joints for twenty dollars because it

3403
02:10:18,420 --> 02:10:22,319
was a 20 back because my mom was a

3404
02:10:19,920 --> 02:10:24,539
dealer so I just was like oh my gosh and

3405
02:10:22,319 --> 02:10:26,880
uh right when I did that my big friend

3406
02:10:24,539 --> 02:10:28,560
said can I get one too and I had the

3407
02:10:26,880 --> 02:10:31,260
other half at home and I was like yes

3408
02:10:28,560 --> 02:10:33,900
and uh so he only lived three houses

3409
02:10:31,260 --> 02:10:36,960
away from my grandma so I [ __ ] like

3410
02:10:33,899 --> 02:10:39,899
it was that was it man from that day on

3411
02:10:36,960 --> 02:10:42,960
I became uh my neighborhood pot dealer

3412
02:10:39,899 --> 02:10:44,879
and uh I my poor mom dude I went back to

3413
02:10:42,960 --> 02:10:47,399
her that night after hitting her up for

3414
02:10:44,880 --> 02:10:49,139
a bag that day and said can I get

3415
02:10:47,399 --> 02:10:50,399
another bag of pot and she goes oh honey

3416
02:10:49,139 --> 02:10:52,260
you know I can't just keep giving you

3417
02:10:50,399 --> 02:10:54,359
bags of pot you know I was like

3418
02:10:52,260 --> 02:10:56,520
because now I had like 40 bucks I bought

3419
02:10:54,359 --> 02:10:58,618
gas which my my gas tank didn't even

3420
02:10:56,520 --> 02:11:01,380
hold a gallon and I swear gas was like

3421
02:10:58,618 --> 02:11:02,698
60 cents back then and um and like I

3422
02:11:01,380 --> 02:11:04,319
brought my friend to friendlies and I

3423
02:11:02,698 --> 02:11:06,539
treated and I think I spent four dollars

3424
02:11:04,319 --> 02:11:08,279
and uh we got Burgers and Fries and

3425
02:11:06,539 --> 02:11:11,340
sodas and it was like four dollars you

3426
02:11:08,279 --> 02:11:13,139
know it was 1982. so uh

3427
02:11:11,340 --> 02:11:15,420
so my mom looked at me and I was like

3428
02:11:13,139 --> 02:11:17,520
can I just buy it and and the look on

3429
02:11:15,420 --> 02:11:20,819
her face was sheer [ __ ] horror you

3430
02:11:17,520 --> 02:11:22,440
know but she's like I guess so and uh

3431
02:11:20,819 --> 02:11:25,079
and I was like cool can I pick and then

3432
02:11:22,439 --> 02:11:26,939
she was like I put the 20 down and I

3433
02:11:25,079 --> 02:11:28,920
went to go get the bag and she was just

3434
02:11:26,939 --> 02:11:32,519
like she knew it was like this is not

3435
02:11:28,920 --> 02:11:34,560
good you know but uh I started selling

3436
02:11:32,520 --> 02:11:37,679
pot to my friends and uh it worked out

3437
02:11:34,560 --> 02:11:39,599
really well and by the time I was like

3438
02:11:37,679 --> 02:11:41,340
12 years old in six months I was

3439
02:11:39,599 --> 02:11:43,199
probably selling like 200 worth of weed

3440
02:11:41,340 --> 02:11:45,420
to my local friends you know because I

3441
02:11:43,198 --> 02:11:47,399
buy an ounce and I'd split it into four

3442
02:11:45,420 --> 02:11:50,219
bags and sell it from 40 each so I get

3443
02:11:47,399 --> 02:11:52,559
like 160 per ounce for like a quarter

3444
02:11:50,219 --> 02:11:54,300
ounce you know for 40 bucks and um

3445
02:11:52,560 --> 02:11:55,860
I never sold joints I would only give

3446
02:11:54,300 --> 02:11:57,659
them away because when people ask me for

3447
02:11:55,859 --> 02:11:59,158
joints I always felt bad that they

3448
02:11:57,658 --> 02:12:00,719
couldn't afford a bag of weed so I just

3449
02:11:59,158 --> 02:12:02,519
give them a giant give them a hug

3450
02:12:00,719 --> 02:12:04,020
because I felt like there was karma in

3451
02:12:02,520 --> 02:12:05,760
the world and I felt like if you were

3452
02:12:04,020 --> 02:12:07,500
giving away joints and somewhere

3453
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:09,239
somebody was like lighting up a joint

3454
02:12:07,500 --> 02:12:10,979
that they couldn't help but to think

3455
02:12:09,238 --> 02:12:12,839
good thoughts of you

3456
02:12:10,979 --> 02:12:14,939
because like you just let them off the

3457
02:12:12,840 --> 02:12:16,619
joint for free you know and like I don't

3458
02:12:14,939 --> 02:12:18,539
know like I felt like if a lot of people

3459
02:12:16,618 --> 02:12:19,738
were thinking good thoughts of you that

3460
02:12:18,539 --> 02:12:22,260
your life would be a little bit better

3461
02:12:19,738 --> 02:12:23,879
but at the time my thought process was

3462
02:12:22,260 --> 02:12:25,920
with that but

3463
02:12:23,880 --> 02:12:27,840
um and then I went to sell a bag of weed

3464
02:12:25,920 --> 02:12:30,359
to my friend's older brother he was all

3465
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:32,699
of like 19 at the time and when we got

3466
02:12:30,359 --> 02:12:34,920
to his house he had a Mel Frank grow

3467
02:12:32,698 --> 02:12:36,479
book and he had

3468
02:12:34,920 --> 02:12:38,760
um he had built he was a construction

3469
02:12:36,479 --> 02:12:40,559
worker so he built like this plywood

3470
02:12:38,760 --> 02:12:41,820
Closet in his living room where those

3471
02:12:40,560 --> 02:12:44,039
most normal people would have a

3472
02:12:41,819 --> 02:12:46,019
television and it was like four feet

3473
02:12:44,039 --> 02:12:47,880
maybe four and a half feet wide uh

3474
02:12:46,020 --> 02:12:50,520
because he had four foot lamps in it and

3475
02:12:47,880 --> 02:12:53,279
then he it was like maybe 18 that put 30

3476
02:12:50,520 --> 02:12:55,440
inches off the wall and it had doors and

3477
02:12:53,279 --> 02:12:57,479
when he opened it and I saw plants there

3478
02:12:55,439 --> 02:13:00,419
growing with the fluorescent light it

3479
02:12:57,479 --> 02:13:01,379
was like the color version of the you

3480
02:13:00,420 --> 02:13:02,099
know

3481
02:13:01,380 --> 02:13:04,739
um

3482
02:13:02,099 --> 02:13:06,539
that [ __ ] um the emerald Brick Road

3483
02:13:04,738 --> 02:13:07,979
well the wizard of Vara is like well

3484
02:13:06,539 --> 02:13:10,800
they show color for the first time but

3485
02:13:07,979 --> 02:13:13,678
like my whole life changed that was I

3486
02:13:10,800 --> 02:13:15,539
was [ __ ] floored man and uh I traded

3487
02:13:13,679 --> 02:13:17,819
him the 20 bag of weed for that Mel

3488
02:13:15,539 --> 02:13:20,039
Frank row book and I went home I cleaned

3489
02:13:17,819 --> 02:13:22,799
out my closet I already had seats I

3490
02:13:20,039 --> 02:13:24,840
found the pots the the clothing lines

3491
02:13:22,800 --> 02:13:26,639
that I used to hang the lights I found

3492
02:13:24,840 --> 02:13:28,860

3493
02:13:26,639 --> 02:13:29,819

3497
02:13:33,779 --> 02:13:38,158
shed where she used to keep her pots in

3498
02:13:35,520 --> 02:13:40,440
her soil and her watering can and I

3499
02:13:38,158 --> 02:13:43,799
[ __ ] dude at work it works so good

3500
02:13:40,439 --> 02:13:45,719
and I grew pot for like a year until my

3501
02:13:43,800 --> 02:13:48,119
grandma caught me and when she caught me

3502
02:13:45,719 --> 02:13:49,439
it was [ __ ] cute as [ __ ] because she

3503
02:13:48,118 --> 02:13:51,118
came up like I used to have my light

3504
02:13:49,439 --> 02:13:53,939
cycle eight to eight so when I was at

3505
02:13:51,118 --> 02:13:56,698

3506
02:13:53,939 --> 02:13:58,678
up at like 7 59 and 55 seconds and the

3507
02:13:56,698 --> 02:14:00,658
lights glowing in the closet and she

3508
02:13:58,679 --> 02:14:03,359
goes to touch me and the timer clicked

3509
02:14:00,658 --> 02:14:05,158
off and she freaking and loses it saying

3510
02:14:03,359 --> 02:14:06,479

3511
02:14:05,158 --> 02:14:08,879

02:14:10,618 --> 02:14:14,219
slide it open and I reach down and as

3515
02:14:12,359 --> 02:14:16,198
soon as I clicked the timer she heard

3516
02:14:14,219 --> 02:14:18,420
the sound of it she goes hey that's my

3517
02:14:16,198 --> 02:14:19,618
timer and then the lights flickered on

3518
02:14:18,420 --> 02:14:21,300
and she goes those are my fluorescent

3519
02:14:19,618 --> 02:14:24,118
lights and she looks down and I had like

3520
02:14:21,300 --> 02:14:25,800

3521
02:14:24,118 --> 02:14:28,380
like those are my pots that's my

3522
02:14:25,800 --> 02:14:30,539

02:14:33,238 --> 02:14:36,359
been dying to tell you why all of your

3526
02:14:35,039 --> 02:14:38,639
house plants are dying it's because

3527
02:14:36,359 --> 02:14:40,738
you're not fertilizing them and she was

3528
02:14:38,639 --> 02:14:42,060
just like what and the plants were like

3529
02:14:40,738 --> 02:14:43,500
six feet high because I didn't know what

3530
02:14:42,060 --> 02:14:45,300
I was doing I was just raising the light

3531
02:14:43,500 --> 02:14:46,738
as they would grow and there she was

3532
02:14:45,300 --> 02:14:48,900
like four foot eleven she was Italian

3533
02:14:46,738 --> 02:14:50,879
and she like looks at this and she's

3534
02:14:48,899 --> 02:14:52,738
like they were bigger than her men and

3535
02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:54,840
they were in Bud and the leaves were

3536
02:14:52,738 --> 02:14:57,238
huge and she was like

3537
02:14:54,840 --> 02:14:58,800
do you bring these outside I said no she

3538
02:14:57,238 --> 02:14:59,879
goes they grow under these fluorescent

3539
02:14:58,800 --> 02:15:02,039
lights I was like yeah I was really

3540
02:14:59,880 --> 02:15:04,618
surprised myself and she was like

3541
02:15:02,039 --> 02:15:06,359
couldn't believe I did it you know like

3542
02:15:04,618 --> 02:15:07,679
she just couldn't and she couldn't she

3543
02:15:06,359 --> 02:15:10,439
like because they were clearly had been

3544
02:15:07,679 --> 02:15:11,940
there for a long time and um I left that

3545
02:15:10,439 --> 02:15:13,859
day with the deal that she wouldn't hurt

3546
02:15:11,939 --> 02:15:15,960
my plants while I was in school and then

3547
02:15:13,859 --> 02:15:18,299
I came home and I was like yo

3548
02:15:15,960 --> 02:15:20,099
what's up you know and uh she said I

3549
02:15:18,300 --> 02:15:22,739
think they need more room and I was like

3550
02:15:20,099 --> 02:15:25,260
oh so she let me put him downstairs she

3551
02:15:22,738 --> 02:15:26,759
had me lay down a pallet put my pots on

3552
02:15:25,260 --> 02:15:28,860
the pallet so they wouldn't be on the

3553
02:15:26,760 --> 02:15:30,840
concrete and then she let me use some of

3554
02:15:28,859 --> 02:15:33,059
her old drapes that had white vinyl on

3555
02:15:30,840 --> 02:15:35,460
the inside and I hung it to the exposed

3556
02:15:33,060 --> 02:15:37,320
wood and I hung a fan up top and I had

3557
02:15:35,460 --> 02:15:39,300
my fluorescent lights there and she

3558
02:15:37,319 --> 02:15:41,939
started watering the plants when she

3559
02:15:39,300 --> 02:15:44,820
would do the wash and then they finished

3560
02:15:41,939 --> 02:15:47,519
and I had my first Growers dispute ever

3561
02:15:44,819 --> 02:15:49,439

3565

3575
02:16:13,679 --> 02:16:20,039

3576
02:16:17,158 --> 02:16:21,598
God Todd I can't you should have left a

3577
02:16:20,039 --> 02:16:23,460
little [ __ ] because I've been taking

3578
02:16:21,599 --> 02:16:25,619
care of him and I was like and I

3579
02:16:23,460 --> 02:16:28,679
realized at that moment how attached she

3580
02:16:25,618 --> 02:16:31,319
came to him and I felt so bad and uh it

3581
02:16:28,679 --> 02:16:33,898
was really cute and uh after that I I

3582
02:16:31,319 --> 02:16:36,239
did my first cutting in the kitchen with

3583
02:16:33,898 --> 02:16:38,579
my grandma uh we actually put it in a

3584
02:16:36,239 --> 02:16:40,558
napkin with a powder like formats I

3585
02:16:38,579 --> 02:16:42,299
still use it to this day number eight uh

3586
02:16:40,558 --> 02:16:44,459
it had been around since she was younger

3587
02:16:42,299 --> 02:16:46,379
and um I put in rooting powder put in

3588
02:16:44,459 --> 02:16:49,079
the napkin and we had it like in the

3589
02:16:46,379 --> 02:16:50,938
little like in a little she had sauces

3590
02:16:49,079 --> 02:16:52,799
for her tea and she would put a little

3591
02:16:50,939 --> 02:16:54,479
water in the saucer and left it right

3592
02:16:52,799 --> 02:16:56,938
there and the [ __ ] Roots grew right

3593
02:16:54,478 --> 02:16:58,619
through the paper towel and and it was

3594
02:16:56,939 --> 02:17:01,380
neat and and that's when I started doing

3595
02:16:58,620 --> 02:17:03,780
cuttings way back way back in 1984 with

3596
02:17:01,379 --> 02:17:06,420
my grandma and uh it was really cool

3597
02:17:03,780 --> 02:17:09,620
honestly and uh I I other than going to

3598
02:17:06,420 --> 02:17:13,079
prison I've never stopped growing sets

3599
02:17:09,620 --> 02:17:15,059
wow what a fantastic like real organic

3600
02:17:13,079 --> 02:17:16,620
sort of story that's so cool you and

3601
02:17:15,058 --> 02:17:18,599
your grandma grew together I love it

3602
02:17:16,620 --> 02:17:19,800
yeah it's really funny she took my

3603
02:17:18,599 --> 02:17:22,139
Pringles can because I used to have

3604
02:17:19,799 --> 02:17:24,000
these uh they like chips that come in

3605
02:17:22,138 --> 02:17:25,739
America called Pringles and they they

3606
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:27,780
come in a can they they're very much

3607
02:17:25,739 --> 02:17:29,819
like this thing so your chips are all

3608
02:17:27,780 --> 02:17:31,979
like perfectly formed and they don't get

3609
02:17:29,819 --> 02:17:34,138
crushed and uh it was really funny

3610
02:17:31,978 --> 02:17:35,638
because I had Pringles cans full of

3611
02:17:34,138 --> 02:17:37,259
seeds because when I get pot with seeds

3612
02:17:35,638 --> 02:17:39,358
I would take the seeds out and just sell

3613
02:17:37,260 --> 02:17:40,739
the weed to my friends because they

3614
02:17:39,359 --> 02:17:43,019
didn't want seeds and it didn't look

3615
02:17:40,739 --> 02:17:45,840
good in my bags so I collected all these

3616
02:17:43,019 --> 02:17:47,760
seeds and uh she she snatched one of my

3617
02:17:45,840 --> 02:17:49,319
Pringles cans and she had a garden

3618
02:17:47,760 --> 02:17:51,420
outside of her window where she'd have

3619
02:17:49,319 --> 02:17:53,459
roses grow up and then she'd prune all

3620
02:17:51,420 --> 02:17:55,620
the Roses so they all came just to the

3621
02:17:53,459 --> 02:17:57,119
height of her window so it would she had

3622
02:17:55,620 --> 02:17:59,099
opened her window it'd be all roses it

3623
02:17:57,120 --> 02:18:00,960
was really cool she was like really good

3624
02:17:59,099 --> 02:18:03,840
at gardening you know but you have to

3625
02:18:00,959 --> 02:18:06,299
realize she was born in 1911 and her big

3626
02:18:03,840 --> 02:18:07,978
like technological advancement when she

3627
02:18:06,299 --> 02:18:09,420
was a little girl was her house study

3628
02:18:07,978 --> 02:18:12,058
electricity

3629
02:18:09,420 --> 02:18:13,920
so just to put it in perspective and she

3630
02:18:12,058 --> 02:18:16,199
grew she grew her food in the backyard

3631
02:18:13,920 --> 02:18:19,079
and they they had to understand food

3632
02:18:16,200 --> 02:18:21,359
preservation and you know cultivation

3633
02:18:19,079 --> 02:18:22,679
was a part of human existence to her so

3634
02:18:21,359 --> 02:18:25,859
she's the one who taught me how to grow

3635
02:18:22,679 --> 02:18:27,478
a garden in our backyard and um and

3636
02:18:25,859 --> 02:18:31,019
she's really where all this came from

3637
02:18:27,478 --> 02:18:32,699
and I I will give her credit forever for

3638
02:18:31,019 --> 02:18:35,639
turning me on to this it was really cool

3639
02:18:32,700 --> 02:18:37,859
of her and but uh but she took my

3640
02:18:35,638 --> 02:18:40,500
Pringles can and uh turned the ground

3641
02:18:37,859 --> 02:18:42,840
and then sprinkled these cannabis seeds

3642
02:18:40,500 --> 02:18:44,459
like broadcast style all there and I'm

3643
02:18:42,840 --> 02:18:45,780
in the backyard selling my friend a bag

3644
02:18:44,459 --> 02:18:47,518
of weed it was dude you're gonna get

3645
02:18:45,780 --> 02:18:49,380
caught and I went

3646
02:18:47,519 --> 02:18:50,519
like I thought he meant selling in the

3647
02:18:49,379 --> 02:18:52,138
bag of weed and I was like that's what

3648
02:18:50,519 --> 02:18:54,478
are you talking about and he goes dude

3649
02:18:52,138 --> 02:18:56,819
all these plants and I looked down and

3650
02:18:54,478 --> 02:18:58,739
they were all like knee-high because as

3651
02:18:56,819 --> 02:19:01,079
they grew up my grandmother would take

3652
02:18:58,739 --> 02:19:03,359
her hedger and just sniff them like you

3653
02:19:01,079 --> 02:19:05,939
know with the hedger snip snip snip snip

3654
02:19:03,359 --> 02:19:07,620
snip so she had a little like it was

3655
02:19:05,939 --> 02:19:10,439
probably a hundred something little

3656
02:19:07,620 --> 02:19:13,079
plants but or more but it was like it

3657
02:19:10,439 --> 02:19:15,719
looked like a little Green Hedge you

3658
02:19:13,079 --> 02:19:18,239
know because she was just

3659
02:19:15,718 --> 02:19:19,799
like she did her roses and I was just I

3660
02:19:18,239 --> 02:19:21,478
went inside I was like Grandma what are

3661
02:19:19,799 --> 02:19:23,279
you doing and she's like don't you touch

3662
02:19:21,478 --> 02:19:24,959
those those are mine and I was like

3663
02:19:23,280 --> 02:19:26,460
Graham are you gonna get us in trouble I

3664
02:19:24,959 --> 02:19:29,159
was like you can't just be growing you

3665
02:19:26,459 --> 02:19:31,678
can't do this she's like why and I was

3666
02:19:29,159 --> 02:19:33,478
like Grandma is he legal she goes ah

3667
02:19:31,679 --> 02:19:35,519
plant and I was like

3668
02:19:33,478 --> 02:19:37,260
this is gonna be kind of hard to explain

3669
02:19:35,519 --> 02:19:39,120
I think you know because she just

3670
02:19:37,260 --> 02:19:41,519
couldn't wrap her head around the idea

3671
02:19:39,120 --> 02:19:44,219
that a plant was illegal like she was

3672
02:19:41,519 --> 02:19:47,398
like the drugs illegal but the plant

3673
02:19:44,218 --> 02:19:48,419
like what are you crazy and I was like

3674
02:19:47,398 --> 02:19:51,180
oh

3675
02:19:48,420 --> 02:19:54,239
and uh it was funny and she did cut them

3676
02:19:51,180 --> 02:19:56,460
down but she was pissy about it and um

3677
02:19:54,239 --> 02:19:58,739
it wasn't until I showed my mom and my

3678
02:19:56,459 --> 02:20:00,599
stepdad and and they all were like maybe

3679
02:19:58,739 --> 02:20:03,659
you gotta cut these plants down there

3680
02:20:00,600 --> 02:20:06,120
she was just like she she was hot she

3681
02:20:03,659 --> 02:20:07,739
was just a cool little lady but you know

3682
02:20:06,120 --> 02:20:09,240
it was pretty funny I got my first

3683
02:20:07,739 --> 02:20:11,459
traffic ticket when I was 12 years old

3684
02:20:09,239 --> 02:20:13,319
speeding I was doing 70 on the sidewalk

3685
02:20:11,459 --> 02:20:15,119
I got arrested they towed my motorcycle

3686
02:20:13,319 --> 02:20:16,859
and when they took me to the police

3687
02:20:15,120 --> 02:20:18,420
station they made me call my parents and

3688
02:20:16,859 --> 02:20:21,180
I lived with my grandma so I called my

3689
02:20:18,420 --> 02:20:24,059
grandma and uh she drove a 69 Pontiac

3690
02:20:21,180 --> 02:20:27,600
Firebird with like a uh souped-up 350 it

3691
02:20:24,059 --> 02:20:30,359
was hugger orange my my stepdad gave it

3692
02:20:27,600 --> 02:20:32,460
to her because he thought that his

3693
02:20:30,359 --> 02:20:34,319
mother-in-law Drive in a fast muscle car

3694
02:20:32,459 --> 02:20:36,299
would be cool so he gave her a fast

3695
02:20:34,319 --> 02:20:39,898
muscle car so I'm sitting in a police

3696
02:20:36,299 --> 02:20:41,299
station I'm 12. and and the cop hears

3697
02:20:39,898 --> 02:20:43,739
the car pull up

3698
02:20:41,299 --> 02:20:46,379
and he goes who'd you call I said call

3699
02:20:43,739 --> 02:20:47,818
my grandma and he opens the door and

3700
02:20:46,379 --> 02:20:49,500
there's this little little lady standing

3701
02:20:47,818 --> 02:20:51,420
in front of this [ __ ] 60s muscle car

3702
02:20:49,500 --> 02:20:54,059
and he says is that your car and she

3703
02:20:51,420 --> 02:20:56,159
goes you got a problem with that and he

3704
02:20:54,059 --> 02:20:58,680
was like oh this is definitely your

3705
02:20:56,159 --> 02:21:00,659
grandson and he had to come in and he

3706
02:20:58,680 --> 02:21:02,639
says he was doing 70 on the sidewalk she

3707
02:21:00,659 --> 02:21:03,600
goes I don't think his motorcycle can go

3708
02:21:02,639 --> 02:21:07,619
that fast

3709
02:21:03,600 --> 02:21:10,579
he goes I had it on radar she's like I'd

3710
02:21:07,620 --> 02:21:10,579
have to see the radar

3711
02:21:11,040 --> 02:21:15,479
and I was just like I was there laughing

3712
02:21:13,680 --> 02:21:18,659
it was just like that was my grandpa you

3713
02:21:15,478 --> 02:21:21,179
know she was just she was just Nails you

3714
02:21:18,659 --> 02:21:23,398
know so it was adorable I I'm grateful

3715
02:21:21,180 --> 02:21:25,800
for her to this day you know and it's

3716
02:21:23,398 --> 02:21:28,680
funny because I started growing pot 1982

3717
02:21:25,799 --> 02:21:32,759
19 well it was 1983 technically the end

3718
02:21:28,680 --> 02:21:34,800
of 83 the beginning of 84 and um

3719
02:21:32,760 --> 02:21:36,780
and 13 years later I was living in a

3720
02:21:34,799 --> 02:21:38,699
Belair Mansion growing [ __ ] 4 000

3721
02:21:36,780 --> 02:21:41,220
marijuana plants with [ __ ] you know a

3722
02:21:38,700 --> 02:21:43,260
staff of six and I kind of think you

3723
02:21:41,219 --> 02:21:45,599
know how weird it is to go from living

3724
02:21:43,260 --> 02:21:47,159
on you know like welfare because I was a

3725
02:21:45,600 --> 02:21:49,200
pre-existing medical condition and we

3726
02:21:47,159 --> 02:21:50,398
were poor as dirt you know to like

3727
02:21:49,200 --> 02:21:53,460
living in one of the wealthiest

3728

3731
02:21:59,340 --> 02:22:04,978
never have expected that my little

3732
02:22:01,620 --> 02:22:08,100
closet Garden could end up you know

3733
