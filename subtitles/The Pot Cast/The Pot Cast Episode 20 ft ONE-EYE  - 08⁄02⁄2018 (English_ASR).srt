fantastic heavy days

00:00:54,479 --> 00:01:00,319
how are you i'm doing great

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,600
good times so first question i like to

28
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,079
ask everyone what was your first

29
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,599
experience with cannabis

30
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:10,879
um wow that goes back uh

31
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:12,640
many years for me believe it or not

32
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,719
this is going to sound really strange

33
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,000
but when i was

34
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:21,118
growing up in virginia beach virginia

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
uh i had a group

36
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:26,959
of friends a few guys who were about

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,280
four years older than me

38
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:30,239
and they were pretty much my surfing

39
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,960
buddies uh

40
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,359
so they were you know all able to drive

41
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,279
you know

42
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:39,039
long before i was so getting down to

43
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,040
places like cape hatteras was uh

44
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,560
quite created quite an advantage for me

45
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,239
of having these older guys but one of

46
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,000
the other things that came along

47
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:51,599
with the surfing capabilities

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,239
were the opportunities to see some cool

49
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:54,959
music

50
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:56,239
and also playing dungeons and dragons of

51
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:59,839
all things

52
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:03,919
so the summer that i turned 12 years old

53
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,840
after a game of dungeons and dragons one

54
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,920
of my older friends

55
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,200
pulled me aside and said hey you know

56
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,039
we're going to go out to the porch here

57
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:14,159
and smoke a joint

58
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:15,598
would you care to do so and uh you know

59
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,799
you got to remember this is

60
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:22,318
roughly 1986.

61
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:28,239
the just say no campaign

62
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:29,598
was very much part of our existence

63
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,680
so i was pretty hesitant in the

64
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,199
beginning but i caved eventually after a

65
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,400
little bit of peer pressure

66
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:38,639
and that you know

67
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,640
uh

68
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,479
i can't remember i don't remember that i

69
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:46,560
really got too high off that first joint

70
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:48,560
but i knew it was something that i was

71
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,239
willing to do again

72
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:55,360
and over the next few years

73
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,360
uh primarily getting high

74
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,200
with friends and smoking joints and

75
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,840
taking long hits

76
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:02,639
all that good stuff of course as i got

77
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,239
older that

78
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:09,119
the frequency certainly increased

79
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,959
but uh you know not a uh it was a

80
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,599
groundbreaking moment for sure

81
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,640
because it certainly opened my eyes to a

82
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:17,119
whole new world

83
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,079
and way to experience the world for sure

84
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,200
and so

85
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,800
how did you transition from that to a

86
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:23,919
grower it's obviously

87
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,599
because you know you sound like you're

88
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:27,119
quite apprehensive so i imagine it would

89
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:30,079
have taken a little bit for you to

90
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:33,680
really get head first in so to speak

91
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,920
that's very very true uh being the you

92
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,280
know

93
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:40,238
growing up during that era it was uh

94
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,519
very taboo and uh certainly wasn't uh

95
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:46,158
wildly accepted by the masses

96
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,280
but there was a group of us and we we

97
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:49,439
certainly you know

98
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,719
kept to our kept to ourselves and kept

99
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:52,479
to the uh

100
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:55,039
stay dedicated to the smoking of

101
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:58,000
cannabis it really wasn't until

102
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:58,878
uh my i don't know 11th or 12th grade

103
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,239
year

104
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:05,679
in high school that my

105
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:08,080
a friend of mine and i decided to

106
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,360
sprout some seeds and put them outside

107
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,840
and see what we could do

108
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,000
this was the beginning of several failed

109
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,560
attempts

110
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,600
in you know in in the hometown where i

111
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,600
grew up

112
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,879
it wasn't really until i went off to

113
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,840
college

114
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:28,879
in the early 90s that i

115
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:30,879
decided to be a bit more committed to

116
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:34,399
the growing cause

117
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:37,600
and it really just started with cracking

118
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:40,000
bag seeds uh you know

119
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,439
as new things came through again back

120
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,079
then it was all kind but of course and

121
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:47,918
we certainly got to learn some of the

122
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:50,240
different names of strains

123
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:52,079
but we were just more or less cracking

124
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,199
random seeds

125
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:57,839
primarily outdoor but

126
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:01,280
there was some early indoor cultivation

127
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:03,439
in closets while i was in college

128
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:06,159
and you know back then we were really

129
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:07,759
winging it there was no

130
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,880
growth store that you could there were

131
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,160
growth you know there was a couple of

132
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:13,038
hydro stores

133
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,880
within an hour's drive of my college but

134
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:17,519
you certainly weren't going there for

135
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:20,399
any advice during that era

136
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:22,079
so we really had to just kind of figure

137
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:24,079
it out the best we could

138
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:26,240
maybe a couple of articles in high times

139
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:28,719
here there but

140
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,918
the beginnings were very rudimentary at

141
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,759
best

142
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:33,519
but we did what we could and you know

143
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,439
there were some good things that turned

144
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:37,918
out of some of those early gardens

145
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:39,120
but uh the success rates were not very

146
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:41,120
high

147
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,240
yeah and so who are the people that you

148
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,000
were looking up to

149
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,319
during that time was there anyone like

150
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,600
often we hear people like ed rosenthal

151
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:49,360
and you know the guys who were around

152
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,720
back in those days did you look to them

153
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,280
at all or you were really just

154
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,840
out in the ocean on your own i mean you

155
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,038
know

156
00:05:53,839 --> 00:06:01,679
as far as breeders were concerned

157
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:04,800
uh or expert growers or whatever

158
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,240
the only access that i really had to

159
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,879
that world was

160
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,439
via the high times magazine so people

161
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:12,719
like

162
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:16,719
neville for example fascinated me uh

163
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:20,479
in his whole story of lore and legend

164
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:23,840
but there weren't a lot of uh

165
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:25,360
gurus to look up to that we were really

166
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:28,239
that aware of

167
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,879
it wasn't until later on you know after

168
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,918
college

169
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:34,399
of late 90s that i uh

170
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:35,918
that i you know started looking up to

171
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:38,000
some folks who were making impacts in

172
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:40,719
the industry and of course early on

173
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,399
jack herrera comes to mind he was

174
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,440
someone and i

175
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:46,959
volunteered with normal when i was one

176
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:50,000
year when i was in college

177
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:53,519
and was exposed to the emperor aware's

178
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,478
clothes and and jack's whole

179
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:58,079
kind of pursuit of legal you know why

180
00:06:56,478 --> 00:07:00,639
legalized cannabis is such a good thing

181
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:02,959
and why hemp was so important

182
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,240
so you know between you know in the very

183
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:07,680
early days

184
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:10,478
jack herrera would be one uh you know

185
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,720
uh you know popular individual and then

186
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:15,038
neville would bend the other

187
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,000
so knowing what you know now if you had

188
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:18,159
to guess

189
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,319
what the origins of a lot of that kind

190
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,120
bud and by extension the seeds you were

191
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,240
getting from it

192
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,038
what do you think that stuff would have

193
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,680
been predominantly

194
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:30,000
so well a couple of them one of them in

195
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,879
fact i can attest to specifically

196
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,478
and that would have been the uh afghani

197
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:37,680
number one the wood which was

198
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:38,719
so lovely dawned the virginia beach

199
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,840
afghani

200
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:45,120
and this was the first kind bud that i

201
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:48,318
was exposed to when i was in high school

202
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,959
and it rained you know it

203
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,439
set kind of the gold standard for me in

204
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:55,519
those

205
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:57,279
very very early years there were

206
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:59,198
other you know of course skunk crop

207
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:00,799
skunk you know skunk was still around

208
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,720
then the railroad kill skunk

209
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,960
uh there were some northern lights that

210
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,080
would pop up here and there

211
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:10,239
we would see uh blueberry from time to

212
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:12,800
time

213
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,519
and then you know as the years

214
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,560
progressed into the early 90s

215
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:22,399
i started to get exposed to more

216
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:26,079
uh more of a variety i i went to school

217
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:30,000
around the dc area in northern virginia

218
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:33,199
and we would see things like g13

219
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,440
and pluton and now we would see nl2

220
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:40,640
and nl5 and nl5 haze crosses

221
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:43,919
black domina as you get

222
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:44,958
deeper into the mid 90s the the four-way

223
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:46,879
uh which is now

224
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:49,439
known to the cut is known as the fairfax

225
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:50,399
four-way that one just about changed my

226
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,200
life

227
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:58,480
and i was uh so this was right around

228
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:02,000
96 now that i

229
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,879
was fortunate enough to be in close

230
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,919
proximity

231
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:06,639
to the group who was responsible for

232
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:09,360
producing

233
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:11,600
those very early uh four-way the fairfax

234
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:15,919
four-way plants

235
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:19,200
and that strain when it hit our scene

236
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:20,479
just dominated the scene and it became

237
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,759
the standard by which

238
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,800
we judged everything else and it's

239
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:29,519
really the strain that got me into

240
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,838
eventually exploring the whole concept

241
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,600
of

242
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:37,360
breeding and creating new strains

243
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:40,320
i kind of set myself out on a mission to

244
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,639
kind of meet or beat the four-way which

245
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,200
was

246
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:44,639
a daunting task at that part of my

247
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,080
career but

248
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:47,838
you know we eventually got there after

249
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,920
several years

250
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:55,040
so it was uh

251
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:56,319
it was definitely you know a a

252
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:59,120
game-changing uh

253
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,560
strain and and many others you know

254
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,639
followed after that we eventually got

255
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,278
into the the white line so the white

256
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:07,600
widows

257
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:10,320
and white rhino the great white shark

258
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,759
some of those come to mind uh those now

259
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,278
we're getting a little deeper into the

260
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:15,600
90s

261
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:17,360
and then of course you know it wasn't

262
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,519
until i moved out west

263
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,519
that i actually was exposed to

264
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:25,199
things like og kush and of course you

265
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,320
know we're getting later into the two

266
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:31,120
mid 2000s at this point but you know we

267
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,160
we had i'd say when i was in that

268
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,440
northern virginia

269
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:37,838
area there you know just

270
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,600
due to location there were you know

271
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,120
there was quite an interesting scene

272
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,000
going in and around

273
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,039
that area with with pretty high quality

274
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,519
cannabis

275
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:48,399
um you know never mind the canadian

276
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,360
influence

277
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,078
which was certainly present at that time

278
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,839
but we

279
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:59,199
we really sought to source

280
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,640
the best domestic that we could find at

281
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,959
that time

282
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:03,919
and and we're attempting on the side to

283
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:07,359
produce

284
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:08,879
you know uh some some decent cannabis as

285
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,720
well

286
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:13,838
yeah wow so many different avenues we

287
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,759
could jump off into the first thing

288
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,600
you must have been friends with mr bob

289
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:22,000
hemphill for quite a while then

290
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:23,839
yes we we've known each other for

291
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,360
a cup gosh going on a cup probably a

292
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,240
couple decades now

293
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,240
we've definitely gone and seen some fish

294
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,799
shows back in the day together

295
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,519
uh it's really interesting you know he

296
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:35,278
and i

297
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,799
and this one this will kind of this will

298
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:40,320
be a great example of

299
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:43,599
how kind of deep the code went back then

300
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,440
so you know back in those days in the

301
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,480
early days especially back in virginia

302
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,079
you know neither one of us ever once had

303
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,920
the conversation

304
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:54,399
about growing uh even though we were

305
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:57,599
both

306
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,639
actively cultivating and probably knew

307
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,120
each other were

308
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,680
but it was just so tight back then that

309
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,000
you just

310
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,519
didn't even you know it was just you

311
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,200
just didn't want to breach the subject

312
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,839
because you didn't want someone else to

313
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,000
really know

314
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:14,480
um but you know he has forever

315
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,679
you know since those days been an

316
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,839
amazing

317
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:20,559
just incredible incredible cultivator i

318
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:23,760
have a lot of respect for

319
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:25,679
not only his ability to preserve

320
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:28,240
genetics and keep them over the years

321
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:31,039
but also as a cultivator he is

322
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,600
really spectacular in my opinion yeah

323
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:33,039
agreed

324
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,120
and i mean if we just touch back to a

325
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:36,559
point you made yourself the va

326
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,320
scene you know the more you learn about

327
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:40,479
it the more it seems like this place was

328
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,240
like the mecca of weed back in the day

329
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,278
what do you think contributed to being

330
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,278
such a hot spot

331
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,680
you know that's a that's a really good

332
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:54,320
question i think

333
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:54,319
there was

334
00:12:54,879 --> 00:13:01,120
a desire you know at that point in time

335
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,200
at least for the circle of folks that i

336
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,919
ran with uh which

337
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:09,440
overlaps a lot of these other you know

338
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,439
virginia breeders and growers

339
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:14,319
there was a need for self-sufficiency

340
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:19,040
you know

341
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:21,120
you didn't always want to rely on

342
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:22,958
what was coming in next on what load or

343
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,039
whatnot you know and we certainly didn't

344
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:28,239
want to all sit around and and

345
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:31,360
have to consume you know canadian

346
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,879
so i think um you know

347
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,959
there's a lot of rural countries

348
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:37,039
especially in southwestern virginia

349
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:40,239
floyd county comes to mind that was

350
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:40,240
always a mecca for

351
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:46,078
just incredibly grown cannabis over the

352
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,759
years

353
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:49,359
but you know you find even in the

354
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:50,240
richmond scene you know there's there's

355
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,360
a lot of

356
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,120
a lot of really important in my opinion

357
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,680
you know important breeders and

358
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,959
some of these kind of gurus of the

359
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:01,198
industry

360
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:02,159
that all hailed from you know the

361
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:05,838
dominion state

362
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:07,600
and it's um to me it's quite remarkable

363
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,959
um i don't know maybe it was something

364
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,159
in the water who knows

365
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:14,319
but there it i you know for us it came

366
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:16,240
out of self-sufficiency we didn't want

367
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,278
to have to rely

368
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,159
you know always on others so we set

369
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:23,360
forth

370
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:25,439
you know to to do our own thing and

371
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,959
produce our own cannabis even if those

372
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,519
small amounts and a lot of it you know

373
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:30,078
was just

374
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,600
head stash we weren't at that time

375
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:35,039
necessarily

376
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,278
you know all producing for production on

377
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:36,639
a

378
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:39,039
you know certainly not on a commercial

379
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:42,560
level or anything close to it

380
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:44,240
but it was always it was always pleasant

381
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:46,799
to know that you had a nice

382
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,759
head stash of you know nicely grown

383
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:50,639
cannabis with

384
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:51,120
you know great flavor and stupendous

385
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,440
highs

386
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,480
and you didn't have to rely on mexi

387
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,920
brick or

388
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,560
canadian so you know and it really i

389
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:01,198
mean it just

390
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,559
uh but but your point is and i think

391
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:05,439
about this a lot

392
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:07,119
about you know how many of these great

393
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:11,040
individuals have um

394
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,720
hailed from from the home state

395
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:14,719
yeah it's kind of perplexing to see it

396
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,320
all happen i think va in new york is

397
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,680
where a lot of the best stuff and

398
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,879
best breeders have come from in my

399
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:20,879
opinion and i'm sorry to anyone who's

400
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:23,759
not from there if you're butthurt but um

401
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:25,360
any anyway another thing you brought up

402
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:26,958
which is really interesting

403
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,879
actually no sorry i want to quickly ask

404
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:30,239
this one did you get any of that uh va

405
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:33,919
super skunk

406
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:38,079
yes yes uh the super skunk

407
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:42,000
was definitely you know

408
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:44,479
available and i do remember it um

409
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,039
it just it's so strange you know as soon

410
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,440
as you

411
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:48,159
talk about as soon as we got into that

412
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,680
four-way

413
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:54,958
era it really became

414
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:56,078
difficult for a other varieties to be

415
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,039
memorable just because we kind of it's

416
00:15:56,078 --> 00:15:58,479
just because it was some some of these

417
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,278
things were stopped at but the va uh

418
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,320
super skunk

419
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:04,000
is fantastic um i i

420
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,680
you know there's not enough nice things

421
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,720
that i could say about that strain

422
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:12,078
and i you know i applaud anyone who

423
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,879
pursues it during this era because it's

424
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:16,239
uh

425
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:18,399
you know it's a it's a special strain

426
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,198
so another one with the va tag in the

427
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,799
name you referenced it the va afghani i

428
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:23,198
think what's interesting about this one

429
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:25,278
is

430
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:27,519
it's actually making quite a comeback

431
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:29,439
notably duke diamonds worked in

432
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,519
some of his more recent lines i think

433
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,440
what's interesting about this one is

434
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,720
for the people who haven't seen or

435
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,399
smoked it in real life

436
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,240
i think it would really catch you off

437
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,600
guard that's that's the way i felt it

438
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,360
was nothing like what i expect like

439
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,040
didn't smell like what i expected the

440
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,159
high was nothing like what i expected

441
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:45,120
like i knew it was going to be good but

442
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:46,480
it was like a

443
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,039
how do you feel about that one because

444
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:52,240
it's it's really i think it's the real

445
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:55,120
anomaly and i'd love to hear europeans

446
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,560
so that that's a great one the virginia

447
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,839
beach afghani

448
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:01,599
is is a standout for

449
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,600
for me for one specific reason and

450
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:07,038
that's the flavor

451
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:10,720
um it almost has a

452
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:14,400
to me almost like a mentee note to it

453
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,759
and there is something so very distinct

454
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,439
about it

455
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:19,599
that it's you know it's certainly one of

456
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,319
those strains that if you smoke it once

457
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:23,599
or twice

458
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:27,038
you'll know it forever um

459
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:28,480
the plants aren't highly you know

460
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:30,480
and from what i remember you know and of

461
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,400
course going back many years to the

462
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,000
virginia beach days when our friends

463
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,759
were cultivating it you know it was all

464
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,919
closet cultivated

465
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:39,599
so these were smaller plants they didn't

466
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,799
yield an incredible amount

467
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:43,279
but they uh but what came out of that

468
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:46,400
was

469
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:50,639
you know an incredible high to me

470
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:54,480
it is uh almost you know mind numbing

471
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:57,520
and a flavor that is just remarkable

472
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:00,720
i mean it does have that kind of

473
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:02,319
slight ganny kind of hash plant taste to

474
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,400
it but like i said there's something

475
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:07,279
almost a minty note in it

476
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,840
that makes it unmistakable every time

477
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:11,359
and

478
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:12,480
i i was i actually would at the emerald

479
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:15,038
cup this year

480
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,880
when i saw that uh duke diamond was

481
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:18,879
breeding it with the gandy skunk with

482
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,360
the granny skunk or whatever i was

483
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,160
so excited to see that back i couldn't

484
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:23,599
resist

485
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,840
you know and certainly grab some for

486
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:29,038
myself to me that's you know an

487
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:31,759
homage to the old days and

488
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:33,279
uh it's like i said that ganny is there

489
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:34,798
there's just nothing like it else in the

490
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:36,960
world

491
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:39,359
yeah definitely i think the one thing

492
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,319
that i picked up on for me elise was

493
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:42,719
that mintiness you speak of i feel like

494
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:45,918
it's

495
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:48,720
it's one of the many components to that

496
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,240
jack herrera flavor like is that that's

497
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,798
what i found really weird like i thought

498
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,720
it was

499
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:53,918
really one of the more tropical like not

500
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,798
maybe not tropical but you know what i

501
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,720
mean it had

502
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:58,639
had a lot of body to it for an afghani

503
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,960
and it just took me back

504
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,720
um and the other thing i found was the

505
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,319
high it's like

506
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,798
i'm just going to quote dookie he said

507
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,279
it was almost like paranoia inducing it

508
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:10,400
so

509
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:12,319
so wrong yes it's not

510
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,679
typical of an afghani people think you

511
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:16,720
know like strong indicas would do the

512
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:19,840
opposite they'd chill you out

513
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:22,000
no not that one it is uh it is

514
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:24,240
unmistakable

515
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,599
yeah uh one one that hopefully everyone

516
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,038
gets to try the final thing i want to

517
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:29,599
look back on quickly

518
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:31,279
you mentioned the northern lights and

519
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:32,639
the blueberry being as some of the other

520
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:34,240
ones around at the time

521
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,919
out of all those ones that you do think

522
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,519
back on what's the most memorable for

523
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:41,120
you

524
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:41,679
g13 okay we don't hear a lot of that

525
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:44,719
anymore

526
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:47,440
what was it about the g13 that you liked

527
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,558
uh that's another one you know the real

528
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,840
d13

529
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:53,119
uh and it's it's a complex one to try to

530
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:58,639
describe

531
00:19:53,119 --> 00:20:01,759
it is has a very distinct taste

532
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,280
i really enjoyed the high we the g13

533
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:06,400
that we were getting back then actually

534
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:10,639
was coming from san diego

535
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:14,000
um it was

536
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,720
it just i i tell you what so i got a bag

537
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,319
seat of it

538
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,000
i think this is why i like it so much so

539
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:20,319
i got a bag seat out of it

540
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,400
and grew a plant of it outdoors in

541
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:24,960
northern virginia

542
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,320
and it was the only plant i've ever

543
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,240
grown in my life to actually have the

544
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:31,119
magenta pistols

545
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,679
which when it dried when the flower was

546
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:38,319
you know dried and cured out

547
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:41,440
so g13 in itself has that kind of um

548
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:42,879
almost grayish green tone to it to me

549
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,798
it has a lot to do with the trichome

550
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,120
coating but if you can imagine that kind

551
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:48,000
of

552
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:49,519
grayish green color with uh coated in

553
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,359
trichomes and these beautiful like

554
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:52,319
purple hairs that are interlaced in it

555
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:53,519
it just it

556
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:55,519
turned out to be one of those beautiful

557
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:58,319
flowers i've ever grown

558
00:20:55,519 --> 00:21:00,000
uh and then the the just the complexity

559
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:02,960
of flavor of g13

560
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,519
is another one that uh and that's what

561
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,440
i'm

562
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:07,440
it's work those are the really the

563
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,720
genetics that really get to me

564
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:13,759
are the ones that

565
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,519
have multiple layers of flavor you know

566
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:17,599
something on the inhale

567
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:20,240
something else on the exhale and then

568
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:22,319
those flares continue to evolve even

569
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,679
after the exhale

570
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:27,759
so for me the standout strains

571
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,720
going even going back in time are the

572
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:32,798
ones that

573
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:36,000
had that same quality and g13

574
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:38,158
certainly has that same quality

575
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,919
yeah okay and so i mean you just touched

576
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:43,919
on it you said you popped a bag seed

577
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:46,320
what was the first strain you ever grew

578
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,320
wow

579
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,880
let's see here

580
00:21:56,839 --> 00:22:01,599
so

581
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,400
let me think about that that is so there

582
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:05,279
was some

583
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,559
seeds that we had gotten out of what was

584
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:08,558
supposed to have been

585
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:11,038
back then it was just called purple haze

586
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:13,918
who knows really what it was

587
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:14,558
um those were probably some of the first

588
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,840
seeds

589
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:21,359
that we cracked where i actually had

590
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:22,079
successful plants um and those were

591
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:25,359
actually

592
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:27,519
indoor and then there was also a durbin

593
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:30,079
poison back then but that wasn't

594
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:32,400
per that wasn't bagsy that was actually

595
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:34,558
purchased from a friend of mine who went

596
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,600
over to amsterdam and brought some seeds

597
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:38,319
back

598
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:40,639
um so there was some durban poison back

599
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:44,000
then there was the purple haze

600
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:48,480
um there was once a

601
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:51,359
bag seed from a blueberry uh

602
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,240
see we scored some blueberry in 95 after

603
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:55,839
a fish show

604
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,919
outside the spectrum in philadelphia and

605
00:22:55,839 --> 00:23:00,240
there was a blueberry uh so and you know

606
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,640
these who knows what the actual

607
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,319
crosses were that's you know that's the

608
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,520
that's the whole fun of bag seeds right

609
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:07,279
back in the day is

610
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:09,519
you knew pretty much what the female was

611
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:10,798
but had no idea what created the seed in

612
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:12,879
that female

613
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:14,879
of course you know nobody was sending uh

614
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,880
lineage information with

615
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,240
the with the cannabis we were receiving

616
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,280
so

617
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,120
there you know

618
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:25,119
i i have to say you know just going back

619
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:27,359
i'm pretty sure there's the purple haze

620
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:30,000
and then the durbin those would have

621
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:34,079
been the very first ones that were

622
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,720
successfully grown and then after that

623
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:38,480
um you know i wish i wish i back in

624
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,079
those days i'd kept better notes

625
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,759
but i didn't uh we weren't certainly

626
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:45,278
thinking about recording anything on

627
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:48,480
paper back then

628
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:50,159
that would have been way too risky

629
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,000
yeah all too common of an answer don't

630
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,080
worry sure

631
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,240
so you referenced that the four-way was

632
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:57,519
one of the things which kind of inspired

633
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,839
you to start breeding

634
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:02,960
with that being said what was your first

635
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:02,959
ever breeding project

636
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:08,399
so the very first one

637
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,440
and i'm going to kind of skip to the

638
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,120
second or third

639
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,360
because it's the one that really made a

640
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:16,719
difference so

641
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:20,319
there was an nl5 haze

642
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:23,120
that i had at the time and

643
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:24,079
then there was some big bud and there

644
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:27,839
was a big bud

645
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:31,359
male that was used to

646
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:32,399
pollinate the nl5 haze and this would be

647
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:33,839
the first

648
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,320
cross and and you know of course you

649
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:38,158
have to keep in mind bear in mind here

650
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:40,399
these are names that were given to

651
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,480
strains and in those days

652
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,798
i have to be very blunt here it's

653
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,120
anybody's guess what it really was

654
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:48,879
you know uh unless it came out of a seed

655
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:49,759
pack it was very hard to validate

656
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,919
anything

657
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:54,319
i can't tell you how many you know

658
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,400
flowers we saw that were called skunk

659
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:58,079
that certainly weren't skunk or even for

660
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,440
that matter you know northern lights

661
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:00,798
that weren't truly normal lights it was

662
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,320
they were just kind of blanket

663
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:06,720
labels given to whatever looked good so

664
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:08,319
but that that first very successful one

665
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,120
was the nl5 big

666
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:12,079
n5 haze big bud cross and that's

667
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:15,359
actually the one

668
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:17,038
that i'd sent back to uh virginia to a

669
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:18,719
friend of mine who gave me kind of the

670
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:21,839
two thumbs up

671
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,759
you know as good as the four-way um and

672
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:28,558
from that point forward

673
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:29,839
i really didn't want to slow down the

674
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:32,639
process

675
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:33,759
once i got the the gold stamp approval

676
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,360
from my buddy

677
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:39,440
and from there there were um

678
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:42,319
so i started playing around with silver

679
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:46,720
pearl in the late

680
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:47,519
90s and another strain called kc36 which

681
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,640
was uh

682
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:52,480
from casey brains in brazil and i the

683
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,559
silver pearl i had was a cut

684
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,000
of fema that was from uh scentsy seed

685
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:58,720
bank and

686
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
casey brains pack of seeds that i got

687
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,120
provided me in very

688
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,960
interesting mail and so i

689
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:09,119
worked with that one in the late 90s

690
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,079
and developed a strain that i called

691
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:13,439
proof

692
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:15,599
and the proof was a

693
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:19,440
due to the silver pearl content was a

694
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:21,918
strain that finished up in about 47 days

695
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,360
uh it was just to prove and we called it

696
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,679
proof just because to prove that things

697
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:30,079
didn't have to go eight or nine weeks

698
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:31,679
so a little bit yeah just a little bit

699
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:33,519
and the proof was something that i

700
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:36,880
worked with um

701
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:38,240
you know that's the only genetic that

702
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:42,159
i've ever taken to

703
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:44,159
an f3 but it became also a foundation

704
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:47,600
that i have built off here

705
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:50,880
over the years whenever i want to induce

706
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:53,278
a short flowering period i can

707
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,000
generally you know crack one of them and

708
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:58,079
at this point the proof seeds are

709
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,278
somewhat homogeneous uh they're very

710
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:04,720
predictable in what they'll actually uh

711
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:05,278
uh grow out to so if i have a good male

712
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,679
donor

713
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:09,519
then i can you know throw that onto a

714
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,480
proof email and if i want you know if

715
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:12,319
i've got a good proof

716
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,599
uh mail then i can throw that onto

717
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:16,798
something else but

718
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:18,959
uh that one that that that cross was

719
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:20,000
one that made me very happy for a period

720
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,919
of time

721
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,079
and then you know as soon as we get into

722
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:28,000
the early 2000s

723
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:30,960
really right around 0.405

724
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,359
that's when more breeding happened and i

725
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,519
get

726
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:34,879
there most of the breeding that i have

727
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:37,918
done in the past

728
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:40,320
has been intentional s1s

729
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,200
there have been some true breeding

730
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:44,558
projects

731
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:48,159
but those are a little bit more recent

732
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:50,879
and you know sometimes s1s get a bad

733
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,760
rap and some you know from some folks

734
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,320
but i think

735
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:55,278
most of some of the greatest genetics

736
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:58,720
we've seen

737
00:27:55,278 --> 00:28:02,319
on this planet are generally a result of

738
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:04,399
s1 situations yeah that's definitely a

739
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:05,678
topic i'd love to get into in just a

740
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:06,158
moment but i just want to quickly draw

741
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,320
you back

742
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,440
you referenced casey brains it's a

743
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:12,158
really

744
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,759
really kind of obscure breeder the thing

745
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,840
i am most interested in him

746
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:17,679
is is that oh you know the collective

747
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:20,079
whoever it was or whoever they were

748
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,120
essentially they're notable because they

749
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:22,879
never released

750
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:25,199
the information around any of their

751
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,760
strains and yet at the time they were

752
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,759
still

753
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:29,519
regarded as quite really good like you

754
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:31,278
know very good breeders essentially

755
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:32,720
and i just thought it's so interesting

756
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:33,038
it's such a polarization because you

757
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,720
could

758
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:36,720
never be successful in today's market

759
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,240
doing that and yet it just i guess it

760
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,240
goes to show like it wasn't a concern

761
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:45,839
back in the time

762
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,839
right you know lineages were

763
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:50,879
as far as i remember you know lineages

764
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,679
weren't something that we were overly

765
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:56,799
concerned about in the early days

766
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,759
i know that uh you know the kc36 and

767
00:28:56,798 --> 00:28:59,918
i've you know

768
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:01,519
years gone past i've gone and tried to

769
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,559
look up as much as i could on it but

770
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:04,158
i haven't really been able to find much

771
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:04,639
of anything because you know he's at

772
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,559
that

773
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,440
at that air and that era you know he's

774
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:11,278
simply giving the label to the strain

775
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,080
of the you know during the during

776
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:16,720
whatever however old he was that year

777
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:18,480
so the 36 is the strain he created when

778
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,278
he was 36 years old

779
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,120
um but yeah you know the the that was

780
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:25,919
not necessarily something

781
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:27,278
that you know even that i was even aware

782
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,799
of that people were really that

783
00:29:27,278 --> 00:29:32,079
concerned about back in the day

784
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:32,639
uh is you know what what is the lineage

785
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:34,079
here

786
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,320
more you know more important to folks

787
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:38,398
was what kind of flower is this going to

788
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:40,798
produce

789
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:43,278
and so with that being said do you think

790
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:44,798
that a lot of the stuff was quite inbred

791
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:47,369
or do you think it had like a diverse

792
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:49,359
variety within it

793
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:51,199
[Music]

794
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:55,439
you know i think that really has a lot

795
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:57,440
to do with the commitment level of the

796
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,480
breeder back then

797
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:03,840
i mean you know you can

798
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:06,000
take someone as certain

799
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:07,759
like someone like dj short you know he's

800
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,880
he's stabilized

801
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:12,000
his blueberry line was an f4 f5 across

802
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,919
these the one that's

803
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,240
touted now and you know it's a it's a

804
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,159
predictable strain at this point

805
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,679
and you know someone who like that has

806
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,039
worked with the genetics over a year and

807
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,038
year and year to try to kind of

808
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:26,240
homogenize the outcome

809
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:26,640
however then there were also you know a

810
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,159
lot of

811
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,919
f1s that get out there in the world and

812
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,039
you're going to see a ton of diversity

813
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:34,159
from those

814
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:37,440
so i think it kind of goes back to

815
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:40,799
the breeder and how

816
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,840
important it was to that particular

817
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:45,038
breeder to

818
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:47,918
stabilize that genetic um

819
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:48,398
for you know for market from you know to

820
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,720
put in

821
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:56,719
to put into the market i you know i i

822
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,720
don't really think that

823
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,200
you know it it had anything to do with

824
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,120
you know

825
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,960
the company so much as it you know just

826
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:08,158
just just the breeder just you know

827
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:10,240
and and how uh committed they were to

828
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,679
trying to create stability in the strain

829
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,759
i mean the further you get

830
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,000
you know the f1 two three and four and

831
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:17,519
five and the deeper you get into that

832
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,278
certainly the more stable the genetic

833
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,000
comes and of course that generally

834
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:22,798
reduces

835
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,759
the diversity as well so something you

836
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:25,679
referenced earlier

837
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:27,278
uh just a second ago in fact was uh

838
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,679
scentsy those were some of the seeds

839
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:29,038
that were

840
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,440
popular at one point when you were

841
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:33,759
buying you also referenced neville so

842
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,798
golden segway for me this is a bit of a

843
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:36,558
weird question a little bit

844
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:38,158
controversial but at the same time it's

845
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:40,079
so obvious i can't believe that it's

846
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,679
even like a bit of a weird thing

847
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:43,439
you know sensei went to [ __ ] at some

848
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:47,840
point why do you think that happened and

849
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,840
who's responsible

850
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:56,000
you know i really feel like

851
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:57,119
since he kind of took the fun out of

852
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,159
genetics

853
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:04,000
and i think a lot of that had to do with

854
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:06,880
trying to make their seed outcome

855
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,798
more marketable based on what they

856
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,519
thought people liked

857
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:12,960
um you know the the first genetic that

858
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,798
certainly comes to mind here is

859
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,278
something like the skunk you know

860
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:18,879
every we all kind of agree that since

861
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:20,079
he's the one that added sweetness to

862
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,559
skunk one

863
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:24,639
uh that original roadkill skunk wasn't a

864
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:25,839
you know wasn't a sweet tasting strain

865
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,320
at all

866
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:29,839
um it was kind of offensive to and in

867
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:33,839
some respects

868
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:34,558
um but sensei certainly produced a skunk

869
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:37,918
one

870
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:40,720
that had a very sweet note to it and

871
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,360
that to me you know ruined that that let

872
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,919
that

873
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:48,959
strain you know forever so

874
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:51,759
you know that's what i think sensei did

875
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,798
is they took a lot of diversity out of

876
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:54,720
the game

877
00:32:52,798 --> 00:32:56,398
and they did that over the years too

878
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,480
because i feel like they continued to

879
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:00,398
like further try to stabilize

880
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,720
you know the strain so that they could

881
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:04,319
create something that was predictable

882
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,159
but i don't know that you know that

883
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:07,599
which is predictable is all that much

884
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:09,360
fun

885
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:10,719
especially when it comes to something

886
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:14,158
like cannabis and

887
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,919
and you know growing from seed

888
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:18,320
part of the fun of growing from seed is

889
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:22,240
exploring the depths of

890
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:25,038
what that that strain can produce

891
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,919
and if you're you know if what's

892
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:28,240
important to you

893
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,080
is you know a marketable strain or a

894
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,359
marketable seed pack and you want

895
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:32,879
stability and you want something

896
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:36,240
predictable

897
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:38,960
it just kind of it waters it down

898
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:41,278
and i think they did a very good job of

899
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,480
watering down a lot of genetics

900
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:44,558
so i mean while we're on the general

901
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,159
topic if we do look back at all the

902
00:33:44,558 --> 00:33:46,798
companies that have existed throughout

903
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:53,360
time

904
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:56,398
which one do you think was the best

905
00:33:53,359 --> 00:34:00,719
that's a good question

906
00:33:56,398 --> 00:34:01,918
if i had to you know super sativa seed

907
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,798
club

908
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,600
if i'm looking back in in time a little

909
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:07,918
bit

910
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:09,838
i think they brought forth some very

911
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:12,320
very important

912
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:14,559
genetics to the to the world and i

913
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,280
thought i think that they also provided

914
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:17,440
us

915
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,000
with some of the foundations that a lot

916
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:23,599
of really popular strains now are built

917
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,719
off of um and

918
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:29,679
if i look to more recent

919
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:31,678
times you know when i was still going

920
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:35,519
over to amsterdam back in the

921
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:38,720
2000s i really had um

922
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:41,599
i really i really had a a

923
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:44,000
a general love for uh th seeds for adam

924
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:47,200
dunn's group

925
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,239
oh there you go nice and i thought some

926
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,719
of the

927
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:52,799
strains that they were i really loved

928
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:54,719
his mk ultra especially before it was

929
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,879
feminized

930
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:58,480
do you think something changed beyond

931
00:34:56,878 --> 00:35:03,039
the obvious

932
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:05,920
uh yes i do um so

933
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:07,199
i'd grown so i gotten some mk ultraseeds

934
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,240
over in amsterdam

935
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:14,879
before it was feminized and

936
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:18,239
the there's a particular chemo bar that

937
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:21,920
is just straight mothballs

938
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:24,879
and i love that uh it's a it's a complex

939
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,480
deep smelling flower like i said the

940
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,039
mothballs comes to mind

941
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,400
first on the nose it's a phenomenal hash

942
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:32,559
maker

943
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,519
so i fell in love with that particular

944
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:35,679
selection

945
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:37,440
and i had a friend go back over to

946
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:39,358
amsterdam a couple years later

947
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,639
and bring back some of the feminized

948
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:43,598
version

949
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:44,719
and what we saw fairly consistently out

950
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:48,640
of that

951
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:51,838
was a kind of had a

952
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:55,118
light purplish hue to it and had

953
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:57,440
this sweeter note that

954
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,358
kind of overpowered anything that was

955
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:03,119
chemical or fuelly

956
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:05,920
and it just wasn't as exciting

957
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,960
as the version we as the king of r that

958
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,119
we had seen come out of the

959
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,119
pre-feminized days

960
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:13,599
so the genetics have always been listed

961
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:17,039
as b13 and og kush

962
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,720
yes however you know i love you adam but

963
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:20,239
that's never made sense to me

964
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:22,559
how do you make regular seats with two

965
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:26,239
clone onlys

966
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:27,920
well so you know i

967
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:29,439
i don't know if there was a reversal

968
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,960
done

969
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:36,320
which is somewhat possible

970
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:40,079
uh maybe there was access

971
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:42,800
to the uh to the um

972
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:45,280
g13 seed somewhere in that vault i don't

973
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:50,160
know that's that's a very good question

974
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:54,960
and interestingly enough

975
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:59,358
if i think back on it you know i can see

976
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:01,519
both genetics in that flower

977
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:03,440
you know you can definitely see the og

978
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:04,719
cushion there you can taste the og

979
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,800
cushion there there's a little bit of

980
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:10,239
that earthiness for sure

981
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,519
um but it's something i've never really

982
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:13,679
given too much thought to

983
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:15,039
and the only thing i can think of is

984
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:17,199
either there was something going on with

985
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:21,759
the g13 or perhaps something

986
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:23,838
was reversed which

987
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,960
little colloidal silver who knows but

988
00:37:23,838 --> 00:37:27,838
that's just going to create us ones yeah

989
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,838
that's a very good question

990
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,960
i like to hear his answer on that

991
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,519
actually i forgot to ask him

992
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,280
hopefully we'll find out one day someday

993
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:39,199
yes

994
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,480
just take a step back or wind down a

995
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:42,000
little

996
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,800
something which everyone remembers

997
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,679
fondly what was your first experience

998
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,680
with the chem dog

999
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:54,880
well that definitely goes back to the

1000
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:58,239
east coast

1001
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:01,280
and it was definitely

1002
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:04,319
at a fish show it was

1003
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,920
definitely at hampton coliseum

1004
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,079
trying to remember what year i think it

1005
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:11,358
was 97

1006
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:14,800
probably and it was

1007
00:38:11,358 --> 00:38:17,759
a friend of mine who had packed a nice

1008
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,079
glass bowl and passed it to me during

1009
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,839
the

1010
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:26,880
show and wow

1011
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:29,440
that was one explosive hit back then

1012
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,400
there was just nothing like it nothing

1013
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,960
that had

1014
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,760
at that point had even come close to

1015
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,880
that

1016
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:39,599
super chemical fuel taste uh

1017
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,680
it was definitely it was definitely that

1018
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,960
that one changed the game

1019
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:46,480
uh you know it was it was interesting

1020
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:51,440
because

1021
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:54,079
you know i knew of kim back in the day

1022
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,320
but i knew him only as a glassblower it

1023
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:59,039
really the connection to the genetic

1024
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,000
had not been made at that point for me

1025
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:02,000
at all

1026
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,800
it wasn't until years later that i

1027
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:08,000
actually made that connection

1028
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:11,359
um but yeah that flower was

1029
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:14,400
just phenomenal i just i

1030
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:16,799
will never forget the the nose burn

1031
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,400
and the eyes watering and just how it

1032
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,640
hit the frontal

1033
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,720
of the head and you know kicked your

1034
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:26,239
body temp up about two degrees

1035
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:27,598
just about immediately you know

1036
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:29,118
yeah you know it's kind of like it's

1037
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,760
like taking that first you know the

1038
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:31,440
first dab

1039
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,119
you ever take you know it's it's a whole

1040
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,400
new experience

1041
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:37,200
and um you know didn't have really the

1042
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,680
opportunity

1043
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:42,078
to you know find out where it came from

1044
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:44,719
or purchase any or anything like that so

1045
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,519
i had that experience in the in the 90s

1046
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:48,078
and then

1047
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:49,679
it wasn't until i moved out west and

1048
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:53,680
then you know met a few folks

1049
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:56,719
and some folks who were um growing

1050
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:57,759
one version or another that we saw more

1051
00:39:56,719 --> 00:39:59,759
of it but

1052
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,359
that that was that was definitely one

1053
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,720
memorable bull hit i can tell you that

1054
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:07,119
much

1055
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:07,118
and so do you think that was the 91

1056
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:14,240
so 1998 you know i i'm pretty yeah

1057
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,280
at this point of my career i'm pretty

1058
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:19,039
sure it was

1059
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:22,480
i don't think it was the d and of course

1060
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:23,199
the no nobody was really running some of

1061
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,280
the others

1062
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:26,719
at that point it certainly was too way

1063
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,160
too early for the four

1064
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:29,838
which you know we'll of course talk

1065
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:33,598
about that a little bit later but

1066
00:40:29,838 --> 00:40:35,838
um uh you know at that point yes i'm

1067
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:37,440
pretty sure that was the 91.

1068
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:39,358
i was about to say that that temperature

1069
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,639
one got me that's i always get crushed

1070
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:43,358
by that one and the other one

1071
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:45,838
my friends love to say is uh you get

1072
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:47,358
sweaty feet

1073
00:40:45,838 --> 00:40:48,880
that's a good one i might have to use

1074
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:51,440
that yeah

1075
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,079
uncomfortably high right right right oh

1076
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,079
absolutely

1077
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:58,640
don't i know about that sometimes so

1078
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:00,720
hard question which out of all the chem

1079
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:04,400
cuts is your favorite and just know if

1080
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:07,519
you say chem 4 you are dead to me

1081
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,000
well you know okay so can we sidebar for

1082
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:11,759
a second

1083
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:14,639
okay so so sidebar for a second

1084
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:16,160
so there's been this whole thing where

1085
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:18,000
i've had to change up the genetics on

1086
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:19,598
dog walker right

1087
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,679
i don't know if you're aware of this but

1088
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:24,800
you know i did it on instagram whatever

1089
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:26,399
so uh for many years i was under the

1090
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,240
impression that i had the 91 and it

1091
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:33,119
turns out it's the four

1092
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:35,919
now going back to the the 91

1093
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:36,800
yeah now that i have gone back and

1094
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,760
resampled it

1095
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,079
91 is probably my favorite but i but i

1096
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,960
do

1097
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:43,280
don't mind the four she's certainly been

1098
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:47,280
a

1099
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:52,240
good foundation for me uh to breed with

1100
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:54,960
um so 91 is going to be my favorite

1101
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:56,719
so you're saying you're half dead to me

1102
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,599
i'm only half dead that's right only

1103
00:41:56,719 --> 00:42:00,879
half dead

1104
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:02,400
and and i wish i wish i could say i i

1105
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,000
you know think it's deplorable but i

1106
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,079
don't it's

1107
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,440
it's been good to me and i i certainly

1108
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:10,000
can't complain and

1109
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,838
you know somewhere hiding in that genome

1110
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,519
is is a whole lot of gas

1111
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:15,199
because it certainly has shown off in

1112
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:18,000
some of my offspring

1113
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:20,799
oh yeah i get this weird betadine taste

1114
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:24,159
from it like iodine it's weird you know

1115
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:26,480
interesting yeah i like that

1116
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:27,679
so i guess just to kind of summarize for

1117
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,199
people who maybe

1118
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:30,639
missed what we were talking about there

1119
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:31,358
i guess the reason why that's important

1120
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:33,279
is because

1121
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:34,400
you've gone on to create a few very

1122
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,800
well-known strains

1123
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,318
using your cut which you thought was 91

1124
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,160
turns out to be the number four

1125
00:42:38,318 --> 00:42:41,838
so i think that's the reason why maybe

1126
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:43,679
it's a little more relevant that that

1127
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:45,838
post was made but just to essentially

1128
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:47,118
explain it for everyone um one eye put

1129
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:47,679
up a post saying hey everyone just so

1130
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:49,838
you know

1131
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:52,159
like we thought that the dog walker was

1132
00:42:49,838 --> 00:42:54,000
91 across albert walker it's actually

1133
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:55,679
the chem 4 cross albert walker there you

1134
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,760
go everyone's on the same page now

1135
00:42:55,679 --> 00:43:01,519
um so i guess the first thing is

1136
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,359
that that obviously suggests that the

1137
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:05,920
chem was the pollen donor in the albert

1138
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:06,799
in sorry the dog walker correct not

1139
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:10,838
correct

1140
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:14,160
so okay so this is a game

1141
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:17,519
of selfing

1142
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:20,078
genetics and it's really starts off

1143
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:20,639
with the uh what i call the a wong it's

1144
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:24,560
actually an

1145
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:27,598
albert walker og cross so going back

1146
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:29,920
to we got the um og here in portland the

1147
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:33,519
og question oh four

1148
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:37,519
and in o5 i had a plant

1149
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:39,199
that self and all that was a single

1150
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:42,480
pollen spike

1151
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:43,439
so i plucked that spike and

1152
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,519
a lot of people have a hard time

1153
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,240
believing this but this is god's honest

1154
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:48,318
truth

1155
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:49,759
plucked a little spike put a little ten

1156
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:53,440
put it in my fridge

1157
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:56,640
and later that summer or follow

1158
00:43:53,440 --> 00:44:00,000
in summertime had

1159
00:43:56,639 --> 00:44:01,679
the albert walker plant and decided to

1160
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,760
take that little bit of pollen on a

1161
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:06,239
little tiny paintbrush and just dust a

1162
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:09,359
branch of the albert walker plant

1163
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:12,719
and that little process

1164
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:17,279
yielded a measly six seeds

1165
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:18,078
and i got four of those to crack i

1166
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,480
actually lost

1167
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:22,240
two of the seeds somehow but four of

1168
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,358
those were cracked i went with the most

1169
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:25,759
vigorous one

1170
00:44:23,358 --> 00:44:26,799
that showed a pre you know pre-flowered

1171
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:30,560
female

1172
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:34,800
and that one ended up selfing

1173
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:36,318
itself in somewhere around week three so

1174
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,280
i kind of went through this process from

1175
00:44:36,318 --> 00:44:39,039
like pulling

1176
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,560
pollen spikes and trying to keep up with

1177
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:42,000
it but of course

1178
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:43,759
certain things got pollen you know that

1179
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,639
that plant got pollinated

1180
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,560
and that produced about 200 seeds uh

1181
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:53,118
which we called the awog

1182
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:56,239
albert walker og the awog

1183
00:44:53,119 --> 00:45:00,480
i decided again to revive it

1184
00:44:56,239 --> 00:45:04,000
some years later right around 2009

1185
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:07,519
and had at that point had just

1186
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:10,639
acquired the what we now know was chem-4

1187
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:11,199
plant and the awog that i was growing

1188
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:13,519
two aw

1189
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:15,759
do different aog plants one of them was

1190
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:16,480
just a beast and super stable the other

1191
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:20,000
one turned out

1192
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:24,079
not to be so stable

1193
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:26,960
so she then spit onto the

1194
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:28,640
to the chem 4 and then i actually

1195
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,559
collected some of her

1196
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:32,000
stamen and kept that in a little

1197
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:34,400
container that i later used

1198
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,599
to create a another string called the

1199
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:39,039
walk

1200
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:41,599
crossing it with forum cut so you know

1201
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:44,239
what we do have here admittingly is a

1202
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:46,400
lot of instability but very intentional

1203
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:50,639
uses of those

1204
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:51,200
unstable plants and when it came time to

1205
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:53,199
crack

1206
00:45:51,199 --> 00:45:54,960
the dog walker seeds the original the

1207
00:45:53,199 --> 00:45:58,399
original cracking

1208
00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:01,519
um it was just you know we i had a

1209
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:04,880
few hundred of the seeds and we

1210
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:08,480
cracked uh about 10 of them

1211
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:09,920
and you know knowing that they

1212
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,318
you know no males were going to get

1213
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:15,440
produced out of this project

1214
00:46:12,318 --> 00:46:18,079
i decided to look at i think there were

1215
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,639
four particular ones that were growing

1216
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:21,440
really

1217
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:21,920
nicely we liked the stem rub you know

1218
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:25,119
the

1219
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:26,400
the odor that came off of that and one

1220
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:29,680
of those

1221
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:32,559
kind of out was was a bit muskier

1222
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:34,078
if you will than the others and that one

1223
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:37,440
was just selected and we

1224
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:38,640
and i ran with that one and you know it

1225
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:41,838
so

1226
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:42,318
what you have is the albert walker og

1227
00:46:41,838 --> 00:46:45,440
actually

1228
00:46:42,318 --> 00:46:48,318
selfing onto the chem 4 plant

1229
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:50,318
and that's how we got the original and

1230
00:46:48,318 --> 00:46:53,039
current dog walker seeds

1231
00:46:50,318 --> 00:46:54,960
and so i guess what might be surprising

1232
00:46:53,039 --> 00:46:57,679
out of that whole story is that

1233
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:00,720
the dog walker ag is not regarded as an

1234
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:00,719
unstable plant

1235
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:04,719
would you agree with that or do you

1236
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:07,919
think it does throw pollen well

1237
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:10,480
so here so one of the things we saw very

1238
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,880
early on and this is only in the first

1239
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,079
probably year year and a half of its

1240
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:17,358
existence

1241
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:19,839
was that it did not it was very

1242
00:47:17,358 --> 00:47:22,159
hypersensitive to oversaturation with

1243
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:22,159
light

1244
00:47:22,838 --> 00:47:28,719
and so in the very early days

1245
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:30,078
there were a couple of us who

1246
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:31,279
experienced and you got to remember in

1247
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:33,359
the early days there's only eight

1248
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,760
gardens that are running this strain

1249
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:37,598
um but a couple of us were seeing this

1250
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,520
phenomenon where it would

1251
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:40,800
try to self kind of towards the end of

1252
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:44,079
the round

1253
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:47,200
and so believe it or not

1254
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:49,519
i think it was my

1255
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:50,318
friend of mine out at heroes of the farm

1256
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:52,639
who

1257
00:47:50,318 --> 00:47:54,159
decided to pull his lights back another

1258
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:56,078
you know 12 inches or something like

1259
00:47:54,159 --> 00:47:57,358
that went from like 24 inches to 36

1260
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:59,119
inches this is under single ended

1261
00:47:57,358 --> 00:48:01,598
thousand watt lights

1262
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:02,160
and then all of a sudden that issue went

1263
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:04,160
away

1264
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:06,239
so we kind of went word went around the

1265
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:09,358
small group of hey

1266
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:10,558
uh you know she she gets oversaturated

1267
00:48:09,358 --> 00:48:12,400
pretty easily

1268
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:13,760
back your lights off it'll prevent any

1269
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:17,440
of these issues

1270
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:19,599
and since that era i have yet to see a

1271
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:23,119
single

1272
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:26,640
unstable response from that plant period

1273
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:29,599
uh and certainly don't hear lots of

1274
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:30,799
murmurs about that being about it being

1275
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:33,599
unstable

1276
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,000
um you know whenever they're you know

1277
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:37,359
whenever

1278
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,880
someone calls or contacts or you know

1279
00:48:37,358 --> 00:48:39,119
comes in the store to ask me about you

1280
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,318
know

1281
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:43,440
growing it the first recommendation i

1282
00:48:42,318 --> 00:48:45,358
make is

1283
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,880
put her on the perimeter if you can't

1284
00:48:45,358 --> 00:48:48,880
raise your lights

1285
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,000
she does a lot better on the perimeter

1286
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:53,280
around and not

1287
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
and splash over crossover zones than she

1288
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,599
does

1289
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,519
you know directly under her in the

1290
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,800
crossover she's a perimeter plant for

1291
00:48:57,519 --> 00:49:03,440
sure

1292
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:06,079
or get those lights a pie

1293
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:07,920
so in general the dog walker og it's

1294
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:09,599
it's really kind of gained itself a cult

1295
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,599
status along with the scooby snacks

1296
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:13,200
which we'll get into shortly

1297
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:14,800
how do you think that happened you know

1298
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:16,078
like what do you kind of attribute it to

1299
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,440
just just the quality or do you think

1300
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,039
there was you know like the right people

1301
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,720
were growing it at the right time type

1302
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:23,838
of thing

1303
00:49:20,719 --> 00:49:28,558
full disclosure yeah go for it

1304
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:31,679
okay um so it was all intentional

1305
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:34,559
um oh yeah so

1306
00:49:31,679 --> 00:49:35,440
this was during a time here in oregon

1307
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:37,839
where

1308
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,559
some of the the best cultivators that i

1309
00:49:37,838 --> 00:49:41,920
knew

1310
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:43,599
uh were starting to have to take

1311
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,280
less and less and less you know chipping

1312
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:46,400
away at the bottom line of what they

1313
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:49,440
were getting

1314
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:50,800
for their product and it was also right

1315
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:54,159
at the beginning

1316
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,559
of the cookie craze so 09 and i'd been

1317
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:56,480
down

1318
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:58,240
in northern california at a friend's

1319
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:00,480
farm i

1320
00:49:58,239 --> 00:50:02,078
gotten he showed me the cookie and he

1321
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,679
was complaining like oh people pay you

1322
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:05,519
know a thousand two thousand dollars a

1323
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:08,239
cut for this stuff and you get you know

1324
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:11,358
top end at all the dispensaries

1325
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:13,199
and when i you know when i sampled the

1326
00:50:11,358 --> 00:50:15,119
plant it was it was amazing flour

1327
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:17,759
super tasty but i was like what what

1328
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:20,318
gives you know what is the driving force

1329
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,839
behind the craze and he said well just

1330
00:50:20,318 --> 00:50:24,239
you know it's really hard to get a cut

1331
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:27,279
of it and they really limit the release

1332
00:50:24,239 --> 00:50:30,399
and so i came back here to oregon

1333
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:31,440
and thought about that a bit and i said

1334
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,639
you know

1335
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:36,800
if if there's some way somehow to come

1336
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:40,078
up with something here

1337
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:42,960
that you know i could create

1338
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:44,720
give to a limited number of people we

1339
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:48,079
control the release of it

1340
00:50:44,719 --> 00:50:48,719
we don't give it out uh and if it's good

1341
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:50,960
enough

1342
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:52,159
perhaps we can kind of start this same

1343
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,000
kind of craze

1344
00:50:52,159 --> 00:50:55,920
here in oregon just with an organ

1345
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:59,519
produced genetic

1346
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:02,079
and at that time

1347
00:50:59,519 --> 00:51:03,039
had the chem iv there was the selfing of

1348
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:05,359
the alog

1349
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:07,119
i think this is a good thing i think

1350
00:51:05,358 --> 00:51:10,318
this could be the cross

1351
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:13,039
and it was really a stroke of luck

1352
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:14,639
that the you know the king of r that we

1353
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:16,480
selected was the one that is out and

1354
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:18,480
available today

1355
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,838
as soon as we finished that plant that

1356
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,960
first you know

1357
00:51:19,838 --> 00:51:25,199
bong hit of it was this is it you know

1358
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:28,639
we know we have something here

1359
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:31,519
so i did a limited release to

1360
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:33,519
eight other growers that i knew in the

1361
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:36,079
area that were all friends

1362
00:51:33,519 --> 00:51:36,960
and you know we kind of had a pow wow

1363
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:40,400
this is

1364
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:42,960
the plant here is what it's worth

1365
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,599
don't take anything less than that don't

1366
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,880
give out

1367
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:47,280
cuts this was also very during the very

1368
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:51,039
first

1369
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:53,200
early days of our quasi-dispensary

1370
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:54,558
system here in portland or medical

1371
00:51:53,199 --> 00:51:56,558
you know dispensaries so there were only

1372
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:58,720
a couple at that point just two or three

1373
00:51:56,559 --> 00:52:00,480
that were definitely operating uh very

1374
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:03,039
much in the gray

1375
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:04,559
but you know if these places wanted this

1376
00:52:03,039 --> 00:52:05,519
this is what it cost even though

1377
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:07,599
there was everything else was

1378
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:09,199
significantly cheaper and we kind of

1379
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:12,000
stuck to our guns and that

1380
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:13,358
that project worked great for about 18

1381
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,480
months

1382
00:52:13,358 --> 00:52:19,759
and then you know cuts were stolen

1383
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:22,960
and partnerships fractured and people

1384
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:26,880
got you know butt hurt and

1385
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:30,318
but to this day you know it still

1386
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:32,640
is a crowd pleaser um you know for me

1387
00:52:30,318 --> 00:52:35,279
personally it's still a strain that i

1388
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:38,960
never get bored or tired of

1389
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:42,319
um and it's uh you know it's it's

1390
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:44,880
kind of legend and lore was born

1391
00:52:42,318 --> 00:52:46,159
out of trying me my attempt to give

1392
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,920
something back to my

1393
00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:50,000
friends to give them an opportunity to

1394
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:52,000
do a little better

1395
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,679
so it came from a good place but it was

1396
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,920
certainly an exercise in market

1397
00:52:53,679 --> 00:52:58,000
manipulation

1398
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:00,079
do you feel like that is a negative

1399
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,920
thing in the cannabis industry given

1400
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:02,720
it's so rampant in other industries

1401
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,119
there's

1402
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:07,199
a growing movement in australia that you

1403
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:08,559
know people want everything to be as

1404
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:10,078
cheap as possible or

1405
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:11,599
that type of thing because they're like

1406
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:12,800
oh it's medicine and it's like no one

1407
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:15,359
can see that like

1408
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:17,039
there's obviously a literal business

1409
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:18,318
side of things as well and like

1410
00:53:17,039 --> 00:53:19,679
you know what i mean it's it's an

1411
00:53:18,318 --> 00:53:20,480
interesting thing because it's like

1412
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:22,318
people almost

1413
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,000
think that it all the regular rules

1414
00:53:22,318 --> 00:53:25,440
don't apply to cannabis because it's

1415
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,119
for some people you know it's more than

1416
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,720
just a recreational thing

1417
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:30,640
well yeah there's a lot of altruistic

1418
00:53:28,719 --> 00:53:34,159
dreamers in the cannabis industry

1419
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:37,039
but at the end of the day this is

1420
00:53:34,159 --> 00:53:38,239
now and has been for many years people's

1421
00:53:37,039 --> 00:53:41,279
livelihoods

1422
00:53:38,239 --> 00:53:42,159
uh they're you know we've certainly

1423
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:46,000
watched here

1424
00:53:42,159 --> 00:53:49,118
in our state prices go from

1425
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,960
you know 3 000 and this is going

1426
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:52,559
like in the medical market of course you

1427
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,720
know and now the wreck market and

1428
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:56,640
medical market you know but people

1429
00:53:54,719 --> 00:53:58,159
years just a few years ago getting

1430
00:53:56,639 --> 00:54:00,239
upwards of three thousand thirty two

1431
00:53:58,159 --> 00:54:01,920
hundred dollars a pound and now they're

1432
00:54:00,239 --> 00:54:03,759
having to settle for

1433
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,440
you know twelve hundred fourteen hundred

1434
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:08,559
for the same quality

1435
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:10,880
uh and it's not that it costs any

1436
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:13,359
less to cultivate it you certainly have

1437
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:15,039
to figure out how to survive in a lower

1438
00:54:13,358 --> 00:54:18,239
margin market

1439
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:21,599
but uh yeah you know i i think

1440
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:24,719
it has great value and i think it should

1441
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:26,960
you know the

1442
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:28,078
boutique side of this industry and i'm

1443
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:29,920
speaking more for

1444
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:31,680
you know our state at this point the

1445
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,519
boutique side of the industry

1446
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:35,598
and the mass cultivation side of the

1447
00:54:33,519 --> 00:54:39,280
industry will separate

1448
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:41,680
and there will be added value and value

1449
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:42,880
given higher value given to boutique

1450
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:44,399
produce cannabis

1451
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,599
right now that is there's there's no

1452
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,280
dichotomy there there's just no

1453
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:48,720
separation there or at least there's

1454
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:53,839
very little

1455
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:53,838
um so i think that

1456
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:00,719
it's important to have

1457
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:04,318
to place greater value

1458
00:55:00,719 --> 00:55:04,719
on cannabis that is produced with great

1459
00:55:04,318 --> 00:55:08,239
thought

1460
00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:11,439
great passion uh intense work

1461
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:12,639
uh you know not total automated systems

1462
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:15,838
and so forth and so on so

1463
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:17,920
i i i kind of i don't think

1464
00:55:15,838 --> 00:55:19,440
you know it should be the cheapest thing

1465
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:22,720
in the world because

1466
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:25,920
once again for a small producer

1467
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:27,919
that's that's a death sentence and

1468
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:30,000
i think it should be you know i think it

1469
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:33,519
should be a free market to where there's

1470
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:36,559
opportunity for all yeah exactly

1471
00:55:33,519 --> 00:55:38,159
and the thing that i like is not taking

1472
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:39,920
any personal stabs but i find a lot of

1473
00:55:38,159 --> 00:55:41,039
the people making these broad types of

1474
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,960
claims are

1475
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:45,519
generally people who still buy into that

1476
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:47,358
whole [ __ ] of like you know like

1477
00:55:45,519 --> 00:55:48,880
gucci brands and they want a mercedes

1478
00:55:47,358 --> 00:55:50,480
car it's like guys you want you want

1479
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:51,280
premium everything else just not premium

1480
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,280
cannabis

1481
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:55,680
okay right right right right you'll pay

1482
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:57,519
you'll buy up you know 4 500

1483
00:55:55,679 --> 00:55:59,199
handbag for your lady but you don't want

1484
00:55:57,519 --> 00:55:59,838
to pay more than five dollars a gram for

1485
00:55:59,199 --> 00:56:02,480
cannabis

1486
00:55:59,838 --> 00:56:03,039
yeah i i don't get that you know when i

1487
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,119
when i

1488
00:56:03,039 --> 00:56:06,318
first so one of my first dispensary

1489
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:09,519
experiences

1490
00:56:06,318 --> 00:56:11,759
in uh portland was at a place here that

1491
00:56:09,519 --> 00:56:12,400
had kind of a farmer's market style

1492
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,799
approach

1493
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:17,358
you pay a booth fee each day and you

1494
00:56:14,798 --> 00:56:21,199
could sit there and you know

1495
00:56:17,358 --> 00:56:22,639
pass out your wares and it used to amaze

1496
00:56:21,199 --> 00:56:24,879
me

1497
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:26,960
how many people came in you know under

1498
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:29,039
the medical program

1499
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:30,798
and they'd want to sit there and you

1500
00:56:29,039 --> 00:56:33,279
know go to the smoking room and

1501
00:56:30,798 --> 00:56:34,719
roll a blunt up but then every so often

1502
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,079
you know somebody would actually come in

1503
00:56:34,719 --> 00:56:37,919
in a wheelchair

1504
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:39,599
or someone would actually come in who's

1505
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:41,440
going through chemo

1506
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:43,599
and needs help getting through the door

1507
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:46,720
and it was just such a

1508
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:48,640
stark contrast between

1509
00:56:46,719 --> 00:56:50,078
you know the people who really needed

1510
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:52,078
the medicine and then the people who

1511
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:52,400
just kind of wanted the medicine and and

1512
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:55,519
i

1513
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:57,599
you know look i make no i make no ill

1514
00:56:55,519 --> 00:57:00,159
claim to anyone who just wants to smoke

1515
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:01,440
cannabis i mean that's primarily my my

1516
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:04,879
take on it

1517
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:06,079
uh but for the you know for those

1518
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,559
those folks that really need the

1519
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:08,880
medicine there should be programs for

1520
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:11,839
those

1521
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:13,680
individuals uh it's just there's you

1522
00:57:11,838 --> 00:57:14,719
know the way the state hands out the

1523
00:57:13,679 --> 00:57:18,318
medical cards

1524
00:57:14,719 --> 00:57:21,919
uh you know it's kind of hard to tell

1525
00:57:18,318 --> 00:57:23,838
if they need it or if they just want it

1526
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:25,519
speak speaking on like the medical model

1527
00:57:23,838 --> 00:57:28,078
in oregon in general

1528
00:57:25,519 --> 00:57:29,519
i've heard whispers from people that the

1529
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:31,920
general trend in oregon

1530
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:33,519
is that there's a few companies opening

1531
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:36,000
up really big facilities

1532
00:57:33,519 --> 00:57:38,000
and their production is so high that's

1533
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,239
one of the major contributing forces to

1534
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,559
that downward trend on pricing

1535
00:57:40,239 --> 00:57:44,558
do you feel that is actually an accurate

1536
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:47,280
analysis of the situation

1537
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:48,400
absolutely yeah absolutely there's a

1538
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:51,200
statistic that came

1539
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:54,798
out uh mid-december of last year where

1540
00:57:51,199 --> 00:57:57,838
we had about 1.2 or 1.1 million

1541
00:57:54,798 --> 00:58:00,318
pounds in our metric system wow now

1542
00:57:57,838 --> 00:58:01,358
the year before the entire state for an

1543
00:58:00,318 --> 00:58:05,519
entire

1544
00:58:01,358 --> 00:58:08,400
excuse me entire year consumed about 430

1545
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:10,639
or 460 000 pounds doubled

1546
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,599
yeah oh yeah oh absolutely i mean almost

1547
00:58:10,639 --> 00:58:14,879
tripled

1548
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:18,160
and so there is

1549
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:19,280
there is an absolute glut in our

1550
00:58:18,159 --> 00:58:21,519
industry here

1551
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:23,599
and you know once that products entered

1552
00:58:21,519 --> 00:58:25,920
into metric you don't have that old

1553
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:28,160
backdoor opportunity anymore

1554
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:30,798
it's locked up in the system so there

1555
00:58:28,159 --> 00:58:34,159
are you know i think

1556
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:36,719
we're gonna see a lot of folks

1557
00:58:34,159 --> 00:58:38,239
having hard times weathering this storm

1558
00:58:36,719 --> 00:58:40,719
in our state

1559
00:58:38,239 --> 00:58:42,318
uh you know recreational growers uh it's

1560
00:58:40,719 --> 00:58:44,558
gonna be it's and i think you know i

1561
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:46,880
think who really survives here

1562
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:49,119
uh or has the best opportunity to

1563
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:50,000
survive are these smaller producers you

1564
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:52,480
know their

1565
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,519
their necks aren't extended out quite as

1566
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:55,760
far

1567
00:58:53,519 --> 00:58:57,759
as some of you know financially as some

1568
00:58:55,760 --> 00:59:00,640
of these you know large

1569
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:01,839
well-funded operations but if you're not

1570
00:59:00,639 --> 00:59:03,920
turning a profit

1571
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:05,358
and it's you're still dumping more money

1572
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:08,000
into something it's

1573
00:59:05,358 --> 00:59:09,519
it's that's a hard hole to get out of

1574
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,639
with prices plummeting

1575
00:59:09,519 --> 00:59:12,880
you know i don't think we've seen the

1576
00:59:10,639 --> 00:59:15,519
bottom here yet oh wow

1577
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:16,160
where do you think they'll bottom out at

1578
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:21,039
i don't know

1579
00:59:16,159 --> 00:59:23,519
500 maybe wow yeah

1580
00:59:21,039 --> 00:59:25,199
so something i was interested in a

1581
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:26,880
little kind of peripheral but it's kind

1582
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:28,558
of the same band

1583
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,920
when i was in oregon i thought it was a

1584
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:31,280
really interesting place it was almost

1585
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:33,119
like the twilight zone in a lot of

1586
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:35,119
regards because it's extremely similar

1587
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:36,960
to australia in regards to like people's

1588
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:38,480
general attitudes the mood you know it's

1589
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:39,280
pretty really laid back pretty welcoming

1590
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,880
that type of thing

1591
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:42,640
that was really cool the biggest thing

1592
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:44,480
that stood out in my mind though was

1593
00:59:42,639 --> 00:59:46,480
i thought people were far more

1594
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:47,920
environmentally and kind of ethically

1595
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,280
aware of their actions and their

1596
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,079
decisions and you know everyone wants to

1597
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:52,000
be as

1598
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:54,240
organic as possible things like that far

1599
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,838
more in oregon than in australia

1600
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:57,679
the dichotomy which slapped me in the

1601
00:59:55,838 --> 00:59:59,679
face though was doesn't seem to be that

1602
00:59:57,679 --> 01:00:01,598
same focus in regards to cannabis in

1603
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:02,879
regards to organically grown versus

1604
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:04,720
synthetically grown

1605
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:06,720
how do you think that exists like a lot

1606
01:00:04,719 --> 01:00:09,919
of the cannabis i tried in oregon myself

1607
01:00:06,719 --> 01:00:11,598
was all organic as far as i could tell

1608
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:14,318
so yeah that's that's a great that's

1609
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:15,920
actually a great point

1610
01:00:14,318 --> 01:00:17,599
and being in the retail inside of the

1611
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,559
industry i can actually speak speaking

1612
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:21,359
volumes of this

1613
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:22,319
so it really depends where you are in

1614
01:00:21,358 --> 01:00:26,239
oregon

1615
01:00:22,318 --> 01:00:28,000
and it can even be as simple as

1616
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:30,479
what part of a county you're in whether

1617
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:33,358
you're seeing salt synthetic growers

1618
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:35,920
organic bottle growers organic no-till

1619
01:00:33,358 --> 01:00:37,679
you go down to a place like eugene

1620
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:39,440
which is uh you know just a little bit

1621
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:42,318
south here of portland

1622
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:45,200
a college town full of loads of hippie

1623
01:00:42,318 --> 01:00:47,199
and counter culture folks

1624
01:00:45,199 --> 01:00:48,480
and you're going to see tons of

1625
01:00:47,199 --> 01:00:50,879
organically

1626
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:53,440
produced cannabis you get back up here

1627
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:54,318
to portland and the city kind of divides

1628
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,480
between

1629
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:57,519
you know portland and then the west side

1630
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:59,358
which is uh

1631
01:00:57,519 --> 01:01:01,358
beaverton and hillsborough you see a lot

1632
01:00:59,358 --> 01:01:04,318
more salt growers out in that zone

1633
01:01:01,358 --> 01:01:05,039
but then as you go closer you go further

1634
01:01:04,318 --> 01:01:07,119
east

1635
01:01:05,039 --> 01:01:08,480
towards mount hood from portland you

1636
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:10,880
start to get into

1637
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:12,719
rural you know farm country and there's

1638
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:16,240
certainly a lot of

1639
01:01:12,719 --> 01:01:18,078
a lot of organic producers there now

1640
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:19,838
you know the other thing to keep in mind

1641
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:23,119
here is a lot of these

1642
01:01:19,838 --> 01:01:25,440
cultivators 10 years ago

1643
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:26,400
not even 10 years ago six years and five

1644
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:29,519
years ago

1645
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:32,880
were still running small opera smaller

1646
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:36,159
operations and not necessarily

1647
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:38,400
uh producing for

1648
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:39,519
you know there were clandestine

1649
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,119
operations they're not necessarily

1650
01:01:39,519 --> 01:01:43,440
producing for the medical market

1651
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:44,880
so you know it was about it's all about

1652
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,760
production and you're starting to see

1653
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,760
that kind of turn

1654
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:49,200
now there's a lot of commercial groups

1655
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:50,880
that are just about production

1656
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:53,519
but we actually see you know the store

1657
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:57,039
that i work for we're very

1658
01:01:53,519 --> 01:01:58,159
as far as what we focus on and what we

1659
01:01:57,039 --> 01:02:01,119
kind of preach

1660
01:01:58,159 --> 01:02:03,598
we certainly preach and focus more on

1661
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:07,280
organic and sustainable approaches

1662
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:09,599
to cultivation doesn't mean that we

1663
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:12,319
won't sell canada or advanced or

1664
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:14,880
botanical and we certainly do

1665
01:02:12,318 --> 01:02:15,920
but we we try to push for the organic

1666
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:18,000
thing through our store

1667
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:19,680
there are other stores that rarely push

1668
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,798
organics and you'll find

1669
01:02:19,679 --> 01:02:23,279
you know a lot more synthetic products

1670
01:02:22,798 --> 01:02:25,838
on their

1671
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:26,960
on their shelves and so you know as you

1672
01:02:25,838 --> 01:02:29,199
skip around

1673
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:30,318
from store to store in the city you can

1674
01:02:29,199 --> 01:02:32,639
see

1675
01:02:30,318 --> 01:02:33,679
really what that main customer base is

1676
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:37,199
based on

1677
01:02:33,679 --> 01:02:38,480
the nutrients that are more than readily

1678
01:02:37,199 --> 01:02:40,798
available

1679
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:41,838
totally i can agree with that last point

1680
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:44,000
you know 100

1681
01:02:41,838 --> 01:02:45,519
because we're kind of experiencing that

1682
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,280
ourselves and that previously there's

1683
01:02:45,519 --> 01:02:49,599
only been synthetic options and over the

1684
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:51,280
past few years we've seen the rise in

1685
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:53,599
organic options becoming more available

1686
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:56,798
and it really is a direct reflection of

1687
01:02:53,599 --> 01:03:00,318
the market demand as far as i can see

1688
01:02:56,798 --> 01:03:03,759
yeah and it's true and believe it or not

1689
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:05,440
we end up having to educate a lot of

1690
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:06,960
you know growers both you know small

1691
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:10,000
home growers and

1692
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:13,119
uh commercial growers and how to turn

1693
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:15,679
that operation into an organic operation

1694
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:17,519
and you know so many a lot of your

1695
01:03:15,679 --> 01:03:19,118
synthetic growers

1696
01:03:17,519 --> 01:03:21,280
have kind of had it drilled into their

1697
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:23,039
head that this is the way to yield

1698
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:25,440
this is how you yield this is you know

1699
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:26,960
the organics doesn't yield enough

1700
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,559
and that you know that couldn't be any

1701
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:31,199
further from the truth uh

1702
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:32,559
there there are certainly you know

1703
01:03:31,199 --> 01:03:36,000
organic approaches

1704
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:38,960
that not only you know deliver

1705
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,679
incredibly flavorful cannabis but also

1706
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:41,199
can produce

1707
01:03:39,679 --> 01:03:42,879
phenomenal yields and you know the

1708
01:03:41,199 --> 01:03:45,199
yields are so much more

1709
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:45,920
you know strain contingent than anything

1710
01:03:45,199 --> 01:03:47,919
else

1711
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:49,760
if you ask me and and so i think this

1712
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:52,400
you know i think there's this kind of

1713
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:54,079
uh block blockade in the salt grower's

1714
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:56,160
mind that i i can't go organic because

1715
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:58,559
i'm going to lose out on my yield but

1716
01:03:56,159 --> 01:04:01,519
you know and and even cost wise you can

1717
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:04,319
get very competitive cost wise

1718
01:04:01,519 --> 01:04:04,798
with organics i understand what you mean

1719
01:04:04,318 --> 01:04:06,719
i think

1720
01:04:04,798 --> 01:04:08,000
the other thing i've noticed maybe this

1721
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:10,078
is just you know a little bit of

1722
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,838
personal bias because i'm organic but

1723
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:13,359
i think that the learning curve with

1724
01:04:11,838 --> 01:04:14,960
organics is a little steeper

1725
01:04:13,358 --> 01:04:17,119
and that's how we got to that point

1726
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:18,639
where people say the yield isn't as good

1727
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:20,000
and it's like now if you get up there

1728
01:04:18,639 --> 01:04:20,798
high enough on the curve you'll get the

1729
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,199
same yield

1730
01:04:20,798 --> 01:04:24,079
absolutely i i couldn't agree with that

1731
01:04:23,199 --> 01:04:27,919
uh anymore

1732
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:29,440
the that's there's there is if

1733
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:30,960
you're right about one thing the curve

1734
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,760
is a little steeper and it's a little

1735
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:34,880
longer

1736
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:35,359
on fine-tuning organics but really you

1737
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:37,440
know

1738
01:04:35,358 --> 01:04:38,880
one of the best pieces of iso united

1739
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:41,760
that i give out at the shop

1740
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:42,160
is to you know pick a pick a program you

1741
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:44,160
know

1742
01:04:42,159 --> 01:04:45,199
organic programming so whatever you know

1743
01:04:44,159 --> 01:04:49,118
and really

1744
01:04:45,199 --> 01:04:51,759
figure out how to how that program

1745
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:53,599
can bring your strains to their full

1746
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:55,440
genetic expression so don't switch

1747
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:57,760
programs don't switch up genetics

1748
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:59,358
work with those genetics with that

1749
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:02,480
nutrient program where that

1750
01:04:59,358 --> 01:05:02,960
you know or you know no-till approach or

1751
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:04,798
whatever

1752
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:06,639
but learn you know see what inputs are

1753
01:05:04,798 --> 01:05:08,480
really influencing

1754
01:05:06,639 --> 01:05:10,318
that your group of genetics or your

1755
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:12,480
strain or whatever so that you can get

1756
01:05:10,318 --> 01:05:15,759
that best expression possible

1757
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:17,679
uh and i i truly believe that

1758
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,799
it's certainly achievable through

1759
01:05:17,679 --> 01:05:20,719
organics

1760
01:05:18,798 --> 01:05:22,400
now it's achievable in synthetics too

1761
01:05:20,719 --> 01:05:24,959
for to some degree

1762
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:26,400
um but you know the people that are

1763
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:28,318
pushing tons of foss

1764
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:30,318
salts into their product and bloom

1765
01:05:28,318 --> 01:05:33,599
boosting with their you know

1766
01:05:30,318 --> 01:05:35,279
you know 35 40 you know zero 35

1767
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:36,318
40 project product at the end you know

1768
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:38,000
they're going to end up with a bunch of

1769
01:05:36,318 --> 01:05:39,679
road flare product

1770
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,000
for sure and it's not going to be very

1771
01:05:39,679 --> 01:05:43,519
flavorful but it's going to heal

1772
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,880
not not to hate on our soul growers

1773
01:05:43,519 --> 01:05:46,719
we've got a few out there and some of

1774
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:49,119
them do a really good job still

1775
01:05:46,719 --> 01:05:50,798
so on a lighter note i constantly hear

1776
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:52,400
this analogy i want to know if you agree

1777
01:05:50,798 --> 01:05:55,199
it's a bit of tongue-in-cheek but

1778
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:56,720
people say to me colorado weeds too dry

1779
01:05:55,199 --> 01:06:00,399
oregon weeds too wet

1780
01:05:56,719 --> 01:06:01,118
do you agree well colorado's too dry and

1781
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:04,240
we're too wet

1782
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:05,920
uh sure you know i mean you know that's

1783
01:06:04,239 --> 01:06:07,838
i always make the comment that whenever

1784
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:10,480
i because i do go to denver

1785
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:12,400
you know generally once or twice a year

1786
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:15,519
and as soon as i walk off the airplane i

1787
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:18,240
can feel the moisture leaving my lips

1788
01:06:15,519 --> 01:06:19,679
because it is that dry there uh and it

1789
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:22,959
is you see that

1790
01:06:19,679 --> 01:06:24,960
uh in colorado with you know i take

1791
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:27,039
you know cannabis there and within two

1792
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:28,159
days if it's not you know in a sealed

1793
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:31,440
container with a

1794
01:06:28,159 --> 01:06:32,078
humidity pack it's turned to rock hard

1795
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:34,720
and eventually

1796
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:35,680
dust and you know yeah it's it's damp up

1797
01:06:34,719 --> 01:06:39,038
here in oregon

1798
01:06:35,679 --> 01:06:40,318
but you know i it it you know i i a

1799
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:41,680
great example for colorado i have a

1800
01:06:40,318 --> 01:06:43,358
friend of mine who used to run you know

1801
01:06:41,679 --> 01:06:45,598
he probably still does runs humidifiers

1802
01:06:43,358 --> 01:06:47,598
in his drying room

1803
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:49,838
you know that's that's a testament to

1804
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:50,559
how freaking dry it is there and you

1805
01:06:49,838 --> 01:06:53,279
know here

1806
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:55,200
it's really about how you how you dry

1807
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:56,319
your cannabis and how you cure it after

1808
01:06:55,199 --> 01:06:59,679
that

1809
01:06:56,318 --> 01:07:00,880
so you know i i could i could understand

1810
01:06:59,679 --> 01:07:04,000
someone's gripe with

1811
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:06,079
oregon being a little too damp

1812
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,280
and uh you know colorado is certainly

1813
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:09,920
dry

1814
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:10,480
yeah okay so get back to our industry

1815
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:12,079
talk

1816
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:13,760
in case we didn't make it a bit obvious

1817
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:14,880
you've obviously managed and run

1818
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:17,359
hydroponic stores

1819
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:19,358
grow stores in general for many years

1820
01:07:17,358 --> 01:07:20,078
i'm sure you've seen the fads come and

1821
01:07:19,358 --> 01:07:22,159
go

1822
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:24,798
what products do you think fall under

1823
01:07:22,159 --> 01:07:26,639
that general fad cycle you know to me

1824
01:07:24,798 --> 01:07:28,719
feels like we've had you know the

1825
01:07:26,639 --> 01:07:29,759
shilajit trend it's almost completely

1826
01:07:28,719 --> 01:07:30,959
died off you know

1827
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:33,440
not almost there's maybe a few

1828
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:36,079
stragglers but they'll die off soon

1829
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:36,079
yeah i mean

1830
01:07:36,639 --> 01:07:41,118
there have been a load of what i just

1831
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:44,640
call kind of flash in the pan products

1832
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:46,160
and i you know you'll have to forgive me

1833
01:07:44,639 --> 01:07:49,759
because

1834
01:07:46,159 --> 01:07:51,358
i i can't in good conscience call out

1835
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:52,559
too many of them on the negative just

1836
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:54,480
because i'm going to sell some of them

1837
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:57,280
and i'll probably hear back from others

1838
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:58,639
but you know they're the hype products

1839
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:02,240
that

1840
01:07:58,639 --> 01:08:05,199
companies invest loads of money on

1841
01:08:02,239 --> 01:08:05,679
uh into the marketing of those products

1842
01:08:05,199 --> 01:08:07,439
um

1843
01:08:05,679 --> 01:08:09,679
some of them are here to stay for a long

1844
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:11,039
time some of them have come and gone

1845
01:08:09,679 --> 01:08:14,480
already

1846
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:17,440
um but at the end of the day

1847
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:19,198
you know the i kind of split the

1848
01:08:17,439 --> 01:08:22,838
industry into two groups

1849
01:08:19,198 --> 01:08:24,960
there's the products that are made to

1850
01:08:22,838 --> 01:08:25,278
market and then they're the products

1851
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:28,480
that

1852
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:29,359
are just made and what we what i often

1853
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:32,479
find is the

1854
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:33,920
the the hyped companies if you will uh

1855
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:35,838
products you know they all work

1856
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:36,960
otherwise they wouldn't be in business

1857
01:08:35,838 --> 01:08:39,439
but you're

1858
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:40,560
gonna pay out the wazoo forum because

1859
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:42,238
gosh they have to back all that

1860
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:45,520
marketing somehow

1861
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:48,559
and two it's

1862
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:51,440
you know it's generally pretty cannabis

1863
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:55,679
but not the best tasting cannabis

1864
01:08:51,439 --> 01:08:55,678
so for me you know

1865
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:02,000
things like uh what's a good

1866
01:08:59,039 --> 01:09:03,198
program to that falls into this kind of

1867
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:07,359
flash in the pan

1868
01:09:03,198 --> 01:09:11,039
category yeah

1869
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:12,159
yeah you know i look and that that book

1870
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:15,439
you know so funny

1871
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:17,198
when that book came out uh how

1872
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:19,119
you know so many people clamored into

1873
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:20,318
the store and wanted us to explain to

1874
01:09:19,119 --> 01:09:21,439
them how to do it like i don't know you

1875
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:23,359
got to buy the 500

1876
01:09:21,439 --> 01:09:24,719
book you know they explain how to do it

1877
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:25,920
you know of course that led to all the

1878
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:27,119
stripping the leaves and everything like

1879
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:28,319
that and be like oh all you got to do is

1880
01:09:27,119 --> 01:09:29,119
strip leaves well no there's a whole

1881
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:31,120
like nutrient

1882
01:09:29,119 --> 01:09:32,798
feed that they put in that book that you

1883
01:09:31,119 --> 01:09:34,399
know compensates for the loss of your

1884
01:09:32,798 --> 01:09:38,640
storage houses

1885
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:38,639
uh so you know it's it's

1886
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:42,079
you know i i don't want to pick on

1887
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:45,119
anybody in particular

1888
01:09:42,079 --> 01:09:47,119
but there's a few of them out there uh

1889
01:09:45,119 --> 01:09:49,358
and and i i keep stressing the heavily

1890
01:09:47,119 --> 01:09:53,358
marketed heavily marketed thing

1891
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:57,039
uh you know products that that work

1892
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:58,640
and produce well don't need a lot of

1893
01:09:57,039 --> 01:10:00,399
hype

1894
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:02,239
they speak for themselves the results

1895
01:10:00,399 --> 01:10:05,519
speak for themselves

1896
01:10:02,238 --> 01:10:09,359
and so you know i have sold product

1897
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:12,719
on and off for the last 17 years

1898
01:10:09,359 --> 01:10:15,439
and you know seen

1899
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:17,359
a lot of good ones come and i've seen a

1900
01:10:15,439 --> 01:10:19,519
few bad ones go

1901
01:10:17,359 --> 01:10:20,719
you know the there was a point in time

1902
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:24,640
here in the states

1903
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:28,000
a few years back uh going back to the

1904
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:31,039
kind of mid 2000s to

1905
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:33,679
2010 era roughly where uh

1906
01:10:31,039 --> 01:10:36,719
there was pocobutazole showing up in all

1907
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:39,039
these uh flower boosting products

1908
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:40,560
phosphoload red dragon it was funny

1909
01:10:39,039 --> 01:10:42,000
because the companies that were creating

1910
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:43,920
these products were just simply

1911
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,439
they create one it would get banned and

1912
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:47,920
then they would just

1913
01:10:45,439 --> 01:10:49,599
you know rename relabel the same product

1914
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:49,920
and wait for that one to get banned you

1915
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:52,079
know

1916
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:53,760
butcherozo is definitely not a very

1917
01:10:52,079 --> 01:10:57,359
pleasant compound

1918
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:59,280
um known carcinogen especially if you're

1919
01:10:57,359 --> 01:11:01,679
smoking it in fact there was a you know

1920
01:10:59,279 --> 01:11:04,559
a company down in california

1921
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:06,880
that had been called out by a couple of

1922
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:09,120
states for their content of it

1923
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:11,119
uh and eventually if i'm not mistaken

1924
01:11:09,119 --> 01:11:13,840
the epa got involved

1925
01:11:11,119 --> 01:11:15,359
um you know and banned the product

1926
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:18,640
nationally

1927
01:11:15,359 --> 01:11:20,319
so you know some of these

1928
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:22,000
and a few of these products were pretty

1929
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:23,599
you know heavily marketed and yeah this

1930
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,719
is the game changer you know

1931
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:30,640
increase your yields tenfold whatever

1932
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:33,840
but all at what expense to the end user

1933
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:34,960
and uh so it was that and you got to

1934
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:36,800
remember too there was

1935
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:38,719
very very very very very little

1936
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:40,400
regulation on our industry until just a

1937
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:42,480
few years ago

1938
01:11:40,399 --> 01:11:44,479
you describe the australian market right

1939
01:11:42,479 --> 01:11:46,879
now the you know rampant with

1940
01:11:44,479 --> 01:11:47,759
plant grown uh plant growth regulators

1941
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:49,679
and

1942
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:51,199
i guess the issue which i'm really

1943
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:52,719
interested in knowing and you probably

1944
01:11:51,198 --> 01:11:54,479
have the answer is

1945
01:11:52,719 --> 01:11:56,640
you just referenced one situation where

1946
01:11:54,479 --> 01:11:57,359
it happened how rampant do you think the

1947
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:59,840
problem is

1948
01:11:57,359 --> 01:12:01,198
of companies having off-label pgrs do

1949
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:02,880
you think it really is a common

1950
01:12:01,198 --> 01:12:06,319
occurrence or it's more of a

1951
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:09,920
rare i think you know

1952
01:12:06,319 --> 01:12:12,079
in all honesty i believe that it's

1953
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:13,119
not as rampant as it used to be in this

1954
01:12:12,079 --> 01:12:15,760
country

1955
01:12:13,119 --> 01:12:16,960
if you go back five or six years it was

1956
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:20,079
pretty rampant

1957
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:22,560
once states like california

1958
01:12:20,079 --> 01:12:23,519
uh and oregon for their registration

1959
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:26,560
required uh

1960
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:28,159
full disclosure of contents uh that

1961
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:30,960
started that ceased

1962
01:12:28,158 --> 01:12:33,198
the frequency of products like that ever

1963
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:36,480
making it back into our market

1964
01:12:33,198 --> 01:12:38,719
uh you know few of these companies were

1965
01:12:36,479 --> 01:12:40,000
shut down and sued and made a lot of you

1966
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:40,800
know kind of a racket throughout the

1967
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,880
industry

1968
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:44,880
and that that got people to notice you

1969
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:46,800
know before nobody really noticed nobody

1970
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:48,319
really knew to ask you know if this had

1971
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:51,039
a

1972
01:12:48,319 --> 01:12:53,039
you know a harmful pgr in it uh they

1973
01:12:51,039 --> 01:12:53,840
just saw the results that it created and

1974
01:12:53,039 --> 01:12:56,079
thought like well

1975
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:56,880
this product works let's keep using it

1976
01:12:56,079 --> 01:13:00,000
uh and that's

1977
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:03,119
unfortunately you know a the the

1978
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,640
the result of having

1979
01:13:03,119 --> 01:13:06,479
you know back then which was really an

1980
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:08,640
uneducated customer base

1981
01:13:06,479 --> 01:13:11,119
which allowed a lot of bad actors to

1982
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:14,400
thrive in our industry here

1983
01:13:11,119 --> 01:13:16,640
but once there was you know state

1984
01:13:14,399 --> 01:13:18,639
intervention on the level you know by

1985
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:19,920
the department of agriculture in various

1986
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:23,840
states

1987
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:26,560
then the situation

1988
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:27,840
started to correct itself and i feel

1989
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:31,039
like we're at a point

1990
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:32,800
now where it is at least in our state

1991
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:36,079
and certainly in california

1992
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:37,279
very very difficult to register a

1993
01:13:36,079 --> 01:13:39,519
product

1994
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:41,920
uh that has in for our industry that has

1995
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:45,040
a pgr you gotta remember uh the states

1996
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:46,158
we don't have a unified registration for

1997
01:13:45,039 --> 01:13:49,600
the entire country

1998
01:13:46,158 --> 01:13:52,158
each state has its own registration for

1999
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:53,520
uh nutrients pesticides fungicides

2000
01:13:52,158 --> 01:13:54,960
whatever

2001
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:56,400
so the reason why i bring up that

2002
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:58,640
question is because on your instagram

2003
01:13:56,399 --> 01:14:00,799
page there's like a post kind of

2004
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:03,920
referencing that there was some uh i

2005
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:06,239
believe the product is called azatrol

2006
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:07,679
and yeah it had some adulterants in it

2007
01:14:06,238 --> 01:14:09,678
but they weren't actually plant growth

2008
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:11,920
regulators they were more like um

2009
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:13,600
in yeah what's the pesticide yeah

2010
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:15,119
pesticide i was gonna say insecticides

2011
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:16,719
but yeah pesticides

2012
01:14:15,119 --> 01:14:18,559
do you think this is something which is

2013
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:19,679
a little more rampant given

2014
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:20,719
and i was going to ask you this is a

2015
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:22,399
question as well you know what do you

2016
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:23,840
think the next trend will be in terms of

2017
01:14:22,399 --> 01:14:26,399
these fad products we mentioned

2018
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:28,079
i feel like pesticides fungicides these

2019
01:14:26,399 --> 01:14:29,439
are the ones on the rise you know it

2020
01:14:28,079 --> 01:14:31,439
seems like every day there's a new one

2021
01:14:29,439 --> 01:14:34,719
especially organic ones

2022
01:14:31,439 --> 01:14:38,238
right so um so we have uh

2023
01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:40,960
we have a a registration here

2024
01:14:38,238 --> 01:14:42,000
through the epa uh which is 25b

2025
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:44,640
compliant which is

2026
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,039
low or minimum risk pesticides which

2027
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:46,640
those

2028
01:14:45,039 --> 01:14:48,800
generally do not have to be thoroughly

2029
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:50,719
tested you just have to register as such

2030
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:54,079
as long as the ingredients that you

2031
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:56,079
provide are all 25b compliant then the

2032
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:59,519
epa approves your product

2033
01:14:56,079 --> 01:15:02,880
and it's a lot of these 25b compliant

2034
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:05,199
products quote unquote that

2035
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:06,719
seem to be sneaking things into their

2036
01:15:05,198 --> 01:15:08,639
products and of course when it comes

2037
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:10,960
when when rubber meets the road with

2038
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:12,480
this and the company has their back

2039
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:14,480
against the wall you know they blame

2040
01:15:12,479 --> 01:15:17,359
their partners they blame

2041
01:15:14,479 --> 01:15:18,639
you know some nefarious force that slip

2042
01:15:17,359 --> 01:15:20,479
this into their product but at the end

2043
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:23,840
of the day

2044
01:15:20,479 --> 01:15:25,198
they're adding adulterants for some

2045
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:26,960
reason other or there's some kind of

2046
01:15:25,198 --> 01:15:28,719
crap cross-contamination happening at

2047
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:31,039
their facility the azo12 one is very

2048
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:33,920
interesting and intriguing to me because

2049
01:15:31,039 --> 01:15:35,760
when when i looked into the compounds

2050
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:39,440
that were showing up in those tests

2051
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:42,640
uh as adulterants the addition

2052
01:15:39,439 --> 01:15:43,279
of those particular compounds made zero

2053
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:46,800
zilch

2054
01:15:43,279 --> 01:15:50,840
no sense whatsoever from a

2055
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:53,440
ipm or uh knock down approach

2056
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:54,719
strategy you know even even if you're a

2057
01:15:53,439 --> 01:15:57,759
big ag person

2058
01:15:54,719 --> 01:15:59,600
the that particular group just didn't

2059
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:00,159
make any sense why we'd all be in there

2060
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:02,640
together

2061
01:16:00,158 --> 01:16:04,960
so part of me wants to think that

2062
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:06,960
perhaps there's some kind of residual

2063
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:09,119
contamination that's happening at that i

2064
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:10,640
mean the company that manufactures that

2065
01:16:09,119 --> 01:16:13,039
product manufactures

2066
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:14,560
every single one of those compounds in

2067
01:16:13,039 --> 01:16:17,359
some shape or form

2068
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:19,039
uh through their company and uh it

2069
01:16:17,359 --> 01:16:20,639
manufactures that load so you know it

2070
01:16:19,039 --> 01:16:21,840
doesn't make sense for a company of that

2071
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:23,840
magnitude because you gotta remember

2072
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:25,760
that's not a hydro industry company

2073
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:27,119
that's an ag company uh so it doesn't

2074
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:29,520
make any sense for them

2075
01:16:27,119 --> 01:16:30,158
to intentionally adulter their product

2076
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,679
now

2077
01:16:30,158 --> 01:16:34,559
the fact that it hasn't come back to

2078
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:37,600
market yet that's very curious to me

2079
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:38,320
um but something that one was very

2080
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:39,760
strange

2081
01:16:38,319 --> 01:16:41,679
there have been a couple others and

2082
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:42,400
believe it or not our store has kind of

2083
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:44,399
been ground

2084
01:16:42,399 --> 01:16:45,679
zero for the discovery of these products

2085
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:48,960
what really brought

2086
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:52,079
the adulterant of pesticides to light

2087
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:55,840
for our industry was the testing of

2088
01:16:52,079 --> 01:16:59,198
finished product of the cannabis

2089
01:16:55,840 --> 01:17:02,000
and and concentrates and

2090
01:16:59,198 --> 01:17:02,639
so the one of the first major cases we

2091
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:06,238
had here

2092
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:08,560
was with a product called guardian

2093
01:17:06,238 --> 01:17:09,359
and guardian was being produced i think

2094
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:14,800
out of a company

2095
01:17:09,359 --> 01:17:14,799
out of michigan you know lemongrass oil

2096
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:21,760
cinnamon uh a couple other little

2097
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:24,880
essential oils and it was being sold

2098
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:25,760
believe it or not to organic growers as

2099
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:27,840
a way to knock

2100
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:29,360
back russet mites which had just kind of

2101
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:32,880
found their way into the

2102
01:17:29,359 --> 01:17:33,799
oregon scene and everyone was just

2103
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:36,560
having this

2104
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:40,079
incredible success

2105
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:42,880
with these essential oils

2106
01:17:40,079 --> 01:17:44,238
you know and none of us wow they've just

2107
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:44,480
kind of unlocked the key here because no

2108
01:17:44,238 --> 01:17:45,678
one

2109
01:17:44,479 --> 01:17:48,319
at that point in time was having very

2110
01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:51,600
much success getting rid of russet mites

2111
01:17:48,319 --> 01:17:52,399
and eventually uh i think it was two or

2112
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:55,199
three

2113
01:17:52,399 --> 01:17:55,198
cultivators

2114
01:17:56,238 --> 01:18:03,198
down in eugene or in that area uh failed

2115
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:07,119
their pesticide screening uh for

2116
01:18:03,198 --> 01:18:09,839
because uh abamectin was present

2117
01:18:07,119 --> 01:18:10,840
and uh a lot of folks will know the

2118
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:13,199
brand name

2119
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:15,119
avid if some people said it was

2120
01:18:13,198 --> 01:18:17,839
ivermectin some people says abamectin

2121
01:18:15,119 --> 01:18:18,319
whatever so what the department of ag so

2122
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:21,920
the

2123
01:18:18,319 --> 01:18:24,479
the lab that found these test results uh

2124
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:26,079
called called all the growers and said

2125
01:18:24,479 --> 01:18:26,479
you know everybody write down your list

2126
01:18:26,079 --> 01:18:29,600
of all

2127
01:18:26,479 --> 01:18:31,359
your inputs and the three gardens all

2128
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:33,440
had one common denominator which was

2129
01:18:31,359 --> 01:18:37,198
this guardian product

2130
01:18:33,439 --> 01:18:40,079
so that lab og analytical down in eugene

2131
01:18:37,198 --> 01:18:41,599
called the department of ag and said hey

2132
01:18:40,079 --> 01:18:43,519
we have a suspicion here so the

2133
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:45,039
department of ag contacted our store

2134
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:46,320
because we sold one of the bottles

2135
01:18:45,039 --> 01:18:47,679
and said hey do you have this product we

2136
01:18:46,319 --> 01:18:48,479
said yeah we do like okay we're going to

2137
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:50,399
come by and

2138
01:18:48,479 --> 01:18:51,919
grab a bottle off your shelf so they

2139
01:18:50,399 --> 01:18:53,599
bought a bottle off of our shelf

2140
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:55,039
they went down to eugene it's about two

2141
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:56,079
hours away south bought a bottle off

2142
01:18:55,039 --> 01:18:57,039
their shelf and then went down to

2143
01:18:56,079 --> 01:18:58,559
southern oregon

2144
01:18:57,039 --> 01:19:00,158
and bought a bottle of those tested all

2145
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:01,679
three of those independently voila

2146
01:19:00,158 --> 01:19:04,639
there's abamectin

2147
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:07,279
so you know you call the uh you know so

2148
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:09,600
then the department of bag

2149
01:19:07,279 --> 01:19:11,439
calls the company the the manufacturer

2150
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:14,079
and the guy says oh my partner just

2151
01:19:11,439 --> 01:19:15,198
put some of that in no your partner

2152
01:19:14,079 --> 01:19:16,238
didn't just slip some of that and it's

2153
01:19:15,198 --> 01:19:17,599
been there all along

2154
01:19:16,238 --> 01:19:19,279
that's why it's actually killing russet

2155
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:20,079
mites because i'm sorry lemongrass and

2156
01:19:19,279 --> 01:19:23,198
cinnamon oil

2157
01:19:20,079 --> 01:19:23,760
isn't going to kill or us it might um it

2158
01:19:23,198 --> 01:19:26,238
will

2159
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:27,679
they they're they're great uh repellents

2160
01:19:26,238 --> 01:19:31,119
but not necessarily

2161
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:34,719
kill factor um so

2162
01:19:31,119 --> 01:19:37,760
that was the first case where

2163
01:19:34,719 --> 01:19:40,880
pesticide screening actually

2164
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:44,079
benefited the community

2165
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:48,239
and it was that event that got

2166
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:50,800
me very very interested in you know

2167
01:19:48,238 --> 01:19:51,919
looking at adulterants that were

2168
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:55,520
currently in

2169
01:19:51,920 --> 01:20:00,239
in products in our industry and

2170
01:19:55,520 --> 01:20:04,159
right after the uh right after the

2171
01:20:00,238 --> 01:20:06,158
guardian situation there was another one

2172
01:20:04,158 --> 01:20:08,559
with a product called mighty wash

2173
01:20:06,158 --> 01:20:09,839
that was wildly and rampantly available

2174
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:12,719
as a 25b

2175
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:13,920
this one had frequency water in it right

2176
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:16,319
quote unquote

2177
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:17,440
and it was killing mites everyone just

2178
01:20:16,319 --> 01:20:20,880
destroying mites

2179
01:20:17,439 --> 01:20:23,119
spider mites too spotted right and uh

2180
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:25,039
oh it's it's it's you know the the the

2181
01:20:23,119 --> 01:20:28,238
what was the the

2182
01:20:25,039 --> 01:20:30,560
a vortex implosion yeah

2183
01:20:28,238 --> 01:20:32,319
what was the the frequency would stun

2184
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:35,679
the mite and the oil would suffocate

2185
01:20:32,319 --> 01:20:37,759
it and that was its mode of action

2186
01:20:35,679 --> 01:20:39,440
well so one of our customers comes back

2187
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:41,119
to us and says hey you know

2188
01:20:39,439 --> 01:20:42,960
i've failed a couple tests now for

2189
01:20:41,119 --> 01:20:45,198
pyrethrum

2190
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:46,239
oh well what are you using go down the

2191
01:20:45,198 --> 01:20:48,399
list oh

2192
01:20:46,238 --> 01:20:50,079
mighty wash huh so i call up the

2193
01:20:48,399 --> 01:20:51,039
department of ag and said hey

2194
01:20:50,079 --> 01:20:52,559
at this point we have a nice

2195
01:20:51,039 --> 01:20:53,840
relationship and i say hey we've got

2196
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:55,760
this product here and

2197
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:57,520
our customer keeps failing for pyrethrum

2198
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:59,360
you want to come check this out

2199
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:01,280
so i said we'll be right up so they came

2200
01:20:59,359 --> 01:21:02,719
and bought a bottle off of our shelf did

2201
01:21:01,279 --> 01:21:03,759
the same thing bottled down in southern

2202
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:06,399
oregon bottle in

2203
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:07,520
salem oregon state capital uh sorry

2204
01:21:06,399 --> 01:21:10,879
springfield

2205
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:13,360
uh but then uh

2206
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:16,000
they discovered pyrethrum in a product

2207
01:21:13,359 --> 01:21:18,238
that was 25b compliant now and pyrethrum

2208
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:22,319
isn't the nastiest of compounds

2209
01:21:18,238 --> 01:21:25,599
really of all of the knockdown takedown

2210
01:21:22,319 --> 01:21:26,559
pesticides it's it's it's fairly safe to

2211
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:28,880
use

2212
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:29,760
but if you don't disclose it in your

2213
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:32,400
product

2214
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:34,239
and people are using your product to the

2215
01:21:32,399 --> 01:21:36,879
day of harvest and then making

2216
01:21:34,238 --> 01:21:38,319
concentrates from your product

2217
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:40,960
see how things scale up very quickly

2218
01:21:38,319 --> 01:21:44,079
here yeah it's it's a problem

2219
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:45,679
and you know this of course then goes

2220
01:21:44,079 --> 01:21:48,000
back to the micro butanol thing

2221
01:21:45,679 --> 01:21:49,679
and the eagle 20 and the cyanide

2222
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,639
hydrogen or hydrogen cyanide that's

2223
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:53,279
released from that

2224
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:54,000
when it's combusted and that actually

2225
01:21:53,279 --> 01:21:55,599
got me

2226
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,439
very heavily involved with a couple of

2227
01:21:55,600 --> 01:22:00,320
groups and

2228
01:21:57,439 --> 01:22:01,439
there's a one at least one white paper

2229
01:22:00,319 --> 01:22:03,359
out there that's published

2230
01:22:01,439 --> 01:22:05,439
that i was a part of and then i actually

2231
01:22:03,359 --> 01:22:08,839
went to speak

2232
01:22:05,439 --> 01:22:10,638
at a cannabis conference in new york

2233
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:13,679
city uh

2234
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:16,000
that uh

2235
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:17,600
a group called bow tech analytical put

2236
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:19,439
on it was an international cannabis

2237
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:21,440
conference and spoke on a panel

2238
01:22:19,439 --> 01:22:22,879
with a couple of other individuals

2239
01:22:21,439 --> 01:22:26,000
specifically about

2240
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:26,719
adulterants and entering into the supply

2241
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,840
chain

2242
01:22:26,719 --> 01:22:33,279
for products used to cultivate cannabis

2243
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:34,239
and um you know it was it was very

2244
01:22:33,279 --> 01:22:36,719
important to me

2245
01:22:34,238 --> 01:22:37,919
for at that point to you know because a

2246
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:38,800
lot of these folks who came to this

2247
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:41,440
conference

2248
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:43,440
were very policy oriented or financial

2249
01:22:41,439 --> 01:22:46,479
oriented individuals

2250
01:22:43,439 --> 01:22:48,000
and they uh you know

2251
01:22:46,479 --> 01:22:50,158
it was something to explain you have to

2252
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:52,000
understand that the majority of the

2253
01:22:50,158 --> 01:22:54,079
customers who are using these products

2254
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,000
that are going to the grow store

2255
01:22:54,079 --> 01:22:57,198
are not necessarily you know they

2256
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,039
certainly don't have pesticide

2257
01:22:57,198 --> 01:22:59,359
applicators licenses so they're they're

2258
01:22:59,039 --> 01:23:02,079
not

2259
01:22:59,359 --> 01:23:03,359
educated in the world of pesticides

2260
01:23:02,079 --> 01:23:07,679
pesticide application

2261
01:23:03,359 --> 01:23:09,359
uh so you know the the old you know

2262
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:10,960
just used twice as much as what the

2263
01:23:09,359 --> 01:23:14,399
label recommends was

2264
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:17,520
a pretty popular way of approaching

2265
01:23:14,399 --> 01:23:21,279
you know pesticide and fungicide use

2266
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:23,520
uh so for me whenever a bulletin

2267
01:23:21,279 --> 01:23:25,359
and i'm always you know i'm linked in

2268
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:26,480
with oda alerts the oregon department of

2269
01:23:25,359 --> 01:23:28,719
agricultural alerts

2270
01:23:26,479 --> 01:23:30,399
whenever a bulletin gets posted i'm

2271
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:33,039
going to very quickly put it up

2272
01:23:30,399 --> 01:23:34,799
on the instagram there because you know

2273
01:23:33,039 --> 01:23:38,238
the folks who do follow me in this state

2274
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:38,239
that's important for them to know

2275
01:23:38,399 --> 01:23:42,158
yeah okay so just kind of touching back

2276
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:44,320
on

2277
01:23:42,158 --> 01:23:45,920
like i guess maybe a general undertone

2278
01:23:44,319 --> 01:23:47,198
that's been going on in the whole

2279
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:49,840
conversation

2280
01:23:47,198 --> 01:23:52,238
do you view a lot of these new

2281
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:54,159
organic-based pesticides with an eye of

2282
01:23:52,238 --> 01:23:54,959
caution or do you think that there is a

2283
01:23:54,158 --> 01:23:57,519
legitimate

2284
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:58,880
kind of area of research that could be

2285
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:01,040
done to develop better

2286
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:02,319
organic pesticides and the reason why i

2287
01:24:01,039 --> 01:24:03,600
bring this up is because

2288
01:24:02,319 --> 01:24:06,079
you know there's obviously just such a

2289
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:06,719
vast contrast in the effectiveness of

2290
01:24:06,079 --> 01:24:08,559
synthetic

2291
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:11,198
versus organic like synthetic it's like

2292
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:12,719
one application and stuff just dies

2293
01:24:11,198 --> 01:24:14,238
um with organic it seems like you know

2294
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:16,158
we're really trying to just like you

2295
01:24:14,238 --> 01:24:17,839
know chase our tails but you can kind of

2296
01:24:16,158 --> 01:24:18,399
get on top of it eventually do you think

2297
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:20,239
that's

2298
01:24:18,399 --> 01:24:21,759
the general situation and it's not going

2299
01:24:20,238 --> 01:24:25,279
to change too much

2300
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:27,280
uh you know if by looking at what

2301
01:24:25,279 --> 01:24:29,119
you know california is allowing i'd say

2302
01:24:27,279 --> 01:24:30,719
that's definitely the situation

2303
01:24:29,119 --> 01:24:33,359
what you're dealing with once again is

2304
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:36,000
an uneducated customer base

2305
01:24:33,359 --> 01:24:37,039
uh so until things like pesticide you

2306
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,198
know and

2307
01:24:37,039 --> 01:24:40,719
if you look at so the way the or the

2308
01:24:39,198 --> 01:24:42,238
environmental protection agency works

2309
01:24:40,719 --> 01:24:44,000
here in the states

2310
01:24:42,238 --> 01:24:45,599
is if you have a product that you're

2311
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,158
bringing to market you know the epa

2312
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:48,800
tests it

2313
01:24:46,158 --> 01:24:49,920
goes through a rigorous testing 120 some

2314
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:52,400
different tests

2315
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:53,440
uh but they test it on specific crops

2316
01:24:52,399 --> 01:24:56,559
and on most

2317
01:24:53,439 --> 01:24:59,119
labels of most pesticides uh it lists

2318
01:24:56,560 --> 01:25:02,320
the specific crops that it is that is

2319
01:24:59,119 --> 01:25:05,679
legal to use that pesticide fungicide or

2320
01:25:02,319 --> 01:25:06,158
miticide on if you use it on some other

2321
01:25:05,679 --> 01:25:07,600
crop

2322
01:25:06,158 --> 01:25:10,158
let's say cannabis then you're

2323
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:11,600
absolutely violating epa regulation and

2324
01:25:10,158 --> 01:25:12,960
you can be fined and

2325
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:15,120
all kinds of horrible things can happen

2326
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:17,679
right so

2327
01:25:15,119 --> 01:25:19,760
the the big fear of the state and

2328
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:20,639
allowing any pesticide or fungicide is

2329
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:23,440
that they would be

2330
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:25,039
defying epa regulation by allowing

2331
01:25:23,439 --> 01:25:28,319
cultivators to do so

2332
01:25:25,039 --> 01:25:31,279
so what you find in most states

2333
01:25:28,319 --> 01:25:32,079
as far as what is allowed are a lot of

2334
01:25:31,279 --> 01:25:35,359
25b

2335
01:25:32,079 --> 01:25:37,679
compliant products that are safe

2336
01:25:35,359 --> 01:25:38,479
or you know that are that are generally

2337
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:39,760
safe to you know

2338
01:25:38,479 --> 01:25:41,519
generally regarded as safe when they

2339
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:45,760
call that grass

2340
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:47,520
uh so these products are

2341
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:50,560
somewhat benign in the sense that

2342
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:54,239
they're they are good control measures

2343
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:56,080
they are very difficult

2344
01:25:54,238 --> 01:25:57,599
they're not as they're not it's not as

2345
01:25:56,079 --> 01:25:59,359
easy to create solution from them but

2346
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:02,120
they're we're getting better there's a

2347
01:25:59,359 --> 01:26:04,158
a couple of companies out there marone

2348
01:26:02,119 --> 01:26:06,319
bioinnovations that are putting forth

2349
01:26:04,158 --> 01:26:09,519
some pretty interesting products

2350
01:26:06,319 --> 01:26:09,759
uh that you know i certainly get behind

2351
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:12,000
you

2352
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:13,039
for me it's not about pesticides to

2353
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,760
control pests

2354
01:26:13,039 --> 01:26:17,679
it's you know good practices beneficials

2355
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:20,719
predatory insects that can play well

2356
01:26:17,679 --> 01:26:23,199
with bio-pesticides

2357
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:25,760
to me that's the best approach

2358
01:26:23,198 --> 01:26:28,238
prevention is obviously the first step

2359
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:30,560
but if you are dealing with you know

2360
01:26:28,238 --> 01:26:33,599
certain pests or certain funguses

2361
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:35,920
uh there is generally a very good and

2362
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:38,239
sound

2363
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:41,119
organic approach to solving that problem

2364
01:26:38,238 --> 01:26:41,119
but it generally

2365
01:26:41,359 --> 01:26:45,439
requires multiple steps because they're

2366
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:46,719
look even with chemicals there's no

2367
01:26:45,439 --> 01:26:51,678
magic bullet

2368
01:26:46,719 --> 01:26:54,960
in any of this so it repeat applications

2369
01:26:51,679 --> 01:26:57,840
and of certain products and of course

2370
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:59,039
uh for me when it comes to you know

2371
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:01,440
insects i

2372
01:26:59,039 --> 01:27:03,679
i love the idea of using predators

2373
01:27:01,439 --> 01:27:07,678
coupled with bio-pesticides

2374
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:10,800
generally between those two arms

2375
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:13,600
you can solve many many many problems

2376
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:14,400
they have a pretty far reach so

2377
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:17,280
something i

2378
01:27:14,399 --> 01:27:19,039
noticed on your instagram was that you

2379
01:27:17,279 --> 01:27:20,559
do the gas lantern method

2380
01:27:19,039 --> 01:27:22,319
it's a little yes yeah a little bit of

2381
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:24,239
an unusual thing something everyone's

2382
01:27:22,319 --> 01:27:26,158
curious about but i find you know

2383
01:27:24,238 --> 01:27:28,000
certainly myself never tried it

2384
01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:30,000
what initially stimulated you to do it

2385
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:34,079
and what about it causes you to keep

2386
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:36,960
doing it so

2387
01:27:34,079 --> 01:27:38,399
oh gosh how many years ago was this

2388
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,420
probably

2389
01:27:38,399 --> 01:27:42,509
2000

2390
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:42,510
[Music]

2391
01:27:43,119 --> 01:27:49,359
12 or 13 i was at a trade

2392
01:27:46,158 --> 01:27:53,039
show in denver and a

2393
01:27:49,359 --> 01:27:53,039
very good friend of mine

2394
01:27:54,319 --> 01:27:59,759
came up behind me and whispered gas

2395
01:27:57,439 --> 01:28:04,158
lantern check it out

2396
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:06,239
and then walked away so

2397
01:28:04,158 --> 01:28:07,599
i was like okay so i was back in my

2398
01:28:06,238 --> 01:28:10,799
hotel room that night

2399
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:13,440
after the event and you know started

2400
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:14,159
looking online google gas lantern

2401
01:28:13,439 --> 01:28:16,000
gasoline

2402
01:28:14,158 --> 01:28:18,960
comes across you know joe's pietry's

2403
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:20,399
thing okay so i'm looking at this whole

2404
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:22,158
lighting schedule first i'm like wow

2405
01:28:20,399 --> 01:28:23,679
this is like mind-blowing i don't see

2406
01:28:22,158 --> 01:28:24,960
how this could ever work out but then

2407
01:28:23,679 --> 01:28:29,359
i'm reading

2408
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:32,399
the um uh he had put together

2409
01:28:29,359 --> 01:28:33,519
kind of a reasoning of why this works so

2410
01:28:32,399 --> 01:28:36,559
well

2411
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:39,600
and you know his whole theory is

2412
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:40,400
that we we are constantly over

2413
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:43,440
saturating

2414
01:28:40,399 --> 01:28:46,238
cannabis more so than it typically needs

2415
01:28:43,439 --> 01:28:48,079
uh to be to be lit and he starts with

2416
01:28:46,238 --> 01:28:49,519
you know people who like to do 24 hours

2417
01:28:48,079 --> 01:28:51,279
of veg for example he's like well

2418
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:52,639
look at where it's 24 hours of light for

2419
01:28:51,279 --> 01:28:54,238
extended periods of time

2420
01:28:52,639 --> 01:28:55,359
that's generally the polar regions if

2421
01:28:54,238 --> 01:28:56,959
you look around the polar regions

2422
01:28:55,359 --> 01:28:58,158
granted it's cold but not much grows

2423
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:59,600
there

2424
01:28:58,158 --> 01:29:01,119
you can even come down a little bit

2425
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:02,560
further and then you get into tundra

2426
01:29:01,119 --> 01:29:04,319
regions but you know you're getting

2427
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:05,679
lichen and grasses but nothing that's

2428
01:29:04,319 --> 01:29:07,519
lush and supple once again it's probably

2429
01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:09,600
more temperature related but

2430
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:11,440
he's using this to drive a point home

2431
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:14,880
and then out of that he's

2432
01:29:11,439 --> 01:29:18,079
he states that if you look at

2433
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:20,239
plants that are veged you know six

2434
01:29:18,079 --> 01:29:21,279
eight ten weeks to get these large

2435
01:29:20,238 --> 01:29:24,238
plants indoors

2436
01:29:21,279 --> 01:29:24,800
under artificial lighting we generally

2437
01:29:24,238 --> 01:29:27,599
see

2438
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:29,920
pre-flowering occurring somewhere in

2439
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:32,960
that fifth to sixth week

2440
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:33,840
of running like 18-6 and for a

2441
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:36,639
photoperiod

2442
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:37,600
obligate plant this is this is his

2443
01:29:36,639 --> 01:29:39,760
theory now

2444
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:41,199
uh which i somewhat subscribe to for a

2445
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:44,000
photoperiod obligate plant

2446
01:29:41,198 --> 01:29:45,678
that is a very unnatural reaction so

2447
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:48,000
floral hormone should stay

2448
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:49,520
bottled up in that plant until there

2449
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,880
until that photo period triggers and

2450
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:53,040
then that should release

2451
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:54,880
release the hormone so he says so why

2452
01:29:53,039 --> 01:29:56,719
are we seeing these little

2453
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:58,079
you know pistols showing up five six

2454
01:29:56,719 --> 01:30:01,039
weeks into a veg

2455
01:29:58,079 --> 01:30:02,319
well it has a lot to do with this over

2456
01:30:01,039 --> 01:30:04,960
lighting of plants

2457
01:30:02,319 --> 01:30:05,599
and it's more of a stress response so

2458
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:06,960
the plants are

2459
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:09,520
letting out little bits of floral

2460
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:12,480
hormones uh during a time when it should

2461
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:15,600
be keeping those bottled up

2462
01:30:12,479 --> 01:30:17,678
so that's kind of the reasoning

2463
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:19,760
why he says so i read this and i think

2464
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:23,760
okay well this kind of makes sense so

2465
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:26,079
i get back to portland and

2466
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:27,440
pretty soon thereafter decide okay i'm

2467
01:30:26,079 --> 01:30:30,639
going to try

2468
01:30:27,439 --> 01:30:30,638
i'm going to start with the veg

2469
01:30:31,119 --> 01:30:38,158
13 on what's it five and a half off

2470
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:39,760
one on five and a half off or twelve on

2471
01:30:38,158 --> 01:30:42,319
excuse me twelve twelve on five and a

2472
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:45,440
half off one on twelve uh

2473
01:30:42,319 --> 01:30:47,519
five and a half off again so anyway so

2474
01:30:45,439 --> 01:30:49,359
the light the light break is what kind

2475
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:50,080
of keeps these floral hormones bottled

2476
01:30:49,359 --> 01:30:52,399
up and the way

2477
01:30:50,079 --> 01:30:53,359
he the way he rationalizes that is the

2478
01:30:52,399 --> 01:30:54,879
reason

2479
01:30:53,359 --> 01:30:56,799
the reason why they call the gas lantern

2480
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:57,440
is you know northern latitudinal glass

2481
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:59,600
houses

2482
01:30:57,439 --> 01:31:01,359
in the winter time trying to keep uh

2483
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:02,400
flowering crops from flowering they go

2484
01:31:01,359 --> 01:31:04,399
through in the middle of the night

2485
01:31:02,399 --> 01:31:05,679
light up these gas lanterns and that

2486
01:31:04,399 --> 01:31:07,119
little bit of a light break in the

2487
01:31:05,679 --> 01:31:08,719
middle of the dark cycle would keep

2488
01:31:07,119 --> 01:31:11,599
those hormones bottled up so

2489
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:13,359
the flowers wouldn't express or shift

2490
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:17,280
gears so to speak

2491
01:31:13,359 --> 01:31:20,880
so i applied that

2492
01:31:17,279 --> 01:31:23,759
practice to my own garden pretty quickly

2493
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:24,239
and was kind of amazed when i saw that

2494
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:26,480
you know

2495
01:31:24,238 --> 01:31:27,839
eight weeks into veg there's no pistol

2496
01:31:26,479 --> 01:31:30,238
showing up

2497
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:31,440
and then as soon as i put a plant into

2498
01:31:30,238 --> 01:31:32,799
flower

2499
01:31:31,439 --> 01:31:34,879
you know and the theory here is you get

2500
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:37,199
this kind of rush of floral hormones

2501
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:39,039
because they've been bottled up so long

2502
01:31:37,198 --> 01:31:39,678
uh when you put a plant in the flower

2503
01:31:39,039 --> 01:31:41,519
you get a

2504
01:31:39,679 --> 01:31:42,719
brush of floral hormones and so flower

2505
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:46,159
set does

2506
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:49,279
tend to occur a couple of days early

2507
01:31:46,158 --> 01:31:52,559
uh so i did the veg

2508
01:31:49,279 --> 01:31:55,039
side of it for about

2509
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:57,679
five rounds almost for an entire year

2510
01:31:55,039 --> 01:31:59,519
before i ever subscribed to

2511
01:31:57,679 --> 01:32:01,199
the flowering in the diminishing light

2512
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:04,239
on the flowering end

2513
01:32:01,198 --> 01:32:05,519
and i just you know i i just i i in the

2514
01:32:04,238 --> 01:32:06,879
beginning the first couple runs like i

2515
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:07,760
just knew something bad was going to

2516
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:09,920
come out of it and

2517
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:12,480
fortunately nothing ever did but it was

2518
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:13,760
it's such a leap of faith when you know

2519
01:32:12,479 --> 01:32:16,718
your entire

2520
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:18,159
growing career you're told 18 6 18 6 18

2521
01:32:16,719 --> 01:32:19,439
6 this is how you do it

2522
01:32:18,158 --> 01:32:21,519
you know people say like oh you got to

2523
01:32:19,439 --> 01:32:22,559
have 24 hours of light over your clones

2524
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:24,800
now you know when i people

2525
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:26,320
suggested 24 hours of light over clones

2526
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:29,039
to keep the temperature stable

2527
01:32:26,319 --> 01:32:31,679
that was it you know i clone under gas

2528
01:32:29,039 --> 01:32:34,479
lantern great great success from it

2529
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:36,319
uh so on the veg side of things it's a

2530
01:32:34,479 --> 01:32:39,198
great money saving opportunity

2531
01:32:36,319 --> 01:32:40,399
especially for a large commercial grow

2532
01:32:39,198 --> 01:32:41,759
you know and i've heard lots of people

2533
01:32:40,399 --> 01:32:44,238
think oh you know it decreases your

2534
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:46,480
yield or it slows down the veg and i i

2535
01:32:44,238 --> 01:32:48,238
couldn't that certainly has not been my

2536
01:32:46,479 --> 01:32:50,479
experience whatsoever certainly haven't

2537
01:32:48,238 --> 01:32:53,678
had any yield loss over the years and

2538
01:32:50,479 --> 01:32:54,238
the veg keeps up just as as good as ever

2539
01:32:53,679 --> 01:32:57,679
uh

2540
01:32:54,238 --> 01:33:01,039
so it but it is it's it's a huge

2541
01:32:57,679 --> 01:33:03,279
leap of faith and i can't stress that

2542
01:33:01,039 --> 01:33:04,079
it's it's such a hard shift to make in

2543
01:33:03,279 --> 01:33:05,759
your head

2544
01:33:04,079 --> 01:33:08,079
to say okay i'm only going to light

2545
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:11,360
these veg plants up 13 hours a day

2546
01:33:08,079 --> 01:33:13,279
now yeah so i guess maybe

2547
01:33:11,359 --> 01:33:15,279
if we try to condense all that down into

2548
01:33:13,279 --> 01:33:18,399
one line would you advocate everyone

2549
01:33:15,279 --> 01:33:22,158
uses the gas lantern method

2550
01:33:18,399 --> 01:33:25,198
no because there are some strains

2551
01:33:22,158 --> 01:33:30,399
that will act adversely to it

2552
01:33:25,198 --> 01:33:30,399
uh equatorial strains especially um

2553
01:33:30,479 --> 01:33:33,678
i think that

2554
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:38,000
and i've only had i've had one strain in

2555
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:40,560
my life not

2556
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:42,399
work with it and that was cenax cinnax

2557
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:43,840
did not react very good to the veg

2558
01:33:42,399 --> 01:33:45,679
program at all

2559
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:47,039
but cenex can be kind of a wild plant to

2560
01:33:45,679 --> 01:33:50,399
begin with

2561
01:33:47,039 --> 01:33:52,719
um but it yeah i mean

2562
01:33:50,399 --> 01:33:54,158
i think for someone who's coming out of

2563
01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:56,399
the gates maybe a hobbyist

2564
01:33:54,158 --> 01:33:58,238
if you want to have that you know

2565
01:33:56,399 --> 01:34:00,719
guaranteed your genetics going to work

2566
01:33:58,238 --> 01:34:02,000
fine with it then run your 18-6

2567
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:03,920
but i think for someone with a little

2568
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:05,840
more experience that's willing to

2569
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:07,359
experiment with their genetics to see

2570
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:09,440
how they react

2571
01:34:07,359 --> 01:34:10,399
like i said all of mine except for that

2572
01:34:09,439 --> 01:34:13,599
one strain

2573
01:34:10,399 --> 01:34:17,359
which i don't run anymore

2574
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:18,639
all of mine have done fine by it so

2575
01:34:17,359 --> 01:34:20,559
you know i think someone with some

2576
01:34:18,639 --> 01:34:23,279
experience that's willing to take a risk

2577
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:24,800
it's better for them than perhaps

2578
01:34:23,279 --> 01:34:26,399
someone who's completely agreeing to the

2579
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:28,400
game

2580
01:34:26,399 --> 01:34:30,799
so just to completely clarify because i

2581
01:34:28,399 --> 01:34:32,719
only very briefly referenced it earlier

2582
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:34,239
do you believe in defoliation at all

2583
01:34:32,719 --> 01:34:36,079
like yeah we kind of were you know

2584
01:34:34,238 --> 01:34:37,759
talking [ __ ] about three a lot but

2585
01:34:36,079 --> 01:34:39,679
right do you believe there's any merit

2586
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:42,719
in defoliation of any kind are you just

2587
01:34:39,679 --> 01:34:44,239
kind of not into it at all um no i mean

2588
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:47,520
i do periodic

2589
01:34:44,238 --> 01:34:47,759
i i don't strip my plants personally um

2590
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:49,199
and

2591
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:50,960
and keep in mind too you know i'm a

2592
01:34:49,198 --> 01:34:53,118
smaller cultivator so i don't have a

2593
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:56,880
giant warehouse or anything like that

2594
01:34:53,118 --> 01:34:58,799
um you know so i have the ability to

2595
01:34:56,880 --> 01:35:00,000
work very closely with the number of

2596
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:03,199
plants that i do have

2597
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:07,359
on a very personal level so you know

2598
01:35:03,198 --> 01:35:09,439
i will remove fan leaves as i see fit

2599
01:35:07,359 --> 01:35:11,359
if they're shadowing out of you know a

2600
01:35:09,439 --> 01:35:12,879
lower branch or i want to get a little

2601
01:35:11,359 --> 01:35:14,479
bit more light down that

2602
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:16,560
you know down that that one branch you

2603
01:35:14,479 --> 01:35:18,559
know i will do periodic removal

2604
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:20,960
throughout the bloom process but i am

2605
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:24,400
not a fan leaf stripper

2606
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:27,198
um it can work i've done it before

2607
01:35:24,399 --> 01:35:28,079
a couple of my varieties reacted fairly

2608
01:35:27,198 --> 01:35:30,479
decently to

2609
01:35:28,079 --> 01:35:33,118
it a couple of them didn't react so well

2610
01:35:30,479 --> 01:35:35,039
so i bagged it after two attempts

2611
01:35:33,118 --> 01:35:36,319
but keep in mind too that it's more than

2612
01:35:35,039 --> 01:35:38,319
just you know the stripping of the

2613
01:35:36,319 --> 01:35:39,359
leaves there's also this augmenting of

2614
01:35:38,319 --> 01:35:41,519
the feed

2615
01:35:39,359 --> 01:35:43,039
to provide you know kind of consistent

2616
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:45,199
flow of nutrients because you are

2617
01:35:43,039 --> 01:35:48,079
removing those storage houses when you

2618
01:35:45,198 --> 01:35:48,799
strip them all away from the plant yeah

2619
01:35:48,079 --> 01:35:51,359
totally

2620
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:52,639
so so let's take a step back i realized

2621
01:35:51,359 --> 01:35:53,279
we didn't go over and i really want to

2622
01:35:52,639 --> 01:35:54,960
know

2623
01:35:53,279 --> 01:35:56,479
the albert walker itself it's an

2624
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:58,399
interesting strain it's a bit of an

2625
01:35:56,479 --> 01:36:02,319
enigma no one can tell me too much about

2626
01:35:58,399 --> 01:36:02,319
it and no one ever has any to smoke

2627
01:36:02,399 --> 01:36:09,279
sure so the albert walker

2628
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:12,079
that we had in the mid

2629
01:36:09,279 --> 01:36:12,439
2000s was a very finicky plant but had

2630
01:36:12,079 --> 01:36:15,519
this

2631
01:36:12,439 --> 01:36:18,719
incredible kind of

2632
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:21,520
combination of like a

2633
01:36:18,719 --> 01:36:22,560
rose note like from roses you know a

2634
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:24,719
very floral

2635
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:27,039
sweet rose note but with this crazy kind

2636
01:36:24,719 --> 01:36:30,319
of garlic funk

2637
01:36:27,039 --> 01:36:33,600
as well so it was like yeah

2638
01:36:30,319 --> 01:36:36,639
it was a very very strange and and

2639
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:38,800
and you know interesting plant to me

2640
01:36:36,639 --> 01:36:40,480
it was a bit finicky so i didn't run it

2641
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:44,400
for very long

2642
01:36:40,479 --> 01:36:46,238
um but it it just yeah it just had such

2643
01:36:44,399 --> 01:36:48,719
this clash of

2644
01:36:46,238 --> 01:36:49,678
noses on it that it was just it was just

2645
01:36:48,719 --> 01:36:52,880
remarkable

2646
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:56,158
the high was decent it wasn't

2647
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:58,800
uh stupendous or anything like that but

2648
01:36:56,158 --> 01:37:01,198
the the it was the flavor that really

2649
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:04,719
got me and it's that unmistakable

2650
01:37:01,198 --> 01:37:06,399
rose note with that garlic kind of

2651
01:37:04,719 --> 01:37:08,239
buried in there that just it just gets

2652
01:37:06,399 --> 01:37:11,279
me every time and you know what

2653
01:37:08,238 --> 01:37:12,879
i haven't seen it for years i've seen a

2654
01:37:11,279 --> 01:37:14,319
lot of things come through i've actually

2655
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:16,319
had a lot of folks because i've

2656
01:37:14,319 --> 01:37:17,920
at one point was kind of in this

2657
01:37:16,319 --> 01:37:20,158
headspace of

2658
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:21,199
getting back to the root genetics of dog

2659
01:37:20,158 --> 01:37:23,279
walker

2660
01:37:21,198 --> 01:37:24,879
and so a couple years ago i went on a

2661
01:37:23,279 --> 01:37:28,559
hunt for

2662
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:28,560
the albert walker and

2663
01:37:28,719 --> 01:37:34,639
i don't know three or four different

2664
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:35,679
specimens have been brought to me and

2665
01:37:34,639 --> 01:37:37,760
none of them

2666
01:37:35,679 --> 01:37:39,359
none of them were there none of them

2667
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:41,440
were it

2668
01:37:39,359 --> 01:37:43,039
so i i don't you know i'm sure it is

2669
01:37:41,439 --> 01:37:44,559
still in existence

2670
01:37:43,039 --> 01:37:46,639
i hear a lot of folks kind of on the

2671
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:49,199
west there's a crew on the west side

2672
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:50,239
of our area that runs albert walker

2673
01:37:49,198 --> 01:37:52,638
pretty heavy

2674
01:37:50,238 --> 01:37:53,678
but um i've yet to see what they're

2675
01:37:52,639 --> 01:37:55,440
producing

2676
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:56,800
so yeah it's kind of and it is it's a

2677
01:37:55,439 --> 01:37:57,839
bit of an enigma string because i think

2678
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:00,480
there's a lot of

2679
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:02,319
impostors out there it's just like chem

2680
01:38:00,479 --> 01:38:03,519
you know there's so many impostors out

2681
01:38:02,319 --> 01:38:06,319
there

2682
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:08,080
um finding getting to the to the you

2683
01:38:06,319 --> 01:38:10,639
know to the origin to the real

2684
01:38:08,079 --> 01:38:12,800
to that real cut can be a very a very

2685
01:38:10,639 --> 01:38:15,359
daunting task

2686
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:17,760
and so do you give any credence to the

2687
01:38:15,359 --> 01:38:19,599
current online story which says that

2688
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:21,440
you know originates from the grateful

2689
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:22,320
dead i think it says roadie crew i'm

2690
01:38:21,439 --> 01:38:23,839
doubtful on that

2691
01:38:22,319 --> 01:38:25,599
but you know like some kind of grateful

2692
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:27,440
dead genesis do you think that's true

2693
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:28,239
and it also says that the suspected

2694
01:38:27,439 --> 01:38:31,839
genetics are

2695
01:38:28,238 --> 01:38:35,439
afghan skunk

2696
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:37,840
yeah i you know look we have a lot of

2697
01:38:35,439 --> 01:38:40,238
incredible genetics came out of the

2698
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:43,440
grateful dead scene that's for sure

2699
01:38:40,238 --> 01:38:45,678
um you know there's uh

2700
01:38:43,439 --> 01:38:47,678
there's loads of stories we can tell but

2701
01:38:45,679 --> 01:38:49,840
uh yeah i i do buy into the

2702
01:38:47,679 --> 01:38:50,880
you know i buy into the northwest origin

2703
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:53,520
of it i

2704
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:55,039
buy into the that it was something that

2705
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:56,639
evolved out of the grateful dead scene

2706
01:38:55,039 --> 01:38:59,920
now whether it was the roadie crew

2707
01:38:56,639 --> 01:39:02,960
or someone else who really knows uh

2708
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:07,679
and you said swazi skunk uh sorry

2709
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:07,679
afghan skunk oh an afghan skunk

2710
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:12,320
hmm not as interesting as swazi skunk

2711
01:39:11,039 --> 01:39:14,158
no that was just kind of thanks why this

2712
01:39:12,319 --> 01:39:15,759
gun sounds great yeah i mean i could

2713
01:39:14,158 --> 01:39:17,359
i could see that i mean it was

2714
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:19,360
definitely a squatter plant

2715
01:39:17,359 --> 01:39:21,118
um what was really remarkable to me is

2716
01:39:19,359 --> 01:39:24,319
this very light colored uh

2717
01:39:21,118 --> 01:39:26,639
green almost like a pale green it was

2718
01:39:24,319 --> 01:39:27,439
never really a super dark robust plant

2719
01:39:26,639 --> 01:39:28,719
for us

2720
01:39:27,439 --> 01:39:30,559
you know that could have been part of

2721
01:39:28,719 --> 01:39:32,000
its finickiness and that's at that time

2722
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:33,920
not being able to really dial it in

2723
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:37,520
nutrient-wise

2724
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:39,359
but it uh you know it

2725
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:41,040
yeah i think it gets its origin from the

2726
01:39:39,359 --> 01:39:43,198
grateful dead scene i

2727
01:39:41,039 --> 01:39:44,639
i don't doubt that at all it's

2728
01:39:43,198 --> 01:39:45,519
interesting because it's certainly gone

2729
01:39:44,639 --> 01:39:47,359
on to make

2730
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:49,199
you know a wide variety of well-known

2731
01:39:47,359 --> 01:39:50,479
strains but if we just take a bit of a

2732
01:39:49,198 --> 01:39:52,719
step forward to

2733
01:39:50,479 --> 01:39:54,399
after you've made the dog walker og

2734
01:39:52,719 --> 01:39:56,960
let's get into the scoobies

2735
01:39:54,399 --> 01:39:58,799
at what point did it become you know a

2736
01:39:56,960 --> 01:40:00,719
thought in your mind to cross dog walker

2737
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:04,800
with the cookies

2738
01:40:00,719 --> 01:40:06,560
so that came out of my cookie experience

2739
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:08,159
and it was very interesting with cookies

2740
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:11,199
for me um

2741
01:40:08,158 --> 01:40:12,000
so i was running the forum cut this is

2742
01:40:11,198 --> 01:40:15,279
going to sound

2743
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:18,479
really hard to to believe but if i

2744
01:40:15,279 --> 01:40:21,759
only ran one plant in the room

2745
01:40:18,479 --> 01:40:24,879
one cookie plant it would always produce

2746
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:25,600
a tiny male cluster on one of the bottom

2747
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:28,239
branches

2748
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:29,920
just one though the first time it

2749
01:40:28,238 --> 01:40:31,359
happened i thought it was a phenomenon

2750
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:33,118
the second time it happened it made me

2751
01:40:31,359 --> 01:40:35,359
pay attention and the third time it

2752
01:40:33,118 --> 01:40:38,960
happened i did it intentionally

2753
01:40:35,359 --> 01:40:42,559
and so it was the pollen

2754
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:46,800
from that forum cut that i

2755
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:49,119
used on that second event

2756
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:50,000
to pollinate the dog walker because i

2757
01:40:49,118 --> 01:40:52,479
thought to myself

2758
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:54,238
well here's this how cool would it be to

2759
01:40:52,479 --> 01:40:58,479
have all these purples and stuff

2760
01:40:54,238 --> 01:41:02,799
wrapped up in dog walker and

2761
01:40:58,479 --> 01:41:04,959
um i it was it was a risk

2762
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:06,320
for me i didn't want though to create

2763
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:08,158
like another

2764
01:41:06,319 --> 01:41:09,759
cookie plant you know what i mean like i

2765
01:41:08,158 --> 01:41:10,238
didn't want to be like grow you know

2766
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:12,239
grow like

2767
01:41:10,238 --> 01:41:13,678
that cookie structure just drives me

2768
01:41:12,238 --> 01:41:16,479
crazy

2769
01:41:13,679 --> 01:41:17,199
so at the time i actually pollinated

2770
01:41:16,479 --> 01:41:19,439
with that

2771
01:41:17,198 --> 01:41:20,960
that little bit of male with that little

2772
01:41:19,439 --> 01:41:24,000
cluster that it developed

2773
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:25,279
dusted a dog walker plant and then also

2774
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:27,359
at the time i was running

2775
01:41:25,279 --> 01:41:29,279
a cotton candy kush and dusted a cotton

2776
01:41:27,359 --> 01:41:31,359
candy coach plant as well with it

2777
01:41:29,279 --> 01:41:33,920
and once again just using you know

2778
01:41:31,359 --> 01:41:36,000
collected pollen in a small container

2779
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:37,039
little paint brush you know short

2780
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:39,760
bristles

2781
01:41:37,039 --> 01:41:40,800
just painting it on and we ended up oh

2782
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:44,239
gosh what did i have

2783
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:48,719
probably close to 100

2784
01:41:44,238 --> 01:41:48,718
150 of the scooby seeds

2785
01:41:49,039 --> 01:41:52,800
and how many of those still exist

2786
01:41:53,039 --> 01:41:58,960
probably about 60 at this point

2787
01:41:57,118 --> 01:42:01,519
yeah i mean a lot of them went out for a

2788
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:03,198
big fino hunt this summer out at heroes

2789
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:06,000
of the farm

2790
01:42:03,198 --> 01:42:06,559
and unfortunately a lot of those were

2791
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:09,439
lost

2792
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:10,480
to a mouse issue when they were still

2793
01:42:09,439 --> 01:42:14,000
young and

2794
01:42:10,479 --> 01:42:14,559
tender a couple flats i think that

2795
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:17,118
chewed up

2796
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:19,600
at some point but uh there were some

2797
01:42:17,118 --> 01:42:22,399
others that were explored this summer

2798
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:23,679
uh which i've yet to i saw them right as

2799
01:42:22,399 --> 01:42:25,118
they were finishing when they were still

2800
01:42:23,679 --> 01:42:28,239
in the greenhouse

2801
01:42:25,118 --> 01:42:30,479
but um you know the the original is a

2802
01:42:28,238 --> 01:42:32,879
hard one to beat and originally i had

2803
01:42:30,479 --> 01:42:34,879
two different phenos the one that i kept

2804
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:36,719
and the other one wasn't very stable so

2805
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:38,719
i called it the scrappy dew

2806
01:42:36,719 --> 01:42:40,239
yeah little tongue and cheek there and

2807
01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:42,000
that got actually passed on to some

2808
01:42:40,238 --> 01:42:43,839
folks and they did whatever they did

2809
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:45,279
with it and it still kind of pops up

2810
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:48,560
around town here

2811
01:42:45,279 --> 01:42:50,639
you know off and on but the the scooby

2812
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:53,039
that was selected and there's really

2813
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:53,039
kind of a

2814
01:42:53,279 --> 01:42:58,559
kind of a heartwarming story that

2815
01:42:56,479 --> 01:43:00,479
that from that one so you know that

2816
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:02,080
original the one that i liked so the

2817
01:43:00,479 --> 01:43:03,198
reason i liked is that the flower was

2818
01:43:02,079 --> 01:43:04,960
more

2819
01:43:03,198 --> 01:43:06,559
structure wise was a little more dog

2820
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:08,158
walker dominant

2821
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:10,639
it had all the it had some of the cookie

2822
01:43:08,158 --> 01:43:10,960
coloring in it and then it just had this

2823
01:43:10,639 --> 01:43:14,000
just

2824
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:16,719
extremely offensive nose and

2825
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:18,319
i passed it off to a co-worker of mine

2826
01:43:16,719 --> 01:43:20,239
for safe keeping because i was running

2827
01:43:18,319 --> 01:43:21,920
out of room and i just i couldn't

2828
01:43:20,238 --> 01:43:23,599
i was exploring other stuff at the same

2829
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:24,800
time so i said you know hey can you hold

2830
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:30,159
this for me

2831
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:34,960
and um the co-worker

2832
01:43:30,158 --> 01:43:38,799
passed away in an untimely time

2833
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:40,399
and when that happened a small group of

2834
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:43,679
us went over to his house

2835
01:43:40,399 --> 01:43:45,439
before his family arrived to clean up

2836
01:43:43,679 --> 01:43:46,800
the garden so that wouldn't be something

2837
01:43:45,439 --> 01:43:48,158
they would have to deal with because

2838
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:49,520
maybe they didn't know he had a garden

2839
01:43:48,158 --> 01:43:52,719
or something

2840
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:54,880
and so we get over there and

2841
01:43:52,719 --> 01:43:56,000
i walk into the room and i see the

2842
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:59,520
scooby plant can't

2843
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:00,719
plant over in the corner and i kind of

2844
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:02,159
looked around there's a couple other

2845
01:44:00,719 --> 01:44:03,359
people there and i grabbed a pair of

2846
01:44:02,158 --> 01:44:06,559
scissors

2847
01:44:03,359 --> 01:44:08,479
and i cut i don't know maybe a dozen

2848
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:10,719
cuttings and wrapped them up with a wet

2849
01:44:08,479 --> 01:44:13,678
paper towel and threw them in a ziploc

2850
01:44:10,719 --> 01:44:14,719
and then i just just massacred what was

2851
01:44:13,679 --> 01:44:16,000
left of that plant

2852
01:44:14,719 --> 01:44:17,840
because i didn't want anybody else to

2853
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:21,520
get it and

2854
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:25,039
i took those clones back to my house

2855
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:26,719
and uh called my friend pat who's a

2856
01:44:25,039 --> 01:44:28,800
guy who started piers of the farm and i

2857
01:44:26,719 --> 01:44:29,760
said hey you know i have these cuts that

2858
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:31,760
i got from

2859
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:33,440
my buddy's house and i need them to go

2860
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:34,960
somewhere safe

2861
01:44:33,439 --> 01:44:37,039
and pat says oh yeah you know i'll come

2862
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:38,480
and get him and pat actually took him

2863
01:44:37,039 --> 01:44:40,639
back to his house

2864
01:44:38,479 --> 01:44:41,599
and kind of forgot about him i think for

2865
01:44:40,639 --> 01:44:44,880
almost a week

2866
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:46,000
maybe 10 days and when he finally

2867
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:47,440
remembered they were in the back of his

2868
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,800
fridge he's like oh [ __ ] those cuts were

2869
01:44:47,439 --> 01:44:52,158
in there and he actually got

2870
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:56,239
i think two of them to root so

2871
01:44:52,158 --> 01:44:59,279
you know out of great tragedy came

2872
01:44:56,238 --> 01:45:01,678
something phenomenal i think you know

2873
01:44:59,279 --> 01:45:03,439
it's uh and those guys out at heroes

2874
01:45:01,679 --> 01:45:05,440
were very good to keep that strain

2875
01:45:03,439 --> 01:45:08,638
you know interestingly enough i actually

2876
01:45:05,439 --> 01:45:12,399
just got it back for the first time

2877
01:45:08,639 --> 01:45:13,359
about three three and a half months ago

2878
01:45:12,399 --> 01:45:15,599
now

2879
01:45:13,359 --> 01:45:17,599
so i haven't run it in all in all these

2880
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:19,440
years since that very first

2881
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:21,039
run and then passing it on to the

2882
01:45:19,439 --> 01:45:22,319
co-worker and eventually passing it on

2883
01:45:21,039 --> 01:45:24,319
to heroes

2884
01:45:22,319 --> 01:45:25,439
wow what a what kind of journey it's

2885
01:45:24,319 --> 01:45:28,840
taken

2886
01:45:25,439 --> 01:45:30,479
yes it has and uh she wears her badge as

2887
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:33,039
well

2888
01:45:30,479 --> 01:45:34,638
so let's take a step back for a moment

2889
01:45:33,039 --> 01:45:36,000
i'm gonna play devil's advocate throw

2890
01:45:34,639 --> 01:45:37,840
you in the hot seat

2891
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:39,039
i think you think archive knew what he

2892
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:45,440
was doing

2893
01:45:39,039 --> 01:45:49,039
you know what i mean

2894
01:45:45,439 --> 01:45:49,839
you know i i i have a lot of respect for

2895
01:45:49,039 --> 01:45:51,359
those guys

2896
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:53,520
they're phenomenal breeders they're

2897
01:45:51,359 --> 01:45:54,880
phenomenal growers they do a lot of good

2898
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:57,760
work

2899
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:58,639
the you know he's a fletcher's a fellow

2900
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:00,719
virginian

2901
01:45:58,639 --> 01:46:03,760
so i've got mad respect for that as well

2902
01:46:00,719 --> 01:46:03,760
there's another one for you

2903
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:07,039
i i i

2904
01:46:07,198 --> 01:46:11,039
it's very interesting to me because so

2905
01:46:09,198 --> 01:46:12,158
we had it working pretty heavily through

2906
01:46:11,039 --> 01:46:15,198
the dispensary system

2907
01:46:12,158 --> 01:46:18,559
here in portland and eugene

2908
01:46:15,198 --> 01:46:21,039
oregon in general and

2909
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:23,119
you know i was doing i would always do

2910
01:46:21,039 --> 01:46:23,519
searches to make sure it wasn't showing

2911
01:46:23,118 --> 01:46:25,279
up

2912
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:26,880
you know in other people's gardens and

2913
01:46:25,279 --> 01:46:28,079
stuff like that because that was another

2914
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:30,639
one that we were trying to keep

2915
01:46:28,079 --> 01:46:32,000
you know super kind of contained and

2916
01:46:30,639 --> 01:46:34,400
i'll never forget the day

2917
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:35,198
that i looked up and leafly had scooby

2918
01:46:34,399 --> 01:46:37,279
snacks

2919
01:46:35,198 --> 01:46:38,238
whoa what is this and then i go onto the

2920
01:46:37,279 --> 01:46:40,559
leafly page

2921
01:46:38,238 --> 01:46:42,479
and i'm like oh this isn't right and of

2922
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:44,239
course a lot of the comments that

2923
01:46:42,479 --> 01:46:46,158
short were shortly you know thereafter

2924
01:46:44,238 --> 01:46:48,158
to follow were like oh we thought this

2925
01:46:46,158 --> 01:46:51,359
was this and not that and

2926
01:46:48,158 --> 01:46:54,319
you know to me at that point of time

2927
01:46:51,359 --> 01:46:55,599
the my biggest concern was you know if

2928
01:46:54,319 --> 01:46:58,158
someone went you know had

2929
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:59,760
tried one version and then went and

2930
01:46:58,158 --> 01:47:02,000
bought seeds of another version and

2931
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:03,840
didn't get anything that was close

2932
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:05,520
you know how's that person going to feel

2933
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:07,760
as a customer

2934
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:08,560
and so you know i was a little concerned

2935
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:10,000
at that point

2936
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:11,840
and you know there was a point in time

2937
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:14,399
where i was probably a little

2938
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:15,920
you know more hyped up about it than i

2939
01:47:14,399 --> 01:47:17,118
am now i mean at this point it's water

2940
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:19,760
under the bridge and

2941
01:47:17,118 --> 01:47:23,439
i think uh i i finally actually got to

2942
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:25,520
see some of the archive scooby snacks uh

2943
01:47:23,439 --> 01:47:27,359
last year and you know it's a good

2944
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:29,600
strain uh of course they have

2945
01:47:27,359 --> 01:47:30,960
i i know they have some you know other

2946
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:32,560
ones that

2947
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:33,679
that that one pales in comparison when

2948
01:47:32,560 --> 01:47:35,520
you compare them to somebody who's

2949
01:47:33,679 --> 01:47:38,480
really really high-end stuff

2950
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:40,239
but um it's you know i i don't know you

2951
01:47:38,479 --> 01:47:40,959
know that the purist in me wants to

2952
01:47:40,238 --> 01:47:43,519
think that

2953
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:46,480
or the the purest the lover in me wants

2954
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:50,400
to think that it was just happenstance

2955
01:47:46,479 --> 01:47:53,039
the industry side of me says you know

2956
01:47:50,399 --> 01:47:54,479
perhaps there was you know a little

2957
01:47:53,039 --> 01:47:56,000
advantage taken up there

2958
01:47:54,479 --> 01:47:57,519
but i don't know you know we've never

2959
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:59,840
had the conversation

2960
01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:01,440
uh we've met briefly a couple times like

2961
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:04,159
i said i have a lot of respect for what

2962
01:48:01,439 --> 01:48:07,839
the guy what those guys do there

2963
01:48:04,158 --> 01:48:09,839
um but you know what really kind of

2964
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:11,679
settled me on it was when i went to the

2965
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:15,679
emerald cup two years ago

2966
01:48:11,679 --> 01:48:18,319
in 2016 and at that point i was

2967
01:48:15,679 --> 01:48:19,679
a little more concerned and you know

2968
01:48:18,319 --> 01:48:22,880
everyone that i met

2969
01:48:19,679 --> 01:48:26,319
there knew

2970
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:28,560
the one eye version so yeah that

2971
01:48:26,319 --> 01:48:30,559
kind of made me feel good you know and

2972
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:31,119
it calmed me down a bit and you know

2973
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:32,960
they

2974
01:48:31,118 --> 01:48:34,639
so the people to me that you know that

2975
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:38,239
eventually would matter

2976
01:48:34,639 --> 01:48:40,239
um they knew which one

2977
01:48:38,238 --> 01:48:41,279
so you know it's so it's hard to it's

2978
01:48:40,238 --> 01:48:43,279
it's it's hard to

2979
01:48:41,279 --> 01:48:44,479
i don't want to guess and like i said i

2980
01:48:43,279 --> 01:48:47,039
don't want to

2981
01:48:44,479 --> 01:48:48,158
uh you know what i mean like i i want to

2982
01:48:47,039 --> 01:48:49,279
i kind of want to play switzerland on

2983
01:48:48,158 --> 01:48:50,479
this one because like i said there's a

2984
01:48:49,279 --> 01:48:51,519
part of me that believes one thing

2985
01:48:50,479 --> 01:48:52,238
there's other side that believes

2986
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:55,040
something else

2987
01:48:52,238 --> 01:48:56,879
and at this point i'm going with the the

2988
01:48:55,039 --> 01:48:59,198
do right person

2989
01:48:56,880 --> 01:49:00,079
yeah i know what you mean the way i see

2990
01:48:59,198 --> 01:49:02,399
the situation

2991
01:49:00,079 --> 01:49:04,399
i just think if you do boil it down the

2992
01:49:02,399 --> 01:49:06,079
genetics do seem really similar

2993
01:49:04,399 --> 01:49:08,000
although dog walk is not the same as the

2994
01:49:06,079 --> 01:49:10,000
face-off still kind of like og to

2995
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:12,800
cookies it's still kind of similar thing

2996
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:13,359
and the big thing that i noted is oregon

2997
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:16,400
above

2998
01:49:13,359 --> 01:49:17,118
other places in my opinion has very much

2999
01:49:16,399 --> 01:49:19,198
kind of like

3000
01:49:17,118 --> 01:49:20,880
um like you know there's there's cult

3001
01:49:19,198 --> 01:49:23,598
followings the j1

3002
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:25,359
the blue magoo and scooby snacks you

3003
01:49:23,599 --> 01:49:26,719
know so i i would find it hard to

3004
01:49:25,359 --> 01:49:27,279
believe that he wasn't aware of the

3005
01:49:26,719 --> 01:49:30,000
strain

3006
01:49:27,279 --> 01:49:31,920
given that it is a cult-followed one

3007
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:33,679
oregon has that culture of

3008
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:35,679
locking onto a few strains and really

3009
01:49:33,679 --> 01:49:37,440
loving them and so i i just tend to

3010
01:49:35,679 --> 01:49:39,199
think that it would be very hard for him

3011
01:49:37,439 --> 01:49:41,198
to have not been aware

3012
01:49:39,198 --> 01:49:42,960
well and and if you and i'll just say

3013
01:49:41,198 --> 01:49:43,598
one little thing one of the names when

3014
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:48,079
you look at the

3015
01:49:43,599 --> 01:49:48,079
lineage is serendipitous yeah

3016
01:49:48,158 --> 01:49:54,238
okay we'll leave it at that yep so

3017
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:56,159
this you know very loosely touches on

3018
01:49:54,238 --> 01:49:57,759
the idea of ownership

3019
01:49:56,158 --> 01:49:59,519
what does the ownership of a plant mean

3020
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:01,119
to you when do you get ownership of a

3021
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:02,880
plant when do you have to stop

3022
01:50:01,118 --> 01:50:05,439
listening to other people in regards to

3023
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:07,840
what you want to do with the plant

3024
01:50:05,439 --> 01:50:10,960
yeah i mean my experience with dog

3025
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:12,639
walker taught me a lot about that

3026
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:14,239
there was a point of time for the first

3027
01:50:12,639 --> 01:50:17,039
couple years where

3028
01:50:14,238 --> 01:50:18,399
i was obsessed with you know contacting

3029
01:50:17,039 --> 01:50:20,960
people who claimed they were

3030
01:50:18,399 --> 01:50:21,439
you know they had clones of it and you

3031
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:22,560
know because

3032
01:50:21,439 --> 01:50:24,638
at that point it was trying to figure

3033
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:26,560
out how did this leak out how did it get

3034
01:50:24,639 --> 01:50:28,480
outside our small group of eight and you

3035
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:31,039
know over time you eventually find out

3036
01:50:28,479 --> 01:50:32,559
the cracks in the wall occur but you

3037
01:50:31,039 --> 01:50:35,519
know it's

3038
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:38,239
the ownership thing to me it's it's a

3039
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:41,280
tough subject because

3040
01:50:38,238 --> 01:50:41,279
as a breeder

3041
01:50:41,439 --> 01:50:46,879
you know i i don't necessarily all

3042
01:50:44,639 --> 01:50:48,480
you know want to forever profit off my

3043
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:50,840
work but at least want to you know just

3044
01:50:48,479 --> 01:50:54,799
be known for for what i've done

3045
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:55,440
and to me you know if you've created

3046
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:58,079
something

3047
01:50:55,439 --> 01:50:59,678
and you're using you know for example if

3048
01:50:58,079 --> 01:51:01,679
i'm going to be breeding with something

3049
01:50:59,679 --> 01:51:04,399
i'm not going to necessarily release it

3050
01:51:01,679 --> 01:51:06,000
you know at that time because i want to

3051
01:51:04,399 --> 01:51:08,399
work with it and kind of hold it back

3052
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:11,118
but you know look some of these amazing

3053
01:51:08,399 --> 01:51:14,879
genetics that are out there

3054
01:51:11,118 --> 01:51:15,359
get you know start off in this amazing

3055
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:18,159
realm

3056
01:51:15,359 --> 01:51:19,039
and then just kind of get played out for

3057
01:51:18,158 --> 01:51:21,000
one reason

3058
01:51:19,039 --> 01:51:22,479
or another and i don't know because it's

3059
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:24,800
overpopulated the

3060
01:51:22,479 --> 01:51:26,079
you know the cannabis scene or what and

3061
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:28,960
then some of them you know

3062
01:51:26,079 --> 01:51:31,279
are still major players and you know the

3063
01:51:28,960 --> 01:51:35,279
industry never gets tired of them

3064
01:51:31,279 --> 01:51:39,599
so you know on the ownership tip it's uh

3065
01:51:35,279 --> 01:51:42,079
you know it depends on i guess what the

3066
01:51:39,599 --> 01:51:43,599
you know and i'm very you know

3067
01:51:42,079 --> 01:51:45,679
intellectual property is something

3068
01:51:43,599 --> 01:51:48,719
to me that's very important moving

3069
01:51:45,679 --> 01:51:49,679
forward in this industry especially for

3070
01:51:48,719 --> 01:51:52,960
those who are

3071
01:51:49,679 --> 01:51:53,599
are creating these genetics um i think

3072
01:51:52,960 --> 01:51:55,279
that there

3073
01:51:53,599 --> 01:51:57,119
you know i wish there was some way for

3074
01:51:55,279 --> 01:51:57,599
someone to protect it uh you know

3075
01:51:57,118 --> 01:51:59,839
there's

3076
01:51:57,599 --> 01:52:01,279
if you think about something you know

3077
01:51:59,840 --> 01:52:02,880
think about all the folks who have

3078
01:52:01,279 --> 01:52:05,198
profited off of

3079
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:07,118
you know chem dog and chem dog crosses

3080
01:52:05,198 --> 01:52:08,960
but you know the guy who originally

3081
01:52:07,118 --> 01:52:10,238
you know cracks the seeds doesn't get

3082
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:11,760
jack squat from it

3083
01:52:10,238 --> 01:52:14,479
and there's folks out there that made

3084
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:16,960
millions off of those crosses

3085
01:52:14,479 --> 01:52:17,678
so you know if there was a if there was

3086
01:52:16,960 --> 01:52:21,599
a

3087
01:52:17,679 --> 01:52:23,679
easy foreseeable way for folks to stake

3088
01:52:21,599 --> 01:52:25,279
ownership and now that it's become more

3089
01:52:23,679 --> 01:52:28,239
commercialized i think that's more

3090
01:52:25,279 --> 01:52:31,198
important than it was maybe in the past

3091
01:52:28,238 --> 01:52:32,959
uh but what i don't want is for you know

3092
01:52:31,198 --> 01:52:36,719
all these breeders to have done

3093
01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:37,439
these amazing you know projects with

3094
01:52:36,719 --> 01:52:39,279
genetics

3095
01:52:37,439 --> 01:52:40,719
and then all to have it swooped up in

3096
01:52:39,279 --> 01:52:42,800
the future by

3097
01:52:40,719 --> 01:52:44,000
some corporate giant that's figured out

3098
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:47,760
a way to get a utility

3099
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:49,439
patent okay and so what if we simplify

3100
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:50,159
that a little bit because i understand

3101
01:52:49,439 --> 01:52:51,678
it's a

3102
01:52:50,158 --> 01:52:53,839
it's a little bit of a complex issue in

3103
01:52:51,679 --> 01:52:55,118
the way i outlined it what if we make it

3104
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:56,560
a bit more simpler and it's we're

3105
01:52:55,118 --> 01:52:58,639
talking about seeds you

3106
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:59,840
purchase so not just like you know in

3107
01:52:58,639 --> 01:53:01,279
the case of the dog walk

3108
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:02,400
you know it was a bit of a complex issue

3109
01:53:01,279 --> 01:53:03,840
because it was given out under these

3110
01:53:02,399 --> 01:53:05,839
specific conditions but what if you just

3111
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:07,520
bought seeds from someone you don't know

3112
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:09,039
you know is that it as far as you're

3113
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:10,239
concerned

3114
01:53:09,039 --> 01:53:12,719
he's a free-for-all whatever you want to

3115
01:53:10,238 --> 01:53:15,919
do at that point yeah i mean

3116
01:53:12,719 --> 01:53:17,679
i actually so when i grab seeds from

3117
01:53:15,920 --> 01:53:19,599
different seed from different breeders

3118
01:53:17,679 --> 01:53:22,719
you know at events like the emerald cup

3119
01:53:19,599 --> 01:53:25,279
i'm i'm i'm up front about and asking

3120
01:53:22,719 --> 01:53:27,679
say hey do you mind if i breed with this

3121
01:53:25,279 --> 01:53:29,439
to me that is a very important question

3122
01:53:27,679 --> 01:53:33,440
for me to ask

3123
01:53:29,439 --> 01:53:36,079
and although i've rarely had anyone ask

3124
01:53:33,439 --> 01:53:38,319
me about that about any of my genetics

3125
01:53:36,079 --> 01:53:40,158
some have come forward and asked and i

3126
01:53:38,319 --> 01:53:41,439
think that's kind of doing the do-right

3127
01:53:40,158 --> 01:53:44,319
rule

3128
01:53:41,439 --> 01:53:45,678
so i i you know i think it is something

3129
01:53:44,319 --> 01:53:48,799
that

3130
01:53:45,679 --> 01:53:50,800
if there is uh a virtual

3131
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:52,400
like online relationship an existing

3132
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:55,679
personal relationship

3133
01:53:52,399 --> 01:53:58,799
with the purveyor of the seed

3134
01:53:55,679 --> 01:54:00,880
i you know i i think if you're trying to

3135
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:03,119
to do right in this industry it's a

3136
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:05,679
conversation that you should have

3137
01:54:03,118 --> 01:54:06,639
as a breeder you know uh do you mind if

3138
01:54:05,679 --> 01:54:08,880
i work with your

3139
01:54:06,639 --> 01:54:10,239
work with your you know genetics now i'm

3140
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:12,319
going to create something new i'm not

3141
01:54:10,238 --> 01:54:16,000
going to redo what you've done

3142
01:54:12,319 --> 01:54:19,118
right but so i i think it's

3143
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:22,319
it's in to me it's important

3144
01:54:19,118 --> 01:54:23,920
to have that conversation with a breeder

3145
01:54:22,319 --> 01:54:25,679
because you know sometimes people do get

3146
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:27,199
a little chat about

3147
01:54:25,679 --> 01:54:28,880
people breeding with their gear and

3148
01:54:27,198 --> 01:54:32,399
stuff like that and not

3149
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:33,920
you know kind of staking ownership and

3150
01:54:32,399 --> 01:54:37,039
not giving credit to

3151
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:37,359
the breeder of those root genetics so if

3152
01:54:37,039 --> 01:54:38,719
we

3153
01:54:37,359 --> 01:54:40,158
follow that same thought you know you

3154
01:54:38,719 --> 01:54:41,439
reference what you got at the emerald

3155
01:54:40,158 --> 01:54:44,238
cup and things like that

3156
01:54:41,439 --> 01:54:45,839
if we check your ig we can see nice

3157
01:54:44,238 --> 01:54:46,959
little stash from the most recent

3158
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:50,159
emerald cup

3159
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:53,760
what do you plan to pop first

3160
01:54:50,158 --> 01:54:56,000
so first is definitely the burmese

3161
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:58,400
landrace from coastal i'm going to be

3162
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:00,800
doing a mail hunt with that

3163
01:54:58,399 --> 01:55:03,359
and then i was actually just recently

3164
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:06,000
gifted some magnerosa

3165
01:55:03,359 --> 01:55:07,279
which is a brazilian from brazilian sea

3166
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:09,760
company magna rosa

3167
01:55:07,279 --> 01:55:11,359
land race i'm going to peel yeah peel

3168
01:55:09,760 --> 01:55:13,280
through some of those as well

3169
01:55:11,359 --> 01:55:15,039
right now i'm kind of on this i'm

3170
01:55:13,279 --> 01:55:16,719
actually not kind of i'm on a mail hunt

3171
01:55:15,039 --> 01:55:19,439
right now which i have to do

3172
01:55:16,719 --> 01:55:20,480
very very carefully in my small smaller

3173
01:55:19,439 --> 01:55:23,759
space

3174
01:55:20,479 --> 01:55:24,799
um but the other one that i would really

3175
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:28,079
be

3176
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:31,199
there was uh the

3177
01:55:28,079 --> 01:55:34,639
roadkill ganny uh from matt

3178
01:55:31,198 --> 01:55:36,158
ryan from riot seeds uh was also one

3179
01:55:34,639 --> 01:55:38,239
that i'm very interested in looking into

3180
01:55:36,158 --> 01:55:40,319
that that cut that comes out of the

3181
01:55:38,238 --> 01:55:41,519
uh they call it the heirloom afghani and

3182
01:55:40,319 --> 01:55:43,198
i think that comes out of the project

3183
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:44,400
that maybe he and bodhi did looking for

3184
01:55:43,198 --> 01:55:46,719
roadkill skunk through

3185
01:55:44,399 --> 01:55:48,238
all these various afghani seeds maybe

3186
01:55:46,719 --> 01:55:50,158
the i think it's like a nine-year

3187
01:55:48,238 --> 01:55:52,879
project or something like that

3188
01:55:50,158 --> 01:55:53,920
and um they finally came up with one

3189
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:55,599
that

3190
01:55:53,920 --> 01:55:57,039
truly is they feel it's the roadkill

3191
01:55:55,599 --> 01:55:58,480
skunk so uh

3192
01:55:57,039 --> 01:56:00,880
getting into that is going to be

3193
01:55:58,479 --> 01:56:02,559
interesting and uh

3194
01:56:00,880 --> 01:56:04,319
what was the other one i was going to do

3195
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:07,679
oh well just because i have to

3196
01:56:04,319 --> 01:56:10,479
they get the granny skunk from dominion

3197
01:56:07,679 --> 01:56:12,000
you have to yeah i have to yeah i can't

3198
01:56:10,479 --> 01:56:14,559
resist that one at all

3199
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,560
and then i've got

3200
01:56:15,599 --> 01:56:18,800
uh and then we've got a couple of them i

3201
01:56:17,840 --> 01:56:21,840
did a little breeding

3202
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:23,840
this past summer with uh pacquiao mail

3203
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:26,639
the pacquiao is one of the uh

3204
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:28,079
bob hempel crosses out at coastal yeah

3205
01:56:26,639 --> 01:56:29,118
you just stole my next question i was

3206
01:56:28,079 --> 01:56:30,960
gonna say

3207
01:56:29,118 --> 01:56:33,359
we also see you've been growing out the

3208
01:56:30,960 --> 01:56:35,198
puck yeah from our friend bob at coastal

3209
01:56:33,359 --> 01:56:37,039
how'd you find this line and more

3210
01:56:35,198 --> 01:56:38,719
interestingly in my opinion is

3211
01:56:37,039 --> 01:56:40,479
you know the puck or the skelly hash

3212
01:56:38,719 --> 01:56:42,079
plants quickly becoming one of the most

3213
01:56:40,479 --> 01:56:43,678
sought after cuts around

3214
01:56:42,079 --> 01:56:45,359
do you like it and do you think it lives

3215
01:56:43,679 --> 01:56:48,239
up to the hype in terms of what it

3216
01:56:45,359 --> 01:56:52,479
brought as a parent to the cross

3217
01:56:48,238 --> 01:56:55,198
okay so funny thing about the puck

3218
01:56:52,479 --> 01:56:57,118
so i know the puck from years in the

3219
01:56:55,198 --> 01:56:58,238
past and it was definitely very popular

3220
01:56:57,118 --> 01:57:00,319
with some of the

3221
01:56:58,238 --> 01:57:02,238
folks who were dealing with kim back in

3222
01:57:00,319 --> 01:57:04,158
the day the camden dog genetics and some

3223
01:57:02,238 --> 01:57:07,359
of the virginia guys too that i knew

3224
01:57:04,158 --> 01:57:10,399
uh very big up in new england and

3225
01:57:07,359 --> 01:57:13,759
when i at the emerald cup in 2016

3226
01:57:10,399 --> 01:57:16,719
uh i walked up to the coastal booth

3227
01:57:13,760 --> 01:57:17,119
and i saw that on their list and i it

3228
01:57:16,719 --> 01:57:21,198
was

3229
01:57:17,118 --> 01:57:21,920
the one of the guys behind the booth i

3230
01:57:21,198 --> 01:57:25,279
said oh

3231
01:57:21,920 --> 01:57:27,359
what do you guys know about the puck and

3232
01:57:25,279 --> 01:57:29,118
he said well let me get the guy who bred

3233
01:57:27,359 --> 01:57:31,839
it and come talk to you

3234
01:57:29,118 --> 01:57:33,598
i said okay and the guy comes up and

3235
01:57:31,840 --> 01:57:34,159
he's like oh he's like hey i hear you

3236
01:57:33,599 --> 01:57:36,560
want to

3237
01:57:34,158 --> 01:57:38,000
talk about the puck and i was like yeah

3238
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:39,440
you know i breed with some of the chem

3239
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,639
genetics you know this was real popular

3240
01:57:39,439 --> 01:57:42,319
in the chem family

3241
01:57:40,639 --> 01:57:43,760
yeti he's like yeah yeah yeah he's like

3242
01:57:42,319 --> 01:57:45,359
what chem genetics did you bring what

3243
01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:46,079
did you breed and i said oh well you

3244
01:57:45,359 --> 01:57:48,559
know i

3245
01:57:46,079 --> 01:57:50,719
read dog walker and the guy looks down

3246
01:57:48,560 --> 01:57:52,000
at me and he says

3247
01:57:50,719 --> 01:57:55,840
first words that come out of his mouth

3248
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:57,439
were dj rich dj is our mutual friend

3249
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:59,920
and i looked up in him and i said bob

3250
01:57:57,439 --> 01:58:01,039
hemphill so you hadn't seen bob in 15

3251
01:57:59,920 --> 01:58:04,158
years

3252
01:58:01,039 --> 01:58:06,399
yeah wow and so

3253
01:58:04,158 --> 01:58:07,439
you know back when i knew him dreads and

3254
01:58:06,399 --> 01:58:09,439
beard

3255
01:58:07,439 --> 01:58:11,759
you know he's a clean shave and i was

3256
01:58:09,439 --> 01:58:15,198
like holy crap so we had this kind of

3257
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:18,719
reintroduction after a 15-year gap

3258
01:58:15,198 --> 01:58:19,519
um and it was all over the puck and so

3259
01:58:18,719 --> 01:58:21,520
as far as

3260
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:23,360
the the puck you know living up to its

3261
01:58:21,520 --> 01:58:26,639
height

3262
01:58:23,359 --> 01:58:27,839
um i can certainly say that the kimovar

3263
01:58:26,639 --> 01:58:30,960
that i went with

3264
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:33,760
from the pacquiao definitely has that

3265
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:35,118
hash plant structure the way it grows

3266
01:58:33,760 --> 01:58:37,039
you know so you can get some really nice

3267
01:58:35,118 --> 01:58:39,759
nugs off of it but

3268
01:58:37,039 --> 01:58:40,399
it was heavily influenced from that nl1

3269
01:58:39,760 --> 01:58:43,199
male

3270
01:58:40,399 --> 01:58:44,238
the one i have has this kind of just

3271
01:58:43,198 --> 01:58:46,158
straight up just about

3272
01:58:44,238 --> 01:58:47,839
acetate nose to it it's almost like

3273
01:58:46,158 --> 01:58:50,479
rubber cement

3274
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:51,840
it's really really really intense now by

3275
01:58:50,479 --> 01:58:53,839
the look of it

3276
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:55,920
you know it's it's that kind of old hash

3277
01:58:53,840 --> 01:58:58,000
plant look it's not super frosty

3278
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:59,920
you know it's not caked and glistening

3279
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:03,039
but man the nose on that thing

3280
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:06,560
is just unmistakable so the

3281
01:59:03,039 --> 01:59:08,880
male that i went with actually had

3282
01:59:06,560 --> 01:59:10,960
the same growth very similar growth

3283
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:12,480
pattern to the female i selected

3284
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:15,039
and then as much as you can get out of

3285
01:59:12,479 --> 01:59:16,158
the stem rub just about spot on with

3286
01:59:15,039 --> 01:59:19,920
each other

3287
01:59:16,158 --> 01:59:22,719
so that male pollen was used uh

3288
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:24,079
this past summer on some stuff so some

3289
01:59:22,719 --> 01:59:25,118
new things coming down the pike from

3290
01:59:24,079 --> 01:59:28,000
that

3291
01:59:25,118 --> 01:59:29,598
but yeah that the puck the puck is uh is

3292
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:32,560
an amazing plant

3293
01:59:29,599 --> 01:59:35,199
uh bob hemphill's puck yeah is

3294
01:59:32,560 --> 01:59:35,199
definitely

3295
01:59:35,359 --> 01:59:40,319
out of this world at least what the one

3296
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:42,079
that i found and the actual the the

3297
01:59:40,319 --> 01:59:44,319
selection that i made when i brought it

3298
01:59:42,079 --> 01:59:46,399
to him uh this past year

3299
01:59:44,319 --> 01:59:47,759
at the emerald cup uh he was like he's

3300
01:59:46,399 --> 01:59:48,638
super stoked he's like i gotta come up

3301
01:59:47,760 --> 01:59:51,199
and get that cut

3302
01:59:48,639 --> 01:59:52,639
which i thought was kind of funny i

3303
01:59:51,198 --> 01:59:54,799
think i actually got to try some of it i

3304
01:59:52,639 --> 01:59:55,440
had almost like this watermelon vibe to

3305
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:57,920
it

3306
01:59:55,439 --> 01:59:59,759
okay so there was another one that has a

3307
01:59:57,920 --> 02:00:00,719
little more watermelon inside there was

3308
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:02,639
two

3309
02:00:00,719 --> 02:00:04,239
that i gave him and one has a little bit

3310
02:00:02,639 --> 02:00:07,039
and that one actually was not

3311
02:00:04,238 --> 02:00:08,000
super stable so i've i've unfortunately

3312
02:00:07,039 --> 02:00:10,399
i've scrapped

3313
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:11,118
that one the other one like i said is

3314
02:00:10,399 --> 02:00:12,879
just uh

3315
02:00:11,118 --> 02:00:14,960
it's almost it's just very interesting

3316
02:00:12,880 --> 02:00:16,159
like and i guess you know taking a step

3317
02:00:14,960 --> 02:00:17,439
back i guess you could get a little bit

3318
02:00:16,158 --> 02:00:19,839
of watermelon out of the

3319
02:00:17,439 --> 02:00:21,678
one we kept but uh that being said you

3320
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:24,639
know it's an amazing plant

3321
02:00:21,679 --> 02:00:26,158
uh it's super vigorous i can't say

3322
02:00:24,639 --> 02:00:29,359
enough good things about it

3323
02:00:26,158 --> 02:00:32,960
uh it's definitely uh become

3324
02:00:29,359 --> 02:00:34,639
one of my new favorites and i i can't

3325
02:00:32,960 --> 02:00:37,279
wait to explore some of these new

3326
02:00:34,639 --> 02:00:39,199
crosses that it's providing

3327
02:00:37,279 --> 02:00:41,039
so i don't know if you're purposely

3328
02:00:39,198 --> 02:00:43,118
trying to not spill the beans but what

3329
02:00:41,039 --> 02:00:47,359
crosses did you make

3330
02:00:43,118 --> 02:00:51,359
um so we did let's see here

3331
02:00:47,359 --> 02:00:54,719
so we did the pacquiao on the

3332
02:00:51,359 --> 02:00:57,920
kim four the pacquiao on the biz which

3333
02:00:54,719 --> 02:01:01,198
is a doc walker's sister we did pacquiao

3334
02:00:57,920 --> 02:01:05,039
on to dog walker we did pakia

3335
02:01:01,198 --> 02:01:08,079
on to the wook 3

3336
02:01:05,039 --> 02:01:10,238
which is the awok forum cut

3337
02:01:08,079 --> 02:01:12,238
those were the puck yeah dustings and

3338
02:01:10,238 --> 02:01:13,039
then we actually also worked with

3339
02:01:12,238 --> 02:01:15,519
another

3340
02:01:13,039 --> 02:01:16,319
male from another cross from bob

3341
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:18,480
hemphill

3342
02:01:16,319 --> 02:01:19,840
that was the fairfax four-way crossed

3343
02:01:18,479 --> 02:01:22,718
with south fork seeds

3344
02:01:19,840 --> 02:01:24,079
sirius which the sirius is basically

3345
02:01:22,719 --> 02:01:25,359
just a bunch of chems thrown back and

3346
02:01:24,079 --> 02:01:29,118
forth on each other

3347
02:01:25,359 --> 02:01:32,319
um so that we had a uh a four-way

3348
02:01:29,118 --> 02:01:35,359
mysterious stud that just just was

3349
02:01:32,319 --> 02:01:38,639
beautiful in structure and that one

3350
02:01:35,359 --> 02:01:41,598
it was uh used to actually

3351
02:01:38,639 --> 02:01:44,159
back cross or f2 and then that also went

3352
02:01:41,599 --> 02:01:46,239
on to the chem 4 as well

3353
02:01:44,158 --> 02:01:51,519
okay and so which one are you personally

3354
02:01:46,238 --> 02:01:54,158
most excited for

3355
02:01:51,520 --> 02:01:54,880
to be very blunt the biz in the puck

3356
02:01:54,158 --> 02:01:58,000
yeah

3357
02:01:54,880 --> 02:01:59,599
oh yeah that's yeah that's the one um

3358
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:01,599
you know the business this is dog

3359
02:01:59,599 --> 02:02:04,880
walker's sister and

3360
02:02:01,599 --> 02:02:08,560
she definitely yields a little more

3361
02:02:04,880 --> 02:02:11,199
she tests a little higher and there's

3362
02:02:08,560 --> 02:02:13,599
an incr there's once it cures out

3363
02:02:11,198 --> 02:02:16,158
there's this amazing amount of limonene

3364
02:02:13,599 --> 02:02:19,360
that comes out of that flower

3365
02:02:16,158 --> 02:02:22,319
um that's pretty spectacular uh

3366
02:02:19,359 --> 02:02:24,000
the gas is there the woodiness is there

3367
02:02:22,319 --> 02:02:25,198
although the gas and the woodiness seem

3368
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:27,599
to kind of flip-flop

3369
02:02:25,198 --> 02:02:29,759
on the biz you know on the dog walker i

3370
02:02:27,599 --> 02:02:32,000
feel like you get this like uh

3371
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:34,159
kind of uh cedar sandalwood on the

3372
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:35,118
inhale with you know loads of gas on the

3373
02:02:34,158 --> 02:02:36,960
exhale

3374
02:02:35,118 --> 02:02:38,559
and this one you get uh you know this

3375
02:02:36,960 --> 02:02:40,399
kind of gassy on the inhale with the

3376
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:42,320
cedar sandalwood finish but then there's

3377
02:02:40,399 --> 02:02:42,960
this limonene thing happening in there

3378
02:02:42,319 --> 02:02:46,799
that's

3379
02:02:42,960 --> 02:02:50,079
and once again it's one of those

3380
02:02:46,800 --> 02:02:52,560
strains that the layers from

3381
02:02:50,079 --> 02:02:53,599
a flavor evolve you know well after the

3382
02:02:52,560 --> 02:02:55,119
exhale

3383
02:02:53,599 --> 02:02:56,800
and once again you know something that

3384
02:02:55,118 --> 02:02:59,920
i'm always shooting for so

3385
02:02:56,800 --> 02:03:00,639
taking that that you know that that

3386
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:02,880
female

3387
02:03:00,639 --> 02:03:05,199
and then throwing in this very kind of

3388
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:07,599
accurate astringent note to it

3389
02:03:05,198 --> 02:03:09,118
uh i'm hoping the sky's the limit for

3390
02:03:07,599 --> 02:03:13,039
that one

3391
02:03:09,118 --> 02:03:13,519
awesome so if we just take a jump back

3392
02:03:13,039 --> 02:03:15,439
to

3393
02:03:13,520 --> 02:03:16,719
kind of some growing style questions

3394
02:03:15,439 --> 02:03:17,759
this is something i've been interested

3395
02:03:16,719 --> 02:03:19,439
in for a while

3396
02:03:17,760 --> 02:03:21,280
what do you think is kind of the

3397
02:03:19,439 --> 02:03:24,000
hierarchy or shall we just say the

3398
02:03:21,279 --> 02:03:26,079
the order you know the list of what

3399
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:27,118
needs to be mastered in terms of a

3400
02:03:26,079 --> 02:03:28,639
grower

3401
02:03:27,118 --> 02:03:30,158
i think the fundamental thing you first

3402
02:03:28,639 --> 02:03:32,079
have to do as a grower is

3403
02:03:30,158 --> 02:03:33,519
you have to learn to read the plan not

3404
02:03:32,079 --> 02:03:35,439
not on like the holistic level at like

3405
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:37,040
what a crazy good grower can do

3406
02:03:35,439 --> 02:03:38,719
but on the most simple level which is

3407
02:03:37,039 --> 02:03:40,238
like when does it need water

3408
02:03:38,719 --> 02:03:42,000
i think that's the first thing you learn

3409
02:03:40,238 --> 02:03:44,158
to visually tell and then then you go

3410
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:45,279
from there but anyway put put that in

3411
02:03:44,158 --> 02:03:46,879
the back your mind for the moment

3412
02:03:45,279 --> 02:03:48,479
what's your list you know what do you

3413
02:03:46,880 --> 02:03:50,000
think is the kind of the things you look

3414
02:03:48,479 --> 02:03:52,799
to master because the underlying

3415
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:54,158
kind of you know how should i say vein

3416
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:56,400
of this question is that

3417
02:03:54,158 --> 02:03:58,238
people seem to want to skip the basics

3418
02:03:56,399 --> 02:04:01,920
how do you see all of this

3419
02:03:58,238 --> 02:04:05,598
sure so i really

3420
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:08,639
believe that the foundation

3421
02:04:05,599 --> 02:04:10,400
to all of this begins with with

3422
02:04:08,639 --> 02:04:11,840
observation and you bring a very valid

3423
02:04:10,399 --> 02:04:12,559
point you know for example something as

3424
02:04:11,840 --> 02:04:14,639
simple as

3425
02:04:12,560 --> 02:04:16,320
when does the plant need water what does

3426
02:04:14,639 --> 02:04:19,118
a yellowing leaf mean

3427
02:04:16,319 --> 02:04:20,158
and you know asking these questions and

3428
02:04:19,118 --> 02:04:22,319
answering them

3429
02:04:20,158 --> 02:04:23,759
either through research or through a q a

3430
02:04:22,319 --> 02:04:25,039
with someone who's a little bit more

3431
02:04:23,760 --> 02:04:28,400
knowledgeable

3432
02:04:25,039 --> 02:04:29,920
but really the you know everything can

3433
02:04:28,399 --> 02:04:30,879
kind of be cookie cutter for most

3434
02:04:29,920 --> 02:04:33,118
growers you know

3435
02:04:30,880 --> 02:04:34,719
a feed schedule can be provided a

3436
02:04:33,118 --> 02:04:35,118
lighting schedule you can look up in a

3437
02:04:34,719 --> 02:04:37,760
book

3438
02:04:35,118 --> 02:04:39,439
you know back back when i started these

3439
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:42,079
resources weren't there so there's so

3440
02:04:39,439 --> 02:04:45,678
many more resources today

3441
02:04:42,078 --> 02:04:47,679
that people can utilize to

3442
02:04:45,679 --> 02:04:48,960
get them into those good growing

3443
02:04:47,679 --> 02:04:50,880
practices

3444
02:04:48,960 --> 02:04:52,560
uh and it and it does start with the

3445
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:54,400
basics i think a small

3446
02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:56,320
you know at least rudimentary

3447
02:04:54,399 --> 02:04:58,559
understanding of

3448
02:04:56,319 --> 02:05:00,399
you know what are the important

3449
02:04:58,560 --> 02:05:03,199
nutrients you know your npk

3450
02:05:00,399 --> 02:05:04,319
calcium magnesium you know iron sulfur

3451
02:05:03,198 --> 02:05:07,359
manganese

3452
02:05:04,319 --> 02:05:10,719
name a few you know and you know and

3453
02:05:07,359 --> 02:05:13,198
an understanding at least for

3454
02:05:10,719 --> 02:05:14,078
nitrogen potassium phosphorus calcium

3455
02:05:13,198 --> 02:05:16,559
magnesium

3456
02:05:14,078 --> 02:05:17,279
what those elements really do for the

3457
02:05:16,560 --> 02:05:19,119
plant

3458
02:05:17,279 --> 02:05:22,078
and why they're important at certain

3459
02:05:19,118 --> 02:05:24,000
times and not as important as others

3460
02:05:22,078 --> 02:05:25,359
so you know just having a rudimentary

3461
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:27,920
understanding of how

3462
02:05:25,359 --> 02:05:29,839
the plant uses nutrients to me is a

3463
02:05:27,920 --> 02:05:31,520
really really good foundation and that

3464
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:34,400
does take a little bit of

3465
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:36,079
brief reading to discover it doesn't

3466
02:05:34,399 --> 02:05:38,559
have to be super in-depth

3467
02:05:36,078 --> 02:05:40,238
to have that kind of general

3468
02:05:38,560 --> 02:05:42,400
understanding

3469
02:05:40,238 --> 02:05:44,479
you know and after that you know and

3470
02:05:42,399 --> 02:05:46,638
really you know so much of this is

3471
02:05:44,479 --> 02:05:47,839
and i tell people this all the time it's

3472
02:05:46,639 --> 02:05:50,078
just

3473
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:52,078
based you know it's it's facing these

3474
02:05:50,078 --> 02:05:54,000
facing challenges and learning how to

3475
02:05:52,078 --> 02:05:56,238
overcome them

3476
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:57,920
um you know when someone says that you

3477
02:05:56,238 --> 02:05:58,799
know they want to like well they ask me

3478
02:05:57,920 --> 02:06:00,319
you know all the time

3479
02:05:58,800 --> 02:06:02,079
how do you know all this i get this

3480
02:06:00,319 --> 02:06:05,118
question all the time at the shop and i

3481
02:06:02,078 --> 02:06:07,439
just you know it's it's 25 plus years of

3482
02:06:05,118 --> 02:06:10,000
trying to understand it better

3483
02:06:07,439 --> 02:06:11,359
and constantly wanting to learn and to

3484
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:14,880
better my practices

3485
02:06:11,359 --> 02:06:17,920
to improve you know my results

3486
02:06:14,880 --> 02:06:21,118
uh it's this constant need and desire

3487
02:06:17,920 --> 02:06:23,118
to to do better so

3488
02:06:21,118 --> 02:06:24,479
you know for that for the general

3489
02:06:23,118 --> 02:06:26,479
purpose of you know

3490
02:06:24,479 --> 02:06:28,000
where does it all begin well it all

3491
02:06:26,479 --> 02:06:30,158
begins with having that just

3492
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:31,599
basic understanding of plants and

3493
02:06:30,158 --> 02:06:34,399
nutrients

3494
02:06:31,599 --> 02:06:35,679
and so kind of a little extension of

3495
02:06:34,399 --> 02:06:37,839
that idea is

3496
02:06:35,679 --> 02:06:39,440
on on top of trying to continually get

3497
02:06:37,840 --> 02:06:40,400
better at reading the plant things like

3498
02:06:39,439 --> 02:06:43,118
that

3499
02:06:40,399 --> 02:06:43,519
how important is it to you to constantly

3500
02:06:43,118 --> 02:06:45,279
be

3501
02:06:43,520 --> 02:06:46,800
popping new genetics is that something

3502
02:06:45,279 --> 02:06:48,319
you put value on or do you think it's

3503
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:49,279
fine to just run the same thing again

3504
02:06:48,319 --> 02:06:51,279
and again

3505
02:06:49,279 --> 02:06:53,039
well you know and i'll go back to what i

3506
02:06:51,279 --> 02:06:55,599
was talking i kind of touched on this

3507
02:06:53,039 --> 02:06:58,000
earlier i think it's very important

3508
02:06:55,599 --> 02:06:58,800
um and i tell a lot of my customers this

3509
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,238
to work

3510
02:06:58,800 --> 02:07:02,639
you know your genetics with your

3511
02:07:00,238 --> 02:07:04,078
nutrients to see how to

3512
02:07:02,639 --> 02:07:05,840
best you know to get to that full

3513
02:07:04,078 --> 02:07:07,679
genetic expression via the nutrients

3514
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:09,520
that you're using or you're provided

3515
02:07:07,679 --> 02:07:11,359
or the method or however your whatever

3516
02:07:09,520 --> 02:07:14,400
your approach is

3517
02:07:11,359 --> 02:07:16,319
i i think it's important

3518
02:07:14,399 --> 02:07:18,638
if you want to if you know it depends

3519
02:07:16,319 --> 02:07:22,000
what your goal is if you want to

3520
02:07:18,639 --> 02:07:23,840
you know see what a new strain does

3521
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:25,039
you know running at one time isn't a

3522
02:07:23,840 --> 02:07:27,599
very good

3523
02:07:25,039 --> 02:07:28,078
you know uh litmus test for that you

3524
02:07:27,599 --> 02:07:30,400
know

3525
02:07:28,078 --> 02:07:31,759
i believe a lot of the scientific method

3526
02:07:30,399 --> 02:07:33,198
things need to be done at least three

3527
02:07:31,760 --> 02:07:36,320
times

3528
02:07:33,198 --> 02:07:40,238
to see you know to make a a

3529
02:07:36,319 --> 02:07:43,840
a conscious or you know try

3530
02:07:40,238 --> 02:07:47,118
yeah for validation yeah absolutely so

3531
02:07:43,840 --> 02:07:48,880
it's it to me you know i encourage

3532
02:07:47,118 --> 02:07:50,639
and of course this all goes back to like

3533
02:07:48,880 --> 02:07:52,400
skill level too you know someone who's

3534
02:07:50,639 --> 02:07:55,440
new i'm not going to recommend

3535
02:07:52,399 --> 02:07:57,679
skip around genetics every round

3536
02:07:55,439 --> 02:07:58,879
you'll never you'll it'll be such a slow

3537
02:07:57,679 --> 02:08:00,880
such a longer

3538
02:07:58,880 --> 02:08:02,078
prolonged learning curve with that

3539
02:08:00,880 --> 02:08:05,039
approach

3540
02:08:02,078 --> 02:08:07,198
i think that you know working with a

3541
02:08:05,039 --> 02:08:09,519
specific strain or two

3542
02:08:07,198 --> 02:08:11,439
learning that genetic inside and out if

3543
02:08:09,520 --> 02:08:13,119
it's interesting to you

3544
02:08:11,439 --> 02:08:14,238
that's how you learn now of course if

3545
02:08:13,118 --> 02:08:16,078
it's not interesting you're going to

3546
02:08:14,238 --> 02:08:19,519
bail on it anyway

3547
02:08:16,078 --> 02:08:21,679
but they see way too many folks who

3548
02:08:19,520 --> 02:08:22,639
change genetics every round or change

3549
02:08:21,679 --> 02:08:24,960
their nutrient

3550
02:08:22,639 --> 02:08:26,078
you know regimen every round and not

3551
02:08:24,960 --> 02:08:27,760
necessarily

3552
02:08:26,078 --> 02:08:29,359
for the sake of bettering but just to

3553
02:08:27,760 --> 02:08:31,039
try something new

3554
02:08:29,359 --> 02:08:32,960
and i think that's a pretty haphazard

3555
02:08:31,039 --> 02:08:36,399
way of going about

3556
02:08:32,960 --> 02:08:38,319
you know cultivating cannabis for sure

3557
02:08:36,399 --> 02:08:40,078
without a doubt so what do you think is

3558
02:08:38,319 --> 02:08:41,759
the biggest kind of mistake you

3559
02:08:40,078 --> 02:08:43,439
you see from customers coming to the

3560
02:08:41,760 --> 02:08:47,760
store

3561
02:08:43,439 --> 02:08:50,000
over watering most common mistake

3562
02:08:47,760 --> 02:08:50,880
so many problems start especially over

3563
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:54,238
watering of

3564
02:08:50,880 --> 02:08:56,319
starter plants you know or transplanted

3565
02:08:54,238 --> 02:08:57,279
plants it's it's the beginning of so

3566
02:08:56,319 --> 02:09:01,279
many issues

3567
02:08:57,279 --> 02:09:02,319
and uh that's hands down the most common

3568
02:09:01,279 --> 02:09:04,880
one

3569
02:09:02,319 --> 02:09:06,319
you know i i if the way i tried to

3570
02:09:04,880 --> 02:09:07,920
rationalize it with my customers

3571
02:09:06,319 --> 02:09:10,000
especially with a younger plant you know

3572
02:09:07,920 --> 02:09:12,880
a lot of folks tend to over water

3573
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:13,920
a clone um significantly you know

3574
02:09:12,880 --> 02:09:16,480
they'll put a small

3575
02:09:13,920 --> 02:09:18,078
root clone into a larger you know vessel

3576
02:09:16,479 --> 02:09:20,559
of dirt let's say a one or a

3577
02:09:18,078 --> 02:09:21,198
two gallon pot and want to you know keep

3578
02:09:20,560 --> 02:09:23,119
hammering

3579
02:09:21,198 --> 02:09:24,638
water to keep that pot saturated in the

3580
02:09:23,118 --> 02:09:28,158
beginning and the problem with that is

3581
02:09:24,639 --> 02:09:30,239
that you know compacted muddy media

3582
02:09:28,158 --> 02:09:32,399
is now you know kind of choking off the

3583
02:09:30,238 --> 02:09:33,678
oxygen supply making it harder for those

3584
02:09:32,399 --> 02:09:35,519
roots to excel

3585
02:09:33,679 --> 02:09:37,039
and to grow out and of course you slow

3586
02:09:35,520 --> 02:09:37,920
down the root process you slow down the

3587
02:09:37,039 --> 02:09:39,599
growth process

3588
02:09:37,920 --> 02:09:40,960
so down the growth process you're you

3589
02:09:39,599 --> 02:09:44,159
know you're

3590
02:09:40,960 --> 02:09:45,679
causing all kinds of you know ripple

3591
02:09:44,158 --> 02:09:46,000
effects throughout the life of that

3592
02:09:45,679 --> 02:09:48,319
plant

3593
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:49,920
you know i'm a very very big believer in

3594
02:09:48,319 --> 02:09:51,920
starting off with

3595
02:09:49,920 --> 02:09:53,599
really good healthy plants and if you

3596
02:09:51,920 --> 02:09:56,000
start off with a not so healthy

3597
02:09:53,599 --> 02:09:57,199
plant then you know you can almost

3598
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:59,279
expect to

3599
02:09:57,198 --> 02:10:01,678
face significant challenges throughout

3600
02:09:59,279 --> 02:10:03,759
the life cycle of that plan

3601
02:10:01,679 --> 02:10:04,800
so one thing we've heard anecdotally

3602
02:10:03,760 --> 02:10:07,440
from previous guest

3603
02:10:04,800 --> 02:10:09,039
jeremy of builder soil was that he

3604
02:10:07,439 --> 02:10:10,559
thinks there's certain plants which are

3605
02:10:09,039 --> 02:10:11,679
just pretty good regardless of your

3606
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:12,639
skill level like as in like you know

3607
02:10:11,679 --> 02:10:15,679
they tend to come out

3608
02:10:12,639 --> 02:10:17,679
pretty good he he noted gg4 is one that

3609
02:10:15,679 --> 02:10:19,359
he finds to fall in that category

3610
02:10:17,679 --> 02:10:20,639
do you find there's some that fall into

3611
02:10:19,359 --> 02:10:22,238
that category and you know i guess these

3612
02:10:20,639 --> 02:10:23,279
would be kind of like the more newbie

3613
02:10:22,238 --> 02:10:25,598
friendly type stuff

3614
02:10:23,279 --> 02:10:26,719
what's your recommendations yeah we the

3615
02:10:25,599 --> 02:10:28,400
bulletproof strains

3616
02:10:26,719 --> 02:10:30,399
uh there was there's a strain that's

3617
02:10:28,399 --> 02:10:32,479
been very popular here in oregon

3618
02:10:30,399 --> 02:10:34,319
it's not as popular as it was uh back in

3619
02:10:32,479 --> 02:10:36,479
the early 2000s but still around today

3620
02:10:34,319 --> 02:10:39,599
called green queen

3621
02:10:36,479 --> 02:10:42,078
and green queen was a strain that

3622
02:10:39,599 --> 02:10:43,599
and back then you know as we're you know

3623
02:10:42,078 --> 02:10:44,960
teaching we actually teaching friends to

3624
02:10:43,599 --> 02:10:45,760
grow and stuff like this you could hand

3625
02:10:44,960 --> 02:10:48,319
green queen to

3626
02:10:45,760 --> 02:10:50,320
anybody and they would see marginal or

3627
02:10:48,319 --> 02:10:53,359
decent success from the green queen

3628
02:10:50,319 --> 02:10:55,359
even on their first round out and it was

3629
02:10:53,359 --> 02:10:57,279
pretty much you know powdery mildew

3630
02:10:55,359 --> 02:10:59,118
resistant it could take

3631
02:10:57,279 --> 02:11:02,238
an under over feeding didn't really

3632
02:10:59,118 --> 02:11:04,078
matter fairly decent yield

3633
02:11:02,238 --> 02:11:05,279
i wouldn't say it was absolutely spider

3634
02:11:04,078 --> 02:11:07,118
mite resistant because that certainly

3635
02:11:05,279 --> 02:11:10,238
wasn't the case but it certainly wasn't

3636
02:11:07,118 --> 02:11:13,679
ground zero for infestations

3637
02:11:10,238 --> 02:11:15,759
so it you know it that particular plant

3638
02:11:13,679 --> 02:11:16,800
was the one you know it was it was a

3639
02:11:15,760 --> 02:11:19,119
newbie plant you could give it to

3640
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:21,599
anybody and they could see some success

3641
02:11:19,118 --> 02:11:23,198
so yeah i do believe that there are some

3642
02:11:21,599 --> 02:11:26,719
of those bulletproof strains

3643
02:11:23,198 --> 02:11:28,879
out there um you know i personally

3644
02:11:26,719 --> 02:11:30,078
haven't worked with gorilla excuse me

3645
02:11:28,880 --> 02:11:34,159
gg4

3646
02:11:30,078 --> 02:11:35,519
uh so you know i can't speak to the ease

3647
02:11:34,158 --> 02:11:38,078
of that one but i do see

3648
02:11:35,520 --> 02:11:39,040
a lot of our novice growers you know

3649
02:11:38,078 --> 02:11:42,078
through the store

3650
02:11:39,039 --> 02:11:43,760
who grow it um and and they don't seem

3651
02:11:42,078 --> 02:11:45,039
to be coming into me with too many

3652
02:11:43,760 --> 02:11:49,280
headaches

3653
02:11:45,039 --> 02:11:51,118
you know and a lot of um a lot of those

3654
02:11:49,279 --> 02:11:52,639
i i feel like kind of blue dream is

3655
02:11:51,118 --> 02:11:54,719
another one of those more current

3656
02:11:52,639 --> 02:11:56,159
strains that's kind of bulletproof it's

3657
02:11:54,719 --> 02:11:59,679
pretty easy

3658
02:11:56,158 --> 02:12:01,439
for folks to you know follow a simple

3659
02:11:59,679 --> 02:12:03,679
nutrient regimen

3660
02:12:01,439 --> 02:12:05,519
you know keep your lights on schedule

3661
02:12:03,679 --> 02:12:07,199
keep the humidity where it should be

3662
02:12:05,520 --> 02:12:08,719
temperatures where they should be

3663
02:12:07,198 --> 02:12:10,879
and that plant is going to turn and burn

3664
02:12:08,719 --> 02:12:12,639
for most people but then there are

3665
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:16,319
strains like you know like

3666
02:12:12,639 --> 02:12:18,078
some of those ogs and even chem can kind

3667
02:12:16,319 --> 02:12:21,479
of be this way but they get a little bit

3668
02:12:18,078 --> 02:12:24,319
more finicky and definitely require

3669
02:12:21,479 --> 02:12:28,158
a little bit more skill

3670
02:12:24,319 --> 02:12:31,519
to finesse that plant into its you know

3671
02:12:28,158 --> 02:12:34,238
prime potential definitely i

3672
02:12:31,520 --> 02:12:35,520
i feel like the chem's one of those ones

3673
02:12:34,238 --> 02:12:37,439
for me where i

3674
02:12:35,520 --> 02:12:40,320
i think it's it's lucky that plant

3675
02:12:37,439 --> 02:12:42,479
didn't get thrown out in the sense that

3676
02:12:40,319 --> 02:12:43,920
you know if certain conditions aren't

3677
02:12:42,479 --> 02:12:45,598
right i just feel like it doesn't come

3678
02:12:43,920 --> 02:12:47,359
out anywhere near its full potential

3679
02:12:45,599 --> 02:12:48,960
like not not obviously having a lot of

3680
02:12:47,359 --> 02:12:50,399
experience growing the chem myself but

3681
02:12:48,960 --> 02:12:52,000
just through the variants and

3682
02:12:50,399 --> 02:12:53,439
i've got a lot of really chem dominant

3683
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:55,439
leading plants and you can see

3684
02:12:53,439 --> 02:12:57,118
you know like for example for me at

3685
02:12:55,439 --> 02:12:59,439
least being in australia

3686
02:12:57,118 --> 02:13:01,039
the heat absolutely just destroys that

3687
02:12:59,439 --> 02:13:03,039
plant it doesn't perform well in the

3688
02:13:01,039 --> 02:13:04,479
heat and i think to myself

3689
02:13:03,039 --> 02:13:05,599
what if that happened with kim and he

3690
02:13:04,479 --> 02:13:08,000
just ran it and was like this is just

3691
02:13:05,599 --> 02:13:09,360
bunk let's just throw it out

3692
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:11,599
oh lord what a different world this

3693
02:13:09,359 --> 02:13:12,319
would be uh yeah and i'm glad that

3694
02:13:11,599 --> 02:13:14,159
wasn't the

3695
02:13:12,319 --> 02:13:15,599
i'm glad that wasn't the case with with

3696
02:13:14,158 --> 02:13:18,158
his experience

3697
02:13:15,599 --> 02:13:19,760
and yet no it's uh it you bring up

3698
02:13:18,158 --> 02:13:22,879
actually a very valid point

3699
02:13:19,760 --> 02:13:26,159
um there was a

3700
02:13:22,880 --> 02:13:28,319
a group down in cali that ran

3701
02:13:26,158 --> 02:13:29,439
i think it was dog walker and scooby in

3702
02:13:28,319 --> 02:13:32,639
two locations

3703
02:13:29,439 --> 02:13:35,359
one was inland right on the

3704
02:13:32,639 --> 02:13:37,599
east side of the hills the other one was

3705
02:13:35,359 --> 02:13:40,960
more in a coastal region

3706
02:13:37,599 --> 02:13:41,760
and the plants grown on the east side of

3707
02:13:40,960 --> 02:13:43,840
the hills

3708
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:44,880
more inland so in that more kind of dry

3709
02:13:43,840 --> 02:13:48,880
drier climate

3710
02:13:44,880 --> 02:13:51,440
of norcal didn't do that great

3711
02:13:48,880 --> 02:13:53,840
the ones at the coastal location were

3712
02:13:51,439 --> 02:13:57,198
some of their highest yielding plants

3713
02:13:53,840 --> 02:14:00,159
so yes you know it can make

3714
02:13:57,198 --> 02:14:01,359
a a significant difference and you know

3715
02:14:00,158 --> 02:14:03,839
is that because

3716
02:14:01,359 --> 02:14:05,359
you know of where the dog walker and

3717
02:14:03,840 --> 02:14:07,119
scooby come from and they've just kind

3718
02:14:05,359 --> 02:14:08,238
of naturally acclimated to that cooler

3719
02:14:07,118 --> 02:14:10,238
damper climate

3720
02:14:08,238 --> 02:14:12,158
perhaps i don't know you know the

3721
02:14:10,238 --> 02:14:13,678
majority of it's cultivated indoors so i

3722
02:14:12,158 --> 02:14:14,719
kind of have a hard time believing that

3723
02:14:13,679 --> 02:14:17,920
but maybe there's something

3724
02:14:14,719 --> 02:14:19,840
to it but that happened uh that that

3725
02:14:17,920 --> 02:14:21,440
that test that was done down there uh

3726
02:14:19,840 --> 02:14:23,360
run was was

3727
02:14:21,439 --> 02:14:25,118
it was hard to ignore the results that's

3728
02:14:23,359 --> 02:14:27,519
for sure

3729
02:14:25,118 --> 02:14:28,399
so just as a bit of a random oddball

3730
02:14:27,520 --> 02:14:30,800
question

3731
02:14:28,399 --> 02:14:32,319
what strain has been lost that either

3732
02:14:30,800 --> 02:14:34,800
you had or that you knew of that

3733
02:14:32,319 --> 02:14:37,599
you'd love to get back if possible my

3734
02:14:34,800 --> 02:14:39,360
sugar cookies

3735
02:14:37,599 --> 02:14:41,840
i lost that one recently and that was a

3736
02:14:39,359 --> 02:14:44,880
good one that was the one that was uh

3737
02:14:41,840 --> 02:14:45,279
the that one was the uh forum cut uh the

3738
02:14:44,880 --> 02:14:47,279
mail

3739
02:14:45,279 --> 02:14:50,158
the the selfing pollen that i collected

3740
02:14:47,279 --> 02:14:53,198
onto a cotton candy kush

3741
02:14:50,158 --> 02:14:55,039
and it made this the structure was still

3742
02:14:53,198 --> 02:14:55,759
very much cookie in the flour but the

3743
02:14:55,039 --> 02:14:58,960
flavor

3744
02:14:55,760 --> 02:15:02,560
was just there was like blueberry and

3745
02:14:58,960 --> 02:15:05,679
like a haze spice in there that was

3746
02:15:02,560 --> 02:15:09,440
just freaking off the charts good to me

3747
02:15:05,679 --> 02:15:10,960
and made phenomenal uh bubble hash

3748
02:15:09,439 --> 02:15:12,638
and that one unfortunately was lost

3749
02:15:10,960 --> 02:15:16,960
recently to a

3750
02:15:12,639 --> 02:15:19,359
uh to a cloning mix up a labeling issue

3751
02:15:16,960 --> 02:15:20,560
but um the other one you know it's

3752
02:15:19,359 --> 02:15:23,039
interesting because

3753
02:15:20,560 --> 02:15:25,520
bob brought it up because i remember

3754
02:15:23,039 --> 02:15:28,719
this one too he brought up the rapture

3755
02:15:25,520 --> 02:15:32,239
from yeah and that one was

3756
02:15:28,719 --> 02:15:34,158
always this kind of

3757
02:15:32,238 --> 02:15:36,238
never did not see it for very long and

3758
02:15:34,158 --> 02:15:37,839
only saw it a couple times but

3759
02:15:36,238 --> 02:15:39,759
from what i remember of it just

3760
02:15:37,840 --> 02:15:41,760
everything about that was just about

3761
02:15:39,760 --> 02:15:43,360
picture perfect

3762
02:15:41,760 --> 02:15:44,880
you know that one i do remember and

3763
02:15:43,359 --> 02:15:45,920
that's it's interesting because i've i

3764
02:15:44,880 --> 02:15:48,560
have some folks

3765
02:15:45,920 --> 02:15:50,000
back east recently that are like ah you

3766
02:15:48,560 --> 02:15:50,480
know if it's there we'll find it you

3767
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,158
know

3768
02:15:50,479 --> 02:15:53,519
so i put them to task on the raft but i

3769
02:15:52,158 --> 02:15:54,719
have a feeling that one's probably been

3770
02:15:53,520 --> 02:15:58,000
long gone

3771
02:15:54,719 --> 02:15:59,520
i'm sure bob hemphill can speak more to

3772
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:02,639
that than i can

3773
02:15:59,520 --> 02:16:03,280
but that one was absolutely very special

3774
02:16:02,639 --> 02:16:06,480
and it was

3775
02:16:03,279 --> 02:16:10,319
very short-lived in my experience

3776
02:16:06,479 --> 02:16:14,158
but that's one i'd love to see again uh

3777
02:16:10,319 --> 02:16:16,078
if i could think of any others

3778
02:16:14,158 --> 02:16:18,960
you know the real trinity would be nice

3779
02:16:16,078 --> 02:16:20,880
to see again yeah okay

3780
02:16:18,960 --> 02:16:23,359
you know not the trinity blueberry that

3781
02:16:20,880 --> 02:16:26,400
everyone else has but that old real

3782
02:16:23,359 --> 02:16:28,559
trinity that was you know almost velvety

3783
02:16:26,399 --> 02:16:30,238
and it's you know and it's trichome

3784
02:16:28,560 --> 02:16:31,520
production and it's just kind of

3785
02:16:30,238 --> 02:16:33,439
that was another one of those kind of

3786
02:16:31,520 --> 02:16:36,559
silver gray green plants

3787
02:16:33,439 --> 02:16:39,599
that you know once you got once you

3788
02:16:36,558 --> 02:16:41,438
once again once you've had it just it's

3789
02:16:39,599 --> 02:16:42,799
it leaves a mark on your palette and you

3790
02:16:41,439 --> 02:16:45,120
never forget

3791
02:16:42,799 --> 02:16:46,879
that's why it's so easy now to pick out

3792
02:16:45,120 --> 02:16:48,639
the imposters

3793
02:16:46,879 --> 02:16:51,358
you should you should hunt down not so

3794
02:16:48,638 --> 02:16:55,438
dog i think he's got the real deal

3795
02:16:51,359 --> 02:16:57,280
oh i'll write that down yeah no i tried

3796
02:16:55,439 --> 02:16:58,800
it at the cup and it sounds exactly like

3797
02:16:57,280 --> 02:17:00,159
what you're describing

3798
02:16:58,799 --> 02:17:02,000
all right cool that's cool to hear man

3799
02:17:00,159 --> 02:17:03,840
thank you yeah no check that out i'm

3800
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:05,519
gonna try to get him on soon um what's

3801
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:06,639
interesting though when you mention that

3802
02:17:05,519 --> 02:17:08,159
rapture thing

3803
02:17:06,638 --> 02:17:10,000
i'm actually gonna get hannah bolt to

3804
02:17:08,159 --> 02:17:13,840
come on soon i didn't know this

3805
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:15,200
she smoked more rapture than anyone um

3806
02:17:13,840 --> 02:17:17,359
yeah like without trying to give away

3807
02:17:15,200 --> 02:17:20,240
all the details essentially

3808
02:17:17,359 --> 02:17:22,159
the guy who had it with the source she

3809
02:17:20,239 --> 02:17:24,079
was much closer to him than what bob was

3810
02:17:22,159 --> 02:17:26,239
so she would kind of get first offerings

3811
02:17:24,079 --> 02:17:28,638
before bob did and so she ended up

3812
02:17:26,239 --> 02:17:30,159
getting access to a lot of it oh wow

3813
02:17:28,638 --> 02:17:31,039
that's that's pretty cool because you

3814
02:17:30,159 --> 02:17:33,920
know mine

3815
02:17:31,040 --> 02:17:34,479
had to trickle down from probably you

3816
02:17:33,920 --> 02:17:37,040
know him

3817
02:17:34,478 --> 02:17:38,718
to another friend to eventually to me so

3818
02:17:37,040 --> 02:17:40,240
you know what i was exposed to like i

3819
02:17:38,718 --> 02:17:42,558
said was super limited but

3820
02:17:40,239 --> 02:17:44,239
definitely very memorable how fun for

3821
02:17:42,558 --> 02:17:46,959
her to have that advantage though

3822
02:17:44,239 --> 02:17:47,439
good for her that's awesome yeah no i

3823
02:17:46,959 --> 02:17:50,079
can't wait

3824
02:17:47,439 --> 02:17:51,040
to get the run down it's it's mythical

3825
02:17:50,079 --> 02:17:52,398
so

3826
02:17:51,040 --> 02:17:54,240
last couple questions i've got are

3827
02:17:52,398 --> 02:17:55,760
actually kind of more legalization based

3828
02:17:54,239 --> 02:17:56,558
ones and i think you'd be a good source

3829
02:17:55,760 --> 02:17:59,519
of this

3830
02:17:56,558 --> 02:18:01,279
in terms of oregon at least do you view

3831
02:17:59,519 --> 02:18:02,398
legalization as having had a net

3832
02:18:01,280 --> 02:18:04,960
positive

3833
02:18:02,398 --> 02:18:06,718
you know i was i was more i've always

3834
02:18:04,959 --> 02:18:07,759
been more of a decriminalization than

3835
02:18:06,718 --> 02:18:10,239
legalization

3836
02:18:07,760 --> 02:18:11,200
uh regulation fan you know with

3837
02:18:10,239 --> 02:18:13,840
legalization

3838
02:18:11,200 --> 02:18:14,319
plus regulation the inevitable will

3839
02:18:13,840 --> 02:18:17,439
happen

3840
02:18:14,318 --> 02:18:21,119
everywhere it will provide

3841
02:18:17,439 --> 02:18:24,318
opportunity for the few it will

3842
02:18:21,120 --> 02:18:25,280
eliminate the many factor unfortunately

3843
02:18:24,318 --> 02:18:27,920
i think it's

3844
02:18:25,280 --> 02:18:28,559
you know i've seen so many folks who are

3845
02:18:27,920 --> 02:18:31,120
passionate

3846
02:18:28,558 --> 02:18:34,000
you know for many years kind of turn

3847
02:18:31,120 --> 02:18:36,479
away from the entire industry recently

3848
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:38,000
um shut down you know stop something

3849
02:18:36,478 --> 02:18:41,039
that they've been doing for the last 15

3850
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:42,718
or 20 years some of them um

3851
02:18:41,040 --> 02:18:45,519
and i think they just get kind of jaded

3852
02:18:42,718 --> 02:18:47,919
by the reality of commercialization

3853
02:18:45,519 --> 02:18:50,478
and so you know it's kind of a careful

3854
02:18:47,920 --> 02:18:53,280
what you wish for scenario for me

3855
02:18:50,478 --> 02:18:53,760
uh you know this is this it doesn't

3856
02:18:53,280 --> 02:18:55,679
happen

3857
02:18:53,760 --> 02:18:57,280
it didn't happen of course early on in

3858
02:18:55,679 --> 02:18:58,960
oregon same thing in colorado it's kind

3859
02:18:57,280 --> 02:19:00,319
of like you know even back in montana

3860
02:18:58,959 --> 02:19:01,199
when things were going on there for the

3861
02:19:00,318 --> 02:19:02,879
legalization

3862
02:19:01,200 --> 02:19:05,040
it was kind of the wild wild west for a

3863
02:19:02,879 --> 02:19:07,119
while and you know the hustlers

3864
02:19:05,040 --> 02:19:08,080
out walls and growers were all kind of

3865
02:19:07,120 --> 02:19:10,319
you know

3866
02:19:08,079 --> 02:19:12,239
making the moves to make the scene work

3867
02:19:10,318 --> 02:19:15,599
but eventually the states have to step

3868
02:19:12,239 --> 02:19:18,318
in and institute regulation and

3869
02:19:15,599 --> 02:19:19,679
that that ends that whole kind of wild

3870
02:19:18,318 --> 02:19:23,119
west

3871
02:19:19,679 --> 02:19:24,719
situation and brings it into a very

3872
02:19:23,120 --> 02:19:26,479
much more controlled environment and

3873
02:19:24,718 --> 02:19:28,638
what you know what you've seen is

3874
02:19:26,478 --> 02:19:29,599
you know a couple of states oregon

3875
02:19:28,638 --> 02:19:32,079
washington

3876
02:19:29,599 --> 02:19:34,000
uh even in colorado have to kind of have

3877
02:19:32,079 --> 02:19:36,239
these evolutions to the law

3878
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:39,359
because you know what was what made

3879
02:19:36,239 --> 02:19:41,359
sense or what was uh

3880
02:19:39,359 --> 02:19:43,280
found in good favor you know six months

3881
02:19:41,359 --> 02:19:43,679
ago now the sudden for some reason is

3882
02:19:43,280 --> 02:19:45,120
not

3883
02:19:43,679 --> 02:19:46,719
so we have to change the law we have to

3884
02:19:45,120 --> 02:19:48,479
evolve and

3885
02:19:46,718 --> 02:19:49,919
emerging states are having that

3886
02:19:48,478 --> 02:19:52,318
opportunity to see some of these other

3887
02:19:49,920 --> 02:19:54,478
states make the mistakes along the way

3888
02:19:52,318 --> 02:19:56,639
and hopefully put forth you know their

3889
02:19:54,478 --> 02:19:57,519
more strict legislation and restricting

3890
02:19:56,639 --> 02:19:59,199
legislation

3891
02:19:57,520 --> 02:20:00,479
that much more easily because you can

3892
02:19:59,200 --> 02:20:01,760
say hey well look here what's here's

3893
02:20:00,478 --> 02:20:03,039
here's what happened in these states

3894
02:20:01,760 --> 02:20:04,398
didn't work out there so

3895
02:20:03,040 --> 02:20:06,640
you know we're gonna we're gonna follow

3896
02:20:04,398 --> 02:20:08,079
suit and make

3897
02:20:06,639 --> 02:20:10,000
start with these laws are a little bit

3898
02:20:08,079 --> 02:20:13,760
more restrictive um

3899
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:15,840
so you know i it's a it's a mixed bag of

3900
02:20:13,760 --> 02:20:16,159
emotions for me you know i love the fact

3901
02:20:15,840 --> 02:20:18,478
that

3902
02:20:16,159 --> 02:20:20,398
i can walk down the street with you know

3903
02:20:18,478 --> 02:20:24,159
a few joints in my pocket

3904
02:20:20,398 --> 02:20:25,599
or a bag of top walker and i i'm not

3905
02:20:24,159 --> 02:20:27,200
going to get arrested for it you know i

3906
02:20:25,600 --> 02:20:28,159
can have it in my car i can drive around

3907
02:20:27,200 --> 02:20:29,760
with the plant and

3908
02:20:28,159 --> 02:20:31,520
plants in my car and nobody's going to

3909
02:20:29,760 --> 02:20:34,159
pull me over for it

3910
02:20:31,520 --> 02:20:35,359
that to me is you know amazing and

3911
02:20:34,159 --> 02:20:38,559
mind-blowing

3912
02:20:35,359 --> 02:20:41,600
all at the same time but also you know

3913
02:20:38,559 --> 02:20:45,039
there is this whole thing lurking in the

3914
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:50,318
back you know in the shadows of all this

3915
02:20:45,040 --> 02:20:53,920
of cour larger corporations

3916
02:20:50,318 --> 02:20:56,079
making more of an impact than they have

3917
02:20:53,920 --> 02:20:58,478
up into this point and i don't mean you

3918
02:20:56,079 --> 02:20:59,920
know the philip morrises and stuff like

3919
02:20:58,478 --> 02:21:01,438
that you know i don't i'm not a big

3920
02:20:59,920 --> 02:21:03,200
believer in that they want to convert

3921
02:21:01,439 --> 02:21:06,239
their customers yet

3922
02:21:03,200 --> 02:21:09,439
um but there are large

3923
02:21:06,239 --> 02:21:12,639
you know entities afoot and that

3924
02:21:09,439 --> 02:21:14,720
to me is you know the to me

3925
02:21:12,639 --> 02:21:17,039
you know whenever it's used to destroy

3926
02:21:14,719 --> 02:21:20,239
the medical situation

3927
02:21:17,040 --> 02:21:21,439
um that's the scary part to me and that

3928
02:21:20,239 --> 02:21:24,159
is kind of what happened like in

3929
02:21:21,439 --> 02:21:26,079
washington for example

3930
02:21:24,159 --> 02:21:28,000
like i hate i would hate it if they took

3931
02:21:26,079 --> 02:21:30,559
away the oregonians

3932
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:31,760
residents ability to have a home grow i

3933
02:21:30,559 --> 02:21:33,680
think to me that would be

3934
02:21:31,760 --> 02:21:36,478
unfortunate and that's something that's

3935
02:21:33,680 --> 02:21:39,359
happened to our neighbors to the north

3936
02:21:36,478 --> 02:21:40,000
do you view that as the fundamentally

3937
02:21:39,359 --> 02:21:43,359
paramount

3938
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:47,520
right we need to protect

3939
02:21:43,359 --> 02:21:50,800
i mean i see that as a

3940
02:21:47,520 --> 02:21:52,319
state taking creating the opportunity to

3941
02:21:50,799 --> 02:21:54,559
make more financial

3942
02:21:52,318 --> 02:21:56,478
and more stable financial gain from the

3943
02:21:54,559 --> 02:21:58,559
situation

3944
02:21:56,478 --> 02:22:00,398
does that make sense you know i mean i i

3945
02:21:58,559 --> 02:22:03,439
really do i think that it's

3946
02:22:00,398 --> 02:22:05,039
um you know because when you when you

3947
02:22:03,439 --> 02:22:05,840
take away home grows you're not just

3948
02:22:05,040 --> 02:22:07,840
taking away

3949
02:22:05,840 --> 02:22:10,799
you know that person or patient's

3950
02:22:07,840 --> 02:22:12,639
ability to cultivate their own medicine

3951
02:22:10,799 --> 02:22:14,478
but you're also taking away that

3952
02:22:12,639 --> 02:22:19,439
person's ability

3953
02:22:14,478 --> 02:22:21,760
to um to go to their local retail store

3954
02:22:19,439 --> 02:22:23,600
to go buy the grow equipment and the

3955
02:22:21,760 --> 02:22:25,520
nutrients and stuff you know it's it's

3956
02:22:23,600 --> 02:22:28,159
it's had this incredible effect up in

3957
02:22:25,520 --> 02:22:30,319
washington where it's really disrupted

3958
02:22:28,159 --> 02:22:31,439
uh the retails the hydro industry retail

3959
02:22:30,318 --> 02:22:33,199
stores there and so

3960
02:22:31,439 --> 02:22:35,680
many of them have had to close after

3961
02:22:33,200 --> 02:22:37,840
many many years of operation

3962
02:22:35,680 --> 02:22:39,359
due to the fact that home grows are no

3963
02:22:37,840 --> 02:22:41,680
longer legal there

3964
02:22:39,359 --> 02:22:43,760
so you know to me as long as you know

3965
02:22:41,680 --> 02:22:44,720
everybody has their right to produce

3966
02:22:43,760 --> 02:22:47,439
their own

3967
02:22:44,719 --> 02:22:48,959
and not being forced into a retail store

3968
02:22:47,439 --> 02:22:51,359
to purchase

3969
02:22:48,959 --> 02:22:52,879
cannabis grown by you know whatever

3970
02:22:51,359 --> 02:22:55,040
cultivation group

3971
02:22:52,879 --> 02:22:56,079
um then i'm okay with it but as soon as

3972
02:22:55,040 --> 02:22:58,800
you take this that

3973
02:22:56,079 --> 02:23:01,200
that individual right away to produce

3974
02:22:58,799 --> 02:23:03,438
and cultivate your own cannabis

3975
02:23:01,200 --> 02:23:05,359
um that's a that's dangerous territory

3976
02:23:03,439 --> 02:23:06,800
as far as i'm concerned

3977
02:23:05,359 --> 02:23:08,800
i guess the reason why i asked that

3978
02:23:06,799 --> 02:23:10,318
specifically is because the kind of

3979
02:23:08,799 --> 02:23:12,159
medical option that's being rolled out

3980
02:23:10,318 --> 02:23:13,760
in australia as much as as fast as i

3981
02:23:12,159 --> 02:23:15,439
believe it to be you could kind of boil

3982
02:23:13,760 --> 02:23:17,040
it down to be the case that

3983
02:23:15,439 --> 02:23:18,479
they don't want you to grow your own but

3984
02:23:17,040 --> 02:23:19,359
you've got to accept you know philip

3985
02:23:18,478 --> 02:23:21,119
morrison's

3986
02:23:19,359 --> 02:23:22,880
offering whatever that may be so to

3987
02:23:21,120 --> 02:23:24,160
speak would you

3988
02:23:22,879 --> 02:23:26,478
settle with that or would you just be

3989
02:23:24,159 --> 02:23:31,039
like no i cannot get down with that

3990
02:23:26,478 --> 02:23:33,920
i yeah no i that to me is um

3991
02:23:31,040 --> 02:23:35,920
that to me is is not the best path

3992
02:23:33,920 --> 02:23:36,879
moving forward for a medical program at

3993
02:23:35,920 --> 02:23:40,000
all

3994
02:23:36,879 --> 02:23:42,159
i think that it's you know i think

3995
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:44,879
for a lot of folks if they have the you

3996
02:23:42,159 --> 02:23:47,200
know if someone had the opportunity to

3997
02:23:44,879 --> 02:23:48,478
grow their aspirin what you can with

3998
02:23:47,200 --> 02:23:51,120
cannabis right

3999
02:23:48,478 --> 02:23:52,879
they probably would you know um i think

4000
02:23:51,120 --> 02:23:56,000
that cannabis

4001
02:23:52,879 --> 02:23:57,759
because it is such you know

4002
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:59,680
it can be absolutely personalized

4003
02:23:57,760 --> 02:24:02,719
medicine in the sense that

4004
02:23:59,680 --> 02:24:05,760
people can find specific genetics that

4005
02:24:02,719 --> 02:24:06,559
target whatever they want to whatever

4006
02:24:05,760 --> 02:24:10,559
they're dealing with

4007
02:24:06,559 --> 02:24:13,279
specifically that you know if

4008
02:24:10,559 --> 02:24:14,478
the corporate groups that are mass

4009
02:24:13,280 --> 02:24:17,439
producing whatever

4010
02:24:14,478 --> 02:24:20,159
flower or concentrate they're producing

4011
02:24:17,439 --> 02:24:22,559
doesn't have that particular genetic

4012
02:24:20,159 --> 02:24:23,200
then that you know individual may not

4013
02:24:22,559 --> 02:24:25,519
find

4014
02:24:23,200 --> 02:24:26,640
that combination of sedentary

4015
02:24:25,520 --> 02:24:30,000
metabolites

4016
02:24:26,639 --> 02:24:32,000
that hit all the right spots and i think

4017
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,639
that's very restrictive and unfair to a

4018
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,318
patient

4019
02:24:32,639 --> 02:24:35,680
you know in their you know in the

4020
02:24:34,318 --> 02:24:37,920
medical days here

4021
02:24:35,680 --> 02:24:39,439
even you know even today we have folks

4022
02:24:37,920 --> 02:24:41,280
who are constantly you know those are

4023
02:24:39,439 --> 02:24:43,840
the folks that are trying to find that

4024
02:24:41,280 --> 02:24:45,120
strain that really target and best

4025
02:24:43,840 --> 02:24:48,079
affects

4026
02:24:45,120 --> 02:24:49,040
uh you know whatever condition they're

4027
02:24:48,079 --> 02:24:52,079
dealing with or

4028
02:24:49,040 --> 02:24:52,479
you know gives them the best result so i

4029
02:24:52,079 --> 02:24:54,959
think

4030
02:24:52,478 --> 02:24:56,559
that's unfortunately very restrictive

4031
02:24:54,959 --> 02:25:00,159
and doesn't necessarily

4032
02:24:56,559 --> 02:25:02,000
allow for that personalized medicine to

4033
02:25:00,159 --> 02:25:04,639
occur i mean yeah you can hit for some

4034
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:07,680
folks but you know

4035
02:25:04,639 --> 02:25:08,159
it's to me it's an unfortunate way to

4036
02:25:07,680 --> 02:25:12,398
pursue

4037
02:25:08,159 --> 02:25:14,959
the medical so oregon specifically has

4038
02:25:12,398 --> 02:25:16,639
been criticized in the past with having

4039
02:25:14,959 --> 02:25:18,478
what some might regard as you know kind

4040
02:25:16,639 --> 02:25:20,398
of some laws that are just

4041
02:25:18,478 --> 02:25:22,398
maybe you'd say a bit pedantic i guess

4042
02:25:20,398 --> 02:25:22,799
like most notably the whole naming thing

4043
02:25:22,398 --> 02:25:25,439
like

4044
02:25:22,799 --> 02:25:27,119
you can't call certain strains whatever

4045
02:25:25,439 --> 02:25:27,760
because it's deemed too appealing to

4046
02:25:27,120 --> 02:25:30,079
kids

4047
02:25:27,760 --> 02:25:32,000
girl scout cookies cinderella 99 bubble

4048
02:25:30,079 --> 02:25:34,559
gum you can kind of see where they're

4049
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:37,600
coming from but where do you sit on that

4050
02:25:34,559 --> 02:25:38,799
so essentially a dispensary just i think

4051
02:25:37,600 --> 02:25:40,720
two weeks ago got it

4052
02:25:38,799 --> 02:25:43,199
got it we got our first cease and desist

4053
02:25:40,719 --> 02:25:45,840
for using scooby snacks

4054
02:25:43,200 --> 02:25:46,399
at a dispensary so you know hey look i

4055
02:25:45,840 --> 02:25:49,520
get it

4056
02:25:46,398 --> 02:25:51,358
i do um i i i think

4057
02:25:49,520 --> 02:25:54,159
one of the things you have to have as a

4058
02:25:51,359 --> 02:25:57,120
state that's pursuing legal cannabis

4059
02:25:54,159 --> 02:25:58,559
is this appearance right that you're

4060
02:25:57,120 --> 02:26:00,000
hitting all the things that the federal

4061
02:25:58,559 --> 02:26:04,398
government said you shouldn't do

4062
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:06,159
right and making these and avoiding uh

4063
02:26:04,398 --> 02:26:07,279
attract you know avoiding marketing to

4064
02:26:06,159 --> 02:26:10,000
children is something the federal

4065
02:26:07,280 --> 02:26:13,280
government has absolutely spelled out

4066
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:15,040
and so it's a it's a it's a fear

4067
02:26:13,280 --> 02:26:16,399
response from the state like

4068
02:26:15,040 --> 02:26:17,920
feds say we should do this okay well

4069
02:26:16,398 --> 02:26:19,680
let's do this one little thing because

4070
02:26:17,920 --> 02:26:23,120
this won't have a huge

4071
02:26:19,680 --> 02:26:24,720
negative impact on anyone really

4072
02:26:23,120 --> 02:26:27,439
but we've got to kind of play by their

4073
02:26:24,719 --> 02:26:29,438
rules to have to make the appearance

4074
02:26:27,439 --> 02:26:31,200
that we're doing it right or we're doing

4075
02:26:29,439 --> 02:26:33,600
it by whatever you know

4076
02:26:31,200 --> 02:26:34,880
protocol they spit out the federal

4077
02:26:33,600 --> 02:26:36,000
government hasn't spit out very many

4078
02:26:34,879 --> 02:26:39,519
protocols but that was

4079
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:42,318
definitely one of them um so

4080
02:26:39,520 --> 02:26:43,920
you know does that make me change the

4081
02:26:42,318 --> 02:26:46,239
name of my strain

4082
02:26:43,920 --> 02:26:47,600
no absolutely not but does it mean that

4083
02:26:46,239 --> 02:26:48,559
the next time you go in the dispensary

4084
02:26:47,600 --> 02:26:52,000
it might say s

4085
02:26:48,559 --> 02:26:54,719
snacks yeah probably

4086
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:55,680
does that make the flower any worse no

4087
02:26:54,719 --> 02:26:57,840
you know

4088
02:26:55,680 --> 02:26:59,439
it's that whole name thing you know it's

4089
02:26:57,840 --> 02:27:00,079
it's still it's still going to be the

4090
02:26:59,439 --> 02:27:02,398
same

4091
02:27:00,079 --> 02:27:03,280
you know genetic that i know and love so

4092
02:27:02,398 --> 02:27:06,478
yeah you know it's

4093
02:27:03,280 --> 02:27:09,200
i i get why the state did it uh

4094
02:27:06,478 --> 02:27:12,159
to me it's it's kind of a you know it's

4095
02:27:09,200 --> 02:27:14,319
sacrificing a pawn so to speak

4096
02:27:12,159 --> 02:27:16,398
okay and so i guess you know kind of

4097
02:27:14,318 --> 02:27:17,920
wrap up this whole idea

4098
02:27:16,398 --> 02:27:20,318
what do you think was the most

4099
02:27:17,920 --> 02:27:23,760
unexpected negative thing

4100
02:27:20,318 --> 02:27:23,760
to come out of legalization

4101
02:27:24,719 --> 02:27:27,760
this would be pretty unanimous with

4102
02:27:26,079 --> 02:27:32,639
everyone the just

4103
02:27:27,760 --> 02:27:32,639
the plummeting of the value of cannabis

4104
02:27:32,799 --> 02:27:36,239
i don't think anyone we all knew it

4105
02:27:34,318 --> 02:27:37,600
would drop some but i don't think

4106
02:27:36,239 --> 02:27:40,398
anybody expected

4107
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:42,479
this this big of a tumble in the market

4108
02:27:40,398 --> 02:27:44,239
no way

4109
02:27:42,478 --> 02:27:48,079
that one was you know that's the one

4110
02:27:44,239 --> 02:27:51,439
that's hit everybody i think the hardest

4111
02:27:48,079 --> 02:27:52,478
it's unfortunate though a result of the

4112
02:27:51,439 --> 02:27:55,120
greed

4113
02:27:52,478 --> 02:27:56,639
that ensued as soon as legal cannabis

4114
02:27:55,120 --> 02:27:59,760
was a thing here

4115
02:27:56,639 --> 02:28:01,760
you know i think that states and

4116
02:27:59,760 --> 02:28:03,359
would do well by not allowing

4117
02:28:01,760 --> 02:28:05,600
out-of-state investment

4118
02:28:03,359 --> 02:28:06,800
as they go online to keeping those

4119
02:28:05,600 --> 02:28:11,040
businesses to

4120
02:28:06,799 --> 02:28:13,519
state you know resident businesses

4121
02:28:11,040 --> 02:28:14,960
uh you know everybody you know i can't

4122
02:28:13,520 --> 02:28:17,520
tell you how many and we still see them

4123
02:28:14,959 --> 02:28:18,639
and we still see 120 lighters going up

4124
02:28:17,520 --> 02:28:20,479
all the time and then

4125
02:28:18,639 --> 02:28:22,159
when you look at the glut that we had

4126
02:28:20,478 --> 02:28:23,119
back in december you know over a million

4127
02:28:22,159 --> 02:28:26,719
pounds in our rec

4128
02:28:23,120 --> 02:28:29,280
system what is what good

4129
02:28:26,719 --> 02:28:31,119
you know 120 new lights gonna do for our

4130
02:28:29,280 --> 02:28:34,720
state i don't know

4131
02:28:31,120 --> 02:28:37,760
um so yeah it's it's the the pricing

4132
02:28:34,719 --> 02:28:39,039
it's just it's just made it very very

4133
02:28:37,760 --> 02:28:42,880
difficult

4134
02:28:39,040 --> 02:28:47,200
for extremely talented committed

4135
02:28:42,879 --> 02:28:48,959
cultivators to stay in a profitable game

4136
02:28:47,200 --> 02:28:51,040
it's really hard right now you have to

4137
02:28:48,959 --> 02:28:54,639
be so con

4138
02:28:51,040 --> 02:28:56,640
so focused on the bottom line

4139
02:28:54,639 --> 02:28:58,639
that you know you start to see people

4140
02:28:56,639 --> 02:29:00,959
slipping on things like inputs

4141
02:28:58,639 --> 02:29:03,199
and you know moving it's why all of a

4142
02:29:00,959 --> 02:29:04,799
sudden salts are so much more attractive

4143
02:29:03,200 --> 02:29:07,520
to some of these you know

4144
02:29:04,799 --> 02:29:08,000
uh to some of these commercial growers

4145
02:29:07,520 --> 02:29:09,840
so this

4146
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:11,760
is because it is it can't it is cheaper

4147
02:29:09,840 --> 02:29:12,799
now there's some organic practices that

4148
02:29:11,760 --> 02:29:14,239
get close but

4149
02:29:12,799 --> 02:29:17,358
when you get down to someone who's

4150
02:29:14,239 --> 02:29:19,760
actually mixing their own raw salts

4151
02:29:17,359 --> 02:29:20,720
it's it's it's tough to beat that

4152
02:29:19,760 --> 02:29:22,398
financially

4153
02:29:20,719 --> 02:29:24,318
you know that's a pretty that's about as

4154
02:29:22,398 --> 02:29:26,959
low as you can go on input cost

4155
02:29:24,318 --> 02:29:27,359
and like i said as the price plummets

4156
02:29:26,959 --> 02:29:29,358
that

4157
02:29:27,359 --> 02:29:32,318
focus on input cost becomes more and

4158
02:29:29,359 --> 02:29:34,239
more significant

4159
02:29:32,318 --> 02:29:35,680
so i think there's you know there's a

4160
02:29:34,239 --> 02:29:37,280
lot of things that are getting glossed

4161
02:29:35,680 --> 02:29:40,960
and passed over

4162
02:29:37,280 --> 02:29:42,800
um because of the cost and

4163
02:29:40,959 --> 02:29:45,039
like i said it's just that's that's the

4164
02:29:42,799 --> 02:29:47,840
one thing that's most unfortunate

4165
02:29:45,040 --> 02:29:48,479
absolutely as an individual you know not

4166
02:29:47,840 --> 02:29:50,318
in oregon

4167
02:29:48,478 --> 02:29:51,760
obviously but in say an illegal

4168
02:29:50,318 --> 02:29:54,159
environment what do you think

4169
02:29:51,760 --> 02:29:55,840
is your best advice to someone in terms

4170
02:29:54,159 --> 02:29:56,879
of what they can do on the individual

4171
02:29:55,840 --> 02:29:58,639
level because

4172
02:29:56,879 --> 02:30:00,719
and i guess what i mean by that is not

4173
02:29:58,639 --> 02:30:02,159
looking for an answer that's like

4174
02:30:00,719 --> 02:30:03,199
try to change the law because that's not

4175
02:30:02,159 --> 02:30:04,478
really something you can do as an

4176
02:30:03,200 --> 02:30:05,840
individual like you can try to be more

4177
02:30:04,478 --> 02:30:07,119
politically active sure but

4178
02:30:05,840 --> 02:30:08,799
you know what i mean more so looking on

4179
02:30:07,120 --> 02:30:09,920
like what what's something everyone can

4180
02:30:08,799 --> 02:30:18,559
do in your opinion that

4181
02:30:09,920 --> 02:30:22,079
will help collectively

4182
02:30:18,559 --> 02:30:25,199
be a responsible grower and and and

4183
02:30:22,079 --> 02:30:27,280
and not just responsible in

4184
02:30:25,200 --> 02:30:28,479
your growing practices but just how you

4185
02:30:27,280 --> 02:30:31,120
conduct yourself

4186
02:30:28,478 --> 02:30:33,519
in life you know don't don't be a beacon

4187
02:30:31,120 --> 02:30:35,840
of light for attention

4188
02:30:33,520 --> 02:30:37,200
for the wrong attention be a beacon of

4189
02:30:35,840 --> 02:30:41,600
light for the right attention

4190
02:30:37,200 --> 02:30:45,439
and i think that goes to you know

4191
02:30:41,600 --> 02:30:48,239
you know using not using products that

4192
02:30:45,439 --> 02:30:49,520
will potentially slowly kill your

4193
02:30:48,239 --> 02:30:51,840
customers

4194
02:30:49,520 --> 02:30:53,439
um you know it's reputation buildings

4195
02:30:51,840 --> 02:30:54,719
like building a good reputation for

4196
02:30:53,439 --> 02:30:58,000
yourself as

4197
02:30:54,719 --> 02:31:01,519
a responsible individual uh you know

4198
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:02,799
even in the uh the illicit market side

4199
02:31:01,520 --> 02:31:06,159
of things

4200
02:31:02,799 --> 02:31:08,799
will help to paint a better picture

4201
02:31:06,159 --> 02:31:10,879
for the collective you know so it starts

4202
02:31:08,799 --> 02:31:11,358
on an individual level but what it does

4203
02:31:10,879 --> 02:31:13,438
is

4204
02:31:11,359 --> 02:31:15,200
you know if that responsibility is

4205
02:31:13,439 --> 02:31:16,398
shared and practiced between many

4206
02:31:15,200 --> 02:31:18,880
individuals

4207
02:31:16,398 --> 02:31:21,439
then when states do start turning and

4208
02:31:18,879 --> 02:31:24,719
looking at what's going on

4209
02:31:21,439 --> 02:31:26,639
perhaps there's some kind of pillars in

4210
02:31:24,719 --> 02:31:29,119
the industry at that point that can

4211
02:31:26,639 --> 02:31:31,439
cross over and become leaders in the

4212
02:31:29,120 --> 02:31:33,680
industry of the legal industry

4213
02:31:31,439 --> 02:31:35,359
i think i've seen that here you know

4214
02:31:33,680 --> 02:31:36,079
we've definitely seen that here in

4215
02:31:35,359 --> 02:31:38,559
oregon

4216
02:31:36,079 --> 02:31:39,760
where you know some very well you know

4217
02:31:38,559 --> 02:31:43,680
respected and

4218
02:31:39,760 --> 02:31:45,920
good uh honest cultivators

4219
02:31:43,680 --> 02:31:47,359
you know came out of the shadows and

4220
02:31:45,920 --> 02:31:50,478
stepped into the limelight

4221
02:31:47,359 --> 02:31:51,200
and became leaders for the state and i

4222
02:31:50,478 --> 02:31:53,039
think that

4223
02:31:51,200 --> 02:31:54,479
that's something that the state pays

4224
02:31:53,040 --> 02:31:57,280
attention to

4225
02:31:54,478 --> 02:31:58,959
um and you know and i think it also is

4226
02:31:57,280 --> 02:32:01,200
can be very inspirational to

4227
02:31:58,959 --> 02:32:02,239
those who haven't gotten there yet but

4228
02:32:01,200 --> 02:32:04,319
you know be

4229
02:32:02,239 --> 02:32:05,840
be responsible keep keep your house in

4230
02:32:04,318 --> 02:32:11,199
order um

4231
02:32:05,840 --> 02:32:14,478
you know and do things the right way um

4232
02:32:11,200 --> 02:32:17,200
don't uh don't don't do people

4233
02:32:14,478 --> 02:32:18,719
wrong it's uh definitely come back and

4234
02:32:17,200 --> 02:32:21,520
bite you

4235
02:32:18,719 --> 02:32:22,959
yeah without a doubt really it's not

4236
02:32:21,520 --> 02:32:25,439
profound advice i know

4237
02:32:22,959 --> 02:32:27,119
but it's you know it's i guess if

4238
02:32:25,439 --> 02:32:30,559
there's one thing that i say that i

4239
02:32:27,120 --> 02:32:32,479
kind of try to carry around with me all

4240
02:32:30,559 --> 02:32:34,478
the time is you know just

4241
02:32:32,478 --> 02:32:36,639
try to do things the right way do people

4242
02:32:34,478 --> 02:32:38,318
the right way too

4243
02:32:36,639 --> 02:32:40,079
yeah i mean maybe not profound but

4244
02:32:38,318 --> 02:32:43,279
nevertheless it still needs to be said

4245
02:32:40,079 --> 02:32:43,280
so i guess that says something

4246
02:32:43,439 --> 02:32:46,960
so final little section a little quick

4247
02:32:45,600 --> 02:32:48,720
fire questions so

4248
02:32:46,959 --> 02:32:50,719
these ones you can be as shorter as long

4249
02:32:48,719 --> 02:32:54,639
as you want so

4250
02:32:50,719 --> 02:32:54,639
currently who's the best grower you know

4251
02:32:56,318 --> 02:33:00,239
date farmer hell yeah shout out pig

4252
02:32:59,520 --> 02:33:03,359
farmer

4253
02:33:00,239 --> 02:33:06,000
yes indeed he he definitely

4254
02:33:03,359 --> 02:33:07,120
um and i base it purely on his scooby

4255
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:10,000
snack results

4256
02:33:07,120 --> 02:33:11,600
uh he he crushes that strain as good or

4257
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,799
if not better than anyone that's ever

4258
02:33:11,600 --> 02:33:16,399
run it that i know

4259
02:33:12,799 --> 02:33:19,840
uh so i'm a big fan of his work

4260
02:33:16,398 --> 02:33:22,318
um i definitely am a fan of green bodhi

4261
02:33:19,840 --> 02:33:23,840
his work here in oregon he's another

4262
02:33:22,318 --> 02:33:26,879
phenomenal cultivator

4263
02:33:23,840 --> 02:33:27,520
and a phenomenal breeder at that next

4264
02:33:26,879 --> 02:33:28,879
one is

4265
02:33:27,520 --> 02:33:34,720
what's your prediction for the hottest

4266
02:33:28,879 --> 02:33:38,000
strain of 2018

4267
02:33:34,719 --> 02:33:41,599
um whatever comes out with the biz

4268
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:43,200
and that puck yeah i hope um no if

4269
02:33:41,600 --> 02:33:44,640
the hottest strange you know this is

4270
02:33:43,200 --> 02:33:46,479
this is such a weird question for me

4271
02:33:44,639 --> 02:33:48,478
because i don't necessarily pay

4272
02:33:46,478 --> 02:33:51,840
attention too much this kind of stuff

4273
02:33:48,478 --> 02:33:53,679
but um you know i it looks like uh

4274
02:33:51,840 --> 02:33:55,600
via on instagram looks like archives has

4275
02:33:53,680 --> 02:33:59,040
some cool things in the works

4276
02:33:55,600 --> 02:34:03,040
you know uh me and jean always has

4277
02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:05,520
neat stuff coming down the pike uh the

4278
02:34:03,040 --> 02:34:06,800
gene finder out at wilcox farms even

4279
02:34:05,520 --> 02:34:08,800
though you know he's exploring other

4280
02:34:06,799 --> 02:34:09,759
people's genetics so he's doing final

4281
02:34:08,799 --> 02:34:11,759
hunting

4282
02:34:09,760 --> 02:34:13,040
like no other so i wouldn't i can't

4283
02:34:11,760 --> 02:34:14,719
imagine that we wouldn't see something

4284
02:34:13,040 --> 02:34:18,240
amazing come out of his

4285
02:34:14,719 --> 02:34:20,000
his stable uh so you know there's

4286
02:34:18,239 --> 02:34:21,520
and you know even the guys at heroes you

4287
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:23,040
know those guys are constantly breeding

4288
02:34:21,520 --> 02:34:26,720
turning out good stuff so i don't know

4289
02:34:23,040 --> 02:34:28,640
if i could pick one particular uh

4290
02:34:26,719 --> 02:34:30,079
strain or something like that but you

4291
02:34:28,639 --> 02:34:33,599
know there's at least a short

4292
02:34:30,079 --> 02:34:37,520
list of some breeders and groups to

4293
02:34:33,600 --> 02:34:40,159
certainly pay attention to um you know

4294
02:34:37,520 --> 02:34:41,600
i'm sure something will come out of the

4295
02:34:40,159 --> 02:34:43,600
cookies family or

4296
02:34:41,600 --> 02:34:45,120
the terp hogs or whatever third gen or

4297
02:34:43,600 --> 02:34:46,559
whatever you know i'm sure

4298
02:34:45,120 --> 02:34:48,319
something really big will come out of

4299
02:34:46,559 --> 02:34:49,760
those grips but you know the ones that i

4300
02:34:48,318 --> 02:34:50,398
mentioned prior are the ones that i'm

4301
02:34:49,760 --> 02:34:51,840
really

4302
02:34:50,398 --> 02:34:53,840
paying attention and of course whatever

4303
02:34:51,840 --> 02:34:56,880
coastal does

4304
02:34:53,840 --> 02:34:58,719
yeah well that ties into the next one if

4305
02:34:56,879 --> 02:35:01,358
you could only pick one land race which

4306
02:34:58,719 --> 02:35:01,358
one would it be

4307
02:35:02,318 --> 02:35:09,279
well for me because of

4308
02:35:06,559 --> 02:35:10,959
the effect that i really am looking for

4309
02:35:09,280 --> 02:35:15,280
in cannabis

4310
02:35:10,959 --> 02:35:18,398
uh it'd have to be a land race afghani

4311
02:35:15,280 --> 02:35:21,760
and i can't say a particular one but uh

4312
02:35:18,398 --> 02:35:22,719
land race afghani for me yeah i'm in the

4313
02:35:21,760 --> 02:35:24,840
same boat

4314
02:35:22,719 --> 02:35:27,119
i love stevens but nothing beats a good

4315
02:35:24,840 --> 02:35:28,239
indica no i'm i'm with you i'm already a

4316
02:35:27,120 --> 02:35:30,160
little high strung so

4317
02:35:28,239 --> 02:35:32,079
too much sativa can you know make me a

4318
02:35:30,159 --> 02:35:35,200
little mm-hmm

4319
02:35:32,079 --> 02:35:37,920
okay yeah all righty so next one

4320
02:35:35,200 --> 02:35:39,760
what is the worst strain in your opinion

4321
02:35:37,920 --> 02:35:40,719
they've got some serious traction behind

4322
02:35:39,760 --> 02:35:44,239
it

4323
02:35:40,719 --> 02:35:46,559
cynics and i just don't get it

4324
02:35:44,239 --> 02:35:48,318
i mean and it has a close tie to here in

4325
02:35:46,559 --> 02:35:49,279
portland and some very close friends of

4326
02:35:48,318 --> 02:35:52,639
mine

4327
02:35:49,280 --> 02:35:54,960
um but it's just one that and

4328
02:35:52,639 --> 02:35:56,959
and loads of people love it around here

4329
02:35:54,959 --> 02:35:57,438
i just it's one of those ones that i

4330
02:35:56,959 --> 02:35:59,919
just

4331
02:35:57,439 --> 02:36:01,840
don't get i don't get it it's uh there's

4332
02:35:59,920 --> 02:36:03,120
just not much appeal to me personally

4333
02:36:01,840 --> 02:36:04,719
but once again we're dealing with

4334
02:36:03,120 --> 02:36:06,560
palettes and stuff like that and you

4335
02:36:04,719 --> 02:36:09,519
know some people

4336
02:36:06,559 --> 02:36:10,799
like you know i don't know escargot and

4337
02:36:09,520 --> 02:36:12,399
some people don't

4338
02:36:10,799 --> 02:36:14,239
some people like apples and some people

4339
02:36:12,398 --> 02:36:17,519
think they taste awful

4340
02:36:14,239 --> 02:36:19,359
so so you know it's so i get that part

4341
02:36:17,520 --> 02:36:21,280
of it but yeah that's one that's the one

4342
02:36:19,359 --> 02:36:22,880
strain for me that i just i've never

4343
02:36:21,280 --> 02:36:24,960
understood

4344
02:36:22,879 --> 02:36:26,079
okay so opposite end of the spectrum

4345
02:36:24,959 --> 02:36:28,079
desert island weed

4346
02:36:26,079 --> 02:36:31,520
you can only pick two strains for the

4347
02:36:28,079 --> 02:36:31,520
rest of your life what are they

4348
02:36:31,620 --> 02:36:37,600
[Music]

4349
02:36:33,920 --> 02:36:41,359
well the dog walker's definitely

4350
02:36:37,600 --> 02:36:43,280
with me for sure and if i was going to

4351
02:36:41,359 --> 02:36:46,559
couple that with something else

4352
02:36:43,280 --> 02:36:48,560
the lemon diesel uh

4353
02:36:46,559 --> 02:36:50,000
nice so what's what's the lineage on

4354
02:36:48,559 --> 02:36:51,600
that one the lemon

4355
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:53,439
d i don't know that's kind of one of

4356
02:36:51,600 --> 02:36:57,680
those mystery strains that

4357
02:36:53,439 --> 02:36:58,318
um nobody i've never gotten the full

4358
02:36:57,680 --> 02:37:00,000
lineage

4359
02:36:58,318 --> 02:37:03,119
um in fact there's only a few people who

4360
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:05,600
totally even cultivate it anymore

4361
02:37:03,120 --> 02:37:07,200
we called it the lemon d here in oregon

4362
02:37:05,600 --> 02:37:08,399
seems like it came out of the eugene

4363
02:37:07,200 --> 02:37:12,399
scene

4364
02:37:08,398 --> 02:37:15,439
um but just just a phenomenal just

4365
02:37:12,398 --> 02:37:18,559
amazing just sour lemon

4366
02:37:15,439 --> 02:37:19,200
flavor that just resonates for days on

4367
02:37:18,559 --> 02:37:23,039
the palette

4368
02:37:19,200 --> 02:37:24,479
i love it indoor or outdoor you can only

4369
02:37:23,040 --> 02:37:26,880
have one

4370
02:37:24,478 --> 02:37:26,879
endor

4371
02:37:28,318 --> 02:37:34,079
i love it there you go

4372
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:35,840
sorry one word answer there but yeah

4373
02:37:34,079 --> 02:37:39,439
yeah yeah that's it that's it

4374
02:37:35,840 --> 02:37:41,040
man after my own heart so yeah this one

4375
02:37:39,439 --> 02:37:42,800
you know probably going to be something

4376
02:37:41,040 --> 02:37:44,720
you don't sell but

4377
02:37:42,799 --> 02:37:47,840
what's the worst grow product you've

4378
02:37:44,719 --> 02:37:47,840
ever seen

4379
02:37:49,760 --> 02:37:54,239
the bio wave goddess you know what that

4380
02:37:53,120 --> 02:37:56,960
is

4381
02:37:54,239 --> 02:37:58,000
that's something that resonates

4382
02:37:56,959 --> 02:37:59,759
acoustics

4383
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:02,478
and then it's supposed to get rid of

4384
02:37:59,760 --> 02:38:04,159
bugs and increase your yields and

4385
02:38:02,478 --> 02:38:06,639
we sold a couple already this week it's

4386
02:38:04,159 --> 02:38:09,039
weird um it's been around for

4387
02:38:06,639 --> 02:38:11,519
i don't know it's been around for 10

4388
02:38:09,040 --> 02:38:12,640
years now 15 years in our industry and

4389
02:38:11,520 --> 02:38:15,040
it's just

4390
02:38:12,639 --> 02:38:16,959
you know it's just one of those junk

4391
02:38:15,040 --> 02:38:19,600
science

4392
02:38:16,959 --> 02:38:21,679
lots of uh you know no scientific data

4393
02:38:19,600 --> 02:38:23,200
to back it up devices and i'm sure some

4394
02:38:21,680 --> 02:38:26,000
people

4395
02:38:23,200 --> 02:38:26,960
you know see something who knows what

4396
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:29,520
but you know just

4397
02:38:26,959 --> 02:38:31,358
anecdotal evidence at best and kind of

4398
02:38:29,520 --> 02:38:32,720
tiled it is it's not one of those things

4399
02:38:31,359 --> 02:38:34,399
that look if this thing was so

4400
02:38:32,719 --> 02:38:36,239
groundbreaking and it was you know

4401
02:38:34,398 --> 02:38:37,760
increasing everybody big ag would have

4402
02:38:36,239 --> 02:38:40,000
these things all over the place and

4403
02:38:37,760 --> 02:38:42,559
guess where you don't see them big ag

4404
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:46,398
you know if something's really effective

4405
02:38:42,559 --> 02:38:49,600
those guys will have it first always

4406
02:38:46,398 --> 02:38:51,279
so final question what is the best thing

4407
02:38:49,600 --> 02:38:54,479
to happen to cannabis period

4408
02:38:51,280 --> 02:38:54,479
since you've been involved in it

4409
02:38:54,559 --> 02:38:59,439
medical cannabis medical cannabis for

4410
02:38:58,398 --> 02:39:03,519
sure

4411
02:38:59,439 --> 02:39:05,680
that was absolutely a huge turning point

4412
02:39:03,520 --> 02:39:08,560
i know for myself

4413
02:39:05,680 --> 02:39:10,159
um and a huge turning point for a lot of

4414
02:39:08,559 --> 02:39:10,478
individuals that i've been involved with

4415
02:39:10,159 --> 02:39:13,840
now

4416
02:39:10,478 --> 02:39:17,199
for you know a decade plus the

4417
02:39:13,840 --> 02:39:21,200
it it gave

4418
02:39:17,200 --> 02:39:23,760
it finally a little bit of

4419
02:39:21,200 --> 02:39:25,120
validation for the rest of the for the

4420
02:39:23,760 --> 02:39:26,398
rest of the country for the world for

4421
02:39:25,120 --> 02:39:28,960
that matter

4422
02:39:26,398 --> 02:39:29,760
so uh the the explosion of medical

4423
02:39:28,959 --> 02:39:32,398
cannabis

4424
02:39:29,760 --> 02:39:33,920
is definitely probably in my opinion the

4425
02:39:32,398 --> 02:39:36,719
best thing to come out of it

4426
02:39:33,920 --> 02:39:37,439
since i've started yeah what a great

4427
02:39:36,719 --> 02:39:38,799
answer

4428
02:39:37,439 --> 02:39:40,079
so i think that probably does just about

4429
02:39:38,799 --> 02:39:41,599
wrap it up did you have any comments or

4430
02:39:40,079 --> 02:39:43,920
shout outs you wanted to make

4431
02:39:41,600 --> 02:39:46,079
