00:01:42,438 --> 00:01:48,000
let's get into it

39
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:50,399
yeah it's it's pretty wild

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,060
just to jump back to some of the stuff

41
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,040
about David Sam because we we have had

42
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,719
over the years a plethora of pretty

43
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,040
interesting questions asked about him

44
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,618
which we've never really been able to

45
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,079
have answered I guess one of the ones I

46
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:06,420
was personally interested in is that

47
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:09,179
a lot of the stories around the strains

48
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,038
that have come out through David have

49
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,900
sometimes portrayed him as not really

50
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,579
the active breeder but more of like a

51
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,200
steward and in that regard I mean like

52
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,420
if you look at skunk there was often a

53
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:20,399
lot of credit given to Sacred seed and

54
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:22,699
if you look at Haze you know obviously

55
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,379
his neighbors kind of developed that one

56
00:02:22,699 --> 00:02:27,419
where do you see him in the picture of

57
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:28,799
like do you view him as the creator of

58
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:30,539
those strains or more of just someone

59
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,520
who brought them to the world

60
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:34,439
no he bred skunk one from scratch

61
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,420
anybody that says different just doesn't

62
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:38,039
know like Dave assembled that from

63
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:40,439
scratch

64
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:41,818
um Hayes you're right it was the these

65
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:43,378
two dudes that were known as the Hayes

66
00:02:41,818 --> 00:02:45,060
Brothers

67
00:02:43,378 --> 00:02:46,859
um

68
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,479
he tried to introduce me to them

69
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,980
actually one time in California and

70
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:52,619
there's three circumstances of the

71
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:55,619
meeting it didn't work out but

72
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:59,519
um they created the haze

73
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:02,280
um Mel Frank created or collected The

74
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,439
Afghani one and I think he also gave him

75
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,259
the turbine poison which came from Ed

76
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:10,318
Rosenthal which Ed Rosenthal actually

77
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:13,199
didn't collect in South Africa which is

78
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:14,759
the common belief of the story Ed got

79
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,738
them out of some flowers at a coffee

80
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:17,878
shop

81
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:19,920
um so that's the truth about where

82
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:22,079
Jordan poison came from it was out of

83
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,419
seeds at a coffee shop

84
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,760
um the California Orange David also

85
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:28,500
brought that one to California or sorry

86
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:31,318
to Holland but he collected that one

87
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:34,080
from a grower at a Harvest Festival

88
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:35,878
um and he you know Dave is is a member

89
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,060
of the you know the Seed Savers Club of

90
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:42,359
America like he is an insane collector

91
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:45,719
of plant seeds not just cannabis

92
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,340
and what he the story he told me is that

93
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:50,459
he met this grower up at a Harvest

94
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,799
Festival he had the California Orange

95
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:56,219
back then seeds there was no seed

96
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,659
business and they just didn't exist and

97
00:03:56,219 --> 00:04:00,299
but because David was an insane

98
00:03:57,658 --> 00:04:01,859
collector he said hey do you mind if I

99
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:04,140
get some of those seeds and can I work

100
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,120
with them can I breathe them out and

101
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:07,979
and play with them and the guy gave them

102
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,019
to him freely and he brought all those

103
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:12,060
things over to

104
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:14,158
um to Holland right so that's how the

105
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,858
whole Sam skunk band thing kind of

106
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:18,539
started over in Holland but everybody I

107
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:19,918
mean you look at Dutch Passion Scentsy

108
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,199
all their seed catalogs I mean it's

109
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,120
pretty clear that David was the person

110
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:25,500
that brought all those things so some of

111
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,660
them he created then some of them he

112
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,339
just ushered in

113
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,800
um

114
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:35,399
yeah and he made a lot of hybrids I mean

115
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,439
I helped him catalog his entire seed

116
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:40,079
collection which is

117
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:42,000
to my knowledge the largest cannabis

118
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:43,560
term plasm collection on the planet like

119
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,819
I don't know anybody that has a larger

120
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,459
one

121
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:49,019
and it's pretty impressive there's a lot

122
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:50,879
of stuff in there that the world doesn't

123
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:53,219
even know about

124
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:55,978
um just weird land races and weird

125
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,720
plants you know just with strange traits

126
00:04:55,978 --> 00:05:00,899
that people don't even think about

127
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:03,120
and uh it's all it's all there

128
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:05,579
but yeah I I give credit all the David

129
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,780
for that you know and he's he's more

130
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:08,519
than willing to you know he'll he'll

131
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:10,379
tell you straight up you know these ones

132
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:12,719
came from from Mel Frank these ones came

133
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:14,100
from so it's the Hayes Brothers they

134
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,720
hate I mean Hayes isn't even you know

135
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,639
everybody says oh hey is as if it's one

136
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,979
thing Hayes isn't one thing it's many

137
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,900
things it's a series of plants that were

138
00:05:19,978 --> 00:05:24,240
created over multiple Generations being

139
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:25,918
hybridized with one another and every

140
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,519
year they would add in a new cross into

141
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:31,740
the mix right so Hayes is really a

142
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:33,478
family of siblings and half siblings and

143
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,500
cousins

144
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:36,959
um

145
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,579
and there's many different types of the

146
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:39,839
haze there's the Purple Haze you know

147
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:42,599
obviously the Purple Haze there's all

148
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,339
these red and green hazes there's one

149
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,020
that was called Christmas haze there was

150
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:47,638
New Year's Haze right they were super

151
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:49,918
long flowering ones that weren't ready

152
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:51,360
until the new year

153
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:53,819
um

154
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,280
and they all are different variations of

155
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:59,579
hybrids between Mexican Thai

156
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:02,000
South Indian and a little bit of Afghani

157
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:04,978
at times

158
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,800
wow I mean so many different Avenues

159
00:06:04,978 --> 00:06:09,599
again to go into the the most pertinent

160
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,418
question to me is did you ever get to

161
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,680
try what some might call the real Haze

162
00:06:12,418 --> 00:06:15,478
even though you just explained there is

163
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,240
no one real Haze but you know often

164
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:20,279
people reminisce about Hayes but can't

165
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,800
exactly vouch that they've been able to

166
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:25,258
try verified Real Deal have you and what

167
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,579
was your experience if so yeah I've

168
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:28,560
tried a bunch of different things from

169
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:30,240
being over there you know and usually

170
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,639
they're hybrids of plants that were

171
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,019
David shared with people that were over

172
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,360
there I mean you know everybody's heard

173
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:38,818
of Neville's Hayes those were those were

174
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,800
David's non-preferred Haze plants that

175
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:43,800
he gave to Neville with the promise that

176
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,020
devil wouldn't reproduce them pure

177
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,879
right he said he said take these things

178
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:49,318
and make hybrids of them fine but please

179
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:51,000
just don't make them pure because I'm

180
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:54,479
selling them pure

181
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,759
and uh as people are wanting to do they

182
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:58,439
don't like to they don't like to do that

183
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:59,819
they'll tell you anything to get it in

184
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:01,199
their hands and then once they've got it

185
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:03,180
it's a whole different thing when they

186
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,740
can make money off of it

187
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,199
um but yeah they're it's just a family

188
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,060
of plants and really what we know now is

189
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,560
the hazes are mostly like you know the

190
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,000
Amnesia Haze that's really what you find

191
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,918
over in Holland

192
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,720
those are terpenolene plants they're

193
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:18,659
terpineline dominant plants so it's kind

194
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,919
of in the same family as train wreck

195
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,560
um or

196
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:24,839
I think the DNA guys sell it as what do

197
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,579
they call it like citrus skunk or lemon

198
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:28,379
skunk it's Lemon Skunk that's what it is

199
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:30,120
but Lemon Skunk actually everything so

200
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:31,740
it's high in limonene it's not it's high

201
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,560
interpanylene

202
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:36,780
right interpanylene to some people has a

203
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,899
little bit of a fresh lemon scent even

204
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:41,519
though it's to me it's more Piney

205
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:43,258
um so there's those and then there's the

206
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:45,180
the pinene plants which are a little

207
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:47,400
more rare and the limousine pining

208
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:50,519
plants as well and they all kind of fall

209
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:53,339
into that hazy family like where again

210
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:54,418
what I call equatorials right

211
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:57,119
yeah

212
00:07:54,418 --> 00:07:59,579
that's that's amazing I mean you kind of

213
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,660
just quickly alluded to Neville in the

214
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:02,579
mix there

215
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,860
I've always been interested by the fact

216
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:06,899
that he was Don the moniker of like the

217
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:10,080
king of hazes despite the fact he got

218
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:12,179
them from um David do you feel like that

219
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:13,800
was sort of like a misnomer the fact he

220
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,978
got that title and as a bit of a

221
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:19,319
follow-up do you feel like nl5 Haze is

222
00:08:16,978 --> 00:08:20,639
like a really good poster child for

223
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:22,919
Hayes because I think a lot of people

224
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,360
suggest that you know like the NL tames

225
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:27,060
the Hayes to the point where it's like

226
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,800
you can do it indoors do you feel like

227
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,120
there was actually a lot better but it

228
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,978
just you know it didn't really see the

229
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,560
light of day sort of thing

230
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:36,918
it made it more accessible for people to

231
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:40,859
grow but I wouldn't call the nl5 haze

232
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:42,838
like on its own Haze if you inbred it

233
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:45,659
you could pull out haze-like plants from

234
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:47,459
it but the nl5 haze is way too big for a

235
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:48,958
haze it's just got way too much biomass

236
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:51,539
and that's the influence of the

237
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:53,338
afghanica in there

238
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:56,819
um

239
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:58,260
so yeah it's the hazes are very like I

240
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,060
said they're very equatorial they're

241
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:03,000
they're very long flowering they're very

242
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:04,919
thin leaves they're very low yield

243
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,539
um small resin glands they don't have a

244
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:08,879
ton of scent like they'd probably fail

245
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:10,439
the one percent chirp test at least the

246
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:12,360
old ones were they they'd need to be

247
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,920
improved

248
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,019
um

249
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:19,199
but they did have a nice headspace right

250
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:21,839
they did provide that nice clear kind of

251
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,879
effect and and you know what people call

252
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,560
the ceiling where you could or ceiling

253
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:27,539
lists where you can keep consuming them

254
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:29,699
and getting higher and higher

255
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:32,879
I think again it's like because they

256
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:34,500
weren't 25 THC and you could smoke them

257
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:37,379
without burning out

258
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,940
right THC is by it's got a biphasic

259
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:41,220
effect so at small doses it's

260
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:44,220
invigorating but at large doses it makes

261
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:46,139
you lethargic and kind of feel

262
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:48,000
like I don't know I don't know if

263
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:50,100
there's a better word for it than thud

264
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,019
you know it just kind of like it just

265
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,540
kind of like takes it out of you

266
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:56,519
and if you've ever done large doses of

267
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:57,659
Edibles I mean it's kind of a similar

268
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:59,399
feeling

269
00:09:57,659 --> 00:10:01,199
um and then we see that not only in

270
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:04,019
humans but also in rats you know if you

271
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,580
look at the Neuroscience of cannabinoids

272
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:08,519
and administration

273
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:11,580
at a certain point in time people you

274
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:13,560
know you get energetic

275
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,540
on a curve and you get to a point where

276
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:17,159
it plateaus and then the more you

277
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:19,679
consume that you're actually going down

278
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:23,159
not getting up anymore

279
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:25,739
so and I mean how do you feel the

280
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:28,079
comparison between Netherlands and

281
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:30,120
diabetes given that I think a lot of the

282
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,920
time and I'm probably guilty of this

283
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,259
myself people hold Neville in a bit

284
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:36,719
higher regard or maybe feel he maybe

285
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:38,338
contributed more do you feel like that's

286
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,820
maybe inaccurate and what's your

287
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:45,000
thoughts on Neville in general

288
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:47,660
oh can I say don't speak ill of the Dead

289
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,659
sure

290
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:54,539
yeah Neville is a controversial person

291
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:55,379
in the Cannabis world let's put it that

292
00:10:54,539 --> 00:10:57,000
way

293
00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:59,338
and

294
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,139
he took some risks that David wouldn't

295
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:03,240
risk I mean you remember David's

296
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:05,519
American Neville's Australian

297
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,980
and so when Dave produce moved to

298
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,139
Holland

299
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:12,240
you know he knew that the the United

300
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:13,500
States was a machine right and that they

301
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,079
were all these systems in the United

302
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:18,600
States that were part of the machine and

303
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:20,219
that if you wanted to stick

304
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,019
if you want if you wanted to throw a

305
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,700
stick in the wrenches of the operation

306
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:25,500
of the American machine that they're

307
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,360
they're going to come for you

308
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,578
and so David never did any business and

309
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,620
once he left he didn't he didn't he

310
00:11:29,578 --> 00:11:33,479
wasn't involved in in doing business in

311
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,278
the states Neville did

312
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,539
right Neville set up someone in the

313
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,519
states and I was actually doing

314
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:40,860
distribution I don't mind saying this

315
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:42,539
now that he's passed but you know he he

316
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:44,459
actually set up seeds they were shipping

317
00:11:42,539 --> 00:11:46,379
them over from Holland and I think soup

318
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:49,379
containers

319
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:50,820
labeled Soup cans and they had someone

320
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:52,320
that was actually Distributing so the

321
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:54,420
money would come from hot from the

322
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,500
states that would collect the money and

323
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:58,799
then they'd get the seeds would be

324
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:01,078
shipped back out of the states

325
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:03,240
um and that's why the the DEA went after

326
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:05,639
Neville because something happened and

327
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,320
the plot became known and they went for

328
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:08,278
him

329
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,620
um

330
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:13,799
he was a smart guy like I I actually

331
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:15,299
didn't know him too well personally

332
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:16,919
um I tried to interact with a couple of

333
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:21,559
times and he was

334
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:21,559
uh let's say he wasn't receptive to it

335
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,420
um

336
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,399
but same with you know same with Scott

337
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:29,219
like I I have a really good relationship

338
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,500
with Scott I got a lot of respect for

339
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,579
the work that Scott has done Shanti Baba

340
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,039
I mean

341
00:12:32,578 --> 00:12:37,500
um for Mr Nice Seed Company

342
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:39,778
but

343
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,519
for some reason people people want to be

344
00:12:39,778 --> 00:12:43,320
divisive in the Cannabis community so

345
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,299
this like they kind of put themselves

346
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:48,300
either in the the Scott camp or the

347
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:49,620
Neville camp or the David camp and if

348
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:51,120
you're in one Camp then you can't be

349
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:54,659
friends with everybody else and I'm not

350
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,860
like that like I you know I I try to be

351
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:57,480
friends with everybody in the space

352
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,800
because it's like they're all they've

353
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,200
all got interesting histories and

354
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:03,958
they've all got lessons to teach

355
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,519
and I just want to understand the plant

356
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:08,099
from their perspective because I mean

357
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,240
there are Elders right

358
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,980
um

359
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,740
and so George Cervantes actually

360
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:15,240
introduced me to to Scott

361
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,740
and I think Scott was kind of

362
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,600
apprehensive of me at first because he

363
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,579
was like oh you're that Chimera guy and

364
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,100
you know you're in the other camp and

365
00:13:20,578 --> 00:13:26,159
you know we got past that pretty quick

366
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:28,019
he he came to realize that I you know

367
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:30,179
I wasn't any threat to him I wasn't I

368
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:31,620
Had No Malice towards him at all in fact

369
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:33,599
I respected him for the works that he

370
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:36,120
would be done and we we developed kind

371
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,278
of a mutual respect thing but he had

372
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,200
really been poisoned by Neville right

373
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:42,720
because Neville had said it had told him

374
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:46,139
all these awful stories about about

375
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,278
David this weren't true

376
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:49,200
um

377
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:50,578
and he's and he used to tell me oh yeah

378
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,440
but he works for the D.A and he doesn't

379
00:13:50,578 --> 00:13:55,078
I was like Scott dude that's just not

380
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,940
that's not the way it is man like

381
00:13:55,078 --> 00:13:59,159
you know so I think that you know and

382
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:01,680
and truthfully you know you probably

383
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:03,179
know Mr Nice Seed company which at one

384
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:05,458
point in time was Neville Scott that

385
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:07,019
that kind of went you know Neville

386
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:08,219
towards the end he wasn't involved with

387
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:10,679
it anymore

388
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:12,839
right and they they had parted ways a

389
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:14,638
bit too because well just because of

390
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:17,339
stuff that I'm not going to get into but

391
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,659
I think that the internet with the

392
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:20,700
internet especially you know the

393
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:23,278
Cannabis Community for a period of time

394
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:26,160
existed only on the internet right we

395
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:27,919
couldn't interact with each other

396
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:29,939
um

397
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:31,799
one-to-one on person and the internet

398
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,639
the internet and overgrow and all these

399
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:34,799
other

400
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,320
websites that we used to use you know

401
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:39,419
cannabis world all that kind of stuff

402
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,399
they provided an opportunity for people

403
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:43,139
to reach out and connect with each other

404
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:45,419
in a way

405
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:47,159
that we couldn't do before I mean it

406
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:48,899
just those Technologies didn't exist and

407
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:50,759
it was a really great thing for that but

408
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:53,100
the really bad thing about it

409
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:55,500
was that there's just there's become all

410
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,899
this nonsense stories that people have

411
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,339
made and promulgated I mean you can go

412
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:01,799
to Wikipedia and read about a whole

413
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:03,300
bunch of nonsense about David and you

414
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:04,829
know on the Wikipedia stuff like it's

415
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:06,120
somehow fact and it's just not

416
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:09,379
[Music]

417
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,379
um and for whatever reason

418
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:14,159
those things have really resonated in

419
00:15:12,539 --> 00:15:16,860
the Cannabis Community right because

420
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:19,319
again we're so as a whole we're so

421
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:21,360
anti-science we're so anti-big Pharma

422
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,860
we're against the man right because

423
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,539
again we've been kicked in the teeth by

424
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:27,000
the police and the justice system for 50

425
00:15:24,539 --> 00:15:30,958
60 years so it's natural that we have

426
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,759
all those those fears but I think in on

427
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:34,849
the internet forums they really Fester

428
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:36,198
into this like psychotic

429
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:40,019
[Music]

430
00:15:36,198 --> 00:15:42,059
untrusting place of like really what

431
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:43,980
just becomes mostly lies you know I read

432
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:46,198
stuff on the internet

433
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:48,000
that I know for a fact didn't go down

434
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:49,500
that way because I was there

435
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,899
right but I'm reading it on the internet

436
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:56,278
as if it's fact by some guy posting it

437
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:58,919
as if it's like gospel from God's mouth

438
00:15:56,278 --> 00:16:00,659
um so in a way while the internet really

439
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:02,519
helped us get the seeds out and and

440
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:05,100
spread the message and teach people how

441
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:06,778
to grow and even teaching people how to

442
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,399
breed and and some more advanced stuff

443
00:16:06,778 --> 00:16:10,139
about cannabis

444
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,600
there's been a lot of negativity that's

445
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:15,360
come out of it that's that's you know I

446
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,040
think frustrates I know it frustrates a

447
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,778
lot of the old-timers and myself as

448
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:20,578
included

449
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:22,139
and it gets to the point where it's just

450
00:16:20,578 --> 00:16:23,638
like you don't even want to do it

451
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:26,100
anymore like you don't want to post and

452
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:27,659
share the information because all you're

453
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,159
met with is people telling you that

454
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:31,139
you're a liar and that you work with a

455
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:33,360
DEA or that you know it's just all this

456
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:34,379
nonsense and it's it's really it's kind

457
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,659
of a shame

458
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:40,320
because it's done a disservice to the

459
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:41,039
history of cannabis right

460
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,980
um

461
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:46,379
and so I've I've always when I've

462
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,519
been over in Europe and I've tried to

463
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:49,620
meet all these different folks in the

464
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,179
industry I really just want to meet them

465
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,560
all and understand but what their

466
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:54,838
perspectives are for cannabis because

467
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:56,159
I'm interested in the history like I

468
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:58,139
guess kind of like we're doing with this

469
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:01,259
talk now but I'm interested in the

470
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:03,240
history and the reasons why people were

471
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:04,980
doing it and the motivations and how

472
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,439
they got their start

473
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:09,779
and

474
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,240
there's been in the Cannabis industry a

475
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:14,220
lot of smoke and mirrors

476
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,838
um and I really hope that that goes away

477
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,578
and now we're going to see the next

478
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:19,500
generation of people that are they're

479
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:21,480
able to be open and honest they're able

480
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:24,119
to show their work they're able to teach

481
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,798
the Next Generation how to do it better

482
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:27,539
and so I really do feel like quite

483
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:28,980
hopeful for cannabis and positive for

484
00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:30,839
cannabis

485
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:33,179
um in the next 20 years

486
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:34,439
and I really look forward to you know I

487
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:36,419
was talking to a friend from England the

488
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,400
other day and Guernsey one of the little

489
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:40,200
islands off the necessity or Southern

490
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,440
whatever it's called the

491
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:45,000
what is it the Bay of uh Bay of Biscay

492
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,440
they're all

493
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,779
you know they're talking about

494
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,880
legalizing a full adult use model and

495
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:52,440
just off the coast of England they're a

496
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,660
British colony

497
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,340
or protectorate or whatever it is but

498
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:58,740
I'd love to see them legalize I'd love

499
00:17:56,339 --> 00:18:00,959
to see Australia and you know New

500
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:02,279
Zealand legalize really actually the

501
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,419
whole Commonwealth just legalized

502
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:05,099
straight off the bat that would be a

503
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:07,860
nice Quick Start

504
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:09,240
and then the rest of the the world will

505
00:18:07,859 --> 00:18:10,439
eventually catch on and I think that

506
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,720
that's going to be

507
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,700
great for so many reasons it'll probably

508
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,620
lessen the impact that alcohol the

509
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,960
negative impacts that alcohol have on

510
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:20,579
society

511
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,200
um and there's just so many benefits

512
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:23,639
that can come with it you know you know

513
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,558
all about the medical aspects and

514
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,000
everything I mean I'm not going to sit

515
00:18:25,558 --> 00:18:30,000
here and preach to the converted but

516
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,819
it's you know cannabis can do a lot of

517
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,200
benefit for society

518
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:37,079
um

519
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,940
you know we we've seen this with the you

520
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:40,558
know the British soccer hooligans that

521
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,820
used to go you know they'd go to

522
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:43,139
different countries and there'd always

523
00:18:41,819 --> 00:18:45,418
be these brawls and fights with

524
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:47,280
everybody getting drunk and when they'd

525
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:49,200
play Amsterdam or they'd play Holland

526
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:53,279
and Amsterdam that wouldn't happen

527
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,960
because everybody was stoned you know

528
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:56,759
um so there's a lot of good that can

529
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,000
come from Cannabis and Society is using

530
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:01,500
cannabis and it would be great to see a

531
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,240
lot of Neville's old work being grown

532
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,038
down in Australia I mean Australia's Got

533
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,960
a great climate for these equatorial

534
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:08,819
plants

535
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,019
um and it's a shame that it's you know

536
00:19:08,819 --> 00:19:12,000
they're still throwing people in jail

537
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:15,418
there it's nuts

538
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,220
yeah definitely definitely and many

539
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:19,140
points resonating with what you just

540
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:21,600
said but I I feel like it is such a

541
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:23,340
shame that we do still have this kind of

542
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:25,619
culture in the scene of like being

543
00:19:23,339 --> 00:19:26,639
attached to one camp and you can't just

544
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:28,739
kind of

545
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,538
try to be okay with everyone you know

546
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:33,720
because as you've alluded to that's

547
00:19:30,538 --> 00:19:36,419
through being able to kind of float in

548
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:38,279
between the rift so to speak I feel like

549
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:40,799
that's how the truth can come out and

550
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:42,538
you can avoid these sort of issues like

551
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:44,879
you mentioned with Scott thinking that

552
00:19:42,538 --> 00:19:47,519
Dave was a part of the DEA and whatnot

553
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,799
and it's kind of sad that the three

554
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:52,619
arguably the three big pillars in terms

555
00:19:49,798 --> 00:19:54,418
of like Scott Neville and Dave weren't

556
00:19:52,619 --> 00:19:56,819
able to kind of keep it all together

557
00:19:54,419 --> 00:20:00,360
because it's kind of this fragmentation

558
00:19:56,819 --> 00:20:02,879
sort of thing you alluded to but just to

559
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:05,099
to jump back to day for one moment

560
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,720
something which has been asked probably

561
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:07,980
more so than any other question about

562
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,140
him which I would love to get your

563
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:12,000
perspective on is did he ever talk to

564
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:14,220
you about his thoughts and whether he

565
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,019
intentionally ever changed skunk from

566
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:18,058
what people would say was like the

567
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:20,099
stinky early version to the sweet and

568
00:20:18,058 --> 00:20:21,178
like what's your overall perspective on

569
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:23,219
that

570
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:25,140
yeah he loved the Swede I mean that's

571
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,940
just what he that's that was the end of

572
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:29,940
the spectrum the first few Generations

573
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:31,320
it had some stanky plants in there

574
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:33,120
um but those weren't the ones that he

575
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:36,298
preferred and so like all breeders do

576
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:37,798
they select towards the type that they

577
00:20:36,298 --> 00:20:39,660
like

578
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:41,099
um gotta keep in mind the context of the

579
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:43,558
years too that was going on like late

580
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:45,779
70s early 80s we're gonna call it mid to

581
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:48,480
late 70s early 80s

582
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:49,619
um skunk weed back then man you go to

583
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,419
jail

584
00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:53,099
right it's like you're stinking out the

585
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:55,140
whole neighborhood and

586
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:56,519
so they would he selected away from that

587
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,919
and that was just part of his choice

588
00:20:56,519 --> 00:21:00,779
because he liked the resins from the

589
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:02,220
other these other plants better right

590
00:21:00,779 --> 00:21:04,259
they made of they made what he

591
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:07,079
considered a finer hash David wasn't

592
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:09,779
David you know since many many many

593
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:11,759
years ago is not a cannabis flower

594
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:14,220
consumer he's a he's a passion

595
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:16,640
concentrate consumer and he used to have

596
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:19,259
the finest hash in the world right

597
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:22,140
everybody called the 50 and it was like

598
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:24,359
50 plus THC it would turn to liquid as

599
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:26,580
soon as you put a flame to it it was the

600
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:28,199
first dabble you know concentrate

601
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:30,658
extract that I'd ever seen that before

602
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:34,038
dabs were even a thing and and he had

603
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:34,039
that that level of quality

604
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,798
um

605
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:39,658
so again he selected the plants that he

606
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:41,639
liked for that purpose and that's what

607
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:43,380
he did right so that's why skunk is the

608
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,940
way it is everybody talks about the

609
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,080
Terps and skunk it's actually not a

610
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:48,900
terpene it's so there's there's there's

611
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:51,178
rare there's rare volatiles that the

612
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,798
plant produce that the plant produces

613
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:54,179
that have to do with smell or they

614
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:55,859
influence smell

615
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:57,360
and so terpenes everybody thinks that

616
00:21:55,859 --> 00:21:59,639
terpenes is the whole story but they're

617
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:01,619
actually not they're they're one of the

618
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,360
major factors in the scent but there are

619
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:06,359
a few other chemicals that when they get

620
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:08,519
mixed in with these terpenes they

621
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:11,219
they're kind of like I call them scent

622
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:13,918
or flavor modifiers right and they

623
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:17,579
actually use some of these compounds

624
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:19,380
um in the perfume industry to change the

625
00:22:17,579 --> 00:22:21,720
flavors of or sorry to change the sense

626
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,340
of different perfumes in the in the

627
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,819
community at the moment there's this

628
00:22:23,339 --> 00:22:28,980
really kind of popular drive to find the

629
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:31,439
road kill skunk you know my thoughts are

630
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:34,140
that it's most likely gone and touching

631
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,298
on a point you just made some of the

632
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:38,880
smells around this sort of quote

633
00:22:36,298 --> 00:22:40,798
roadkill skunk I've got to believe that

634
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,840
they're kind of more thile based you

635
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:45,058
know sulfur-based compounds and maybe

636
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:47,279
not even technically falling under this

637
00:22:45,058 --> 00:22:48,599
strict definition of a terpene do you

638
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:50,099
think that's the case or do you think

639
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:51,779
that the other point of view might have

640
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:54,298
some Credence to it where it's that

641
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:56,519
there's a bit of like rose shade glasses

642
00:22:54,298 --> 00:22:58,980
and maybe it wasn't really like a skunk

643
00:22:56,519 --> 00:23:00,298
dead down the road sort of thing where

644
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,980
do you sit on that one

645
00:23:00,298 --> 00:23:03,658
well I'll tell you a story that might

646
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,819
tell you I've got a plant that is very

647
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:07,980
very roadkill-like I've got a few of

648
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:09,538
them actually but one of them is a

649
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:12,120
terpineline dominant plant so it's

650
00:23:09,538 --> 00:23:13,798
actually of the same flavor profile or

651
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:15,959
that what we call the flavor class so

652
00:23:13,798 --> 00:23:18,900
flavor class is like they have a general

653
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,279
terpene profile Arrangement that is kind

654
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,440
of a fingerprint

655
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:23,940
and then there's like all these

656
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,220
different plants that kind of fall into

657
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:28,919
that grouping and so this particular

658
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:32,220
plant is a is a terpineline plant and so

659
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:34,799
up close and when you're it's right in

660
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:37,400
your nose it's got that Lemon Skunk kind

661
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:37,400
of like

662
00:23:38,339 --> 00:23:42,240
um we have a product here called Mr

663
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:45,360
Clean Pine I don't know if you have that

664
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,038
in Australia but um it's a it's a

665
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:49,019
concentrated liquid cleaner that you add

666
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:50,879
to water to wash the floors and that's

667
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:52,980
got this real that's a terpenolene kind

668
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,440
of smell to it

669
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,700
but when you so when you have the

670
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,798
flowers and they're up close and you're

671
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,960
breaking it up that's what you smell but

672
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:02,579
I remember harvesting a couple of

673
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,440
um a couple of rooms of this stuff and I

674
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:06,658
I was moving it across town and my bet

675
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,919
in in my knapsack and there was

676
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:10,020
something going on with my car at the

677
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,759
time and I was like decided I was going

678
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:14,158
to get on the bus and go across town

679
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:17,158
with these with these these bags of dope

680
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,780
in my knapsack all sealed up really well

681
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:20,580
and I got on the front of the bus and

682
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:22,259
walked to the back you know halfway to

683
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:24,599
the back of the bus essentially got to

684
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:26,879
the backs of the doors and I remember

685
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:29,158
someone just saying do you smell that it

686
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,679
reeks like a skunk

687
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:33,659
and uh and I just promptly got off the

688
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,580
bus and walked home across town rather

689
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:38,039
than taking the bus

690
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:40,500
um but the point of the story is that

691
00:24:38,038 --> 00:24:42,240
the smell that you smell when it's right

692
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,798
up close is different than the smell

693
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,298
that you smell when it's in the bag and

694
00:24:43,798 --> 00:24:46,679
yeah you'd come into a room and you'd

695
00:24:45,298 --> 00:24:49,079
open it up and it would be like it

696
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:51,419
smells like a skunk and it does have a

697
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:52,740
reminiscent nose of a skunk but when you

698
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:55,320
actually get it out and you grind it up

699
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:57,480
it doesn't right it's actually different

700
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:59,639
and now I I know there's going to be 100

701
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,740
people online telling me that I have no

702
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:03,360
idea what I'm talking about and that

703
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,859
know the stuff that they had it was a

704
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:06,538
skunk right down to the end of the joint

705
00:25:04,859 --> 00:25:08,339
and all that kind of stuff fine maybe it

706
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:10,798
was maybe it was just higher in these

707
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:13,019
compounds but I think that

708
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:15,418
um you know I I know for a fact in

709
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:17,940
having had access to these chemicals to

710
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:20,340
make terpene standards and things when

711
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:24,480
the when you have a molecule at one drop

712
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:26,459
versus you know one one like for example

713
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,720
say you've got one microliter of a

714
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,798
substance and you put it on a piece of

715
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,778
paper

716
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:32,278
and you take the same substance and you

717
00:25:30,778 --> 00:25:34,140
put 10 times as much on a different

718
00:25:32,278 --> 00:25:35,278
piece of paper they smell different same

719
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:37,020
substance

720
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:37,798
right so there's something to do with

721
00:25:37,019 --> 00:25:40,259
like

722
00:25:37,798 --> 00:25:42,538
at like maybe like with that with THC

723
00:25:40,259 --> 00:25:45,538
and the by phasic response that we also

724
00:25:42,538 --> 00:25:48,839
have these responses in our nose right

725
00:25:45,538 --> 00:25:51,839
that like you know one molecule of a of

726
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:54,178
a smelly compound is enough to trigger a

727
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:56,220
certain effect in your nose and more it

728
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:58,640
might elicit a different response again

729
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:01,558
knowing that each of us have different

730
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,940
neurochemistry and smell is also based

731
00:26:01,558 --> 00:26:04,500
on neurochemistry right it's just a

732
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:06,058
chemical signal that's being transferred

733
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,919
to your brain

734
00:26:06,058 --> 00:26:11,158
and uh

735
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:12,778
so yeah I think it's it's it's partly

736
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:14,400
something to do with that and I don't

737
00:26:12,778 --> 00:26:16,200
know what the true answer is but there's

738
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,419
something in that whole thing and then

739
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,340
there's always something to

740
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:22,020
you know nostalgia

741
00:26:20,339 --> 00:26:23,579
right the weed that you had that one

742
00:26:22,019 --> 00:26:25,079
time when you were with your best friend

743
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:27,798
at the lake

744
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:31,019
it's like those things all influence

745
00:26:27,798 --> 00:26:34,798
your perception of the experience

746
00:26:31,019 --> 00:26:37,798
right yeah hugely hugely

747
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:40,259
and looking back on it it's pretty easy

748
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:42,538
to say no no that was skunk Weed Man I

749
00:26:40,259 --> 00:26:43,740
mean it smelled like a skunk but I bet

750
00:26:42,538 --> 00:26:45,538
you if you were able to transport

751
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:47,038
someone back in time and make them smile

752
00:26:45,538 --> 00:26:50,278
the same thing they wouldn't smell the

753
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:51,839
same thing again like you know I don't

754
00:26:50,278 --> 00:26:53,220
know if you're interested if you like

755
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:55,019
beer or anything but I know when I was a

756
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:56,819
kid period to me it used to smell like

757
00:26:55,019 --> 00:26:59,158
skunk it doesn't smell like skunk to me

758
00:26:56,819 --> 00:27:01,678
now right it's because that I've learned

759
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:04,200
to appreciate the different notes that

760
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:07,759
exist within the context and it's the

761
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,759
same with weed right like part of

762
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,620
part of smelling things is like knowing

763
00:27:11,819 --> 00:27:16,339
how to break apart the effect because

764
00:27:13,619 --> 00:27:19,139
again you're not smelling one chemical

765
00:27:16,339 --> 00:27:22,379
you're smelling a symphony of chemicals

766
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:24,480
right and the total of those it like a

767
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:27,059
symphony of of musical notes like the

768
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,480
totality of the orchestra

769
00:27:27,058 --> 00:27:33,240
is what makes the sound you're not

770
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:36,360
listening to the flute right or or the

771
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,859
oboe for example right it's the totality

772
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:40,979
of the whole thing together that you

773
00:27:37,859 --> 00:27:43,139
hear and and being able to train your

774
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,579
ear you know in the context of a

775
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:47,100
symphony being able to train your ear to

776
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:49,139
pick out the oboe or the the bass guitar

777
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:52,079
or whatever it is like that takes a

778
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:53,759
little bit of a skill and and training

779
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:55,859
in time and it's the same thing with the

780
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:58,200
with your nose and cannabis like when we

781
00:27:55,859 --> 00:28:01,079
smell cannabis we're smelling this

782
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:03,259
Orchestra of molecules that come

783
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:06,178
together that come together to create

784
00:28:03,259 --> 00:28:08,220
what we perceive as an experience right

785
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:10,620
but

786
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:13,319
when you when you have the individual

787
00:28:10,619 --> 00:28:16,739
chemicals at your disposal and you can

788
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:19,980
smell limonene on its own or osamine on

789
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:22,380
its own or beta carry offline or I can

790
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:24,599
list you know another any one of the the

791
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:27,240
really 30 major Terps that are that are

792
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:29,339
in cannabis

793
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,919
then we have

794
00:28:29,339 --> 00:28:35,699
a language that we can agree on like for

795
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:37,380
example you know if we're sitting in a

796
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,880
park and we look up the sky you and I

797
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,740
can both point at the sky and say okay

798
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,960
that's blue do we agree yeah that's blue

799
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:44,940
the clouds are white the leaves on the

800
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,558
grass or the leaves you know in the

801
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:48,900
grass or on the trees are green that

802
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:50,819
flower is yellow right and we can have

803
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,919
we can have a shared experience because

804
00:28:50,819 --> 00:28:54,480
we're both looking at the same thing and

805
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:57,360
then we're applying a label to that

806
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,519
thing that we're looking at right

807
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:02,459
we don't have that ability with terpenes

808
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:03,900
or with with scents without having the

809
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:06,538
individual chemicals and that's why

810
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:09,538
people say stuff like oh it smells

811
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:12,720
incense here it smells like roses or it

812
00:29:09,538 --> 00:29:15,179
smells like you know X Y or Zed right

813
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:18,179
the rose actually smells like geraniol

814
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:20,278
right or or the lavender smells like

815
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:22,380
linole but we don't know what those

816
00:29:20,278 --> 00:29:25,140
individual components smell like so it's

817
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:27,419
hard for us to have that consensus where

818
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:29,820
we point to one thing and say this is

819
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:32,580
this and only when you actually get the

820
00:29:29,819 --> 00:29:36,480
individual terpenes or the individual

821
00:29:32,579 --> 00:29:38,939
notes on their own can you then

822
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,679
we can then both share the same vial and

823
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:42,960
smell it you know in a socially

824
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:46,080
distancing manner we can both share it

825
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,519
and say okay this is linolol this is

826
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:49,439
limonene

827
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,179
you know this is osamine or whatever

828
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,558
terpene you want to choose

829
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:54,059
you know people are always blown away

830
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:55,440
when I show them pure limousine they're

831
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:56,759
like it doesn't smell like lemons you're

832
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,679
right no it doesn't smell like lemons it

833
00:29:56,759 --> 00:30:00,240
smells like orange peels yes but

834
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:02,880
everybody assumes it smells like lemons

835
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,798
right yeah yeah I got a bottle of

836
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,778
limonene in my fridge and I I do the

837
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:08,879
same little thing to people

838
00:30:06,778 --> 00:30:11,579
yeah it's great because then it and

839
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,440
what's that that's about is building a

840
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:15,599
consensus of the words that we use to

841
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,399
describe these things right rather than

842
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:19,199
trying to describe them by referring to

843
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:22,079
some other thing

844
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,819
right which again is it's on itself like

845
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:26,579
it was like oh it smells like roses well

846
00:30:23,819 --> 00:30:28,500
roses are also a symphony of smell right

847
00:30:26,579 --> 00:30:30,178
they're a symphony of notes that make up

848
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,500
the overall scent that we perceive as

849
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:33,600
one thing

850
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:35,819
right and so until you have the ability

851
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:38,158
to learn the individual components of

852
00:30:35,819 --> 00:30:40,439
that smell it's really hard to

853
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,940
communicate on things because we just we

854
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:44,100
don't have a Common Language like that

855
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:47,159
like we do for colors

856
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:49,259
yeah of course of course I think yeah

857
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:50,880
just a point you touched on which I I

858
00:30:49,259 --> 00:30:53,519
really struggle to try to get through to

859
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,020
people at times is how like chemicals at

860
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:57,000
different concentrations have different

861
00:30:55,019 --> 00:31:00,058
smells and like I try to make it simple

862
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,278
to understand by talking about like um

863
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:04,019
like ozone you know the smell after rain

864
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:06,359
Patrol

865
00:31:04,019 --> 00:31:08,460
um like it's sweet in low concentrations

866
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:11,099
but if you get a big jar of ozone it's

867
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:13,259
it's it's it smells horrible

868
00:31:11,099 --> 00:31:16,019
um yeah but yeah I guess it is a bit of

869
00:31:13,259 --> 00:31:18,298
a concept to wrap your head around

870
00:31:16,019 --> 00:31:20,158
um I'd love to jump into some more kind

871
00:31:18,298 --> 00:31:21,599
of technical breeding stuff at this

872
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,100
point because I think that's an area

873
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:24,980
you're going to be able to provide a

874
00:31:23,099 --> 00:31:27,538
really great amount of insight into

875
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:28,980
something I've always wondered about is

876
00:31:27,538 --> 00:31:31,919
I think it might have been a forum post

877
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:33,960
but somewhere along the line Dave wrote

878
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:37,080
an article about how he reversed some

879
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:40,079
males and got female seeds out of got

880
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:42,720
seeds out of it and 25 of those seeds

881
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:45,000
were females would you ever consider

882
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,038
doing this sort of project effect if say

883
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,898
you only had one male and you wanted to

884
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,339
like lie and breed it out and get some

885
00:31:48,898 --> 00:31:53,158
females out of it or do you think it's

886
00:31:50,339 --> 00:31:55,439
just too much of an effort

887
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:58,559
uh no it's not it's not too much of an

888
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,240
effort it's actually not that hard to do

889
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:02,940
um it's no harder than or no different

890
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,919
really than making feminized seeds with

891
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:06,419
STS

892
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:08,220
um

893
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:09,778
there's some there's some challenges in

894
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:11,100
working with the populations again you

895
00:32:09,778 --> 00:32:13,579
got to understand about the plant

896
00:32:11,099 --> 00:32:13,579
breeding

897
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:18,058
to be perfectly Frank they need to bring

898
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:20,278
it all to cut around the whole

899
00:32:18,058 --> 00:32:21,960
discussion and go right to the end

900
00:32:20,278 --> 00:32:24,058
I think

901
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:27,360
and this might be controversial to some

902
00:32:24,058 --> 00:32:29,158
people I think that male cannabis plants

903
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:31,798
in the drug breeding world are probably

904
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:32,820
on their way out

905
00:32:31,798 --> 00:32:35,339
um

906
00:32:32,819 --> 00:32:37,139
if you make all female seeds or

907
00:32:35,339 --> 00:32:39,058
gynocious seeds I don't again I don't

908
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:40,740
like to use the word feminized but if

909
00:32:39,058 --> 00:32:41,819
you use gynocious seeds right you make

910
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:44,399
them right

911
00:32:41,819 --> 00:32:46,019
they're every bit as good as

912
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:48,298
regular seeds in fact they're better

913
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:49,859
than regular seeds

914
00:32:48,298 --> 00:32:51,778
um

915
00:32:49,859 --> 00:32:53,398
for a couple of reasons the obvious

916
00:32:51,778 --> 00:32:54,839
reason that in your next Generation you

917
00:32:53,398 --> 00:32:56,099
don't have to worry about dealing with a

918
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:57,898
bunch of males

919
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:59,759
right I mean truthfully if you're

920
00:32:57,898 --> 00:33:01,139
growing out a thousand plants and 500

921
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:03,119
that are males that's a big waste of

922
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:05,100
time and space

923
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:06,658
you know the resources to pull them out

924
00:33:05,099 --> 00:33:09,418
even if you're using genetic uh

925
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:11,399
sequencing or PCR based method to

926
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:13,500
identify the males at the beginning

927
00:33:11,398 --> 00:33:15,898
that's a that's a cost right like it's

928
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:17,579
not free to do that it costs money it

929
00:33:15,898 --> 00:33:19,379
costs money to plant them it costs time

930
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:21,720
to plant them it costs money in terms of

931
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:24,419
nutrients and soil and space in your

932
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:26,640
grow room and all that kind of stuff

933
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:28,559
so to me males are a big hassle to deal

934
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,200
with sometimes I I work with male

935
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:33,960
populations but if I do I typically

936
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,659
don't do one-to-one readings with males

937
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:38,340
unless the plant has some incredible

938
00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:40,860
unique trait that I can't do it another

939
00:33:38,339 --> 00:33:42,658
way usually what I'll do is I'll combine

940
00:33:40,859 --> 00:33:45,359
the pollen from

941
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:48,179
a percentage of the population call it

942
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:50,759
10 to 15 percent of the plants that I

943
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:52,140
see I I determined or I believe are the

944
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:54,538
most suitable for whatever that

945
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:55,980
population is and then I'll mix the

946
00:33:54,538 --> 00:33:58,379
pollen

947
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:00,179
or or use those plants all together in

948
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:01,919
the same room and that way

949
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:04,320
because that's that's really the natural

950
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:07,080
way that cannabis breeds in a in a

951
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:09,599
natural stand okay like if you you know

952
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:11,039
call it 30 000 years ago if you're

953
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,838
walking through the Tibetan plateau and

954
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:15,059
you find a stand of cannabis you're not

955
00:34:12,838 --> 00:34:17,039
going to find one female together you're

956
00:34:15,059 --> 00:34:19,320
going to find a group of plants many

957
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:22,500
males and many females and the males are

958
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:24,960
pollinating all the females

959
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:28,019
um and that that that's a not that

960
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:30,358
natural state of of breeding is what we

961
00:34:28,019 --> 00:34:32,099
call outcrossing but it's actually

962
00:34:30,358 --> 00:34:34,079
called an obligate outcross or an

963
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:36,899
obligate outcrosser is a plant that

964
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:38,759
needs another individual from a

965
00:34:36,898 --> 00:34:40,519
different you know genetic type maybe

966
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:44,099
our brother or sister but maybe another

967
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:46,440
plant far away to cross

968
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:48,059
um to hybridize to make to make

969
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,980
Offspring right that's the consequence

970
00:34:48,059 --> 00:34:52,799
of having a dioecious population where

971
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:55,800
you have males and females right so it's

972
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:59,700
it's a lot more akin to the way that

973
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:02,580
humans breed right where

974
00:34:59,699 --> 00:35:05,338
um humans also need to have

975
00:35:02,579 --> 00:35:07,139
you know they need to have sex with

976
00:35:05,338 --> 00:35:09,299
another individual to be able to leave

977
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:11,460
Offspring right you can't you can't

978
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:13,920
clone yourself you don't just have kids

979
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:15,838
willy-nilly unless you're you know the

980
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,059
Virgin Mary

981
00:35:15,838 --> 00:35:19,920
um everybody else has to breed together

982
00:35:18,059 --> 00:35:22,440
to make Offspring and there's a genetic

983
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:25,440
consequence to that meaning that the

984
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:28,559
child is actually a hybrid right of two

985
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,119
different parental types

986
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:32,039
um

987
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:33,780
so when you look at you know everybody's

988
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:35,159
got a mother and a father and I don't

989
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:38,280
know if you've got brothers and sisters

990
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:39,779
but if if you look at you know your

991
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,220
family you don't look like your mother

992
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:42,660
or your father like you don't look like

993
00:35:41,219 --> 00:35:44,279
your father if you have a sister she

994
00:35:42,659 --> 00:35:46,679
doesn't look exactly like your mother

995
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:48,839
right they have some traits of both the

996
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:51,960
parents and you you don't look like your

997
00:35:48,838 --> 00:35:52,799
siblings unless you're twins

998
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:56,338
um

999
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:58,859
and so that state of breeding is really

1000
00:35:56,338 --> 00:36:01,078
much more similar to cannabis than for

1001
00:35:58,858 --> 00:36:03,779
example Tomatoes right if you're growing

1002
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:05,820
an heirloom tomato variety you can plant

1003
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:07,920
a seed grow it into a plant harvest the

1004
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:10,619
fruit take the seeds out of the fruit

1005
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,838
plant those again the next year and the

1006
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:14,160
fruit from that subsequent year are

1007
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:16,259
going to look like the year before and

1008
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:18,960
the year before and for 10 20

1009
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:20,280
Generations down into the future the

1010
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,500
tomato is going to keep coming out

1011
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,400
looking the same well cannabis isn't

1012
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,380
like that

1013
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,660
right it's began and the reason it's not

1014
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:29,940
like that is because when you constantly

1015
00:36:27,659 --> 00:36:32,159
breed to another type

1016
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:34,740
you're constantly introducing new

1017
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:36,659
genetic material into the mix and you're

1018
00:36:34,739 --> 00:36:38,879
losing some genetic material every time

1019
00:36:36,659 --> 00:36:40,618
but you're also gaining new stuff

1020
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:44,880
and so

1021
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:47,039
you don't have this uniformity that that

1022
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,900
starts to develop in plants like tomato

1023
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:51,420
that are what we call self-crossers or

1024
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:54,000
South species selfing species or

1025
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:56,460
inbreeding species

1026
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,338
um and those types of Speedy species get

1027
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:01,980
to be more homogeneous and more uniform

1028
00:36:59,338 --> 00:37:06,599
over time because they actually their

1029
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:09,480
breeding system actually purges genetic

1030
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:12,900
variation rather than increases the

1031
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:14,400
genetic variation okay so from a

1032
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:16,320
breeding perspective it's actually a lot

1033
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,480
more work with cannabis to make things

1034
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,619
uniform

1035
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:21,119
and through some of the work that I've

1036
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:22,980
done down in the states and especially

1037
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:26,220
having access to the chemical

1038
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:28,858
uh to the laboratory where you know we

1039
00:37:26,219 --> 00:37:30,539
would grow hundreds of plants and and

1040
00:37:28,858 --> 00:37:33,239
every single plant would go to the

1041
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:34,800
laboratory and so we would get back you

1042
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:36,838
know not only the phenotypic data that

1043
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,339
we would collect during the grow you'd

1044
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:40,199
also get the chemical data from the

1045
00:37:38,338 --> 00:37:42,539
laboratory

1046
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:44,460
um and so we would be able to take two

1047
00:37:42,539 --> 00:37:46,800
plants that had a very similar to an

1048
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:49,019
identical terpene profile and we'd cross

1049
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,820
those together

1050
00:37:49,019 --> 00:37:53,159
whereas if you took plants with

1051
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:54,900
Divergent terpene profiles and you cross

1052
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:58,078
them together you wouldn't have the same

1053
00:37:54,900 --> 00:38:01,500
level of uniformity in The Offspring

1054
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:04,800
um and so because male cannabis plants

1055
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:07,320
don't produce the traits of Interest or

1056
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:10,320
even of import to

1057
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:13,019
drug cannabis Growers right you don't

1058
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:16,460
use male plants in growing drug cannabis

1059
00:38:13,019 --> 00:38:16,460
you only use them for making seed

1060
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:23,519
those those male plants people don't

1061
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:24,780
because it's like I use this expression

1062
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:25,800
and you know some people don't like when

1063
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:28,019
I use it but I'm going to use it anyway

1064
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:30,960
because I don't care if you're breeding

1065
00:38:28,019 --> 00:38:32,940
humans for breast size it's pretty easy

1066
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,699
to select the female the the female

1067
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:38,039
humans that have big breasts right

1068
00:38:35,699 --> 00:38:40,019
how do you select a mail

1069
00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:41,820
individual for big breasts they don't

1070
00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:44,759
have that characteristic and so it's a

1071
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:48,720
sex it's what we call a sex-linked trait

1072
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:52,320
right only one gender really shows those

1073
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:54,179
characteristics and so if you're in a

1074
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,740
if you were running a human breeding

1075
00:38:54,179 --> 00:38:57,179
program which we can't do because of

1076
00:38:55,739 --> 00:38:59,338
Ethics but if you were running a human

1077
00:38:57,179 --> 00:39:01,259
breeding program you would probably look

1078
00:38:59,338 --> 00:39:03,599
at male plants

1079
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:05,280
that had sisters with large breasts or

1080
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:08,240
mother with large mothers with large

1081
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:10,920
breasts and that increases the

1082
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:13,379
probability that they'll have the genes

1083
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:15,240
for large breasts but it doesn't

1084
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:17,280
guarantee it right

1085
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:18,899
whereas when you're selecting two

1086
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,640
females and you can find a way to cross

1087
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:23,820
two females together like we have done

1088
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:25,739
with creating feminized seeds you can do

1089
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:27,660
what I call positive selection for the

1090
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:30,838
traits of interest on both sides of the

1091
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:32,460
Cross and when you can do that

1092
00:39:30,838 --> 00:39:35,279
trust me because I've done it in the

1093
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:36,838
laboratory many times when you bring two

1094
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,180
types together that are almost identical

1095
00:39:36,838 --> 00:39:42,960
the chances of the plants being more

1096
00:39:39,179 --> 00:39:46,980
uniform are way way higher

1097
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:49,079
um so what I've noticed is that you you

1098
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:51,539
make more genetic progress in a

1099
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:53,820
generation when you're doing it that way

1100
00:39:51,539 --> 00:39:55,500
you also have the added Consequence the

1101
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:58,380
added benefit

1102
00:39:55,500 --> 00:40:00,239
of not having to remove males from your

1103
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,920
subsequent population right like with

1104
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:03,838
like I said if you've got hundreds or

1105
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,880
even thousands of plants

1106
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:07,858
having to go through and write Rogue out

1107
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:10,260
half your crop or kill half your crop

1108
00:40:07,858 --> 00:40:13,319
that really is a pain

1109
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:16,380
right it's a real real inconvenience

1110
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:18,539
yeah of course and I mean gosh so many

1111
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:21,240
Avenues to go down

1112
00:40:18,539 --> 00:40:23,338
something just to kind of follow on with

1113
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:25,559
that is there's long been a discussion

1114
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:27,960
within the community about whether

1115
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:30,960
there's any realistic significance

1116
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:34,559
between say a feminized seed produced

1117
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:37,199
from intentional STS application versus

1118
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:39,119
one that's just purely a result of maybe

1119
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:41,338
a stressed environment some sort of

1120
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,660
hermaphroditic event what's your

1121
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:44,519
thoughts on this do you think that there

1122
00:40:42,659 --> 00:40:47,399
is some sort of difference or that

1123
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:50,699
they're fundamentally the same thing

1124
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,900
well it's both uh I I can't tell you

1125
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:54,299
it's the same in the other one or the

1126
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:55,800
other but it's it's actually both

1127
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:57,240
okay sure

1128
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,980
let me put it this way I'm just trying

1129
00:40:57,239 --> 00:41:01,439
to think how to put it we have a basic

1130
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:02,880
tenant in as a breeders but it applies

1131
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,639
to plants but it also applies to animal

1132
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:09,000
breeding and that that tenant is like

1133
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:12,420
begets like and all that means is the

1134
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:15,420
plants that you you select as parents

1135
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:16,920
it's it's very likely that the traits

1136
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:18,059
that you selected for in those parents

1137
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:21,240
are going to reoccur in the Next

1138
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:24,900
Generation okay and so if you're using a

1139
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:26,819
plant that go that goes intersects again

1140
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:28,559
hermaphrodite's not a it's not

1141
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:30,720
technically a real world word for plants

1142
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:33,960
because a hermaphrodite flower would be

1143
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:36,059
a would be a one single flower that had

1144
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,740
male parts and female parts and that's

1145
00:41:36,059 --> 00:41:40,019
not what happens with cannabis we have

1146
00:41:37,739 --> 00:41:42,419
flower clusters that have male and

1147
00:41:40,019 --> 00:41:44,159
single female flowers together and so

1148
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:46,680
that's really called intersex not

1149
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:48,420
hermaphrodite hermaphrodite would be if

1150
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:50,279
it was half a male flower and half a

1151
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:52,019
female flower

1152
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:54,780
um so intersex is the proper term for

1153
00:41:52,019 --> 00:41:58,460
that but so intersex plants they have

1154
00:41:54,780 --> 00:42:00,780
like you said some either genetic

1155
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:03,240
predisposition to have both sexes on the

1156
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:06,180
same plant or

1157
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:08,459
in the case that you mentioned under a

1158
00:42:06,179 --> 00:42:11,279
specific grow room stress or

1159
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:13,679
environmental stress they produce male

1160
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,680
flowers right well if you use those

1161
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:18,419
plants that produce male flowers under

1162
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:21,779
that given stress

1163
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:23,599
like begets like the next generation are

1164
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:26,640
going to be more likely to be

1165
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:28,680
predisposed to making male flowers given

1166
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:31,379
that stress appears

1167
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:33,659
right so by using plants like you said

1168
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:35,039
that are maybe like late flowering this

1169
00:42:33,659 --> 00:42:36,598
is the way Dutch Passion used to do it

1170
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:39,239
and Soma kind of does it this way as

1171
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:41,579
well they call it rhodolization when you

1172
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:44,399
use these plants that are

1173
00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:47,359
are producing intersex flowers

1174
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:50,820
either late in the cycle or due to a pH

1175
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:52,619
fluctuation or light cycle fluctuation

1176
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:54,180
or whatever it is that throws off the

1177
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:55,740
hormonal balance in the plant that makes

1178
00:42:54,179 --> 00:42:58,199
it produce set that makes it produce

1179
00:42:55,739 --> 00:43:00,598
male flowers if you select if you

1180
00:42:58,199 --> 00:43:02,219
positively select those crates those

1181
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:04,559
traits are going to be more likely to be

1182
00:43:02,219 --> 00:43:07,559
present in the Next Generation and so

1183
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:09,000
all that says is intersex plants are

1184
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:12,299
going to have are going to have a higher

1185
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,940
likelihood of making intersex offspring

1186
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:18,060
whereas if you select plants that don't

1187
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:20,760
have those intersex characteristics and

1188
00:43:18,059 --> 00:43:24,059
then you create you use you know STS or

1189
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:27,720
silver thiosolvate for example to force

1190
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:30,960
those plants to produce male flowers

1191
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:33,779
the next generation of plants are going

1192
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:36,420
to be less likely

1193
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:39,119
to produce intersex flowers

1194
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:41,220
right so everybody typically the

1195
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:43,740
Cannabis Community you know

1196
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:45,838
whatever we look for the short easy

1197
00:43:43,739 --> 00:43:49,679
explanations and it's like oh the the

1198
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:51,838
explanation everybody comes to is oh we

1199
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:54,419
sprayed this chemical on the plants

1200
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:56,460
the the Next Generation had

1201
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:58,440
intersex Offspring it's the chemical

1202
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:01,559
that's doing that and that's a wrong

1203
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:03,300
conclusion right it's the the thing is

1204
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:05,699
is that they selected a plant that has a

1205
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:07,140
higher likelihood to go intersex and

1206
00:44:05,699 --> 00:44:08,759
that trait is Amplified in the Next

1207
00:44:07,139 --> 00:44:10,559
Generation

1208
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:13,500
right so yeah they are very different

1209
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:14,519
you don't want to use plants that are

1210
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:18,420
likely

1211
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:20,759
to produce intersex flowers

1212
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:24,059
as parents right because again like

1213
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:25,740
begets like those the progeny from those

1214
00:44:24,059 --> 00:44:28,078
those parents are going to be more

1215
00:44:25,739 --> 00:44:30,779
likely to be intersex

1216
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:33,240
yeah sure and this is something that

1217
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:36,420
I've long suspected and tried to explain

1218
00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:39,000
to people that like fundamentally at its

1219
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:41,338
core cannabis is a plant which doesn't

1220
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,318
have discrete Sexes you know it's it's

1221
00:44:41,338 --> 00:44:46,318
actually both at the same time and we've

1222
00:44:43,318 --> 00:44:48,900
just bred it from like this Manisha sort

1223
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:50,219
of plan to try to be more dioecious so I

1224
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:52,139
guess my question is do you think we'll

1225
00:44:50,219 --> 00:44:55,318
ever get to a point where we have bread

1226
00:44:52,139 --> 00:44:57,779
cannabis selectively enough that we more

1227
00:44:55,318 --> 00:45:00,239
or less don't see any expression of the

1228
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:01,920
other sex in the in the say a female

1229
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:04,078
plant or do you think it's it's almost

1230
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,940
genetically impossible

1231
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:08,880
well it's not genetically impossible in

1232
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:11,400
any given plans because we have lots of

1233
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,079
plants that don't go intersex

1234
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:15,059
um

1235
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:17,519
you know it's it's like it's it's a

1236
00:45:15,059 --> 00:45:18,900
Continuum right it's a spectrum

1237
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:20,519
um and on one end of the spectrum

1238
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:21,420
there's plants that don't go intersects

1239
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:23,099
at all

1240
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:25,079
at the other inspection that there's

1241
00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:27,900
plants that are completely like you said

1242
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:30,000
manishes I would disagree with you in

1243
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:33,480
saying that they don't that there are

1244
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,639
discrete genders in cannabis there's two

1245
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:37,559
things there's discrete genders and then

1246
00:45:35,639 --> 00:45:39,239
there's females that are intersex

1247
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:42,059
right so you can have a female plant

1248
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:43,500
that is female but intersex and you can

1249
00:45:42,059 --> 00:45:44,759
have a female plant that is female but

1250
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:47,460
not intersex

1251
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:49,680
right we do understand the the genetic

1252
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:52,500
basis now of

1253
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:53,699
um of gender in cannabis

1254
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:56,760
and

1255
00:45:53,699 --> 00:46:01,139
it it's yeah it's almost

1256
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:03,540
it's it's almost 100 sure that we're

1257
00:46:01,139 --> 00:46:05,279
right but in the Plant World you know

1258
00:46:03,539 --> 00:46:08,039
you know what it's like in nature I mean

1259
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:09,780
there's exceptions to every rule

1260
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:12,719
right like there's there's human

1261
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:15,599
children that are born uh intersex right

1262
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:18,779
that they have some gender from each

1263
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:20,579
the X and the Y chromosome they undergo

1264
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:23,760
um crossing over so there's genetic

1265
00:46:20,579 --> 00:46:25,800
material exchange between

1266
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,240
um the male and the female so you can

1267
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:29,039
have males

1268
00:46:27,239 --> 00:46:31,739
that don't have the G you're not gonna

1269
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:33,900
have genetically male people with Y

1270
00:46:31,739 --> 00:46:37,318
chromosomes

1271
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:40,800
that have female reproductive parts

1272
00:46:37,318 --> 00:46:43,500
you can have female people with two X

1273
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:46,140
chromosomes and no Y chromosome and they

1274
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:48,260
have male reproductive parts

1275
00:46:46,139 --> 00:46:50,699
right so there's always going to be

1276
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:53,240
exceptions to every rule when it comes

1277
00:46:50,699 --> 00:46:53,239
to biology

1278
00:46:53,429 --> 00:46:54,838
[Music]

1279
00:46:53,639 --> 00:46:59,818
um

1280
00:46:54,838 --> 00:47:01,679
and so I think that yeah as a whole

1281
00:46:59,818 --> 00:47:03,539
in the species we'll never get rid of

1282
00:47:01,679 --> 00:47:05,639
intersexuality because it's it's part of

1283
00:47:03,539 --> 00:47:08,759
the the thing that's coded into the

1284
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:10,940
species but if you want to grow you know

1285
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:13,260
one of the easy ways to do it is to grow

1286
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:14,818
plants and select clones that don't go

1287
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:16,260
intersex and then use those plants for

1288
00:47:14,818 --> 00:47:18,599
your production

1289
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:20,099
I think over time in a proper breeding

1290
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:23,460
program and now that we're starting to

1291
00:47:20,099 --> 00:47:25,318
get access to genomics genomic companies

1292
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:27,240
that can support cannabis breeding

1293
00:47:25,318 --> 00:47:29,880
programs that we will be able to

1294
00:47:27,239 --> 00:47:32,279
identify genetic markers related to

1295
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:34,858
intersexuality and we'll be able to

1296
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:37,019
select against those markers and create

1297
00:47:34,858 --> 00:47:39,960
populations that are much more resistant

1298
00:47:37,019 --> 00:47:42,900
to intersexuality

1299
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:44,639
but that's part of our process and part

1300
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:45,660
of our

1301
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:47,400
um

1302
00:47:45,659 --> 00:47:48,659
our learning experience that we're going

1303
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:51,720
to have to go through over the next you

1304
00:47:48,659 --> 00:47:54,078
know like I said however long 20 years

1305
00:47:51,719 --> 00:47:57,000
yeah funnily enough funnily enough

1306
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:58,920
all-female breeding is probably going to

1307
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,480
be the way that we will do that right

1308
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:02,400
because again when you're selecting

1309
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,679
males unless you have genetic markers

1310
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,880
it's very difficult to tell whether that

1311
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:08,940
plant has

1312
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:10,980
uh will be intersex because again

1313
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:13,019
the males don't show that characteristic

1314
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:14,400
so how do you select for or against a

1315
00:48:13,019 --> 00:48:16,639
characteristic in males that you can't

1316
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,639
see

1317
00:48:16,858 --> 00:48:23,358
right so in fact using two female plants

1318
00:48:20,219 --> 00:48:25,439
that are highly resistant to

1319
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:28,858
intersexuality that might be how we

1320
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:30,780
breed out intersexuality right

1321
00:48:28,858 --> 00:48:32,279
that's which is maybe seems

1322
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:33,240
counterintuitive to some people I know

1323
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,680
that

1324
00:48:33,239 --> 00:48:36,419
you know there's a lot of people again

1325
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:37,980
it's kind of a trait in our community

1326
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:40,920
that it's like everybody wants it to be

1327
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:42,119
as natural as possible

1328
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:44,639
um that's not the way that cannabis

1329
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:45,900
evolved well truthfully the Cannabis

1330
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:47,519
that you're smoking today is nothing

1331
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:50,160
like the Cannabis that humans first

1332
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:51,960
encountered right like the Cannabis that

1333
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:53,940
humans first encountered was a tall with

1334
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:55,858
a short little plant that probably

1335
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:59,039
produced very little flower and a few

1336
00:48:55,858 --> 00:49:01,078
seeds and no discernible

1337
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:03,300
give collaborated content or terpene

1338
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:05,280
content certainly not

1339
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:07,500
but it's comparable to today's modern

1340
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,339
hybrids

1341
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:10,500
um

1342
00:49:08,338 --> 00:49:12,420
and so if you want to be if you're like

1343
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:13,739
kind of hippie minded and anti-science

1344
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:15,000
and you want everything to be natural

1345
00:49:13,739 --> 00:49:19,578
organic

1346
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:21,900
you know the way Mother Nature intended

1347
00:49:19,579 --> 00:49:24,960
you're probably not going to be

1348
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:26,880
supportive of female female breeding

1349
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:29,699
but I think that if you're serious about

1350
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:31,680
breeding cannabis for its chemistry

1351
00:49:29,699 --> 00:49:32,879
which is what we do as drug cannabis

1352
00:49:31,679 --> 00:49:35,578
breeders

1353
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,838
that it's really kind of undeniable that

1354
00:49:35,579 --> 00:49:39,839
the

1355
00:49:36,838 --> 00:49:42,539
effects that you can get the the sorry

1356
00:49:39,838 --> 00:49:46,139
the progress that you can make using

1357
00:49:42,539 --> 00:49:49,679
female plants or only female populations

1358
00:49:46,139 --> 00:49:51,779
is uh it's pretty significant if you

1359
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:53,399
actually use a lab and Screen the

1360
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:55,740
samples you know from male female

1361
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:57,240
crosses and female female crosses I

1362
00:49:55,739 --> 00:49:59,539
think most people would be surprised

1363
00:49:57,239 --> 00:50:01,618
that um

1364
00:49:59,539 --> 00:50:03,059
of the differences in the amount of

1365
00:50:01,619 --> 00:50:04,140
genetic gain that you can make in a

1366
00:50:03,059 --> 00:50:06,480
generation

1367
00:50:04,139 --> 00:50:08,039
truthfully some female female crosses

1368
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,900
don't work I mean a lot of females they

1369
00:50:08,039 --> 00:50:11,279
contain intersex genes and when you self

1370
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:14,579
them or when you cross them to other

1371
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:15,260
female plants yeah you get a lot of

1372
00:50:14,579 --> 00:50:17,818
um

1373
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:20,640
intersexuality in some lines right it's

1374
00:50:17,818 --> 00:50:23,940
not everywhere but it does happen

1375
00:50:20,639 --> 00:50:25,500
um and you just you either

1376
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:27,720
do your best to pull those

1377
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:30,960
intersexuality traits out or you don't

1378
00:50:27,719 --> 00:50:32,759
use that line I mean I said this last

1379
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:35,400
week on on or a couple weeks ago on

1380
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:37,500
shango's the podcast but

1381
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:40,318
you don't you know in the plant breeding

1382
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:42,420
world not every up you don't step up to

1383
00:50:40,318 --> 00:50:44,338
bat every time and hit a home run right

1384
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:46,380
there's a lot of fail failures you might

1385
00:50:44,338 --> 00:50:48,539
fail 90 of the time

1386
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:50,338
right and that's okay because breeding

1387
00:50:48,539 --> 00:50:52,440
plants is about taking the best of the

1388
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:54,599
best of the best right you're taking the

1389
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:57,000
cream from the crop

1390
00:50:54,599 --> 00:50:59,039
um and using those to for the Next

1391
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,179
Generation

1392
00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:01,920
um

1393
00:51:00,179 --> 00:51:03,239
and so it's okay if things don't work

1394
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,519
out it just means that you don't work

1395
00:51:03,239 --> 00:51:08,039
those lines right or you work them a

1396
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:10,139
different way right and you you focus on

1397
00:51:08,039 --> 00:51:12,539
the ones that do work

1398
00:51:10,139 --> 00:51:14,578
right that's another another one of the

1399
00:51:12,539 --> 00:51:17,579
David's quotes he's like I love killing

1400
00:51:14,579 --> 00:51:19,318
plants you know I love killing cats and

1401
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:20,818
I was like really and he's like yeah of

1402
00:51:19,318 --> 00:51:22,318
course like that's how you that's how

1403
00:51:20,818 --> 00:51:24,659
you make them better

1404
00:51:22,318 --> 00:51:25,699
you gotta get rid of all the junk

1405
00:51:24,659 --> 00:51:28,460
yeah

1406
00:51:25,699 --> 00:51:31,139
150 on that one I think pay for her

1407
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:32,460
sometimes a bit too attached to plants

1408
00:51:31,139 --> 00:51:35,699
to realize when maybe they're not worth

1409
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:38,280
keeping around just to extend on a kind

1410
00:51:35,699 --> 00:51:40,439
of idea you touched on I remember one of

1411
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:42,599
the ideas DJ mentioned when we had a

1412
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:45,059
chat with him was that he always had

1413
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:47,940
this sneaking suspicion that males which

1414
00:51:45,059 --> 00:51:50,280
showed intersex traits might be of more

1415
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:52,440
value than just what you would call a

1416
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:55,500
male that doesn't do you have any sort

1417
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:56,940
of speculation on maybe where that might

1418
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:58,739
come from or if there's any maybe

1419
00:51:56,940 --> 00:52:01,619
validity to that if you've seen that or

1420
00:51:58,739 --> 00:52:04,318
toyed with intersex males at all

1421
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:05,519
yeah so David and David also has talked

1422
00:52:04,318 --> 00:52:07,199
a lot about this with Hayes and

1423
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:09,480
apparently Hayes is you know throws like

1424
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:10,919
he's he claims up to 75 of the

1425
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:13,740
population they're females it's a much

1426
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:14,940
higher ratio sex ratio which is bizarre

1427
00:52:13,739 --> 00:52:17,039
um because it doesn't really fit our

1428
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:17,760
scientific understanding

1429
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:20,400
um

1430
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:22,319
what DJ's talking about I think there's

1431
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:25,200
probably a scientific basis for what

1432
00:52:22,318 --> 00:52:27,480
he's noticed right so I don't know if

1433
00:52:25,199 --> 00:52:30,899
you've looked into how the silver silver

1434
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:31,619
thiosulfate chemical that we use for

1435
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:34,139
um

1436
00:52:31,619 --> 00:52:36,599
for creating male flowers on female

1437
00:52:34,139 --> 00:52:39,118
plants what it does is it blocks a

1438
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:41,599
receptor in the plant called the

1439
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:45,720
ethylene receptor and ethylene is one of

1440
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:49,200
five major plant hormones

1441
00:52:45,719 --> 00:52:50,818
um in in humans we have you know you'd

1442
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:52,379
probably know more than I but with your

1443
00:52:50,818 --> 00:52:53,400
background but there's we have lots and

1444
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:54,240
lots of

1445
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:56,099
um

1446
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:57,598
of hormones many hormones that do many

1447
00:52:56,099 --> 00:53:00,539
different things in in the plant world

1448
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:03,599
there's really five major ones

1449
00:53:00,539 --> 00:53:06,000
um and one of those is ethylene and so

1450
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:08,700
people might heard of this trick with

1451
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,039
either avocados or or bananas if you got

1452
00:53:08,699 --> 00:53:12,719
a green banana and you take it and you

1453
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:14,338
put it in a paper bag and cinch the top

1454
00:53:12,719 --> 00:53:17,279
of the paper bag

1455
00:53:14,338 --> 00:53:19,500
the banana will go ripe yellow more

1456
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:22,019
quickly than say one open sitting on the

1457
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:25,318
counter and the reason is is that when

1458
00:53:22,019 --> 00:53:29,099
bananas mature they give off this gas

1459
00:53:25,318 --> 00:53:31,318
called ethylene okay and ethylene causes

1460
00:53:29,099 --> 00:53:34,760
the banana ripen it also causes plants

1461
00:53:31,318 --> 00:53:38,219
to to it also causes plant flowers

1462
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:43,020
to open and Bloom

1463
00:53:38,219 --> 00:53:45,539
okay and so if you're able to block that

1464
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:47,699
receptor the ethylene can't do its job

1465
00:53:45,539 --> 00:53:49,858
so think of it like Narcan or naloxone

1466
00:53:47,699 --> 00:53:51,838
the anti-opioid drug the the drug that

1467
00:53:49,858 --> 00:53:53,578
all the police carry now to give to

1468
00:53:51,838 --> 00:53:56,699
heroin people that are overdosing from

1469
00:53:53,579 --> 00:53:59,460
heroin that molecule blocks the heroin

1470
00:53:56,699 --> 00:54:01,318
receptor or the opioid receptor and

1471
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:03,059
therefore the fentanyl can't bind to the

1472
00:54:01,318 --> 00:54:04,679
receptor and cause all the downstream

1473
00:54:03,059 --> 00:54:06,420
problems that it does the shortness of

1474
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:07,980
breath and blah blah blah

1475
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:10,619
right

1476
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:12,260
um and so when we do that with the

1477
00:54:10,619 --> 00:54:15,240
silver

1478
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:17,700
thiosulfate or silver nitrate the silver

1479
00:54:15,239 --> 00:54:20,279
molecule actually blocks the ethylene

1480
00:54:17,699 --> 00:54:22,679
receptor and so we shut down that

1481
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:24,800
biological pathway okay we're turning

1482
00:54:22,679 --> 00:54:27,058
off the effect of that

1483
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:30,240
of that hormone

1484
00:54:27,059 --> 00:54:33,000
okay and when we do that in cannabis

1485
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:34,919
the plant produces male flowers rather

1486
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,519
than female flowers it's just a simple

1487
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:37,079
one

1488
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:42,199
[Music]

1489
00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:46,079
um one hormone receptor pathway right

1490
00:54:42,199 --> 00:54:47,338
conversely if you take a male plant and

1491
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:50,099
you spray it with a chemical called

1492
00:54:47,338 --> 00:54:52,380
ethaphone ethaphone is a chemical that

1493
00:54:50,099 --> 00:54:55,500
is absorbed by the plant and it breaks

1494
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:57,059
down into ethylene okay so if you spray

1495
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:59,159
a female plant with this epiphon

1496
00:54:57,059 --> 00:55:01,619
chemical you're introducing more

1497
00:54:59,159 --> 00:55:04,318
ethylene into the plant and the male

1498
00:55:01,619 --> 00:55:06,000
plant will produce female flowers

1499
00:55:04,318 --> 00:55:07,679
and and that's what you were talking

1500
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
about when you asked about uh David

1501
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:12,179
making

1502
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:14,460
um selfs or or hybrids or reversing

1503
00:55:12,179 --> 00:55:16,440
males as you call it

1504
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:18,720
um so really it's about playing with

1505
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:20,338
this one pathway coincidentally I mean

1506
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:21,598
we were talking about flowers opening

1507
00:55:20,338 --> 00:55:24,779
and maturing

1508
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:26,338
and and you know really there's this Arc

1509
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:28,760
in ethylene production over the flower

1510
00:55:26,338 --> 00:55:28,759
cycle

1511
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:32,700
cannabis probably goes through that too

1512
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:34,140
right I don't think anybody's really

1513
00:55:32,699 --> 00:55:35,578
measured that and it's actually quite

1514
00:55:34,139 --> 00:55:38,818
hard to measure arthelene because it

1515
00:55:35,579 --> 00:55:40,380
occurs in such minute quantities in the

1516
00:55:38,818 --> 00:55:41,639
plant

1517
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:44,940
um

1518
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:47,159
but yeah like ethylene probably Cycles

1519
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:48,780
the levels of the plant of the of that

1520
00:55:47,159 --> 00:55:50,940
hormone probably cycle throughout the

1521
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:52,380
hormones and that actually could be very

1522
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:55,679
well be why

1523
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:57,720
we have uh males or some plants that are

1524
00:55:55,679 --> 00:56:00,239
predisposed to throw male flowers at the

1525
00:55:57,719 --> 00:56:02,519
end of the cycle because there's a

1526
00:56:00,239 --> 00:56:03,719
change in ethylene expression in the

1527
00:56:02,519 --> 00:56:07,679
plant

1528
00:56:03,719 --> 00:56:09,299
right so anyway it's just interesting to

1529
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:10,679
know that that's how it works and and

1530
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:14,519
it's likely that what you're talking

1531
00:56:10,679 --> 00:56:15,899
about with DJ is that like humans and

1532
00:56:14,519 --> 00:56:18,838
like cannabis does and all these other

1533
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:20,579
traits there's variation in the levels

1534
00:56:18,838 --> 00:56:23,219
of these chemicals that the plant

1535
00:56:20,579 --> 00:56:25,740
produces some plant some genetic

1536
00:56:23,219 --> 00:56:27,779
backgrounds might have low levels of

1537
00:56:25,739 --> 00:56:30,118
ethylene but some plants maybe they

1538
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:32,339
produce a lot of ethylene right so if a

1539
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:34,079
plant produced a lot of ethylene you

1540
00:56:32,338 --> 00:56:36,239
might have a male plant that would show

1541
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:39,000
a female flower because again

1542
00:56:36,239 --> 00:56:40,379
excess ethylene to the plant changes the

1543
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,659
phenotype a little bit and makes it

1544
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:45,838
produce female flowers so that could

1545
00:56:42,659 --> 00:56:48,000
very well be What DJ is talking about is

1546
00:56:45,838 --> 00:56:49,920
that he's actually unconsciously

1547
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:54,900
selecting plants that have a really high

1548
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:57,358
ethylene load and as such they're more

1549
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:59,519
feminine males

1550
00:56:57,358 --> 00:57:01,380
what a brilliant answer because you you

1551
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:04,079
also answered my next question which was

1552
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:06,059
going to be about breeders claiming that

1553
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:08,519
their seeds have a higher proportion of

1554
00:57:06,059 --> 00:57:10,619
females and things like that so

1555
00:57:08,519 --> 00:57:12,239
perfectly answered that the following

1556
00:57:10,619 --> 00:57:15,480
question was going to be

1557
00:57:12,239 --> 00:57:17,879
I've always kind of thought that this

1558
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:20,400
idea that I'm about to talk about was

1559
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:22,680
kind of incorrect but you would hear

1560
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:24,838
some breeders talk about how you know

1561
00:57:22,679 --> 00:57:26,759
germinating seeds in hot environments

1562
00:57:24,838 --> 00:57:29,159
will give you more males things like

1563
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:31,680
that seems counterintuitive to the idea

1564
00:57:29,159 --> 00:57:33,420
that the the the sex of the plant is

1565
00:57:31,679 --> 00:57:34,739
largely genetically based I mean

1566
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:37,200
although there could be some sort of

1567
00:57:34,739 --> 00:57:39,659
like epigenetic change I guess what's

1568
00:57:37,199 --> 00:57:42,000
your thoughts on like after the seeds

1569
00:57:39,659 --> 00:57:44,219
been produced factors which could

1570
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,559
contribute to the ratio of sex upon

1571
00:57:44,219 --> 00:57:48,539
germination or something like that

1572
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:50,819
okay well let's just put the sex

1573
00:57:48,539 --> 00:57:53,099
conversation just to the side for a

1574
00:57:50,818 --> 00:57:55,318
quick moment and and have a conversation

1575
00:57:53,099 --> 00:57:57,480
about population sizes and statistics

1576
00:57:55,318 --> 00:57:59,940
right so

1577
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:02,099
if you have a population of a hundred

1578
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:04,440
people call it label them one to a

1579
00:58:02,099 --> 00:58:06,660
hundred Right On Any Given trade say

1580
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:08,760
that they're tall to small the smallest

1581
00:58:06,659 --> 00:58:10,318
guy is one the largest guy is 100 and

1582
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:12,480
there's one of each so there's literally

1583
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:13,920
you know one two three four five all the

1584
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:16,500
way up to a hundred

1585
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:17,940
and you then go into that popular you

1586
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:20,219
put them all in a paper bag and you

1587
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:22,139
reach your hand and you pull out three

1588
00:58:20,219 --> 00:58:26,159
at random

1589
00:58:22,139 --> 00:58:27,659
you might get like say say say whatever

1590
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:29,219
you don't shake up the bag very well and

1591
00:58:27,659 --> 00:58:30,539
you put your hand in after and you you

1592
00:58:29,219 --> 00:58:34,318
pull out

1593
00:58:30,539 --> 00:58:35,460
numbers nice 697 and 95 right so you add

1594
00:58:34,318 --> 00:58:38,519
the three up and you take the average

1595
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:40,260
and you decide okay 96 is the average of

1596
00:58:38,519 --> 00:58:41,039
this population well you're going to be

1597
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:43,619
wrong

1598
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:45,539
right because the small subset of the

1599
00:58:43,619 --> 00:58:48,420
plants that you've looked at doesn't

1600
00:58:45,539 --> 00:58:50,818
match the overall population and that's

1601
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:52,980
something in statistics we call sampling

1602
00:58:50,818 --> 00:58:55,558
error and people can Google that if they

1603
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:57,900
want but there's a whole field of math

1604
00:58:55,559 --> 00:58:59,640
about that

1605
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:01,559
um and I think a lot of the results that

1606
00:58:59,639 --> 00:59:03,480
we see in the Cannabis world is that

1607
00:59:01,559 --> 00:59:04,920
people are actually not doing proper

1608
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:07,858
sampling or they're not growing large

1609
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:09,420
enough populations upon which to make

1610
00:59:07,858 --> 00:59:11,699
the conclusions that they're making

1611
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:13,500
right like when we do this kind of stuff

1612
00:59:11,699 --> 00:59:14,098
when you talk about

1613
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:16,858
um

1614
00:59:14,099 --> 00:59:18,298
males and females there's a really basic

1615
00:59:16,858 --> 00:59:21,779
science thing

1616
00:59:18,298 --> 00:59:25,400
um that we use and it's called the

1617
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:28,260
chi-squares test is it's spelled

1618
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:30,480
c-h-i-dash square and you can look that

1619
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:31,619
up but the chi-square test essentially

1620
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:34,679
is

1621
00:59:31,619 --> 00:59:37,519
your observed result minus your expected

1622
00:59:34,679 --> 00:59:39,659
result over your expected result okay

1623
00:59:37,519 --> 00:59:41,579
and that

1624
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:44,039
that gives you a number that you can

1625
00:59:41,579 --> 00:59:45,420
look up on a table and and you can base

1626
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:47,579
on the number of plants that you're

1627
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:50,639
growing and seeing like for example you

1628
00:59:47,579 --> 00:59:52,260
know we would expect that 10 regular

1629
00:59:50,639 --> 00:59:54,659
seeds five them are going to be male and

1630
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:56,579
five are going to be female okay

1631
00:59:54,659 --> 00:59:58,078
and if you grow at a population of a

1632
00:59:56,579 --> 01:00:00,480
hundred you'd probably end up seeing

1633
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:02,818
like oh look there's 47 males and 53

1634
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:05,280
females or vice versa or something close

1635
01:00:02,818 --> 01:00:07,199
to that okay and the larger the

1636
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:09,720
population you grow

1637
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:11,219
the more close to 50 50 you're going to

1638
01:00:09,719 --> 01:00:15,019
get okay

1639
01:00:11,219 --> 01:00:15,019
but if you grow three plants

1640
01:00:15,539 --> 01:00:19,619
each it's like flipping a coin three

1641
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:21,539
times right you might get you might get

1642
01:00:19,619 --> 01:00:24,240
heads three times by flipping a coin

1643
01:00:21,539 --> 01:00:26,699
well does that mean that every time you

1644
01:00:24,239 --> 01:00:29,519
flip that coin it's going to be heads no

1645
01:00:26,699 --> 01:00:31,078
right it it just means that like you

1646
01:00:29,519 --> 01:00:32,940
didn't flip in enough time to get an

1647
01:00:31,079 --> 01:00:35,099
accurate sample of of

1648
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:37,679
the population right so if you grow if

1649
01:00:35,099 --> 01:00:39,660
you buy 10 seeds and you only grow three

1650
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:42,058
of them and they're all males you might

1651
01:00:39,659 --> 01:00:43,798
conclude well this all this all the the

1652
01:00:42,059 --> 01:00:46,559
seeds and the seed line are males but

1653
01:00:43,798 --> 01:00:48,239
that wouldn't be a correct population it

1654
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:50,099
would be an error that you're making in

1655
01:00:48,239 --> 01:00:52,798
your conclusion because you didn't grow

1656
01:00:50,099 --> 01:00:55,079
enough plants

1657
01:00:52,798 --> 01:00:57,119
um and so I would argue that most

1658
01:00:55,079 --> 01:00:59,940
cannabis breeders again working in small

1659
01:00:57,119 --> 01:01:02,579
spaces and closets and not working in

1660
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:04,740
fields and not keeping proper records

1661
01:01:02,579 --> 01:01:07,019
that they're making these conclusions

1662
01:01:04,739 --> 01:01:09,479
based of observations that they've made

1663
01:01:07,019 --> 01:01:11,280
but the observations that they've made

1664
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:13,920
have been on too small of a population

1665
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:15,839
to actually say it's true so when you

1666
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:17,519
hear a breeder say yeah well the plant

1667
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:19,440
you know this population produces 70

1668
01:01:17,519 --> 01:01:21,838
percent males well it's like what so you

1669
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:23,818
grew seven plants or you grew 10 plants

1670
01:01:21,838 --> 01:01:26,519
and seven of them were males right like

1671
01:01:23,818 --> 01:01:30,058
that's that's not a statistically

1672
01:01:26,519 --> 01:01:33,480
significant conclusion right

1673
01:01:30,059 --> 01:01:35,819
um and plant breeding happens to be

1674
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:38,519
heavily stats based it's a lot about

1675
01:01:35,818 --> 01:01:40,679
math and numbers

1676
01:01:38,519 --> 01:01:43,139
um and measuring traits and looking for

1677
01:01:40,679 --> 01:01:45,118
population means and outliers and all

1678
01:01:43,139 --> 01:01:47,098
that kind of stuff and it's really

1679
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:48,660
boring and not exciting to talk about

1680
01:01:47,099 --> 01:01:52,200
when you just want to get high and smoke

1681
01:01:48,659 --> 01:01:54,298
a bunch of weed and talk about Terps but

1682
01:01:52,199 --> 01:01:56,279
again there's a science that goes on

1683
01:01:54,298 --> 01:01:57,900
behind all of the Dan it's like there's

1684
01:01:56,280 --> 01:02:00,000
a genetic dance there's a biological

1685
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:02,460
dance that goes on

1686
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:05,099
Under the Sea Under the scenes of of

1687
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:08,338
plant breeding and you really have to

1688
01:02:05,099 --> 01:02:10,500
understand that science

1689
01:02:08,338 --> 01:02:13,019
um and apply those scientific methods to

1690
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:14,699
be making conclusions that we're making

1691
01:02:13,019 --> 01:02:17,219
and again I'm not trying to talk bad

1692
01:02:14,699 --> 01:02:19,558
about anybody else in the scene for not

1693
01:02:17,219 --> 01:02:21,000
having that set of knowledge but you got

1694
01:02:19,559 --> 01:02:22,980
to understand people just need to

1695
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
understand that

1696
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:26,460
um

1697
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:29,699
you can't make conclusions like that off

1698
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:31,920
of small populations because it's it it

1699
01:02:29,699 --> 01:02:35,058
many many times with small populations

1700
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:37,440
you end up having this this

1701
01:02:35,059 --> 01:02:39,500
artifact called

1702
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,500
um

1703
01:02:40,019 --> 01:02:45,719
sampling error right yeah yeah a perfect

1704
01:02:43,798 --> 01:02:47,940
perfect description of that sort of

1705
01:02:45,719 --> 01:02:50,338
situation and I remember when I was

1706
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:52,858
having a discussion with James Bean the

1707
01:02:50,338 --> 01:02:54,179
uh the owner of seeds here now he

1708
01:02:52,858 --> 01:02:56,338
mentioned to me that uh someone

1709
01:02:54,179 --> 01:02:58,679
contacted him and was like I got 10

1710
01:02:56,338 --> 01:03:00,659
males in a regular packet and this

1711
01:02:58,679 --> 01:03:03,058
person's obviously pretty upset and

1712
01:03:00,659 --> 01:03:06,298
James was like congrats like you won the

1713
01:03:03,059 --> 01:03:07,859
lottery dude like yeah yeah yeah well

1714
01:03:06,298 --> 01:03:11,159
it's true it could happen right you flip

1715
01:03:07,858 --> 01:03:13,318
a coin 10 times it you can get 10 males

1716
01:03:11,159 --> 01:03:15,000
it's rare but you can't happen yeah and

1717
01:03:13,318 --> 01:03:16,199
you know I just when when you have that

1718
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,940
kind of stuff with people you just give

1719
01:03:16,199 --> 01:03:19,618
them more seeds man like white people

1720
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:21,480
freaking out they're just seeds you know

1721
01:03:19,619 --> 01:03:23,818
give some hook somebody up if somebody

1722
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:25,619
has a problem with your seeds why are

1723
01:03:23,818 --> 01:03:27,179
you trying to drag it out I mean sure

1724
01:03:25,619 --> 01:03:28,740
there's people that take advantage it

1725
01:03:27,179 --> 01:03:30,598
happens but you know what what does it

1726
01:03:28,739 --> 01:03:33,058
cost you to give a customer another 10c

1727
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:35,099
it's nothing yeah and then I think that

1728
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:36,660
was his his resolution to that and he

1729
01:03:35,099 --> 01:03:37,559
also even made the point of saying you

1730
01:03:36,659 --> 01:03:39,598
know you should feel good because

1731
01:03:37,559 --> 01:03:41,160
there's probably you know a bit of a

1732
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:42,420
like an assumption but you know there's

1733
01:03:41,159 --> 01:03:44,159
probably someone out there who got a 10

1734
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:46,559
female pack because of you

1735
01:03:44,159 --> 01:03:49,318
everything has to balance out in the end

1736
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:52,260
right it's all about probabilities and

1737
01:03:49,318 --> 01:03:53,940
so for every it's you know these things

1738
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:56,760
are all graphed on what we call a normal

1739
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:58,740
distribution or a bell curve right and

1740
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:00,240
so for every one person that's what one

1741
01:03:58,739 --> 01:04:02,098
end of the Bell there's also somebody

1742
01:04:00,239 --> 01:04:05,639
that's at the other end of the Bell

1743
01:04:02,099 --> 01:04:07,920
of course so something I've always been

1744
01:04:05,639 --> 01:04:10,078
really personally interested in is many

1745
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:12,180
moons ago when I was a wee lad I

1746
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:14,818
remember reading your article on a forum

1747
01:04:12,179 --> 01:04:16,980
about how cubing is a myth and this blew

1748
01:04:14,818 --> 01:04:19,259
my mind because I up until that point I

1749
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:21,900
was you know very devout to the idea of

1750
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:23,640
the cube and I guess the question that I

1751
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:26,400
always wondered when I learned a little

1752
01:04:23,639 --> 01:04:28,139
bit more about genetics was I might be

1753
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:29,760
misunderstanding maybe some of the

1754
01:04:28,139 --> 01:04:32,400
points you wrote about in that little

1755
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:34,380
article but essentially what I took away

1756
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:37,200
was that you could get to where you want

1757
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:40,079
to be in like a bx1 more or less would

1758
01:04:37,199 --> 01:04:42,000
that be a fair kind of statement to say

1759
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:43,798
okay well so sort of a first back

1760
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,559
Chronic Generation

1761
01:04:43,798 --> 01:04:48,239
you can get as far as you can in a third

1762
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:49,798
bat cross generation but there's other

1763
01:04:48,239 --> 01:04:51,239
plants in that generation are still

1764
01:04:49,798 --> 01:04:52,199
going to be the equivalent to the F1

1765
01:04:51,239 --> 01:04:55,139
hybrid

1766
01:04:52,199 --> 01:04:57,239
right so the point that solo was making

1767
01:04:55,139 --> 01:04:59,699
and that you've got to remember solo was

1768
01:04:57,239 --> 01:05:01,199
a is or was I don't know if he still is

1769
01:04:59,699 --> 01:05:03,719
but he's an engineer he's not a

1770
01:05:01,199 --> 01:05:05,818
biologist Okay so

1771
01:05:03,719 --> 01:05:08,399
if you don't understand how biology

1772
01:05:05,818 --> 01:05:11,460
works and how meiosis works specifically

1773
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:14,160
meiosis is the way that cells divide to

1774
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:16,679
produce germline cells or sex cells that

1775
01:05:14,159 --> 01:05:19,259
become you know female eggs or male

1776
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:20,940
sperm or male pollen or female ovules on

1777
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:23,220
a plant

1778
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:26,579
um if you don't understand that

1779
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:28,318
it's kind of hard to you know if you're

1780
01:05:26,579 --> 01:05:30,000
making conclusions as an engineer on

1781
01:05:28,318 --> 01:05:31,318
biological processes then you don't

1782
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,699
understand those things you're probably

1783
01:05:31,318 --> 01:05:36,239
going to make a mistake

1784
01:05:32,699 --> 01:05:37,618
and and so yeah in the third back cross

1785
01:05:36,239 --> 01:05:39,659
generation or even in the first back

1786
01:05:37,619 --> 01:05:41,720
cross generation yes you're going to

1787
01:05:39,659 --> 01:05:44,460
find plants that are like 99

1788
01:05:41,719 --> 01:05:45,959
like the the mother plant say that the

1789
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:48,000
mother is the recurrent parent in the

1790
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:50,579
back cross generation are they in the

1791
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,019
back cross scheme sorry

1792
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:53,220
the truth is is that you're going to

1793
01:05:52,019 --> 01:05:56,159
find another plant in that same

1794
01:05:53,219 --> 01:05:58,199
generation that is it still has 50 of

1795
01:05:56,159 --> 01:06:01,699
the the genetics from the male

1796
01:05:58,199 --> 01:06:05,338
right so as a whole in the population

1797
01:06:01,699 --> 01:06:09,058
yes the population as a whole

1798
01:06:05,338 --> 01:06:11,818
only has 25 percent of the genetics from

1799
01:06:09,059 --> 01:06:13,680
uh any from the male and 75 percent of

1800
01:06:11,818 --> 01:06:15,358
the genetics from the female

1801
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:17,399
but that doesn't mean that every

1802
01:06:15,358 --> 01:06:19,078
individual in that population is going

1803
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:22,260
to be like that right

1804
01:06:19,079 --> 01:06:24,539
and so if you're using

1805
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:26,700
um a male if you're selecting again if

1806
01:06:24,539 --> 01:06:27,900
you if you do this poor kind of breeding

1807
01:06:26,699 --> 01:06:29,279
practice and candidates where you use

1808
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:31,440
one plant

1809
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:33,240
and that you select from your your first

1810
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:35,460
back cross generation

1811
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:37,979
you might choose the plant that is still

1812
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:40,019
50 of the male genome right and you

1813
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:42,780
cross it back again you actually haven't

1814
01:06:40,019 --> 01:06:44,818
gained any genetic progress over time

1815
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:46,680
right to move it over time you have to

1816
01:06:44,818 --> 01:06:49,199
do that back cross and you're

1817
01:06:46,679 --> 01:06:50,659
essentially trying to drag the entire

1818
01:06:49,199 --> 01:06:53,519
population

1819
01:06:50,659 --> 01:06:56,399
towards the female the genetics of the

1820
01:06:53,519 --> 01:06:57,960
female now look that female of her in

1821
01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:00,180
and of herself

1822
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:02,818
might be a hybrid plant like if that

1823
01:07:00,179 --> 01:07:04,259
female was an F1 plant back Crossing and

1824
01:07:02,818 --> 01:07:06,480
I think I was talking about grapefruit

1825
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:07,980
and the Sweet Tooth you know in context

1826
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:10,798
of this or the grapefruit blueberry

1827
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:13,139
hybrid when you when you start Crossing

1828
01:07:10,798 --> 01:07:16,500
back to a hybrid you don't actually ever

1829
01:07:13,139 --> 01:07:18,598
get towards 100 like the parent because

1830
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:21,179
the parent is already a hybrid it's

1831
01:07:18,599 --> 01:07:22,859
already segregating every generation and

1832
01:07:21,179 --> 01:07:26,038
so yeah you might get to a point where

1833
01:07:22,858 --> 01:07:29,400
all of the genetics came from that

1834
01:07:26,039 --> 01:07:31,500
one plant but they're just the

1835
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:32,940
population is still segregating for all

1836
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:35,400
the traits that are in that plant like

1837
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:38,460
you don't actually get close to

1838
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:40,980
a true breeding nature right and so in

1839
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:43,380
the real plant breeding world

1840
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:45,358
you don't use back Crossing in the way

1841
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:47,099
that we use it or that people have

1842
01:07:45,358 --> 01:07:49,139
traditionally used it that have

1843
01:07:47,099 --> 01:07:50,760
professed cubing

1844
01:07:49,139 --> 01:07:53,338
you don't you don't do it that way what

1845
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:54,900
you do is you use a line that is already

1846
01:07:53,338 --> 01:07:56,880
true breeding

1847
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:59,519
and then the reason that you would back

1848
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:01,380
cross to a line is you cross it you take

1849
01:07:59,519 --> 01:08:03,599
that true breeding line or true to type

1850
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:04,980
line where all the plants look the same

1851
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:06,059
and they come up the same with the same

1852
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:08,400
smell

1853
01:08:06,059 --> 01:08:10,859
and you might want to add call it auto

1854
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:12,960
flowering to that trait so you cross it

1855
01:08:10,858 --> 01:08:15,598
to an autoflowering plant you grow up

1856
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:17,819
The Offspring and you back cross it to

1857
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:20,100
the your what we call the recurrent

1858
01:08:17,819 --> 01:08:22,199
parent or you know in this case call it

1859
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:25,380
grapefruit or princess or whatever the

1860
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:28,439
plant they were doing chasing in c99

1861
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:31,920
you only want that one trait the auto

1862
01:08:28,439 --> 01:08:34,079
trait from your pollen donor

1863
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:36,119
you want to take the rest of that

1864
01:08:34,079 --> 01:08:37,798
plant's genome and throw it away right

1865
01:08:36,119 --> 01:08:40,259
you want to get rid of it

1866
01:08:37,798 --> 01:08:41,519
and so that is something that you can do

1867
01:08:40,259 --> 01:08:42,838
then that's the way they do it in the

1868
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:44,819
real plant breeding world it's like it's

1869
01:08:42,838 --> 01:08:47,278
called trait introgression and I wrote

1870
01:08:44,819 --> 01:08:49,560
it about it in um

1871
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:51,600
in Jorge Cervantes the marijuana

1872
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:53,100
Horticulture book

1873
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:54,179
um I think it's the medical Bible is

1874
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:55,679
what they call it but I wrote the

1875
01:08:54,179 --> 01:08:57,659
breeding chapter in there and I kind of

1876
01:08:55,679 --> 01:09:00,179
explained that breeding program on how

1877
01:08:57,659 --> 01:09:02,219
to do that and so trade integration

1878
01:09:00,179 --> 01:09:04,798
through back Crossing is something that

1879
01:09:02,219 --> 01:09:07,500
you want to do with an already true

1880
01:09:04,798 --> 01:09:09,119
breeding population right if you took

1881
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:11,819
like an OG Kush which is a little bit of

1882
01:09:09,119 --> 01:09:13,439
a hybrid plant anyway on its own and you

1883
01:09:11,819 --> 01:09:15,420
kept back Crossing to it you're not

1884
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:18,119
going to get a true breeding plant from

1885
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:19,920
it because again that plant's a hybrid

1886
01:09:18,119 --> 01:09:22,679
and those those traits are going to keep

1887
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:24,480
segregating over time until you are able

1888
01:09:22,679 --> 01:09:26,399
to actually find the true homozygous

1889
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:29,099
parents and cross them together

1890
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:31,679
right so this idea that you can cross

1891
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:33,660
back to a plant three times and all of a

1892
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:36,000
sudden all the offspring are going to

1893
01:09:33,659 --> 01:09:38,159
look like the mother plant is wrong

1894
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:41,520
right if the plant is a hybrid plant

1895
01:09:38,159 --> 01:09:44,219
then it it has heterozygosy or a lot of

1896
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:46,140
genetic diversity in its own genome yeah

1897
01:09:44,219 --> 01:09:48,899
all the plants that come from that plant

1898
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:50,100
might have the collection of traits from

1899
01:09:48,899 --> 01:09:51,659
The genome

1900
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:55,380
but they're not all going to look the

1901
01:09:51,659 --> 01:09:57,899
same and they're not going to breed true

1902
01:09:55,380 --> 01:10:00,900
yeah what a great explanation I think

1903
01:09:57,899 --> 01:10:02,819
the the one question above maybe what

1904
01:10:00,899 --> 01:10:05,460
you'd already answered that I was kind

1905
01:10:02,819 --> 01:10:08,099
of wondering was that given that there

1906
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:10,560
are so many different genes and alleles

1907
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:13,860
and chromosomes within plants

1908
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:16,620
is it fair to say in your mind that by

1909
01:10:13,859 --> 01:10:18,599
doing additional back crosses you could

1910
01:10:16,619 --> 01:10:20,279
potentially lock in additional traits

1911
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:22,140
that were maybe in the original mother

1912
01:10:20,279 --> 01:10:23,579
in The Princess for example which

1913
01:10:22,140 --> 01:10:25,619
because maybe in the first back cross

1914
01:10:23,579 --> 01:10:27,300
you locked down like 70 of the traits

1915
01:10:25,619 --> 01:10:28,800
you were looking for and I get what

1916
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:31,079
you're saying where like you could find

1917
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:32,699
one with like 99 but if I'm

1918
01:10:31,079 --> 01:10:35,640
understanding this correct you'd have to

1919
01:10:32,698 --> 01:10:37,738
run more seeds to find that one whereas

1920
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:39,300
would you um like agree that if you did

1921
01:10:37,738 --> 01:10:41,459
more back crosses you could

1922
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:42,659
theoretically lock down more of the

1923
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:44,279
trade so that they're going to express

1924
01:10:42,658 --> 01:10:47,039
more consistently or have I

1925
01:10:44,279 --> 01:10:48,899
misunderstood that no you can't because

1926
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:52,140
again

1927
01:10:48,899 --> 01:10:54,238
the the condition that the parent has is

1928
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:56,100
it already like so you're recurrent

1929
01:10:54,238 --> 01:10:58,259
parent let's call it let's just use c99

1930
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:59,579
and we'll use princess as the recurrent

1931
01:10:58,260 --> 01:11:02,880
parent so

1932
01:10:59,579 --> 01:11:05,340
princess herself was a hybrid plant okay

1933
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:07,140
and so if you were to self if you were

1934
01:11:05,340 --> 01:11:10,319
to cross princess to itself forget the

1935
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:13,619
the outcross to a new type to bat cross

1936
01:11:10,319 --> 01:11:15,599
for a second let's just self princess if

1937
01:11:13,619 --> 01:11:18,059
you sell princess

1938
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:20,520
she comes out looking like an F2 more or

1939
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:22,679
less right because again she's a hybrid

1940
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:25,940
for almost all the traits that are in

1941
01:11:22,679 --> 01:11:28,140
the in the plant in her genome she's got

1942
01:11:25,939 --> 01:11:30,539
heterozygosity across her chromosomes

1943
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:32,000
right I mean let me simplify this maybe

1944
01:11:30,539 --> 01:11:34,800
for your list there's a little bit like

1945
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,479
in every let's let's everybody think in

1946
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:39,719
terms of their own themself and their

1947
01:11:36,479 --> 01:11:42,178
family you have half of the Chrome in

1948
01:11:39,719 --> 01:11:43,800
your genetic complement Heavenly you've

1949
01:11:42,179 --> 01:11:45,420
got half of your chromosomes from your

1950
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:48,539
mom and half them from your dad you've

1951
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:51,239
got 22 from Mom or you've got 20

1952
01:11:48,539 --> 01:11:52,859
two and an X from Mom and you got 22 and

1953
01:11:51,238 --> 01:11:54,238
a y from Dad

1954
01:11:52,859 --> 01:11:58,259
okay

1955
01:11:54,238 --> 01:11:59,879
so in your mind let's make moms blue and

1956
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:02,100
Dad's red

1957
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:04,319
okay

1958
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:05,699
well if you cross those two types

1959
01:12:04,319 --> 01:12:10,340
together like if you were to able to

1960
01:12:05,698 --> 01:12:10,339
somehow breed with only yourself

1961
01:12:10,439 --> 01:12:14,819
there's going to be three possibilities

1962
01:12:12,119 --> 01:12:17,760
for every chromosome you can either have

1963
01:12:14,819 --> 01:12:20,158
two red ones you can have two blue ones

1964
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:22,800
or you can have

1965
01:12:20,158 --> 01:12:25,339
one red and one blue

1966
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:25,340
okay

1967
01:12:25,439 --> 01:12:29,819
now let's add in the the the parent that

1968
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:32,219
we're going to introgress and we'll do a

1969
01:12:29,819 --> 01:12:35,039
back cross population so now we're

1970
01:12:32,219 --> 01:12:38,279
putting in pollen from

1971
01:12:35,039 --> 01:12:40,260
let's assume in the best case scenario a

1972
01:12:38,279 --> 01:12:42,359
completely hundred percent true breeding

1973
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:44,940
plant and let's label all the

1974
01:12:42,359 --> 01:12:47,460
chromosomes in our mind as black so when

1975
01:12:44,939 --> 01:12:51,079
you cross the black to the to the

1976
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:53,640
possibilities of either red and blue or

1977
01:12:51,079 --> 01:12:55,679
yeah of red and blue

1978
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:58,560
you got two possibilities you can have

1979
01:12:55,679 --> 01:13:00,600
black and blue or black and red

1980
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:03,480
well when you back cross the either of

1981
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:05,219
those types to the red and blue again

1982
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:07,218
now we've just got a mass of three

1983
01:13:05,219 --> 01:13:10,260
different types all segregating together

1984
01:13:07,219 --> 01:13:12,840
right and to make it uniform and true

1985
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:14,340
breeding you have to have two of one

1986
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:16,500
type like you want to have blue and blue

1987
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:18,300
or red and red

1988
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:19,920
right

1989
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:22,039
um yep that's sorry that's maybe that's

1990
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:25,199
a terrible way of explaining it but

1991
01:13:22,039 --> 01:13:27,899
the the point is is that

1992
01:13:25,198 --> 01:13:30,539
we all have chromosomes from our mom and

1993
01:13:27,899 --> 01:13:32,339
our dad right and so somehow we were

1994
01:13:30,539 --> 01:13:34,319
able to back cross

1995
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:36,900
to ourselves

1996
01:13:34,319 --> 01:13:39,179
it's still a 50 50 shot whether you get

1997
01:13:36,899 --> 01:13:41,819
the the chromosome from Mom or the

1998
01:13:39,179 --> 01:13:43,800
chromosome from Dad right and it doesn't

1999
01:13:41,819 --> 01:13:46,979
matter how many times you back crossed

2000
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:48,840
yourself if you've got one of each type

2001
01:13:46,979 --> 01:13:50,639
of chromosome you're never going to get

2002
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:52,800
there the only way that you can get

2003
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:55,079
there is if the plant that you're back

2004
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:57,659
Crossing to is either red red or blue

2005
01:13:55,079 --> 01:14:00,119
blue and then if it if it is over time

2006
01:13:57,658 --> 01:14:01,019
you'll eventually get to all blue or all

2007
01:14:00,119 --> 01:14:03,179
red

2008
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:04,679
right but as long as that initial plant

2009
01:14:03,179 --> 01:14:08,039
that you're using is your recurrent

2010
01:14:04,679 --> 01:14:10,800
parent has what we call heterozygosity

2011
01:14:08,039 --> 01:14:12,899
or as a hybrid plant it has different

2012
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:15,179
chromosomes

2013
01:14:12,899 --> 01:14:18,658
you know every every plant has your

2014
01:14:15,179 --> 01:14:19,739
cannabis plant has 10 chromosomes nine

2015
01:14:18,658 --> 01:14:22,619
um

2016
01:14:19,738 --> 01:14:25,639
what we call autosomes and one uh pair

2017
01:14:22,619 --> 01:14:25,640
of sex chromosomes

2018
01:14:26,039 --> 01:14:29,219
if those plants have different

2019
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:30,539
chromosomes it doesn't matter how many

2020
01:14:29,219 --> 01:14:32,158
times you back cross it you're never

2021
01:14:30,539 --> 01:14:34,079
going to get any closer to your goal

2022
01:14:32,158 --> 01:14:38,698
right

2023
01:14:34,079 --> 01:14:41,519
yeah so yeah so so cubing

2024
01:14:38,698 --> 01:14:43,379
with the idea that yeah after three

2025
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:45,360
generations The Offspring looked exactly

2026
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:48,000
like Mom that's just not true

2027
01:14:45,359 --> 01:14:50,158
yeah after three generations the vast

2028
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:54,300
majority of the population has genetics

2029
01:14:50,158 --> 01:14:55,859
only from Mom but that doesn't mean that

2030
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:58,079
those plants are going to breed true in

2031
01:14:55,859 --> 01:14:59,939
any way

2032
01:14:58,079 --> 01:15:01,619
yeah great thank you so much for

2033
01:14:59,939 --> 01:15:04,139
clearing that up that does make a lot of

2034
01:15:01,619 --> 01:15:05,880
sense and I I suggest the listeners if

2035
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:07,560
you if you got lost at any point feel

2036
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:09,840
free to go back and listen to it a few

2037
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:10,980
more times but hopefully you will be

2038
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:14,039
able to get there

2039
01:15:10,979 --> 01:15:16,439
uh I just wanted to mention we're

2040
01:15:14,039 --> 01:15:18,899
obviously so lucky to to have you on the

2041
01:15:16,439 --> 01:15:20,759
show and I wanted to chat about some of

2042
01:15:18,899 --> 01:15:22,979
your personal breedings that you'd done

2043
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:24,960
before we jump into maybe some of the

2044
01:15:22,979 --> 01:15:26,519
sort of intellectual property and patent

2045
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:28,619
work you've been involved in which is

2046
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:30,659
very very interesting to a lot of our

2047
01:15:28,619 --> 01:15:33,119
listeners but I first just wanted to

2048
01:15:30,658 --> 01:15:34,738
give you a quick Kudos my buddy green

2049
01:15:33,119 --> 01:15:36,960
and gold Farms when I was at his house

2050
01:15:34,738 --> 01:15:38,879
on the weekend I told him I was going to

2051
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:42,239
be interviewing you and he pulled out a

2052
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:44,039
jar of some of your Sour Diesel cross to

2053
01:15:42,238 --> 01:15:45,959
Sweet skunk that he grew probably about

2054
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:47,760
five years ago I think he said but he's

2055
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:50,039
really good at curing and storing things

2056
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:51,719
and so that's been the inspiration for a

2057
01:15:50,039 --> 01:15:53,819
lot of these questions when I was riding

2058
01:15:51,719 --> 01:15:55,500
them I was puffing away on that one from

2059
01:15:53,819 --> 01:15:57,658
you and I tell you what it's a

2060
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:59,819
phenomenal smoke it's almost like piffy

2061
01:15:57,658 --> 01:16:01,139
in a way like very up like more

2062
01:15:59,819 --> 01:16:04,139
uplifting than you would have expected

2063
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:05,760
either if the parents to kind of be

2064
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:07,500
yeah that's great well it's probably

2065
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:08,880
kudos to him as well I mean all we can

2066
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:11,340
do is put the jeans together it's the

2067
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:13,560
grower that brings it out oh there's

2068
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:15,179
other plants like sweet skunk

2069
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:16,560
like for example there's one over here

2070
01:16:15,179 --> 01:16:18,359
called um

2071
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:20,280
it's a seedsman it's a plant that came

2072
01:16:18,359 --> 01:16:22,259
out of the seedsman haze which seedsman

2073
01:16:20,279 --> 01:16:25,559
were just seeds that they were buying in

2074
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:27,539
bulk from David ah and and if you grow

2075
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:29,580
the and so they I don't know whether it

2076
01:16:27,539 --> 01:16:31,198
was they were this this seed came from

2077
01:16:29,579 --> 01:16:33,600
ones that they had bought directly from

2078
01:16:31,198 --> 01:16:35,819
David or they had bought from David and

2079
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:38,100
repopulated them and then this seed came

2080
01:16:35,819 --> 01:16:40,920
from those but I'll tell you this plant

2081
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:44,219
came to me as a clone and I had them in

2082
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:47,460
the grow room and they would continually

2083
01:16:44,219 --> 01:16:51,119
get mixed up one for the other and from

2084
01:16:47,460 --> 01:16:53,460
Veg clone flower bud

2085
01:16:51,119 --> 01:16:55,640
you had to have a really trained eye to

2086
01:16:53,460 --> 01:16:57,840
be able to tell the two of them apart

2087
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:58,800
same with the grapefruit and the Soul

2088
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:01,739
Shine

2089
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:04,140
they both have like their their set of

2090
01:17:01,738 --> 01:17:06,000
traits are so similar

2091
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:08,280
that you have to know the plant

2092
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:10,859
intimately and be like oh this one has a

2093
01:17:08,279 --> 01:17:13,319
slightly wider leaf and a different curl

2094
01:17:10,859 --> 01:17:15,179
to the you know the the serration and

2095
01:17:13,319 --> 01:17:17,698
the leaf that one is this one and this

2096
01:17:15,179 --> 01:17:20,158
one is the other one

2097
01:17:17,698 --> 01:17:21,299
but otherwise you can't tell I mean my

2098
01:17:20,158 --> 01:17:23,399
friends used to grow the grapefruit and

2099
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:25,500
the soul shine in greenhouses and they

2100
01:17:23,399 --> 01:17:27,619
would mix the bud and you nobody ever

2101
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:31,140
knew that the bud was mixed right

2102
01:17:27,619 --> 01:17:32,579
yeah okay there you go so so there's a

2103
01:17:31,140 --> 01:17:35,520
so that's what I when I talk about a

2104
01:17:32,579 --> 01:17:37,140
flavor class that's an example of that

2105
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:39,020
right where

2106
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:41,579
you know

2107
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:43,080
we're not going to push this in so I'll

2108
01:17:41,579 --> 01:17:46,500
use the kind of more crass analogy it's

2109
01:17:43,079 --> 01:17:49,559
like you know it's kind of like saying

2110
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:50,760
well all all Asian kids look the same

2111
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:53,520
right

2112
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:55,800
yeah it's not true there's a variation

2113
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:57,840
in them you might find two kids that

2114
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:59,840
almost look identical it's just you know

2115
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:03,719
familiar so you can't say the difference

2116
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:07,380
exactly yeah but within any family

2117
01:18:03,719 --> 01:18:08,698
there's groups right so the you know and

2118
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:11,159
that's one of the things we we learned

2119
01:18:08,698 --> 01:18:12,899
again when we did these large

2120
01:18:11,158 --> 01:18:14,639
populations grow as with all the

2121
01:18:12,899 --> 01:18:17,158
chemical analysis that you can identify

2122
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:21,300
these unique types and that it's not

2123
01:18:17,158 --> 01:18:23,759
every plant is not while it might be

2124
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:25,800
a unique individual it's not necessarily

2125
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:28,020
a unique chemistry right like the buzz

2126
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:30,679
you couldn't tell apart from between

2127
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:30,679
them so

2128
01:18:30,779 --> 01:18:36,658
yeah there you go sweet skunk in the in

2129
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:39,539
the seedsman taser pure are the same and

2130
01:18:36,658 --> 01:18:42,179
you know again we can talk about that

2131
01:18:39,539 --> 01:18:43,679
later with napro but the again we

2132
01:18:42,179 --> 01:18:45,960
learned that these terpene profiles

2133
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:49,380
they're characteristics right it's a

2134
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:51,420
trait that gets inherited and so while

2135
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:53,880
the plant might not be identical to the

2136
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:56,340
parent oftentimes

2137
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:58,380
the terpene profile is

2138
01:18:56,340 --> 01:19:01,679
right so you can end up with plants that

2139
01:18:58,380 --> 01:19:04,619
smell exactly like the mom or the dad

2140
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:06,420
right and so once when Steve found this

2141
01:19:04,619 --> 01:19:08,460
sweet skunk plant or his friend that

2142
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:10,920
found it found it whatever the story is

2143
01:19:08,460 --> 01:19:13,380
and who cares

2144
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:15,420
yeah he found a plant that was neat but

2145
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:18,659
he just found a plant that was a subtype

2146
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:21,539
of this terpene profile right it's not

2147
01:19:18,658 --> 01:19:23,219
really a unique plant the sweet scar

2148
01:19:21,539 --> 01:19:24,600
kind of fits the description of what

2149
01:19:23,219 --> 01:19:28,198
you're talking about I mean it really is

2150
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:30,360
a kind of pithy equatorial plant

2151
01:19:28,198 --> 01:19:32,879
um that has that really what we would

2152
01:19:30,359 --> 01:19:34,559
you know classically use I'm going to

2153
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:37,199
use the word I hate using sativa but

2154
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:39,239
it's it's it's got that profile and it's

2155
01:19:37,198 --> 01:19:43,559
got like you said the fox tails and the

2156
01:19:39,238 --> 01:19:45,419
the kind of staggered calyxes or the

2157
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:48,060
staggered bracks on the flower structure

2158
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:50,340
it's not a big beefy plant

2159
01:19:48,060 --> 01:19:52,739
um which is kind of odd because the

2160
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:55,860
mother was right like sour diesel is not

2161
01:19:52,738 --> 01:19:58,619
huge but it does have quite dense modern

2162
01:19:55,859 --> 01:20:03,599
looking flowers right highly resinous

2163
01:19:58,619 --> 01:20:05,460
very very fewly and uh in in a lot of

2164
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:08,340
individuals from that family they kind

2165
01:20:05,460 --> 01:20:11,520
of got stomped on by the the sweet skunk

2166
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:12,659
side which was really was not expected

2167
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:15,659
um

2168
01:20:12,658 --> 01:20:17,579
but you know it might have added a

2169
01:20:15,658 --> 01:20:19,319
little more intensity to the high

2170
01:20:17,579 --> 01:20:20,698
so I I like that hybrid there's some

2171
01:20:19,319 --> 01:20:22,019
really great plants in that in that

2172
01:20:20,698 --> 01:20:25,019
family

2173
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:27,659
yeah I I look I'm certainly Keen to try

2174
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:31,199
some others based on this experience we

2175
01:20:27,658 --> 01:20:33,359
had a viewer ask a question of are you

2176
01:20:31,198 --> 01:20:35,279
releasing seeds that they would be able

2177
01:20:33,359 --> 01:20:37,500
to purchase and if so like where can

2178
01:20:35,279 --> 01:20:39,899
someone pick up some of your work

2179
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:42,779
so breeders retail is really the main

2180
01:20:39,899 --> 01:20:44,639
bank that's over in in the UK

2181
01:20:42,779 --> 01:20:45,559
um because I'm working in Canada right

2182
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:49,260
now

2183
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:50,760
mainly the work that I'm doing in the

2184
01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:52,199
regulated market can only be sold

2185
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:54,920
through the regulated market in Canada

2186
01:20:52,198 --> 01:20:57,238
one of the things about the legal

2187
01:20:54,920 --> 01:21:00,179
aspects in Canada

2188
01:20:57,238 --> 01:21:02,879
is that we've created this legal system

2189
01:21:00,179 --> 01:21:05,579
but in order to respect International

2190
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:08,699
Drug law of which we're still beholden

2191
01:21:05,579 --> 01:21:11,698
to the EU

2192
01:21:08,698 --> 01:21:13,460
um we don't export Recreational Products

2193
01:21:11,698 --> 01:21:16,559
we can only export

2194
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:17,399
medical or scientific products so a lot

2195
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:18,659
of the work that I'm actually doing

2196
01:21:17,399 --> 01:21:20,219
right now won't actually be able to

2197
01:21:18,658 --> 01:21:22,079
leave the Canadian system until we can

2198
01:21:20,219 --> 01:21:23,460
start exporting it

2199
01:21:22,079 --> 01:21:25,319
um all of the old work is still

2200
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:27,539
available

2201
01:21:25,319 --> 01:21:28,738
um I actually pulled everything off the

2202
01:21:27,539 --> 01:21:31,979
market a couple of years ago when

2203
01:21:28,738 --> 01:21:34,079
there's this big pubco Frenzy

2204
01:21:31,979 --> 01:21:36,059
um and we're just reopening breeders

2205
01:21:34,079 --> 01:21:39,420
retail which is a site

2206
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:42,539
that will be up soon it's an old friend

2207
01:21:39,420 --> 01:21:44,520
in the UK that's going to do it and all

2208
01:21:42,539 --> 01:21:46,819
the stock is you know produced over

2209
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:50,219
there in Europe many years ago anyway so

2210
01:21:46,819 --> 01:21:52,738
it's uh it can be sold internationally

2211
01:21:50,219 --> 01:21:54,239
from there

2212
01:21:52,738 --> 01:21:56,819
um

2213
01:21:54,238 --> 01:21:58,859
there probably will be a way at some

2214
01:21:56,819 --> 01:22:00,960
point in time for some other work to be

2215
01:21:58,859 --> 01:22:03,119
done in Europe legally and then those

2216
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:05,039
seeds can be sold onto the international

2217
01:22:03,119 --> 01:22:06,960
market through that but it's not a

2218
01:22:05,039 --> 01:22:08,819
current thing right now we're kind of

2219
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:11,219
trying to

2220
01:22:08,819 --> 01:22:13,139
um get this new iteration of the

2221
01:22:11,219 --> 01:22:16,198
business within the Canadian Market to

2222
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:18,239
be able to supply clones and improve

2223
01:22:16,198 --> 01:22:20,039
genetics to all the new licensed Growers

2224
01:22:18,238 --> 01:22:21,959
that are coming online and we've got

2225
01:22:20,039 --> 01:22:24,658
many now in Canada I mean it started

2226
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:26,579
with just a few but we have well over a

2227
01:22:24,658 --> 01:22:28,439
couple of hundred licensed Growers and

2228
01:22:26,579 --> 01:22:30,300
some new small craft Growers what

2229
01:22:28,439 --> 01:22:32,158
they're calling micro licenses

2230
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:35,699
that are allowed to grow you know I

2231
01:22:32,158 --> 01:22:36,539
think it's 250 square meters

2232
01:22:35,698 --> 01:22:38,879
um

2233
01:22:36,539 --> 01:22:40,738
which is good because it's enough for a

2234
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:42,179
family to a family-run business for

2235
01:22:40,738 --> 01:22:44,579
people to make enough money to make a

2236
01:22:42,179 --> 01:22:46,560
living and probably make a good living

2237
01:22:44,579 --> 01:22:49,019
and

2238
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:50,820
um it also allows them to focus on a

2239
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:53,400
smaller footprint

2240
01:22:50,819 --> 01:22:55,319
so we have a higher quality product than

2241
01:22:53,399 --> 01:22:56,639
what was coming out of these very large

2242
01:22:55,319 --> 01:22:59,519
grows

2243
01:22:56,640 --> 01:23:01,320
uh that are producing hundreds of

2244
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:04,080
thousands of square feet worth of of

2245
01:23:01,319 --> 01:23:06,840
flowers and when you start producing

2246
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:08,819
cannabis on that scale

2247
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:11,100
it's actually quite difficult to

2248
01:23:08,819 --> 01:23:14,420
maintain the level of quality that

2249
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:16,679
people have come to express expect from

2250
01:23:14,420 --> 01:23:18,539
the high quality cannabis that you can

2251
01:23:16,679 --> 01:23:21,199
find on you know any given market around

2252
01:23:18,539 --> 01:23:21,198
the world really

2253
01:23:21,539 --> 01:23:25,439
um and so yeah so our new our new

2254
01:23:23,279 --> 01:23:26,880
project is really bringing in the

2255
01:23:25,439 --> 01:23:28,678
genetics we've got the ability to

2256
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:31,319
legally import genetics from other

2257
01:23:28,679 --> 01:23:32,520
countries so we've been bringing in a

2258
01:23:31,319 --> 01:23:34,799
lot of work that was done in Europe

2259
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:36,300
under license over there bringing it

2260
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:38,640
into Canada and we're going to be

2261
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:41,520
re-screening large populations of all

2262
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:43,260
the old goodies and bringing them to

2263
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:44,940
life and making them available in the

2264
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:47,219
new system

2265
01:23:44,939 --> 01:23:50,639
that's really exciting

2266
01:23:47,219 --> 01:23:52,198
um I wanted to specifically ask I want

2267
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:54,420
to talk about some of your older strains

2268
01:23:52,198 --> 01:23:56,339
in just a second but before we do I've

2269
01:23:54,420 --> 01:23:58,679
noticed that some of the more newer ones

2270
01:23:56,340 --> 01:24:00,600
and by new you know relative term you

2271
01:23:58,679 --> 01:24:02,640
you're working with sweet skunk and

2272
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:04,620
obviously you had involvement with

2273
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:06,179
sweets gunk in the past and Steve so

2274
01:24:04,619 --> 01:24:07,859
that might be the simple answer to the

2275
01:24:06,179 --> 01:24:09,600
question that it was just like proximity

2276
01:24:07,859 --> 01:24:11,579
but were there any specific

2277
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:13,500
characteristics about the sweet skunk

2278
01:24:11,579 --> 01:24:16,260
that you really liked which kind of made

2279
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:18,779
you want to work with it a little more

2280
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:21,420
yeah but one of the reasons is it

2281
01:24:18,779 --> 01:24:23,399
reverses easily it makes a lot of pollen

2282
01:24:21,420 --> 01:24:26,640
so you know when you're doing a seed

2283
01:24:23,399 --> 01:24:28,079
crop that's um going to be sold you want

2284
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:30,020
it to produce as many seeds as possible

2285
01:24:28,079 --> 01:24:33,300
so that was one of the drivers behind it

2286
01:24:30,020 --> 01:24:35,580
as an initial feminized release it's

2287
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:37,500
also a great plant it's a it's a really

2288
01:24:35,579 --> 01:24:39,179
hazy piffy type as you were saying

2289
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:40,439
earlier

2290
01:24:39,179 --> 01:24:43,079
um

2291
01:24:40,439 --> 01:24:45,178
and it's enjoyable it leaves this

2292
01:24:43,079 --> 01:24:48,300
beautiful

2293
01:24:45,179 --> 01:24:49,920
I want to say in like sweet perfumey

2294
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:53,279
incensey

2295
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:54,539
um nose in the air and it's kind of

2296
01:24:53,279 --> 01:24:57,119
bizarre it's one of those things that

2297
01:24:54,539 --> 01:24:59,179
I've had with other other types as well

2298
01:24:57,119 --> 01:25:01,979
typically if you're lighting the joint

2299
01:24:59,179 --> 01:25:03,179
you don't smell it but if you you know

2300
01:25:01,979 --> 01:25:04,559
if you like The Joint you smoke a little

2301
01:25:03,179 --> 01:25:05,940
bit and then you pass it to somebody and

2302
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:08,120
you leave the room

2303
01:25:05,939 --> 01:25:10,619
for a few minutes and then come back in

2304
01:25:08,119 --> 01:25:13,920
you're immediately hit by this very

2305
01:25:10,619 --> 01:25:15,779
sweet incensey kind of unique exotic

2306
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:17,340
smell and it's hard to just it's hard to

2307
01:25:15,779 --> 01:25:19,800
describe again because we don't have a

2308
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:22,020
common set of knowledge or common set of

2309
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:24,719
words to describe it but it's really

2310
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:27,360
quite intriguing and um

2311
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:30,000
so so from that perspective yeah I just

2312
01:25:27,359 --> 01:25:31,859
wanted to see how she came together and

2313
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:34,500
interplayed with some of the other

2314
01:25:31,859 --> 01:25:36,599
plants that I had in the collection

2315
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:38,399
and it's a part of a breeding program

2316
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:40,739
those are not finished breeding programs

2317
01:25:38,399 --> 01:25:43,079
by any means but you know I kind of like

2318
01:25:40,738 --> 01:25:44,759
to release release small batches out of

2319
01:25:43,079 --> 01:25:46,260
those so that other people have the same

2320
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:49,380
genetics that I'm working with and they

2321
01:25:46,260 --> 01:25:50,880
can create parallel lines or or back

2322
01:25:49,380 --> 01:25:52,319
cross them to for example I mean that

2323
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:54,239
would be a great candidate for example

2324
01:25:52,319 --> 01:25:55,920
to back cross to sour diesel or to Sweet

2325
01:25:54,238 --> 01:25:58,500
skunk right you can kind of start

2326
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:59,399
different breeding programs with it

2327
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:00,479
um and that was really one of the

2328
01:25:59,399 --> 01:26:02,519
reasons that I did that with the

2329
01:26:00,479 --> 01:26:03,539
blueberry lines as well

2330
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:04,800
um you know blueberry is a great

2331
01:26:03,539 --> 01:26:07,260
population it's an inch really

2332
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:09,420
interesting plant with the colors and

2333
01:26:07,260 --> 01:26:11,579
some of the shapes and and things but it

2334
01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:13,920
also has some weaknesses and so

2335
01:26:11,579 --> 01:26:15,420
when you're using a population like that

2336
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:17,100
sometimes you wanna we were talking

2337
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:19,020
about back Crossing earlier sometimes

2338
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:21,420
you might want to take one of those

2339
01:26:19,020 --> 01:26:23,820
traits from the hybrid plant and use

2340
01:26:21,420 --> 01:26:25,319
that to enter grass or incorporate into

2341
01:26:23,819 --> 01:26:27,238
the blueberry line

2342
01:26:25,319 --> 01:26:29,039
right and so a lot of these these things

2343
01:26:27,238 --> 01:26:31,439
are part of projects that are ongoing

2344
01:26:29,039 --> 01:26:33,960
that I kind of just share along the way

2345
01:26:31,439 --> 01:26:35,579
so that they don't get lost if you know

2346
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:36,779
something happens to me either they end

2347
01:26:35,579 --> 01:26:38,100
up in other people's hands I think

2348
01:26:36,779 --> 01:26:41,099
that's part of responsible plant

2349
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:42,980
breeding is to share things with people

2350
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:45,300
you know

2351
01:26:42,979 --> 01:26:46,559
which is kind of funny given the the

2352
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:48,900
conversation that we're going to have in

2353
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:52,620
the future about uh intellectual

2354
01:26:48,899 --> 01:26:55,379
property and cannabis development but

2355
01:26:52,619 --> 01:26:56,939
um yeah those are fantastic plants and I

2356
01:26:55,380 --> 01:26:58,079
really like those populations they're a

2357
01:26:56,939 --> 01:27:00,238
lot of fun

2358
01:26:58,079 --> 01:27:02,399
yeah I mean the person the pudding right

2359
01:27:00,238 --> 01:27:04,079
and you just touched on my next question

2360
01:27:02,399 --> 01:27:06,000
perfectly for me where I was going to

2361
01:27:04,079 --> 01:27:07,920
talk about how you had some notable

2362
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:11,039
experience working with some of the

2363
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:13,500
earlier versions of blueberry and

2364
01:27:11,039 --> 01:27:16,979
notably in your fighting Buddha cross

2365
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:19,139
you use like an F2 blueberry and I think

2366
01:27:16,979 --> 01:27:20,759
the part which struck my curiosity the

2367
01:27:19,139 --> 01:27:23,159
most was that this was back in the

2368
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:25,679
generations where people often regarded

2369
01:27:23,158 --> 01:27:27,238
blueberries like more blueberry back

2370
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:29,158
then like you often hear comments about

2371
01:27:27,238 --> 01:27:31,619
the blueberry muffin or the blueberry

2372
01:27:29,158 --> 01:27:34,559
syrup terpenes that the earlier

2373
01:27:31,619 --> 01:27:37,019
Generations had which are often said to

2374
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:38,940
not quite be present anymore was that

2375
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:40,320
your experience that there was those

2376
01:27:38,939 --> 01:27:42,479
sort of expressions and what's your

2377
01:27:40,319 --> 01:27:45,299
thoughts on blueberry now

2378
01:27:42,479 --> 01:27:46,859
okay so one little correction I think

2379
01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:50,940
the blueberry that we we actually used

2380
01:27:46,859 --> 01:27:54,059
was an F4 those were seeds from DJ

2381
01:27:50,939 --> 01:27:55,319
um but maybe it hasn't probably been

2382
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:58,739
known but I don't think it's terrible to

2383
01:27:55,319 --> 01:28:00,319
say that those seeds they came to Canada

2384
01:27:58,738 --> 01:28:03,119
um from someone

2385
01:28:00,319 --> 01:28:05,759
arrived them here whatever with DJ or

2386
01:28:03,119 --> 01:28:07,260
without him I'm not sure but when I saw

2387
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:09,600
them they all came and they were in a

2388
01:28:07,260 --> 01:28:11,100
container or they were in a a one piece

2389
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:12,300
of corrugated plastic and there's all

2390
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:14,460
these different lines in it and my

2391
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:16,560
understanding was that those were seeds

2392
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:20,399
that had come back from Dutch Passion

2393
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:22,920
after DJ's uh experience with them

2394
01:28:20,399 --> 01:28:24,479
and these seeds were returned to him and

2395
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:26,940
they were the pure seeds that he had

2396
01:28:24,479 --> 01:28:30,119
originally brought over from which Dutch

2397
01:28:26,939 --> 01:28:32,579
Passion started their programs and so

2398
01:28:30,119 --> 01:28:34,019
they came back and when they came back I

2399
01:28:32,579 --> 01:28:37,380
think that they'd been a little bit

2400
01:28:34,020 --> 01:28:39,060
mixed up to a certain degree

2401
01:28:37,380 --> 01:28:42,000
um but

2402
01:28:39,060 --> 01:28:44,340
from from DJ's

2403
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:46,619
um notes and information that we had and

2404
01:28:44,340 --> 01:28:48,960
he was there at the time as well

2405
01:28:46,619 --> 01:28:51,119
I believe they were actually an F4 plant

2406
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:53,399
that we that we or the plant that we

2407
01:28:51,119 --> 01:28:55,979
selected was from the F4 generation

2408
01:28:53,399 --> 01:28:58,619
and so that word that was done in Canada

2409
01:28:55,979 --> 01:29:00,178
was done at a friend's grow

2410
01:28:58,619 --> 01:29:01,679
um and it wasn't a huge grow but it was

2411
01:29:00,179 --> 01:29:02,880
you know like 12 or 15 lights or

2412
01:29:01,679 --> 01:29:04,679
something like that

2413
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:06,420
enough to grow a bunch of really small

2414
01:29:04,679 --> 01:29:09,420
plants and Screen them out and we think

2415
01:29:06,420 --> 01:29:10,859
grew like or the grower grew I kind of

2416
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:13,199
went over and helped with the selections

2417
01:29:10,859 --> 01:29:15,779
and babysat them a little bit but it

2418
01:29:13,198 --> 01:29:18,479
wasn't my grow to be clear

2419
01:29:15,779 --> 01:29:20,519
um and the grower there you know grew

2420
01:29:18,479 --> 01:29:22,678
all these plants and then our friend red

2421
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:24,960
from Legends and DJ would come up and we

2422
01:29:22,679 --> 01:29:27,060
would go through the plants and look for

2423
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:31,020
different candidates and so

2424
01:29:27,060 --> 01:29:32,820
I was part of the uh the group that did

2425
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:34,500
that got to do all the selections on

2426
01:29:32,819 --> 01:29:38,039
those plants so we looked at you know

2427
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:39,479
100 like a few hundred of each type the

2428
01:29:38,039 --> 01:29:41,399
flow

2429
01:29:39,479 --> 01:29:43,559
um what was supposed to be the the blue

2430
01:29:41,399 --> 01:29:44,219
moonshine

2431
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:46,980
um

2432
01:29:44,219 --> 01:29:49,980
the blueberry and and they all got relay

2433
01:29:46,979 --> 01:29:53,759
renamed you know F the the F number 13

2434
01:29:49,979 --> 01:29:55,919
or flow number 13 became f13

2435
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:58,980
um there was a plant called

2436
01:29:55,920 --> 01:30:00,719
oh no it was B-25 it was it was in the

2437
01:29:58,979 --> 01:30:03,238
blueberry line and that plant became the

2438
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:04,560
mother of grape crush and it actually

2439
01:30:03,238 --> 01:30:06,178
was a plant like you're talking about

2440
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:08,760
like she was in the blueberry muffin

2441
01:30:06,179 --> 01:30:12,060
side of the Cross but there's also a lot

2442
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:14,820
of stuff on the other side which is more

2443
01:30:12,060 --> 01:30:17,340
of like um

2444
01:30:14,819 --> 01:30:20,939
I don't mean spicy and like a hot exotic

2445
01:30:17,340 --> 01:30:23,579
way just like kind of a dry

2446
01:30:20,939 --> 01:30:25,500
kind of a roasty flavor

2447
01:30:23,579 --> 01:30:28,079
um and a with a lot of chocolate

2448
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:30,060
influence to it like a lot of chocolatey

2449
01:30:28,079 --> 01:30:32,639
notes to it

2450
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:34,440
um and that is really really prevalent

2451
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:36,539
in both the flow and the blueberry lines

2452
01:30:34,439 --> 01:30:38,339
and I think at this point in time

2453
01:30:36,539 --> 01:30:39,719
well this was an F4 so it was earlier

2454
01:30:38,340 --> 01:30:41,340
than the most Generations that have been

2455
01:30:39,719 --> 01:30:43,920
on the market but even they were a bit

2456
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:46,560
blue or a bit more chocolatey than the

2457
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:49,139
blueberry flavor I had previously grown

2458
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:51,719
quite small populations because you know

2459
01:30:49,139 --> 01:30:54,060
getting DJ seeds in Canada was pretty

2460
01:30:51,719 --> 01:30:55,319
expensive I couldn't afford to grow 500

2461
01:30:54,060 --> 01:30:58,679
of them

2462
01:30:55,319 --> 01:31:00,059
um but I think we grew you know 150 of

2463
01:30:58,679 --> 01:31:02,579
them or something like that now I found

2464
01:31:00,060 --> 01:31:05,400
a couple of plants that were quite

2465
01:31:02,579 --> 01:31:07,738
in that blueberry syrup sweet character

2466
01:31:05,399 --> 01:31:09,738
sweet side of the Cross

2467
01:31:07,738 --> 01:31:13,678
um

2468
01:31:09,738 --> 01:31:15,359
DJ's plants are they've been like I said

2469
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:17,340
they've been bred for multiple

2470
01:31:15,359 --> 01:31:19,679
Generations

2471
01:31:17,340 --> 01:31:22,560
um usually using one plant as the parent

2472
01:31:19,679 --> 01:31:24,000
of each generation and so they in my

2473
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:26,940
opinion they suffer a little bit from

2474
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:29,819
inbreeding depression which is corrected

2475
01:31:26,939 --> 01:31:31,799
when you hybridize them to another plant

2476
01:31:29,819 --> 01:31:32,939
but it's something that's present in the

2477
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:34,920
line if you're trying to grow up pure

2478
01:31:32,939 --> 01:31:37,439
and there's also the this characteristic

2479
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:39,600
that I call the crinkler the leaf that

2480
01:31:37,439 --> 01:31:42,299
some people call it the Twisted leaf

2481
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:44,400
but it's a it's a or variegation it's

2482
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:46,440
not really a form of variegation but

2483
01:31:44,399 --> 01:31:48,299
it's a genetic anomaly that the plant

2484
01:31:46,439 --> 01:31:50,158
has where the leaf kind of grows like

2485
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:51,480
really weird shaped it doesn't look like

2486
01:31:50,158 --> 01:31:53,099
cannabis

2487
01:31:51,479 --> 01:31:54,779
like I mean it looks like cannabis but

2488
01:31:53,100 --> 01:31:56,579
they're all kind of gnarled and twisted

2489
01:31:54,779 --> 01:31:59,460
rather than having these long beautiful

2490
01:31:56,579 --> 01:32:01,439
straight lamina like the you know the

2491
01:31:59,460 --> 01:32:04,380
fingers of the of the typical cannabis

2492
01:32:01,439 --> 01:32:06,500
leaf that everyone knows

2493
01:32:04,380 --> 01:32:06,500
um

2494
01:32:06,658 --> 01:32:11,420
so from a breeding perspective you can

2495
01:32:08,698 --> 01:32:14,939
grow a lot of those and throw them away

2496
01:32:11,420 --> 01:32:16,260
DJ like to think that he he had an idea

2497
01:32:14,939 --> 01:32:16,979
that

2498
01:32:16,260 --> 01:32:19,860
um

2499
01:32:16,979 --> 01:32:21,479
maybe those plants were

2500
01:32:19,859 --> 01:32:24,299
the more

2501
01:32:21,479 --> 01:32:25,259
desirable ones

2502
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:26,940
um

2503
01:32:25,260 --> 01:32:28,500
and so I think that he's selected for

2504
01:32:26,939 --> 01:32:30,779
that trait a little bit in past

2505
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:33,719
generations and that's why again we see

2506
01:32:30,779 --> 01:32:36,420
it reoccurring in in future Generations

2507
01:32:33,719 --> 01:32:38,279
like again like begets like I mean if

2508
01:32:36,420 --> 01:32:40,440
you you select those plants in past

2509
01:32:38,279 --> 01:32:42,059
Generations there's a higher probability

2510
01:32:40,439 --> 01:32:44,219
that those plants are going to be seen

2511
01:32:42,060 --> 01:32:45,960
in the in the future generations and so

2512
01:32:44,219 --> 01:32:47,460
I actually personally I tried to stick

2513
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:49,139
away from those plants because I saw

2514
01:32:47,460 --> 01:32:51,359
them as a negative characteristic in the

2515
01:32:49,139 --> 01:32:53,279
population I mean from a Grower's point

2516
01:32:51,359 --> 01:32:56,158
of view I actually worked in a seed shop

2517
01:32:53,279 --> 01:32:58,139
a head shop when I was in in University

2518
01:32:56,158 --> 01:33:01,738
and I remember a guy coming in he had

2519
01:32:58,139 --> 01:33:03,359
spent 250 bucks on 10. of of the DJ

2520
01:33:01,738 --> 01:33:05,759
blueberry and he came back in with the

2521
01:33:03,359 --> 01:33:07,259
plant and you know this was back in the

2522
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:08,940
day when it was like if you brought a

2523
01:33:07,260 --> 01:33:12,000
plant into a public store you were

2524
01:33:08,939 --> 01:33:13,019
pretty much crazy right and so this dude

2525
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,340
there's two walks of the store with

2526
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:15,900
these plants and they're all twisted

2527
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:18,239
they've got this really ugly variegated

2528
01:33:15,899 --> 01:33:19,799
leaf and they just didn't grow very fast

2529
01:33:18,238 --> 01:33:21,718
and they were suffering from inbreeding

2530
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:25,079
depression and he was demanding his

2531
01:33:21,719 --> 01:33:27,179
money back because it was you know he

2532
01:33:25,079 --> 01:33:28,679
thought he had paid so much money that

2533
01:33:27,179 --> 01:33:31,260
he shouldn't be gone and it's like dude

2534
01:33:28,679 --> 01:33:33,899
that's what the seeds do I mean you know

2535
01:33:31,260 --> 01:33:35,520
we're not making the seeds here you kind

2536
01:33:33,899 --> 01:33:37,500
of get what you get but I think we gave

2537
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:41,159
him another pack and sent him on his way

2538
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:44,579
yeah as you do right as you do yeah

2539
01:33:41,158 --> 01:33:47,819
that's right so but but so I I really

2540
01:33:44,579 --> 01:33:49,800
like DJ's population it's it's for the

2541
01:33:47,819 --> 01:33:51,238
most part you know when he was doing all

2542
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:54,239
that work in Oregon

2543
01:33:51,238 --> 01:33:55,439
it's that he never crossed it like the

2544
01:33:54,238 --> 01:33:57,479
one thing that he did that was so cool

2545
01:33:55,439 --> 01:33:59,099
is that he never just crossed it to

2546
01:33:57,479 --> 01:34:00,959
to everything else I mean there's kind

2547
01:33:59,100 --> 01:34:03,239
of this weird thing in the in the

2548
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:05,158
Cannabis Community where you know the

2549
01:34:03,238 --> 01:34:07,198
the way that people breed weed is they

2550
01:34:05,158 --> 01:34:09,479
their breed cannabis was the last at

2551
01:34:07,198 --> 01:34:11,698
least 20 years it's like you take you

2552
01:34:09,479 --> 01:34:13,859
you'd grow out last year's Cannabis Cup

2553
01:34:11,698 --> 01:34:16,019
winner and you'd find a new plant and

2554
01:34:13,859 --> 01:34:17,460
then somebody would win the Cannabis Cup

2555
01:34:16,020 --> 01:34:18,900
the next year and you'd get seeds from

2556
01:34:17,460 --> 01:34:19,800
that and you'd cross that to your old

2557
01:34:18,899 --> 01:34:22,379
plant

2558
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:24,239
and then the next year somebody

2559
01:34:22,380 --> 01:34:25,920
has another plant that wins the Cannabis

2560
01:34:24,238 --> 01:34:28,079
Cup and then you just go out across it

2561
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:30,239
again to the next Plant right

2562
01:34:28,079 --> 01:34:34,158
and nobody really took the time to start

2563
01:34:30,238 --> 01:34:34,158
stabilizing or trying to to

2564
01:34:34,279 --> 01:34:38,819
stabilize and make anything uniform it

2565
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:41,039
was always about just crossing it to the

2566
01:34:38,819 --> 01:34:43,500
next best thing

2567
01:34:41,039 --> 01:34:45,420
um and DJ didn't do that right like he

2568
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:47,340
made his initial crosses and then he

2569
01:34:45,420 --> 01:34:48,840
didn't go outside for germ plasma he

2570
01:34:47,340 --> 01:34:51,060
only worked within the families that he

2571
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:56,219
had that he had created

2572
01:34:51,060 --> 01:34:59,039
and so to me flow and blueberry and you

2573
01:34:56,219 --> 01:35:01,739
know f-13 and and grape crush and all

2574
01:34:59,039 --> 01:35:04,019
these ones to me I look at those as like

2575
01:35:01,738 --> 01:35:06,599
they're really all one family but

2576
01:35:04,020 --> 01:35:08,040
they're like cousins right or they're or

2577
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:09,900
they're what we call half siblings or

2578
01:35:08,039 --> 01:35:12,840
half-brothers right they they share a

2579
01:35:09,899 --> 01:35:14,279
mother or they share a father

2580
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:16,800
um

2581
01:35:14,279 --> 01:35:18,779
and so to me it's really all one family

2582
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:20,420
rather than a bunch of different types

2583
01:35:18,779 --> 01:35:22,380
and they're yeah there are different

2584
01:35:20,420 --> 01:35:24,420
phenotypes and genotypes within the

2585
01:35:22,380 --> 01:35:26,520
family like you know the blue moonshine

2586
01:35:24,420 --> 01:35:29,579
yes stocky and it's got

2587
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:32,159
it's it's shorter stature it's got wide

2588
01:35:29,579 --> 01:35:33,899
leaves and frosty Buds and then the

2589
01:35:32,158 --> 01:35:36,719
great the blueberry story is a little

2590
01:35:33,899 --> 01:35:37,979
bit taller and the the f-13 has its own

2591
01:35:36,719 --> 01:35:39,779
thing and they've all got kind of their

2592
01:35:37,979 --> 01:35:42,059
own thing right they're all like a

2593
01:35:39,779 --> 01:35:44,399
little bit different

2594
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:46,739
um flower structure scent all that kind

2595
01:35:44,399 --> 01:35:49,019
of stuff but they all they also do have

2596
01:35:46,738 --> 01:35:51,059
all these characteristics that are quite

2597
01:35:49,020 --> 01:35:52,500
shared amongst the DJ family like the

2598
01:35:51,060 --> 01:35:56,039
really purple leaf stems and the Really

2599
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:58,198
purple striped leaves or sorry uh stems

2600
01:35:56,039 --> 01:35:59,579
right the main stocks or the underside

2601
01:35:58,198 --> 01:36:01,379
of the leaves I have that kind of purple

2602
01:35:59,579 --> 01:36:04,319
color

2603
01:36:01,380 --> 01:36:07,139
um so yeah so he that the fact that he

2604
01:36:04,319 --> 01:36:09,059
had all that stuff and and bred it in

2605
01:36:07,139 --> 01:36:12,119
line and kind of kept it

2606
01:36:09,060 --> 01:36:13,860
isolated from the rest of the drug pool

2607
01:36:12,119 --> 01:36:15,658
it really makes it interesting for

2608
01:36:13,859 --> 01:36:17,759
actually using as a hybridization tool

2609
01:36:15,658 --> 01:36:19,920
to cross back to other parts of the drug

2610
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:22,679
pool right and that's why I think that

2611
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:24,859
we've seen such an incredible

2612
01:36:22,679 --> 01:36:24,859
um

2613
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:29,039
spread of those those genes I mean we

2614
01:36:27,238 --> 01:36:31,138
see it on all sorts of lines from like

2615
01:36:29,039 --> 01:36:34,679
bubbleberry to Blue Dream and that's

2616
01:36:31,139 --> 01:36:36,359
like over you know 15 20 years right

2617
01:36:34,679 --> 01:36:38,579
there's not many breeders that have had

2618
01:36:36,359 --> 01:36:41,099
that kind of influence

2619
01:36:38,579 --> 01:36:43,859
um so yeah you gotta you know you gotta

2620
01:36:41,100 --> 01:36:47,039
love DJ he's also just a great guy I

2621
01:36:43,859 --> 01:36:47,759
mean he's a really really nice guy

2622
01:36:47,039 --> 01:36:51,479
um

2623
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:54,000
so yeah yeah I wholeheartedly agree he's

2624
01:36:51,479 --> 01:36:56,698
always been very very lovely to me so

2625
01:36:54,000 --> 01:37:00,060
big UPS DJ and I guess as a follow-on

2626
01:36:56,698 --> 01:37:02,939
question to that what's your favorite DJ

2627
01:37:00,060 --> 01:37:04,199
Short Cross or cultivar that you've come

2628
01:37:02,939 --> 01:37:06,599
across and I guess there's a little

2629
01:37:04,198 --> 01:37:08,519
follow-up do you currently follow his

2630
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:10,500
more recent work because he's actually

2631
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:12,540
digging into some of his really old

2632
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:14,039
stock trying to pull some cool unique

2633
01:37:12,539 --> 01:37:15,539
stuff out I thought maybe that might be

2634
01:37:14,039 --> 01:37:17,760
interesting to you

2635
01:37:15,539 --> 01:37:19,380
yeah we kind of lost touch I mean he was

2636
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:20,880
when when we were working together and

2637
01:37:19,380 --> 01:37:22,260
doing all that stuff he was living in

2638
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:24,600
Canada and he was actually trying to

2639
01:37:22,260 --> 01:37:25,860
move here during the um where he went

2640
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:27,480
through a period of trying to move here

2641
01:37:25,859 --> 01:37:30,359
during the bush years

2642
01:37:27,479 --> 01:37:33,959
and it didn't work out in the end and um

2643
01:37:30,359 --> 01:37:35,339
he eventually moved back down to to

2644
01:37:33,960 --> 01:37:37,380
um

2645
01:37:35,340 --> 01:37:40,020
uh to wherever he is in Oregon in

2646
01:37:37,380 --> 01:37:41,880
California but when he was in Vancouver

2647
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:44,179
I had just moved to Vancouver you know

2648
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:48,000
very like right before then

2649
01:37:44,179 --> 01:37:49,440
and he coincidentally lived like three

2650
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:52,319
blocks from my house

2651
01:37:49,439 --> 01:37:54,238
right so we always go over to DJ's house

2652
01:37:52,319 --> 01:37:56,099
he and his the lady who was with the

2653
01:37:54,238 --> 01:37:58,799
time Carla she was just a super lovely

2654
01:37:56,100 --> 01:38:01,679
lady as well and we'd have these epic

2655
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:04,980
parties there there they took over um

2656
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:06,719
an apartment in in that area of town

2657
01:38:04,979 --> 01:38:08,819
that another friend of ours used to have

2658
01:38:06,719 --> 01:38:11,279
and it was like the place must have been

2659
01:38:08,819 --> 01:38:13,920
like a 1970s cocaine Palace like it was

2660
01:38:11,279 --> 01:38:16,198
all I had this big big shag carpet and

2661
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:17,340
mirrors all over the place and they were

2662
01:38:16,198 --> 01:38:19,799
on the top floor and there was an

2663
01:38:17,340 --> 01:38:21,420
elevator that would you'd get in and it

2664
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:22,920
would go up to the top floor and nobody

2665
01:38:21,420 --> 01:38:25,139
else could get there they'd have to buzz

2666
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:26,880
you up the elevator would open and

2667
01:38:25,139 --> 01:38:29,100
there'd be this big mirror bar like

2668
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:30,840
right in front of you so it was kind of

2669
01:38:29,100 --> 01:38:33,659
like a great entrance place to have

2670
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:36,480
these parties a really nice like balcony

2671
01:38:33,658 --> 01:38:39,359
overlooking downtown Vancouver

2672
01:38:36,479 --> 01:38:41,579
um so during that process that was when

2673
01:38:39,359 --> 01:38:43,139
I really got to explore DJ's stuff

2674
01:38:41,579 --> 01:38:46,079
because like I said we were growing all

2675
01:38:43,139 --> 01:38:48,779
these seed lines for selection of what

2676
01:38:46,079 --> 01:38:51,359
became you know true blueberry f13 grape

2677
01:38:48,779 --> 01:38:52,079
crush and so on

2678
01:38:51,359 --> 01:38:55,139
um

2679
01:38:52,079 --> 01:38:56,760
and so I got to see the plants that he

2680
01:38:55,139 --> 01:38:58,440
was that he liked I got to see the

2681
01:38:56,760 --> 01:39:01,260
flowers that he liked

2682
01:38:58,439 --> 01:39:03,479
and I spent probably he was actually at

2683
01:39:01,260 --> 01:39:05,039
the time we were doing the grow he was

2684
01:39:03,479 --> 01:39:06,238
actually still down in the state so I

2685
01:39:05,039 --> 01:39:07,679
spent a fair amount of time in the

2686
01:39:06,238 --> 01:39:08,939
garden kind of just looking over it and

2687
01:39:07,679 --> 01:39:11,340
learning you know learning about his

2688
01:39:08,939 --> 01:39:12,899
lines and watering plants and stuff like

2689
01:39:11,340 --> 01:39:14,340
that

2690
01:39:12,899 --> 01:39:16,738
um and

2691
01:39:14,340 --> 01:39:18,360
that was really I really got to see a

2692
01:39:16,738 --> 01:39:20,519
large because I honestly have never

2693
01:39:18,359 --> 01:39:22,619
grown large populations of DJ stuff

2694
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:25,320
aside from that like I said we did some

2695
01:39:22,619 --> 01:39:27,779
smaller grows but nothing with on any

2696
01:39:25,319 --> 01:39:31,019
kind of scale deep delving into the

2697
01:39:27,779 --> 01:39:32,399
entire genetic diversity right

2698
01:39:31,020 --> 01:39:33,840
so

2699
01:39:32,399 --> 01:39:35,759
um

2700
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:37,440
the the things that I didn't like about

2701
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:39,719
those plants were again the curl I

2702
01:39:37,439 --> 01:39:43,079
thought that was a really trait that it

2703
01:39:39,719 --> 01:39:44,399
was not it was it wasn't a great like it

2704
01:39:43,079 --> 01:39:45,960
wasn't a great thing for Growers right

2705
01:39:44,399 --> 01:39:47,879
it was it was kind of a pain in the butt

2706
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:49,260
to deal with if you were a grower the

2707
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:51,960
plants with the curl they were very

2708
01:39:49,260 --> 01:39:53,699
sensitive to nutrients and you couldn't

2709
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:55,619
push them very much

2710
01:39:53,698 --> 01:39:57,419
they didn't yield a ton they kind of

2711
01:39:55,619 --> 01:40:01,019
grew a little bit slowly

2712
01:39:57,420 --> 01:40:03,119
and so I when we were doing the hybrids

2713
01:40:01,020 --> 01:40:06,900
I kind of shied away from those plants

2714
01:40:03,119 --> 01:40:08,939
and I really went War towards plants

2715
01:40:06,899 --> 01:40:10,799
that were

2716
01:40:08,939 --> 01:40:12,178
um that were better Growers so from that

2717
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:13,739
perspective from the better grower

2718
01:40:12,179 --> 01:40:17,158
plants my favorite plant from that whole

2719
01:40:13,738 --> 01:40:18,859
family was b133 which became the

2720
01:40:17,158 --> 01:40:22,619
old-time moonshine

2721
01:40:18,859 --> 01:40:24,899
an old-time moonshine is a great plant

2722
01:40:22,619 --> 01:40:26,939
it didn't have the curl it grew really

2723
01:40:24,899 --> 01:40:28,799
well it had all the rest of the stuff

2724
01:40:26,939 --> 01:40:30,599
that you'd expect from a DJ line like

2725
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:33,000
the purple underside of the leaves and

2726
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:35,159
the purple stems and it had a really

2727
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:38,100
nice flowers like a good commercial

2728
01:40:35,158 --> 01:40:40,319
dense flower structure and scent it had

2729
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:42,539
that blueberry kind of flavor scent

2730
01:40:40,319 --> 01:40:44,399
unfortunately we went to make the seeds

2731
01:40:42,539 --> 01:40:46,800
from those crosses they all shared the

2732
01:40:44,399 --> 01:40:48,960
same parental plant so really we we you

2733
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:51,179
know we selected the winners cloned them

2734
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:55,260
up and then they went in a room

2735
01:40:51,179 --> 01:40:58,100
kind of in a multi-grid section with you

2736
01:40:55,260 --> 01:41:01,440
know many copies of the same male plant

2737
01:40:58,100 --> 01:41:04,380
that that DJ had selected

2738
01:41:01,439 --> 01:41:06,178
and all the plants set an incredible

2739
01:41:04,380 --> 01:41:07,380
amount of seed except for the old time

2740
01:41:06,179 --> 01:41:09,779
moonshine

2741
01:41:07,380 --> 01:41:11,279
and the grower was really choked because

2742
01:41:09,779 --> 01:41:13,759
they thought they were you know they

2743
01:41:11,279 --> 01:41:15,500
were getting paid based on the seed

2744
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:18,119
and

2745
01:41:15,500 --> 01:41:20,100
this one you know section of the room

2746
01:41:18,119 --> 01:41:22,260
that was like you know 15 of the room or

2747
01:41:20,100 --> 01:41:23,699
whatever it barely set seed like the one

2748
01:41:22,260 --> 01:41:26,280
plant

2749
01:41:23,698 --> 01:41:28,198
it it may you know one plant would make

2750
01:41:26,279 --> 01:41:30,439
Maybe

2751
01:41:28,198 --> 01:41:32,638
I don't know 50 seeds at the most

2752
01:41:30,439 --> 01:41:34,799
whereas a plant that size would normally

2753
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:36,719
produce well over a thousand seeds right

2754
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:38,520
so it was almost Cincinnati there was

2755
01:41:36,719 --> 01:41:39,380
something about

2756
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:41,280
um there's something called

2757
01:41:39,380 --> 01:41:43,079
self-incompatibility in plant breeding

2758
01:41:41,279 --> 01:41:44,819
and that just means when you you know

2759
01:41:43,079 --> 01:41:47,399
when you when you breed plants that are

2760
01:41:44,819 --> 01:41:49,139
out crossers too closely together they

2761
01:41:47,399 --> 01:41:51,000
don't make seeds and for whatever reason

2762
01:41:49,139 --> 01:41:52,560
it whether it was self-incomepatibility

2763
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:55,738
or it was just something to do with this

2764
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:58,560
plant this plant was almost sterile not

2765
01:41:55,738 --> 01:42:02,579
quite but almost right and so in a Bud

2766
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:05,460
you might have one seed rather than

2767
01:42:02,579 --> 01:42:06,539
you know 30.

2768
01:42:05,460 --> 01:42:09,300
um

2769
01:42:06,539 --> 01:42:11,760
and a lot of buds that had no seeds and

2770
01:42:09,300 --> 01:42:13,800
so from a seed making point of view it

2771
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:15,900
kind of sucked because you had this

2772
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:16,860
great plant that it wanted to make seeds

2773
01:42:15,899 --> 01:42:18,899
from

2774
01:42:16,859 --> 01:42:21,359
but for whatever reason genetically it

2775
01:42:18,899 --> 01:42:23,279
just it didn't make seeds

2776
01:42:21,359 --> 01:42:24,719
so those things became really rare on

2777
01:42:23,279 --> 01:42:26,460
the market and that was why the old-time

2778
01:42:24,719 --> 01:42:28,260
moonshine kind of disappeared more

2779
01:42:26,460 --> 01:42:31,319
quickly than any of the other ones

2780
01:42:28,260 --> 01:42:32,280
they just didn't make enough seed

2781
01:42:31,319 --> 01:42:33,840
um

2782
01:42:32,279 --> 01:42:35,819
so I've got a bunch of those in the

2783
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:38,400
library I also took that plant and I

2784
01:42:35,819 --> 01:42:40,559
reversed it and had it produced male

2785
01:42:38,399 --> 01:42:42,839
pollen and It produced copious

2786
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:45,179
quantities of pollen and so that was one

2787
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:47,039
of the ones that I used when I did my

2788
01:42:45,179 --> 01:42:49,319
work with DJI we used the same males

2789
01:42:47,039 --> 01:42:50,939
that he was using and I took a few of my

2790
01:42:49,319 --> 01:42:53,639
favorite of his female plants and I

2791
01:42:50,939 --> 01:42:56,279
reversed those as well and threw them in

2792
01:42:53,639 --> 01:42:58,020
the pollen mix probably I don't know I

2793
01:42:56,279 --> 01:42:59,698
want to say up to 30 but that's probably

2794
01:42:58,020 --> 01:43:01,320
being generous it was probably closer to

2795
01:42:59,698 --> 01:43:03,419
like 10 to 15 percent of the plants came

2796
01:43:01,319 --> 01:43:04,979
from the female pollen and the rest of

2797
01:43:03,420 --> 01:43:08,279
it came from the males

2798
01:43:04,979 --> 01:43:10,198
and that's borne out if you look at the

2799
01:43:08,279 --> 01:43:12,599
you know the sex ratios and The

2800
01:43:10,198 --> 01:43:14,759
Offspring that they are pretty close to

2801
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:17,400
regular seeds you grow 100 you're going

2802
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:19,820
to have only slightly more females than

2803
01:43:17,399 --> 01:43:19,819
males

2804
01:43:20,279 --> 01:43:23,939
um so I really like that one I like the

2805
01:43:21,658 --> 01:43:27,719
f13 for the the nose she's a bit of a

2806
01:43:23,939 --> 01:43:28,439
quirky grower again she's got that curl

2807
01:43:27,719 --> 01:43:30,300
um

2808
01:43:28,439 --> 01:43:32,279
the grape Crush was really interesting

2809
01:43:30,300 --> 01:43:35,219
plant it had this kind of neat trait

2810
01:43:32,279 --> 01:43:37,618
where it had kind of a rounded top Cola

2811
01:43:35,219 --> 01:43:39,539
and all the leaf the sub-tending

2812
01:43:37,618 --> 01:43:41,579
leaflets the little leaves that stick

2813
01:43:39,539 --> 01:43:43,979
out of the bud rather than being

2814
01:43:41,579 --> 01:43:45,539
triangle triangles they were rounded at

2815
01:43:43,979 --> 01:43:47,759
the tips

2816
01:43:45,539 --> 01:43:49,198
and they had a nice little purple stripe

2817
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:50,940
that kind of ripped that kind of went

2818
01:43:49,198 --> 01:43:52,379
around the edge of that subtending

2819
01:43:50,939 --> 01:43:54,719
leaflet as well

2820
01:43:52,380 --> 01:43:55,859
so you know they were pretty plants like

2821
01:43:54,719 --> 01:43:58,139
they were pretty they were pretty nice

2822
01:43:55,859 --> 01:43:59,880
looking plants

2823
01:43:58,139 --> 01:44:03,000
um some of my favorites were the cross

2824
01:43:59,880 --> 01:44:05,159
the Mental Floss cross with that that b

2825
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:06,899
uh 133 plant

2826
01:44:05,158 --> 01:44:08,819
they just they really came out quite

2827
01:44:06,899 --> 01:44:10,259
well

2828
01:44:08,819 --> 01:44:12,059
um and that's yeah those are those are

2829
01:44:10,260 --> 01:44:13,800
my favorites I didn't love the bee the

2830
01:44:12,060 --> 01:44:16,980
true blue the true blueberry I mean it

2831
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:18,659
was neat enough for the most part

2832
01:44:16,979 --> 01:44:20,399
um it was a little bit too leaning

2833
01:44:18,658 --> 01:44:21,719
towards the chocolatey side for me not

2834
01:44:20,399 --> 01:44:24,539
the blueberry

2835
01:44:21,719 --> 01:44:27,179
you know and and having said that I've

2836
01:44:24,539 --> 01:44:30,359
met a grower in the last year and a half

2837
01:44:27,179 --> 01:44:32,579
here in Canada and he bought those seeds

2838
01:44:30,359 --> 01:44:33,859
from you know the group that made them

2839
01:44:32,579 --> 01:44:36,479
back in

2840
01:44:33,859 --> 01:44:39,179
2005 I guess it was

2841
01:44:36,479 --> 01:44:41,579
and I met him a year and a half ago

2842
01:44:39,179 --> 01:44:43,139
maybe two years ago and he showed me his

2843
01:44:41,579 --> 01:44:46,439
blueberry

2844
01:44:43,139 --> 01:44:47,639
and it's everything that you'd want in a

2845
01:44:46,439 --> 01:44:49,919
blueberry plant I mean it's it's

2846
01:44:47,639 --> 01:44:53,279
completely blueberry muffin smelling

2847
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:55,020
it it grows really well

2848
01:44:53,279 --> 01:44:58,139
um and it came from that kind of inbred

2849
01:44:55,020 --> 01:45:00,540
mom so you know it it might just be that

2850
01:44:58,139 --> 01:45:02,639
those blueberry muffin phenotypes that

2851
01:45:00,539 --> 01:45:05,219
you're talking about are still in the

2852
01:45:02,639 --> 01:45:07,440
line it's just they're a little more

2853
01:45:05,219 --> 01:45:09,420
rare right you have you'll have to grow

2854
01:45:07,439 --> 01:45:11,099
a bunch of limited a bunch to find it

2855
01:45:09,420 --> 01:45:12,960
this guy actually only grew a 10 pack

2856
01:45:11,100 --> 01:45:15,239
and he found this really nice plant so

2857
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:18,000
you know

2858
01:45:15,238 --> 01:45:19,678
you can hit it it's just but again like

2859
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,939
with any plant breeding thing it's it's

2860
01:45:19,679 --> 01:45:23,039
numbers

2861
01:45:20,939 --> 01:45:24,238
so if you're growing three seeds you're

2862
01:45:23,039 --> 01:45:25,618
gonna have a hard time finding it if

2863
01:45:24,238 --> 01:45:26,879
you're growing 10 20 you'll probably

2864
01:45:25,618 --> 01:45:29,339
have a better shot

2865
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:32,219
yeah sure so you got that one in a

2866
01:45:29,340 --> 01:45:35,460
million that's that's awesome to hear I

2867
01:45:32,219 --> 01:45:38,039
wanted to ask you about how you had done

2868
01:45:35,460 --> 01:45:40,020
a grapefruit cross to blueberry and this

2869
01:45:38,039 --> 01:45:42,658
is a cross which has been done in many

2870
01:45:40,020 --> 01:45:45,540
forms it's almost a bit of a Redux of

2871
01:45:42,658 --> 01:45:47,939
Sweet Tooth but also you know bcga did

2872
01:45:45,539 --> 01:45:50,819
their own version of it I guess my

2873
01:45:47,939 --> 01:45:52,919
question is do you feel like there were

2874
01:45:50,819 --> 01:45:55,198
components of maybe Sweet Tooth or the

2875
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:57,060
bcga cross that you thought could be

2876
01:45:55,198 --> 01:45:59,039
improved and the reason why I ask is

2877
01:45:57,060 --> 01:46:01,139
because in a lot of your work there's

2878
01:45:59,039 --> 01:46:02,579
like progeny of Sweet Tooth being like

2879
01:46:01,139 --> 01:46:04,618
sweet skunk and other things so

2880
01:46:02,579 --> 01:46:06,539
obviously you like the line I guess but

2881
01:46:04,618 --> 01:46:07,859
did you feel like there were parts of it

2882
01:46:06,539 --> 01:46:10,439
that could be improved or did you do

2883
01:46:07,859 --> 01:46:12,299
that cross for other reasons no I did

2884
01:46:10,439 --> 01:46:15,178
the cross for other reasons and to be

2885
01:46:12,300 --> 01:46:17,760
perfectly Frank those were done really

2886
01:46:15,179 --> 01:46:19,560
out of a Goodwill gesture to Steve and

2887
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:21,060
spice life when he left Switzerland he

2888
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:23,699
was in a pretty rough shape he had been

2889
01:46:21,060 --> 01:46:25,500
busted by the cops and things weren't

2890
01:46:23,698 --> 01:46:27,599
really going his way he had moved back

2891
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:30,060
to Canada and was is trying to get into

2892
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:32,219
the weed or the wine business

2893
01:46:30,060 --> 01:46:33,840
and we had contracted this room to be

2894
01:46:32,219 --> 01:46:36,300
produced for those crosses and I said

2895
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:38,699
you know what they they had made a very

2896
01:46:36,300 --> 01:46:40,199
small batch of the Sweet Tooth 1.1 which

2897
01:46:38,698 --> 01:46:42,719
is the same cross

2898
01:46:40,198 --> 01:46:45,178
it's I label it great for blueberry

2899
01:46:42,719 --> 01:46:46,560
because I don't want the drama

2900
01:46:45,179 --> 01:46:48,960
um but it's

2901
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:50,940
you know they were produced for Steve

2902
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:54,600
right they were supposed to be sold on

2903
01:46:50,939 --> 01:46:58,259
the spices live Seed Catalog and uh

2904
01:46:54,600 --> 01:46:59,579
through life circumstances

2905
01:46:58,260 --> 01:47:01,800
that

2906
01:46:59,579 --> 01:47:05,880
they they stopped being sold deceived he

2907
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:07,500
he kind of just I don't know whatever he

2908
01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:11,520
stopped selling seeds for a while let's

2909
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:13,198
just put it that way and um and so

2910
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:14,940
I put them under my catalog and just

2911
01:47:13,198 --> 01:47:16,138
called them what they were so that's the

2912
01:47:14,939 --> 01:47:18,419
deal behind the grapefruit blueberry

2913
01:47:16,139 --> 01:47:20,699
they were never intended for my catalog

2914
01:47:18,420 --> 01:47:23,639
yeah okay and did you ever get a chance

2915
01:47:20,698 --> 01:47:25,738
to try the bcga version and if so did

2916
01:47:23,639 --> 01:47:27,779
you have any thoughts on that one

2917
01:47:25,738 --> 01:47:29,879
but it's more or less the same right I

2918
01:47:27,779 --> 01:47:32,219
mean the Vic High gave me the grapefruit

2919
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:35,880
clone right the the guy from the bcga

2920
01:47:32,219 --> 01:47:37,618
you know rest his soul gave me the the

2921
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:39,960
parent he brought it to me one day I met

2922
01:47:37,618 --> 01:47:41,579
him in Montreal for a meeting he had he

2923
01:47:39,960 --> 01:47:43,739
had gone down to meet his seed supplier

2924
01:47:41,579 --> 01:47:45,300
down there and I was not far down the

2925
01:47:43,738 --> 01:47:46,379
road a couple hour drive so I wanted to

2926
01:47:45,300 --> 01:47:49,500
go meet him because he was a pretty

2927
01:47:46,380 --> 01:47:52,260
smart guy and you know he was a he you

2928
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:54,600
know he was cantankerous like like we

2929
01:47:52,260 --> 01:47:55,500
all can be at times

2930
01:47:54,600 --> 01:47:57,239
um

2931
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:58,800
but yeah when I showed up he was like I

2932
01:47:57,238 --> 01:48:01,439
brought you a gift and he tossed me a

2933
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:03,300
tupperware container and it had that

2934
01:48:01,439 --> 01:48:07,019
clone and it had

2935
01:48:03,300 --> 01:48:08,579
the AE 77 California Orange clone which

2936
01:48:07,020 --> 01:48:10,980
I don't know if you know that one but

2937
01:48:08,579 --> 01:48:13,319
that was a big thing back on those old

2938
01:48:10,979 --> 01:48:15,539
boards everybody wanted it the funny

2939
01:48:13,319 --> 01:48:17,759
thing that nobody realized about it was

2940
01:48:15,539 --> 01:48:19,618
when Vic gave it to me he said okay

2941
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:22,440
here's here's the grapefruit you know

2942
01:48:19,618 --> 01:48:26,279
because you want that for flavor and

2943
01:48:22,439 --> 01:48:30,000
this is the California Orange this plant

2944
01:48:26,279 --> 01:48:32,460
is a five on ten on every trade right so

2945
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:34,618
it's like it's a five on potent potency

2946
01:48:32,460 --> 01:48:36,118
it's a five on Flavor it had a unique

2947
01:48:34,618 --> 01:48:37,979
flavor right it had that orangey

2948
01:48:36,118 --> 01:48:39,539
terpiness and that's where really a lot

2949
01:48:37,979 --> 01:48:42,238
of the orange stuff came from were

2950
01:48:39,539 --> 01:48:44,579
descendants from that one but

2951
01:48:42,238 --> 01:48:46,618
you know sub cool used it I used it a

2952
01:48:44,579 --> 01:48:48,359
whole bunch of people used it

2953
01:48:46,618 --> 01:48:50,039
um for different things Vic used it for

2954
01:48:48,359 --> 01:48:51,719
the Orange Crush

2955
01:48:50,039 --> 01:48:54,179
um

2956
01:48:51,719 --> 01:48:55,618
and but the re the real reason that he

2957
01:48:54,179 --> 01:48:58,440
gave it to me is that this one's a five

2958
01:48:55,618 --> 01:49:00,479
on ten on everything and now we have a

2959
01:48:58,439 --> 01:49:02,399
scale that we can use to compare things

2960
01:49:00,479 --> 01:49:03,779
we can compare notes from across the

2961
01:49:02,399 --> 01:49:06,719
country because I was living on the East

2962
01:49:03,779 --> 01:49:09,359
the the more Eastern end of Canada and

2963
01:49:06,719 --> 01:49:11,520
he was on the West Coast

2964
01:49:09,359 --> 01:49:13,380
um but it was his way of kind of

2965
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:15,119
calibrating the scale you know what I

2966
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:17,039
mean like it was he was he was saying

2967
01:49:15,118 --> 01:49:18,479
this five on ten so now you got

2968
01:49:17,039 --> 01:49:19,618
something that's a five on Town and

2969
01:49:18,479 --> 01:49:20,879
everything and so when we talk about

2970
01:49:19,618 --> 01:49:22,920
stuff

2971
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:24,840
you know if this is a five then you can

2972
01:49:22,920 --> 01:49:26,819
now assign whatever values to any other

2973
01:49:24,840 --> 01:49:28,500
plant right and that was kind of a nice

2974
01:49:26,819 --> 01:49:32,219
thing I had to do because it was it was

2975
01:49:28,500 --> 01:49:33,779
just a very genuine gift

2976
01:49:32,219 --> 01:49:35,880
um you know at that point in this time

2977
01:49:33,779 --> 01:49:37,500
Steve was over in Switzerland and when

2978
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:39,600
he came back

2979
01:49:37,500 --> 01:49:42,479
I returned the great fruit to him right

2980
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:43,260
along with the sweet skunk as well

2981
01:49:42,479 --> 01:49:44,579
um

2982
01:49:43,260 --> 01:49:46,920
so

2983
01:49:44,579 --> 01:49:49,319
yeah okay that's that's actually quite

2984
01:49:46,920 --> 01:49:50,880
full circle there isn't it what goes

2985
01:49:49,319 --> 01:49:52,259
around what goes around comes around

2986
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:54,960
right it's kind of one of those things

2987
01:49:52,260 --> 01:49:57,420
with plants and I think it's really poor

2988
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:59,399
form if if you find a plant or select a

2989
01:49:57,420 --> 01:50:00,779
plant or a plant comes to you and then

2990
01:49:59,399 --> 01:50:02,339
you lose it but you've given it to

2991
01:50:00,779 --> 01:50:03,719
somebody else it's kind of lame if they

2992
01:50:02,340 --> 01:50:06,000
won't give it back to you in fact it's

2993
01:50:03,719 --> 01:50:07,500
completely lame I mean but people do

2994
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:09,539
that kind of stuff with cannabis because

2995
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:11,579
they think that they have something

2996
01:50:09,539 --> 01:50:14,399
that's unique and it gives them

2997
01:50:11,579 --> 01:50:17,158
a commercial Advantage but the truth is

2998
01:50:14,399 --> 01:50:19,859
when it comes to plants especially in a

2999
01:50:17,158 --> 01:50:21,539
Prohibition Market the only way to keep

3000
01:50:19,859 --> 01:50:24,779
it is to give it away

3001
01:50:21,539 --> 01:50:27,859
right because if you get a bad bug or

3002
01:50:24,779 --> 01:50:30,960
you know a bad police visitor or someone

3003
01:50:27,859 --> 01:50:32,759
you know you can lose things right and

3004
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:36,179
stuff happens plants just die in the

3005
01:50:32,760 --> 01:50:38,460
grow room like things go wrong right

3006
01:50:36,179 --> 01:50:40,199
um the watering systems fail or your

3007
01:50:38,460 --> 01:50:42,179
backup plan or your plant gets like

3008
01:50:40,198 --> 01:50:45,059
pythium or something like stuff dies

3009
01:50:42,179 --> 01:50:49,139
right and really the only way for it to

3010
01:50:45,060 --> 01:50:50,820
really survive is if you pass it around

3011
01:50:49,139 --> 01:50:52,859
um and if you pass it around and it

3012
01:50:50,819 --> 01:50:54,299
survives in everybody's Garden it's

3013
01:50:52,859 --> 01:50:55,920
probably a good plant

3014
01:50:54,300 --> 01:50:58,400
right if you pass it around and nobody

3015
01:50:55,920 --> 01:51:01,139
keeps it that's probably not a good plan

3016
01:50:58,399 --> 01:51:03,719
yeah right it's kind of a good way to

3017
01:51:01,139 --> 01:51:06,118
get like external validation on plants

3018
01:51:03,719 --> 01:51:07,980
definitely definitely and look this is a

3019
01:51:06,118 --> 01:51:09,599
perfect segue because I had a question I

3020
01:51:07,979 --> 01:51:12,299
wanted to ask and I was wondering how I

3021
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:15,239
was going to slot it in but in relation

3022
01:51:12,300 --> 01:51:18,300
to you mentioned the uh the Cali orange

3023
01:51:15,238 --> 01:51:20,399
the AE 77 that's an interesting one

3024
01:51:18,300 --> 01:51:23,039
because I remember one time I was at

3025
01:51:20,399 --> 01:51:25,439
Bodie's house and he was telling me you

3026
01:51:23,039 --> 01:51:27,060
know it's such an old cut it was dotted

3027
01:51:25,439 --> 01:51:29,460
and it was the first time I heard that

3028
01:51:27,060 --> 01:51:31,920
term dudded and then more recently we've

3029
01:51:29,460 --> 01:51:33,539
had the the news come out that like the

3030
01:51:31,920 --> 01:51:35,760
virus responsible for that has been

3031
01:51:33,539 --> 01:51:37,800
categorized it's the Hop late and hemp

3032
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:41,100
virus I'm sure you've probably heard

3033
01:51:37,800 --> 01:51:43,560
about this my question is a what are

3034
01:51:41,100 --> 01:51:46,560
your thoughts on that virus and B do you

3035
01:51:43,560 --> 01:51:48,539
think we might ever see a virus emerge

3036
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:51,900
which actually has a beneficial effect

3037
01:51:48,539 --> 01:51:54,420
kind of in the way that Pinot Noir came

3038
01:51:51,899 --> 01:51:56,039
out of pin or Gris sort of thing or do

3039
01:51:54,420 --> 01:51:57,600
you think that that's too hard to

3040
01:51:56,039 --> 01:52:00,779
predict

3041
01:51:57,600 --> 01:52:02,100
so Pinot Gris and Blanc came from Pinot

3042
01:52:00,779 --> 01:52:04,198
Noir Pinot Noir was the original

3043
01:52:02,100 --> 01:52:06,060
archetype yes and the other ones were

3044
01:52:04,198 --> 01:52:07,618
the other ones were somatic mutations of

3045
01:52:06,060 --> 01:52:09,840
those I don't know that that was a

3046
01:52:07,618 --> 01:52:12,000
virus-induced thing

3047
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:14,520
um you know plants when when cells

3048
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:17,158
divide you can remember it's like it's

3049
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:19,020
like you're you're the the terrible

3050
01:52:17,158 --> 01:52:21,719
analogy is like if you're photocopying

3051
01:52:19,020 --> 01:52:23,760
DNA right so the DNA copies itself and

3052
01:52:21,719 --> 01:52:24,539
it's got a whole

3053
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:27,119
um

3054
01:52:24,539 --> 01:52:28,500
set of genes that are simply required

3055
01:52:27,118 --> 01:52:30,960
that are simply their their whole

3056
01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:33,420
purpose is to to make sure that

3057
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:36,779
when the DNA is copied it's copied

3058
01:52:33,420 --> 01:52:38,940
robustly and reliably and accurately but

3059
01:52:36,779 --> 01:52:40,738
the truth is is that like every set of

3060
01:52:38,939 --> 01:52:44,460
biological machines they make mistakes

3061
01:52:40,738 --> 01:52:46,319
and mutations do happen over time so

3062
01:52:44,460 --> 01:52:49,439
there's something called a sport and a

3063
01:52:46,319 --> 01:52:51,899
sport is a excuse me it's a shoot on a

3064
01:52:49,439 --> 01:52:54,118
plant like a new branch that comes out

3065
01:52:51,899 --> 01:52:57,299
but it's different like you might have

3066
01:52:54,118 --> 01:53:00,420
we can use the the Pinot gris or Pinot

3067
01:52:57,300 --> 01:53:03,060
blonde allergy the original grape was

3068
01:53:00,420 --> 01:53:05,100
purple or Pinot Noir it's a dark-skinned

3069
01:53:03,060 --> 01:53:07,800
grape and and the farther south you grow

3070
01:53:05,100 --> 01:53:10,079
it really produces a lot of

3071
01:53:07,800 --> 01:53:12,480
um a lot of pigments right especially

3072
01:53:10,079 --> 01:53:13,800
like down in California they call Pinot

3073
01:53:12,479 --> 01:53:16,859
noirs from down there they call them

3074
01:53:13,800 --> 01:53:18,480
fruit bombs because they're they're so

3075
01:53:16,859 --> 01:53:20,158
dark and intense if you hold them up to

3076
01:53:18,479 --> 01:53:23,279
the light you can barely see through the

3077
01:53:20,158 --> 01:53:24,960
the wine glass whereas if you take that

3078
01:53:23,279 --> 01:53:28,259
same clone Pinot Noir and you grow up

3079
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:30,300
say in Canada or in France which is at a

3080
01:53:28,260 --> 01:53:33,360
higher latitude

3081
01:53:30,300 --> 01:53:35,520
that they're they're what we call clarat

3082
01:53:33,359 --> 01:53:37,799
or you can actually see through the the

3083
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:40,699
it's not as opaque put it that way it's

3084
01:53:37,800 --> 01:53:40,699
more translucent

3085
01:53:41,039 --> 01:53:46,139
um and so Pinot one somebody noticed hey

3086
01:53:44,279 --> 01:53:49,500
there's a branch on this Pinot Noir

3087
01:53:46,139 --> 01:53:51,118
plant but the grapes are more Gray

3088
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:52,380
colored and someone else in another part

3089
01:53:51,118 --> 01:53:54,779
of the world found one that they were

3090
01:53:52,380 --> 01:53:56,579
white colored and what happened was the

3091
01:53:54,779 --> 01:53:59,658
gene that was responsible for the

3092
01:53:56,579 --> 01:54:02,579
pigment color accumulated the mutation

3093
01:53:59,658 --> 01:54:05,039
and that mutation so what they did is

3094
01:54:02,579 --> 01:54:06,600
they cut off the branch

3095
01:54:05,039 --> 01:54:08,279
um and they rooted it and they created

3096
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:09,420
it into a whole plant and then they took

3097
01:54:08,279 --> 01:54:11,118
a whole bunch of cuttings as a mother

3098
01:54:09,420 --> 01:54:13,859
plant and they started planting out

3099
01:54:11,118 --> 01:54:15,059
sections of this new grape and you can

3100
01:54:13,859 --> 01:54:16,618
actually get

3101
01:54:15,060 --> 01:54:18,719
um so that Branch would have been called

3102
01:54:16,618 --> 01:54:20,099
it was a sport it was a sport of the

3103
01:54:18,719 --> 01:54:23,340
Pinot

3104
01:54:20,100 --> 01:54:25,639
um Noir plant but you can take a cutting

3105
01:54:23,340 --> 01:54:27,779
of a sport and if it's different

3106
01:54:25,639 --> 01:54:29,100
phenotypically from the plant that it

3107
01:54:27,779 --> 01:54:31,859
came from as you can tell in this case

3108
01:54:29,100 --> 01:54:33,600
we're talking about the skin pigment you

3109
01:54:31,859 --> 01:54:35,279
can actually take that plant and go to

3110
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:38,820
the plant breeders rights people and say

3111
01:54:35,279 --> 01:54:42,658
hey I found a new variation of Pinot

3112
01:54:38,819 --> 01:54:44,698
uh Pinot Noir and I want to get you know

3113
01:54:42,658 --> 01:54:46,379
this arose under cultivation in my

3114
01:54:44,698 --> 01:54:48,178
Vineyard I want to claim intellectual

3115
01:54:46,380 --> 01:54:50,819
property rights for this

3116
01:54:48,179 --> 01:54:53,039
and you can actually get

3117
01:54:50,819 --> 01:54:55,679
the commercial rights for a new variety

3118
01:54:53,039 --> 01:54:57,840
by cloning a sport from an old plant

3119
01:54:55,679 --> 01:55:00,420
right because because it's changed it's

3120
01:54:57,840 --> 01:55:03,060
not the same plant anymore right when we

3121
01:55:00,420 --> 01:55:04,440
describe Pinot Noir part of the thing of

3122
01:55:03,060 --> 01:55:05,940
having a cultivar or a variety

3123
01:55:04,439 --> 01:55:08,219
registered is you have to do a full

3124
01:55:05,939 --> 01:55:09,618
description of the plant

3125
01:55:08,219 --> 01:55:12,359
and

3126
01:55:09,618 --> 01:55:13,738
when you get protection on that plant it

3127
01:55:12,359 --> 01:55:15,539
means that you get the protection on

3128
01:55:13,738 --> 01:55:16,919
that whole set of characteristics taken

3129
01:55:15,539 --> 01:55:18,600
together well one of the major

3130
01:55:16,920 --> 01:55:21,000
characteristics like the fruit color

3131
01:55:18,600 --> 01:55:23,039
changes it's a different plant

3132
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,880
so you can actually register it as a new

3133
01:55:23,039 --> 01:55:25,979
plant

3134
01:55:23,880 --> 01:55:29,039
right and so Pinot Gris and Pinot Noir

3135
01:55:25,979 --> 01:55:30,779
sorry Pinot Gris and Pinot Blanc are

3136
01:55:29,039 --> 01:55:33,060
both

3137
01:55:30,779 --> 01:55:35,880
versions of

3138
01:55:33,060 --> 01:55:40,080
um you know their their mutant versions

3139
01:55:35,880 --> 01:55:40,079
of the Pinot variety

3140
01:55:40,198 --> 01:55:44,638
yeah do you have any thoughts on the Hop

3141
01:55:42,600 --> 01:55:47,539
latent virus

3142
01:55:44,639 --> 01:55:47,539
yeah it sucks

3143
01:55:48,300 --> 01:55:53,159
to the Plant World right it's decimating

3144
01:55:50,939 --> 01:55:55,079
whole Greenhouse Productions in in

3145
01:55:53,158 --> 01:55:57,059
California is getting passed around in

3146
01:55:55,079 --> 01:55:58,920
cuttings you know I know people down

3147
01:55:57,060 --> 01:56:01,320
there that are good friends of mine that

3148
01:55:58,920 --> 01:56:03,118
have totally changed their their

3149
01:56:01,319 --> 01:56:05,158
production systems people are getting

3150
01:56:03,118 --> 01:56:06,779
way into tissue culture now again for

3151
01:56:05,158 --> 01:56:08,339
growing that stuff again you got to

3152
01:56:06,779 --> 01:56:10,139
remember like

3153
01:56:08,340 --> 01:56:11,699
let's think let's think of it again the

3154
01:56:10,139 --> 01:56:14,400
terms of the wine grapes I mean Pinot

3155
01:56:11,698 --> 01:56:16,079
Gris is like or Pinot Noir I'm sorry is

3156
01:56:14,399 --> 01:56:18,179
hundreds of years old that clone is

3157
01:56:16,079 --> 01:56:20,279
hundreds of years old right well

3158
01:56:18,179 --> 01:56:22,079
cannabis is an annual right it's

3159
01:56:20,279 --> 01:56:24,420
supposed to it grows and makes seed

3160
01:56:22,079 --> 01:56:25,800
every year it you can't leave it in the

3161
01:56:24,420 --> 01:56:27,539
ground and it'll grow back in the spring

3162
01:56:25,800 --> 01:56:29,520
like you got to get new plants and plug

3163
01:56:27,539 --> 01:56:30,420
them into the ground

3164
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:33,420
um

3165
01:56:30,420 --> 01:56:35,699
so the natural life cycle of that plant

3166
01:56:33,420 --> 01:56:37,199
is a year right so when we start having

3167
01:56:35,698 --> 01:56:39,839
plants that have been around for many

3168
01:56:37,198 --> 01:56:41,519
many more years the longer a plant is

3169
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:44,159
alive in a production system the more

3170
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:45,300
likely it is to be to interact with

3171
01:56:44,158 --> 01:56:47,759
other

3172
01:56:45,300 --> 01:56:52,020
forms of biata like you know like for

3173
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:54,960
example aphids for example or or thrips

3174
01:56:52,020 --> 01:56:56,400
right and um a lot of these bugs I don't

3175
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:59,100
know if you know about Lyme disease but

3176
01:56:56,399 --> 01:57:00,960
Lyme disease essentially is a bacteria

3177
01:56:59,100 --> 01:57:04,139
that's carried in the mouth of a tick

3178
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:06,420
and if you get bitten by The Tick

3179
01:57:04,139 --> 01:57:08,219
the slot the bacteria lives in the

3180
01:57:06,420 --> 01:57:09,779
saliva of that plant and so the bacteria

3181
01:57:08,219 --> 01:57:12,480
can actually infect you and that's what

3182
01:57:09,779 --> 01:57:15,300
causes the disease right so the virus is

3183
01:57:12,479 --> 01:57:17,819
much like that with cannabis it's it

3184
01:57:15,300 --> 01:57:20,820
might be you know transmitted in the

3185
01:57:17,819 --> 01:57:22,859
mouths of uh thrips or or aphids that

3186
01:57:20,819 --> 01:57:26,158
are biting the plant and when they bite

3187
01:57:22,859 --> 01:57:28,019
the plant they they that virus transfers

3188
01:57:26,158 --> 01:57:29,658
over

3189
01:57:28,020 --> 01:57:32,880
um

3190
01:57:29,658 --> 01:57:35,158
so you know these crops that are

3191
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:37,500
typically grown by clone

3192
01:57:35,158 --> 01:57:39,719
a lot of the times the propagation ends

3193
01:57:37,500 --> 01:57:41,460
up making it into tissue culture or or

3194
01:57:39,719 --> 01:57:43,380
propagation in vitro where they grow

3195
01:57:41,460 --> 01:57:46,380
little plants on Petri dishes rather

3196
01:57:43,380 --> 01:57:47,940
than on mother plants and there's

3197
01:57:46,380 --> 01:57:49,199
challenges to that whole technique

3198
01:57:47,939 --> 01:57:51,899
that's a whole show that we could deal

3199
01:57:49,198 --> 01:57:53,960
on its own but

3200
01:57:51,899 --> 01:57:53,960
um

3201
01:57:54,300 --> 01:58:00,060
you know maybe for the people that want

3202
01:57:56,579 --> 01:58:03,059
to grow these these plants from clone

3203
01:58:00,060 --> 01:58:05,219
um that that may become the standard in

3204
01:58:03,060 --> 01:58:07,380
in production systems where you know

3205
01:58:05,219 --> 01:58:09,000
you're not mothering plants

3206
01:58:07,380 --> 01:58:11,279
you're not taking cuttings from other

3207
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:13,260
plants right because again it's like

3208
01:58:11,279 --> 01:58:14,819
when you when you cut a branch off a

3209
01:58:13,260 --> 01:58:18,300
plant you're wounding the plant like

3210
01:58:14,819 --> 01:58:20,279
that's a it's an open spot where it can

3211
01:58:18,300 --> 01:58:22,260
get infected by bacteria and viruses

3212
01:58:20,279 --> 01:58:25,079
right and so when you're you're taking

3213
01:58:22,260 --> 01:58:26,820
and then you take that same razor blade

3214
01:58:25,079 --> 01:58:28,920
and you run around your entire

3215
01:58:26,819 --> 01:58:31,019
Greenhouse cutting shoot after shoot

3216
01:58:28,920 --> 01:58:32,940
after shoot after shoot

3217
01:58:31,020 --> 01:58:34,920
you're spreading the virus right

3218
01:58:32,939 --> 01:58:38,339
everybody understands this in a coveted

3219
01:58:34,920 --> 01:58:40,440
world right viruses spread that's what

3220
01:58:38,340 --> 01:58:43,279
they do right they need to live in

3221
01:58:40,439 --> 01:58:45,178
another organism to to be able to to to

3222
01:58:43,279 --> 01:58:46,859
replicate themselves and that's all that

3223
01:58:45,179 --> 01:58:49,020
they want to do

3224
01:58:46,859 --> 01:58:51,719
right is replica cells and that's how

3225
01:58:49,020 --> 01:58:54,179
they that's how they they you know

3226
01:58:51,719 --> 01:58:57,118
that's how they they live right how the

3227
01:58:54,179 --> 01:59:00,658
species lives

3228
01:58:57,118 --> 01:59:03,000
um so yeah like Horticultural practices

3229
01:59:00,658 --> 01:59:04,979
man are super important keeping bugs

3230
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:06,899
away super important you don't want to

3231
01:59:04,979 --> 01:59:08,399
be having bugs you get bugs and they're

3232
01:59:06,899 --> 01:59:10,738
potentially bringing in viruses on there

3233
01:59:08,399 --> 01:59:12,420
you know in their saliva or on their

3234
01:59:10,738 --> 01:59:15,059
feet or whatever however they how are

3235
01:59:12,420 --> 01:59:17,699
they they transport it

3236
01:59:15,060 --> 01:59:19,920
um so yeah hot virus man terrible stuff

3237
01:59:17,698 --> 01:59:22,259
there they found some tissue culture

3238
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:24,179
ways to uh to remove it through tissue

3239
01:59:22,260 --> 01:59:25,920
culture processes like I think they're

3240
01:59:24,179 --> 01:59:29,279
probably using like a heat treatment and

3241
01:59:25,920 --> 01:59:31,079
meristem culture but that takes time and

3242
01:59:29,279 --> 01:59:34,559
they charge a big bucks you know they're

3243
01:59:31,079 --> 01:59:36,599
asking like 20 to 50 000 a plant to if

3244
01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:38,460
you want to give them your own cutting

3245
01:59:36,599 --> 01:59:39,840
they'll clean it up for you and return

3246
01:59:38,460 --> 01:59:41,460
it to you clean

3247
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:44,400
but you know then there's the

3248
01:59:41,460 --> 01:59:45,960
possibility that they keep your cutting

3249
01:59:44,399 --> 01:59:47,399
um so you might you know you might not

3250
01:59:45,960 --> 01:59:51,560
want to be handing out your genetics to

3251
01:59:47,399 --> 01:59:51,559
a competitor in a legal Market it's

3252
01:59:51,719 --> 01:59:59,039
um and the long-term solution is plants

3253
01:59:55,920 --> 02:00:00,658
that are bred to be stable seed lines so

3254
01:59:59,039 --> 02:00:02,399
that you can grow you know when you eat

3255
02:00:00,658 --> 02:00:05,519
when we grow corn

3256
02:00:02,399 --> 02:00:06,960
we plant thousands of acres of corn and

3257
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:09,179
the plants all come up looking identical

3258
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:10,980
why because they've been bred by plant

3259
02:00:09,179 --> 02:00:13,679
breeders that know what they're doing

3260
02:00:10,979 --> 02:00:15,899
right and cannabis we're using again

3261
02:00:13,679 --> 02:00:17,340
using tools like genomics right and

3262
02:00:15,899 --> 02:00:19,259
that's why when you plant corn they all

3263
02:00:17,340 --> 02:00:20,819
come up like clones we can get there

3264
02:00:19,260 --> 02:00:22,440
with cannabis but it's going to take a

3265
02:00:20,819 --> 02:00:24,299
lot of breeding work done by people that

3266
02:00:22,439 --> 02:00:26,219
really understand plant breeding you

3267
02:00:24,300 --> 02:00:27,659
don't just cross your your OG to next

3268
02:00:26,219 --> 02:00:30,179
year's Cup winner that's not going to

3269
02:00:27,658 --> 02:00:33,839
get you to a stable seed line

3270
02:00:30,179 --> 02:00:35,219
yeah so I mean brilliant segue into the

3271
02:00:33,840 --> 02:00:37,020
next question I wanted to ask which

3272
02:00:35,219 --> 02:00:39,060
relates to how you were mentioning that

3273
02:00:37,020 --> 02:00:42,239
you know some cultivars have been around

3274
02:00:39,060 --> 02:00:44,039
for you know 20 plus years and I guess

3275
02:00:42,238 --> 02:00:45,779
the longer something's been around the

3276
02:00:44,039 --> 02:00:48,060
more chance there is for it to

3277
02:00:45,779 --> 02:00:51,019
accumulate these you know what I like to

3278
02:00:48,060 --> 02:00:54,239
refer to as plant STDs

3279
02:00:51,020 --> 02:00:56,460
but the question I wanted to ask you was

3280
02:00:54,238 --> 02:00:58,500
there's a lot of discussion around for

3281
02:00:56,460 --> 02:01:00,779
example the chem dog it's a very focal

3282
02:00:58,500 --> 02:01:02,340
topic of our show and a lot of the

3283
02:01:00,779 --> 02:01:05,099
people who are familiar with it comment

3284
02:01:02,340 --> 02:01:07,319
that it has lost Vigor compared to when

3285
02:01:05,099 --> 02:01:11,400
it was first around and the debate

3286
02:01:07,319 --> 02:01:13,920
exists around is that a sort of genetic

3287
02:01:11,399 --> 02:01:16,198
drift is that just a molecular biology

3288
02:01:13,920 --> 02:01:18,539
whereby there's some sort of vigor but

3289
02:01:16,198 --> 02:01:20,759
not necessarily A change in the genome

3290
02:01:18,539 --> 02:01:22,859
what's your thoughts on these sort of

3291
02:01:20,760 --> 02:01:24,840
more grandfathered plants which are

3292
02:01:22,859 --> 02:01:27,059
older are not as vigorous as they used

3293
02:01:24,840 --> 02:01:29,039
to be what do you suspect might be going

3294
02:01:27,060 --> 02:01:31,739
on under the hood

3295
02:01:29,039 --> 02:01:33,300
well it could be all of those things

3296
02:01:31,738 --> 02:01:35,039
um except for genetic drift that's not

3297
02:01:33,300 --> 02:01:37,860
what genetic drift means genetic drift

3298
02:01:35,039 --> 02:01:39,719
means the change and pop in in the

3299
02:01:37,859 --> 02:01:42,960
frequency of alleles in a population

3300
02:01:39,719 --> 02:01:44,520
over Generations so that's specifically

3301
02:01:42,960 --> 02:01:46,560
the meaning of genetic drift the

3302
02:01:44,520 --> 02:01:47,820
Cannabis Community uses that word

3303
02:01:46,560 --> 02:01:49,139
totally wrong

3304
02:01:47,819 --> 02:01:50,939
um Everybody kind of uses that word

3305
02:01:49,139 --> 02:01:52,699
wrong it's funny that people have

3306
02:01:50,939 --> 02:01:56,519
learned that that's what that word means

3307
02:01:52,698 --> 02:01:58,500
it's likely not genetic also I've got

3308
02:01:56,520 --> 02:02:00,360
some friends that have a quite serious

3309
02:01:58,500 --> 02:02:05,219
tissue culture companies and you know

3310
02:02:00,359 --> 02:02:07,139
phds and in plant in Plants uh

3311
02:02:05,219 --> 02:02:09,300
whatever I don't even know what it is

3312
02:02:07,139 --> 02:02:11,400
like Plant Pathology I guess but they

3313
02:02:09,300 --> 02:02:13,739
work they they do tissue culture and

3314
02:02:11,399 --> 02:02:16,019
they have companies that multiply large

3315
02:02:13,738 --> 02:02:18,539
amounts of cannabis clones for

3316
02:02:16,020 --> 02:02:20,520
um for propagation it's becoming a more

3317
02:02:18,539 --> 02:02:22,618
a more

3318
02:02:20,520 --> 02:02:24,119
relied upon part of the industry in the

3319
02:02:22,618 --> 02:02:25,439
legal cannabis World in Canada and it

3320
02:02:24,118 --> 02:02:27,359
probably will be in the states as well

3321
02:02:25,439 --> 02:02:28,079
over time

3322
02:02:27,359 --> 02:02:30,059
um

3323
02:02:28,079 --> 02:02:33,059
it will be in any Market over time to be

3324
02:02:30,060 --> 02:02:35,239
truthfully truthful about it but

3325
02:02:33,060 --> 02:02:38,580
one of the things that they learned

3326
02:02:35,238 --> 02:02:40,439
doing this teacher culture and they were

3327
02:02:38,579 --> 02:02:43,738
also trying to find a way to validate

3328
02:02:40,439 --> 02:02:46,500
the genetic identity of a given plant so

3329
02:02:43,738 --> 02:02:48,479
just like how you can identify a

3330
02:02:46,500 --> 02:02:50,520
Criminal by the DNA that they've left at

3331
02:02:48,479 --> 02:02:52,198
a crime scene you can do the same thing

3332
02:02:50,520 --> 02:02:54,659
for a plant or any person or any

3333
02:02:52,198 --> 02:02:57,059
organism they all have unique genetic

3334
02:02:54,658 --> 02:02:58,920
fingerprints and so in the in the

3335
02:02:57,060 --> 02:03:00,300
process of establishing these genetic

3336
02:02:58,920 --> 02:03:01,859
fingerprints they notice that some of

3337
02:03:00,300 --> 02:03:03,360
the plants had different DNA markers

3338
02:03:01,859 --> 02:03:04,500
they're not different but additional

3339
02:03:03,359 --> 02:03:06,598
ones

3340
02:03:04,500 --> 02:03:08,939
and we're able to tease it all apart and

3341
02:03:06,599 --> 02:03:12,239
figure out that what happened was

3342
02:03:08,939 --> 02:03:14,399
there was bacteria that actually had

3343
02:03:12,238 --> 02:03:16,859
that had colonized the plant on the

3344
02:03:14,399 --> 02:03:19,259
inside and they were living in the in

3345
02:03:16,859 --> 02:03:21,658
the cells and in between the cells

3346
02:03:19,260 --> 02:03:22,860
of the plant

3347
02:03:21,658 --> 02:03:25,679
um

3348
02:03:22,859 --> 02:03:27,359
and so you know I mean think about how

3349
02:03:25,679 --> 02:03:28,980
that could affect phenotype right you've

3350
02:03:27,359 --> 02:03:31,098
got a whole other organism that's that's

3351
02:03:28,979 --> 02:03:34,079
living within your system

3352
02:03:31,099 --> 02:03:35,639
and again the likelihood that like you

3353
02:03:34,079 --> 02:03:37,920
said these are grandfather plants that

3354
02:03:35,639 --> 02:03:40,440
have been around for a long time

3355
02:03:37,920 --> 02:03:43,380
and the likelihood is that they've been

3356
02:03:40,439 --> 02:03:45,479
exposed to some kind of either bacteria

3357
02:03:43,380 --> 02:03:49,380
or viral vector

3358
02:03:45,479 --> 02:03:52,919
that is compromising either the growth

3359
02:03:49,380 --> 02:03:55,739
phenotype and I think that that is

3360
02:03:52,920 --> 02:03:59,039
more likely than saying that a mutation

3361
02:03:55,738 --> 02:04:00,718
happened that said mutations like we

3362
02:03:59,039 --> 02:04:03,539
were talking about the sports you know

3363
02:04:00,719 --> 02:04:06,539
just a minute ago mutations do happen

3364
02:04:03,539 --> 02:04:08,698
right in plants

3365
02:04:06,539 --> 02:04:10,679
um it's really low probability that

3366
02:04:08,698 --> 02:04:12,719
they'll happen twice at the same part of

3367
02:04:10,679 --> 02:04:15,000
the chromosome but it can happen

3368
02:04:12,719 --> 02:04:16,739
right and so

3369
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:19,979
um yeah it's also possible that there

3370
02:04:16,738 --> 02:04:20,819
was a genetic change in a gene that led

3371
02:04:19,979 --> 02:04:23,579
to

3372
02:04:20,819 --> 02:04:25,799
some kind of genetic weakness or

3373
02:04:23,579 --> 02:04:27,359
inability to plant to grow as fast as it

3374
02:04:25,800 --> 02:04:30,119
was you know just one one of these

3375
02:04:27,359 --> 02:04:31,738
General housekeeping genes that kind of

3376
02:04:30,118 --> 02:04:33,719
keep the plant healthy maybe it got

3377
02:04:31,738 --> 02:04:35,819
mutated in a way that it's not quite as

3378
02:04:33,719 --> 02:04:38,158
functional so yeah all of those things

3379
02:04:35,819 --> 02:04:39,960
are possible

3380
02:04:38,158 --> 02:04:41,339
yeah are they inevitable are they

3381
02:04:39,960 --> 02:04:45,480
inevitable that they're going to happen

3382
02:04:41,340 --> 02:04:47,699
to Any Given plant like not probably not

3383
02:04:45,479 --> 02:04:49,799
you know and you can do things like I

3384
02:04:47,698 --> 02:04:51,419
said good cultural practices to minimize

3385
02:04:49,800 --> 02:04:53,699
the chance of it happening

3386
02:04:51,420 --> 02:04:56,520
if you're really serious about it then

3387
02:04:53,698 --> 02:04:59,219
you've got a nursery where it's a

3388
02:04:56,520 --> 02:05:00,960
one-way thing you know things only come

3389
02:04:59,219 --> 02:05:03,420
out of the nursery nothing goes back in

3390
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:05,880
that way you're not adding bugs or any

3391
02:05:03,420 --> 02:05:07,739
kind of disease vectors right you clean

3392
02:05:05,880 --> 02:05:09,420
your hands you sterilize your gloves you

3393
02:05:07,738 --> 02:05:11,698
use new tools every time you cut the

3394
02:05:09,420 --> 02:05:13,618
plant or you get serious and you start

3395
02:05:11,698 --> 02:05:15,059
propagating them in tissue culture

3396
02:05:13,618 --> 02:05:18,059
right

3397
02:05:15,060 --> 02:05:19,800
um and and maybe that is the way but I

3398
02:05:18,060 --> 02:05:21,599
think honestly the way the future is

3399
02:05:19,800 --> 02:05:24,480
that that the tissue culture will have

3400
02:05:21,599 --> 02:05:26,460
its Heyday and then finally when the

3401
02:05:24,479 --> 02:05:28,618
plant real plant breeders

3402
02:05:26,460 --> 02:05:30,359
get a chance to run free in these big

3403
02:05:28,618 --> 02:05:32,880
fields with large breeding opportunities

3404
02:05:30,359 --> 02:05:33,960
and we're using genomic techniques that

3405
02:05:32,880 --> 02:05:36,420
we're going to be able to make these

3406
02:05:33,960 --> 02:05:38,219
plants quite uniform and quite

3407
02:05:36,420 --> 02:05:39,899
chemically uniform and then you'll be

3408
02:05:38,219 --> 02:05:40,980
able to grow them from seed as if they

3409
02:05:39,899 --> 02:05:42,839
were clones

3410
02:05:40,979 --> 02:05:45,059
right and they're not going to be clones

3411
02:05:42,840 --> 02:05:46,980
but but every plant will look more or

3412
02:05:45,060 --> 02:05:49,199
less the same to the point where you can

3413
02:05:46,979 --> 02:05:51,598
either use it all for a true to type

3414
02:05:49,198 --> 02:05:53,579
extract or you know eventually we'll

3415
02:05:51,599 --> 02:05:54,300
have the flower morphology nailed as

3416
02:05:53,579 --> 02:05:56,039
well

3417
