today

62
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,719
awesome my friend the question we like

63
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,800
to ask people first off what have you

64
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,878
been smoking on recently

65
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,840
i've been smoking on some douche valley

66
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:38,959
resin it's been cured for a little over

67
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,560
three months

68
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,840
has a really nice

69
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,719
zesty citrusy flavor on the front and

70
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,719
you know background is all really floral

71
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,719
so it's very nice combination the

72
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,878
effects are really mild

73
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:55,039
so i mean it really does not really

74
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:56,959
takes you out of your working group so

75
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:58,639
you can you know get on with your work

76
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,840
you know go about doing what you want to

77
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:01,839
do in the day

78
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,080
and at the same time not feel like you

79
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,920
want to you know indulge in smoking you

80
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,920
know get interrupted in between your

81
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:10,479
curriculum so i think it's a great smoke

82
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:12,158
to you know start the morning

83
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:14,479
for anyone

84
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:16,000
oh that sounds lovely you've got me

85
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:19,039
interested you said it was cured for

86
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,800
three months how do you find as a hash

87
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:24,959
cue as it affects the flavor and potency

88
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,560
oh it definitely does that i mean

89
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,479
especially i mean if you're going to

90
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,640
talk about the resin that was hand

91
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,639
rubbed from the plants so i mean

92
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:33,359
we have to understand i mean

93
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:35,759
if

94
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,519
that uh resin is

95
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:40,239
produced in a much different way then

96
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,000
it's going to have certain properties

97
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,200
which will be very different from your

98
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,519
conventional

99
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:48,079
hash you know that is made by water or

100
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,519
is made by you know dry seeding so i'm

101
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,640
gonna just elaborate a little bit on

102
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,480
that

103
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,079
so what happens when you're uh you know

104
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:55,679
hand rubbing the plant is that you're

105
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,760
also taking out

106
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,680
some of the plant matter and a lot of

107
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:04,560
water content okay so

108
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:07,599
your final hash is basically a

109
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,840
like a ball of a lot of resin which is

110
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:12,079
stuck around you know some impurities

111
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,000
like dust and you know plant matter

112
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,000
which is binding it together it's

113
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,160
binding the lipids together and then

114
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,279
there's a lot of water content as at the

115
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,280
same time

116
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:23,039
now if you attempt to smoke something

117
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,959
like that at the same time i mean if you

118
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,879
smell it it's gonna smell amazing the

119
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:29,039
smell is going to be amazing okay but

120
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:31,120
when you try to smoke it you will not

121
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,319
feel any flavor at all it's going to be

122
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,720
very harsh

123
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:36,719
uh your nostrils gonna burn like you

124
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,479
know somebody put chili powder in there

125
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,120
and it's going to hurt your throat as

126
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:43,360
well and that's because of the water

127
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,680
that is present in it you know so when

128
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,759
you age it or how you guys say you cure

129
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,280
it or there are a few different things

130
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,680
happening there the first thing that is

131
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:56,719
happening basically over there is that

132
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:59,840
uh the decarboxylation of you know the

133
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,759
resin the other thing is that uh the

134
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:04,478
plant matter that is lost in between you

135
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,319
know that is going to lose the taste you

136
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:08,959
know that is interfering with the final

137
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:10,319
flavor okay and the third and the very

138
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:12,719
important thing that is happening is

139
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:14,560
that it's losing that water

140
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,880
that you know

141
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,240
really needs not to be a part of the

142
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:20,478
hash because

143
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,240
if that hash is then taken to a humid

144
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:25,758
place you know it's eventually is going

145
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,759
to develop in a rod as it's going to

146
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,560
have mold in it

147
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:33,280
as we see in a lot of a lot of resin

148
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,918
which is not you know aged properly or

149
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:38,638
it's packed and you know polythene right

150
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,519
away and you know they don't let it just

151
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,840
sit

152
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:43,758
uh sit out for a while so we see that a

153
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:45,679
lot you know we break we break up pieces

154
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,280
and it's all white from inside so you

155
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,319
know that kind of tells the story so

156
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:54,000
it's it becomes very important here

157
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:55,918
uh you know to cure to age your hash and

158
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,839
you know without that i mean uh that

159
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:00,719
hash really is

160
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:03,279
uh not worth smoking but just after a

161
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,000
few months uh it becomes something

162
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:07,599
divine from something which is not worth

163
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,680
smoking so i think that's a big

164
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,680
difference

165
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,160
well what a great little run down on

166
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,519
that and so i guess my little next

167
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,319
question on that is

168
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:20,240
is there a optimum period in your mind

169
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,919
for hash like do you think you know

170
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,519
between three and six months is the

171
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:25,439
minimum you'd want to do it or how do

172
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:28,719
you think about it

173
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:30,160
okay so um i'm not really sure about

174
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,520
that i mean i haven't really thought

175
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,319
about it in that

176
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:33,680
way

177
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,560
but

178
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,199
within our uh within the circumstances

179
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,918
that i'm in i think three months uh

180
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,160
three four months works the best because

181
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:45,359
after that what we usually see is that

182
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,199
we see

183
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,800
uh i mean not through testing i mean

184
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,598
through what we feel subjectively when

185
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,319
we smoke it right so what we see is that

186
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:55,680
uh it becomes more sleepy i mean the

187
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,840
high becomes

188
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,759
uh in a way that you know it induces

189
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:01,679
more sleepy feeling instead of more

190
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,680
energetic feeling

191
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,800
right so and that i probably think is

192
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,759
what's happening is uh the thc begins to

193
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,038
degrade to cbn uh at a certain point

194
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,598
right so

195
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:15,680
that that starts to happen because

196
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:18,560
eventually after march it starts to get

197
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,959
really hot in india and not everyone you

198
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,079
know has the capacity to store their

199
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:26,959
hash and you know sealed

200
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:29,038
ziploc pouches and freezers so by the

201
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:30,799
time it's just you know if when they

202
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:33,199
take it out in january i'm sorry in

203
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,520
october and november december and

204
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,520
january it sits you know in the village

205
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:39,198
or anywhere in india it's fine because

206
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:41,839
it's still cold

207
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:45,280
and after that after february you know

208
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:48,159
as the heat begins to you know surge

209
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:50,318
i think that it's really not ideal for

210
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,400
for people to store the hash here i mean

211
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,560
unless they have a freezer and they can

212
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:56,878
really you know just vacuum seal it and

213
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,639
that's a whole different thing but

214
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,960
in india because of the diversity and

215
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,038
the dynamics of the season and the way

216
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:05,680
they play out because the winter is very

217
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:07,519
cold and you know when it's summer it's

218
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,439
so hot i mean you cannot imagine you

219
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:12,399
know that there was a winter in the same

220
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:13,918
country at some point so uh really

221
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:16,719
temperate kind of you know climate

222
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:18,799
overall so it's uh three months four

223
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,879
months i think that that's really what

224
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,680
does best in the environment and the

225
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,400
circumstances we're in

226
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,639
yeah what if what a fantastic answer

227
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,159
so the next question is

228
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,918
what was your first experience with

229
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,399
cannabis

230
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:36,158
first experience with cannabis is

231
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,719
i mean this is this is going to be a

232
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:40,399
vastly different from you know because

233
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,879
i've heard like some of your podcasts

234
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,360
before and you know uh people have these

235
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:47,278
really nice stories that yeah my first

236
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,440
experience was i went there and i smoked

237
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:51,120
but it's entirely different for people

238
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,160
who belong to places you know where it

239
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,959
grows everywhere so you're just growing

240
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,679
up

241
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:59,759
along with this plant as as you grow up

242
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:01,439
you just see it everywhere so it's kind

243
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:04,480
of is normal

244
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,519
until the society takes hold of you and

245
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,080
starts telling you that you know

246
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,799
it might not be a very good idea if you

247
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,320
you know start smoking this plant

248
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:16,159
and that really helps in actually

249
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,680
propelling a lot of you know teenagers

250
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:19,679
towards it because then they become

251
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:21,359
curious and you know that they really

252
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:23,519
want to smoke it

253
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,639
so um it's really different in india you

254
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,720
know uh

255
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:27,838
because it's everywhere you know it's in

256
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,759
our worship

257
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,480
it's part of our food

258
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:34,639
uh we use it for the ropes for shelter

259
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,200
for medicine even you know sometimes

260
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:39,278
when you know the cattle get sick we can

261
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,278
feed cannabis plants to the cattle and

262
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:44,000
it pretty much seems to do you know well

263
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:46,559
for for for the animals and one of the

264
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,799
things that i've seen for myself is if

265
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:50,639
you let those animals lose and if

266
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,399
they're having some you know stomach

267
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:54,879
issues or some problem they go and they

268
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:57,039
munch on the canvas plants as if they

269
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:58,720
already know i mean you know that this

270
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:59,519
is the medicine so

271
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,040
just

272
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,360
uh

273
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:05,519
i mean the whole perspective is

274
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,519
different here i mean so

275
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,600
we can't really pinpoint or i can't

276
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,679
really pinpoint okay this was the first

277
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,680
time that i said hey this is cannabis

278
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:14,879
because it's just part of your daily

279
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:17,599
affair like

280
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:21,039
you don't really uh you know realize

281
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:24,000
what was the first time uh you know that

282
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:25,838
you saw people around you because that's

283
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,759
you have people around you and that just

284
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,720
normal we don't really try to pinpoint

285
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:30,480
those

286
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,879
uh things

287
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,240
in the way some other significant things

288
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:35,759
like what was the first time you got

289
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,680
your job or what was the first time you

290
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:39,120
went to a beach so those kind of things

291
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:40,799
could be pinpointed because they're very

292
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,519
specific to your

293
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:45,039
uh you know experiences but this is just

294
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,919
part of your

295
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:50,078
life i mean so it's really different you

296
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:52,078
know growing uh around the plants so i'm

297
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:54,159
just going to go ahead and you know

298
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:56,078
tell really a little story and that

299
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:57,919
would i think really help

300
00:10:56,078 --> 00:10:59,679
a lot of people understand you know how

301
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:01,519
things work here

302
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,519
so uh we don't have a we don't have a

303
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,278
water supply in uh you know in our

304
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,039
village so what we had to do when we

305
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:09,519
were kids we had to

306
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:11,838
grab a pot in the morning and just run

307
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,759
down the hill you know get the water

308
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,360
there are some spots where water comes

309
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:17,200
out of the mountain so you can get the

310
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,360
water and you can go about doing your

311
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,519
things as well so we were accompanied

312
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:25,278
with some uh you know uh

313
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:28,000
elder guys who were around like 25 27

314
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:29,838
19 20 right and we're like really kids

315
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,839
seven eight nine years old

316
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,200
so we would go there and by the time

317
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,800
they're you know descending down the

318
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,560
mountain they're

319
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:38,159
rubbing the plants making the hash as

320
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:40,078
they go down so that once they reach

321
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:41,919
there before they take the bath they can

322
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:44,879
smoke and then they can you know really

323
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:45,679
freshen up and start their day as we do

324
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:47,679
so

325
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:49,439
we were like completely unaware of what

326
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:51,039
this plant is or like what is happening

327
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,120
why they're rubbing it and you know why

328
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:55,519
they really empty the cigarettes fill

329
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,440
them back up and smoke and get crazy so

330
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,839
this whole thing is a big confusion for

331
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,600
us but we kind of enjoy that so they

332
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,040
would also make us rub those plants

333
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,720
because they think we have these small

334
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:05,838
supple hands you know because we were

335
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,480
kids so

336
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,720
it's it's kind of a myth in india that

337
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,480
you know if kids rub it you know their

338
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,480
hands are soft so they take out like the

339
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,879
best hash i don't necessarily think

340
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,200
that's the thing that's the case but

341
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:20,559
that was it so we would do that for them

342
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,480
and they would take out the hatch from

343
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:24,799
our hands and we have no idea what

344
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,480
they're doing and why they're doing it

345
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:28,319
but it was weird so it was like one of

346
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,680
the things that i do remember so if i

347
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,959
really have to pinpoint i mean

348
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:32,479
experience wise then i would say this

349
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:35,518
was one of those things and it was

350
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:38,000
happening almost every day because just

351
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,399
again that's part of your being i mean

352
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,879
as a person and where you live your

353
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,679
culture you see it everywhere in the

354
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:47,278
temples you know on the mondays which is

355
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:49,199
the day of the shiva you see a lot of

356
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:52,639
ladies you know just cutting some

357
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:55,200
branches taking it for the worship

358
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,079
so it's a whole different world out here

359
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,360
i mean

360
00:12:56,078 --> 00:12:58,399
yeah

361
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:01,278
[Music]

362
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,679
yeah wow interesting and i mean when the

363
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:05,838
uh the slightly older guys would get it

364
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:07,838
off your hands do you remember how they

365
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,760
smoked it

366
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,600
yeah they would empty the cigarettes and

367
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,278
you know they would mix it and fill it

368
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,278
up and

369
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:17,278
i i was pretty much getting disgusted

370
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:20,399
hey man like they i thought like they're

371
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:22,958
taking you know what do you call

372
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,958
uh i'm only a body waste kind of thing

373
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:27,838
and smoking it's it's kind of weird and

374
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:29,359
disgusting but you know as as you you

375
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,959
grow and you understand what's really

376
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,919
happening and i'm not trying to say you

377
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:34,559
know that

378
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:35,838
not some part of our you know whatever

379
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:38,799
is there on our hand is not getting

380
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,680
mixed with the ash it certainly does

381
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:40,958
but

382
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:43,759
again i mean

383
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:45,198
this is it is the way it is i mean in

384
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:46,159
india i mean

385
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:48,240
so

386
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:50,719
yeah yeah of course and so do you

387
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,039
remember when you first

388
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,800
like can remember feeling high maybe

389
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:57,198
from smoking some hash yourself for

390
00:13:54,799 --> 00:14:00,078
example

391
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:02,799
yeah so uh i started smoking i mean like

392
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:04,958
around 14 15 16 years of age i mean i

393
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:06,799
don't exactly remember like you know you

394
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:08,719
know what was the first time because it

395
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:10,399
it just happens eventually that someday

396
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,600
you know one of your cousins says take

397
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,519
one puff

398
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,278
and then you know the other time you're

399
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,959
with some friends and you know you're

400
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:17,759
also getting drunk and you take a couple

401
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:19,599
of

402
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:21,759
but um

403
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,759
as a whole in uttarakhand you know the

404
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:24,958
hash it does not really get you that

405
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:27,519
high

406
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:28,958
right i mean it's not cultivated or

407
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,519
selected for

408
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:32,638
thc in particularly like some of the

409
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,560
other places

410
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,879
so it's not that potent and

411
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:39,198
again the domestication part is not very

412
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:41,838
uh you know prolific as well so

413
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:43,359
it's really in uh nowhere close to some

414
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,160
of the other regions in india or

415
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:49,360
somewhere else in asia but i think

416
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:51,679
i was in college when i really remember

417
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,519
getting high-end that was you know some

418
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:55,278
guy who had like come down from shimla

419
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,480
and he had like one of the best

420
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:58,720
residents

421
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,278
he thought at that point in time and you

422
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,199
know i really got high on them because

423
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:05,039
i was just uh you know hanging out with

424
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:07,198
these guys in their hostel rooms and all

425
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:08,240
of these guys belong to himachal pradesh

426
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,319
which was

427
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,480
really close to punjab where i was in

428
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,720
college at that point in time

429
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,480
and i'm hanging out i'm smoking but

430
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,639
mostly it's the cheap stuff that they

431
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,079
can share you know but every now and

432
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,919
then somebody would come back from the

433
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:24,239
village after the vacation and he will

434
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:26,479
bring a little bit like two or three

435
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,399
joints of really good hash and i happen

436
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,920
to be lucky to be there

437
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,078
you know at that point in time and i

438
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:32,958
smoked it and you know the effects were

439
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:35,039
just

440
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:37,198
nothing like i'd ever

441
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:38,559
experienced i think the intensity was up

442
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:41,198
to a level

443
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:44,000
which uh really got me thinking that you

444
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:45,838
know this is this is an amazing feeling

445
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,799
i mean whatever i'm feeling right now i

446
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,839
mean this is a great state of mind to be

447
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:51,198
in

448
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,519
you know and

449
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:54,399
it just really kind of pushed me towards

450
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,879
you know

451
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,958
scouring for more of it you know how can

452
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:01,278
i find more people you know who would

453
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:03,359
have something like this which is not

454
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:05,360
ordinary but you know something better

455
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,399
because now i've gotten to understand

456
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,839
hey you know

457
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,278
what these are

458
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,560
there's there is difference it's not

459
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:15,039
just hash there are levels to this hash

460
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:17,439
and they're like many of them so you

461
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:19,439
have to find you know these people who

462
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,440
have the best resin which are

463
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,759
usually the older guys you know 25 and

464
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,160
above because they had really graduated

465
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,560
smoking by then for over seven to ten

466
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:30,399
years so they kind of have found their

467
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:32,078
places where to get the hash on a

468
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:35,198
regular basis and they usually smoke

469
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:38,239
good but at that point in time i mean we

470
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:40,319
were like 17 18 19 year olds so

471
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,240
we had an entirely different circle but

472
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,720
every now and then we we would get

473
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,120
something good but not regularly at that

474
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,560
point in time for that you had to go out

475
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,399
and you know make friends in other

476
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:53,599
groups and you know meet other people

477
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,519
so

478
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,360
it's such an amazing thing i mean it

479
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,039
just pushes you to socialize with not

480
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,480
only that it psychologically puts you in

481
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:03,679
a state of mind where you feel like

482
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,519
socializing more it also has this effect

483
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:07,599
that in order to find it you have to

484
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:08,959
connect to more people so it's just

485
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,958
amazing how

486
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,798
uh you know this plant has this

487
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,558
intrinsic property of bringing people

488
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,400
together i mean psychologically

489
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:18,959
physically in every which way you can

490
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,759
imagine

491
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,439
yeah of course and i mean kind of raises

492
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:26,160
an interesting point you just brought up

493
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,000
yourself where people in past episodes

494
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,000
have spoke about how

495
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,558
you know it was kind of a glue like when

496
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,919
you met someone who was a fellow smoker

497
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:36,160
you kind of felt like you could trust

498
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,080
them a bit is that a similar thing in

499
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,679
india like if you meet a group of people

500
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:41,839
and you say oh hey i'm a smoker you're a

501
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,360
smoker are you kind of able to make

502
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:46,000
friends easily or is it you still got to

503
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:48,719
kind of prove yourself a bit

504
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,919
it really depends on on you as a person

505
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,839
i mean

506
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,480
what kind of behavior you have

507
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:55,359
so in india i mean behavior is big

508
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,839
so

509
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:59,519
you're uh there's a saying in india that

510
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:01,359
your behavior is your

511
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:02,160
introduction

512
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:04,959
so

513
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:08,000
if you are humble and you know you want

514
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,600
to learn and you know you do some you

515
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,919
run some errands with those for the

516
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:13,519
other guys you know then sure i mean

517
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,880
they will make you part of your group

518
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:16,319
and

519
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,039
of course you can then make friends i

520
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:21,200
mean i think that's a very subjective

521
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:23,839
kind of uh issue you know

522
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,840
it's it goes uh case-to-case basis you

523
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:27,279
know what kind of really person you are

524
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:28,959
if you're the kind of person who can

525
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:31,440
connect to other people

526
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,360
so people don't really have

527
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,840
like a fixed uh

528
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:37,599
i should say this a fixed hierarchy or

529
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:39,279
something that you have to have

530
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:41,279
these many years at a certain level to

531
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:42,558
be able to smoke with someone but it's

532
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,480
just really

533
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:46,558
depends on you that you know how curious

534
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,440
you are and how resourceful you are and

535
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:49,440
you know

536
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,200
uh getting to these places getting to

537
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,480
these people and then once you do get

538
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,240
there i mean how good you are in making

539
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,919
sure that you know you're accepted in

540
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,679
these groups and you know

541
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,759
you can then contribute eventually and

542
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,519
become a part of it

543
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,960
yeah that's awesome it's lovely to hear

544
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:08,240
you know if you're kind of of good

545
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,400
intention heart people are accepting so

546
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,640
you mentioned you first experienced the

547
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,798
nice hash that was brought back by

548
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,200
friends after vacation did that

549
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:19,599
stimulate a curiosity in you to kind of

550
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,720
think i've got to go find a consistent

551
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:24,399
source of this for myself

552
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,200
um yeah absolutely

553
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,759
it did but not in terms of like i have

554
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,798
to go out and you know find the fields

555
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:33,759
pretty much

556
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:36,480
but more like that hey could i find more

557
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:39,679
people who belong to this place because

558
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,839
see the way our thinking evolves is

559
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,038
it it happens step by step i'm sure

560
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:45,119
there are some people you know who

561
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:47,279
really gifted and you know i mean they

562
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:49,918
would really you know get to the

563
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:52,480
conclusion very quickly but for most

564
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:55,038
people you know you go step by step and

565
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,038
really when you have uh such a uh you

566
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:59,279
know great experience on something like

567
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:01,038
hash the only thing that really comes to

568
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:03,839
your mind is hey i can i have to find

569
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:06,319
more people you know who has this kind

570
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:08,399
of stuff like i have to be you know

571
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:10,480
connecting with i ought to be connecting

572
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,640
with these people so that i can get

573
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,720
access to more of it and see how many

574
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,480
how much you know more variety and

575
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,558
diversity is out there

576
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,759
and you know what all experiences are

577
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:20,558
waiting for me

578
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:23,038
you know

579
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:24,480
in in terms of smoke so

580
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:25,759
yeah uh

581
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,679
really i mean

582
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:29,599
it didn't really i mean push me in a way

583
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,240
that i would go to the fields because

584
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:35,199
that really pushed i mean that push

585
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,519
really came later from a whole different

586
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,440
angle i think is when i saw someone who

587
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:40,720
was growing it in front of me because

588
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,240
there was this friend of mine who was

589
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,600
growing up and this is in new delhi

590
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,839
around 2015 i think

591
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:48,719
he got some seeds from milana and he

592
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:50,558
grew

593
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,319
in his house and you know he was able to

594
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:54,079
make hash so

595
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:56,079
that really pushed me and i was like

596
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:58,639
okay i have to now go there and i have

597
00:20:56,079 --> 00:21:00,480
to get my own seats but i had no idea

598
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,400
what was waiting for me once i got there

599
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,519
and once i really got there

600
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:08,080
it blew my mind and then i collected my

601
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:10,319
mind all over again and rearranged it in

602
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:13,439
a way that you know then

603
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:16,480
i was i knew what i had to do in my life

604
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,880
i pretty much uh you know abandoned my

605
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,400
masters at that point in time that i was

606
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,799
i mean i was in the final year of my

607
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,720
masters and i thought you know what

608
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:27,038
um you know i have to wholeheartedly

609
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,558
focus on this thing in preserving this

610
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:29,440
because there are there were a lot of

611
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:31,279
other

612
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,798
things that i was becoming aware of at

613
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:35,200
the same time i mean

614
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:37,038
i i had uh at the same time i had

615
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,038
connected to people over facebook from

616
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:41,038
the united states a lot of people who

617
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:42,640
were growing and you know i found out

618
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:43,519
that there's a larger community that

619
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,840
exists

620
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:47,679
outside who already knows so much about

621
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:49,519
this plant and you know who have done so

622
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,640
much work for it

623
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:52,639
and

624
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,850
i i understood that you know i have to

625
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,000
play a very important role here by

626
00:21:54,849 --> 00:21:57,918
[Music]

627
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,119
collecting these seeds and making sure

628
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:03,840
that you know before this is lost we

629
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:05,839
collect as diverse of a seed sample uh

630
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:08,639
you know make an archive as diverse as

631
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:10,798
we can that includes pretty much every

632
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,840
possible cannabis variety that we can so

633
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:13,200
that

634
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:15,119
people who are really putting in the

635
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,200
work people the breeders you know who

636
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:19,038
are in a position in legal places to do

637
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,720
this kind of work they can go ahead and

638
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:22,558
they can you know work with these

639
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,720
varieties incorporate them into their

640
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:27,119
gene pool and

641
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,919
take it further you know just

642
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:32,479
like our contribution to i mean because

643
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,720
you if you like something and you think

644
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,960
this thing helped you in any way you

645
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,120
know shaping your experiences or if you

646
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,798
feel that uh you know this is something

647
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:43,599
you enjoy then you

648
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:45,679
uh inherently have a duty towards

649
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:48,480
promoting that thing so

650
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:50,798
immediately uh my you know understanding

651
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,960
shifted and i knew that i have to go to

652
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:54,879
these other places and have to collect

653
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,440
connect to more people

654
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:00,240
uh to uh you know get access to

655
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,080
different varieties and that's

656
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,599
what really i mean pushed me towards

657
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:06,079
when going out but

658
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:08,000
smoking was i mean the first step but it

659
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:09,678
was not really the ultimate step i would

660
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,839
say man

661
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:14,880
yeah okay like what a really interesting

662
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:16,879
recount so you mentioned that you kind

663
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,200
of had that epiphany moment when you

664
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,440
went on a trip to milana was it can you

665
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,600
tell us about that trip

666
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,640
yeah that was in milan so

667
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:28,000
it was an amazing like like i said uh uh

668
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,080
the moment i got there i didn't know

669
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,079
what was waiting for me i was just going

670
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:34,158
thinking okay now i'm going to the

671
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:36,158
village where i'm going to get the hash

672
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,400
so i'll have a lot of options to choose

673
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:40,080
from and i can have a good time over the

674
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,038
week staying there sampling all these

675
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:42,720
different

676
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:44,400
resins and at the same time i was

677
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,839
thinking a little bit about okay you

678
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,519
know there will be plants as well so i

679
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:48,720
can get some seeds i mean they couldn't

680
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:52,158
be growing their plants without the

681
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,679
seeds right and this is the time i mean

682
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,120
when people are not really clicking

683
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,600
pictures and they're not really bringing

684
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:59,199
back pictures from milana so i pretty

685
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:00,798
much didn't have a very good idea at

686
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,720
that point in time that you know what i

687
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:05,200
was going to encounter there

688
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:08,079
so we we get to the milana and you know

689
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,679
we just uh get down i mean we're not

690
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:11,599
even close to the village right now it's

691
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,679
about two kilometers away and we can

692
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:16,480
already see the trails of plants you

693
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,600
know just leading along the way

694
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,400
you can see

695
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:20,399
and

696
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,240
they have all these different

697
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,159
expressions which are so beautiful they

698
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,400
have colors they have variety of smell

699
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,919
from florals citrus

700
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,480
woody you know

701
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:33,440
something like pine like turpentine

702
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,440
so it was really nice but that's what we

703
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,278
saw at that point in time so

704
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,038
we liked it we thought oh this is it

705
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:40,558
this is what they make hash of and then

706
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:42,558
you know we go a little further and then

707
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:44,639
we find wow i mean you know there are

708
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:46,399
even better plants in the village and

709
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,919
then once we cross the village and we

710
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,919
eventually get to places like watching

711
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,919
valley magic valley and you know whaling

712
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,840
valley we really understand you know

713
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,080
what is the full potential

714
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:59,038
of the varieties uh you know these

715
00:24:56,079 --> 00:25:02,240
people make hash out of and

716
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:03,519
that i think was a profound moment i

717
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,720
mean it

718
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:08,558
it i mean it has to rearrange your

719
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,240
thinking in a way because that was the

720
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:12,879
year after which

721
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,720
i i started going to these different

722
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,559
places like i went back to my village

723
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,919
first of all because i realized that you

724
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:19,918
know a lot of

725
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,480
hunting has to be done there there are a

726
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,720
lot of hot spots just like you know

727
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,360
himachal pradesh has so many

728
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,360
so i went back there we did

729
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:31,278
uh you know a lot of collection out

730
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:33,359
there we went to

731
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:35,599
and we went near into tibetan border we

732
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:38,479
went near in the chinese border that is

733
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:40,558
uh at the mana pass we collected samples

734
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,480
and let me tell you this is

735
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:44,000
this is a different kind of thing i mean

736
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,440
you cannot go to those places and you

737
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,759
know be doing anything around the

738
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,640
cannabis plants because the moment you

739
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:51,278
cross

740
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,679
the cross into those areas you're under

741
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:56,400
observation all the time from the towers

742
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:58,640
of people uh indian tibetan border

743
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,080
police is looking at you at all times

744
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,799
what you're doing

745
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:02,558
so

746
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:04,079
being a local from that place is really

747
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:05,599
going to help you i mean because if

748
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:06,960
you're from outside then you can just

749
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:08,639
forget about it i mean you can just

750
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,640
forget about going to those places those

751
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,480
are border regions but and there were

752
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,559
other places which were more relaxed and

753
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,558
more tourist like like oregon valley

754
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:18,720
where you can just easily act uh you

755
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:20,480
know you have easy access to

756
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,919
any tourist anybody can go there and

757
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,880
collect seeds

758
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,120
so

759
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,960
we we did all of that and then you know

760
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:29,599
we went back to malana again and we

761
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,600
started going to you know uh started

762
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:33,359
going there at different phases and not

763
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:34,399
just during the flower and that really

764
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:36,879
made

765
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:40,400
a lot of other things apparent to us

766
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:43,200
which which you don't realize in one

767
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,759
glimpse or you don't realize even in a

768
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,600
week if you just go there in october

769
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:48,798
when you know things are pretty much

770
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:50,000
ripening

771
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:52,319
so

772
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,960
and those those things started happening

773
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:57,278
uh at the same time so i mean it was

774
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,640
just all coming together from that point

775
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:00,798
for us and you know we were just

776
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,600
beginning to understand you know what

777
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:06,079
has to be done and how it has to be done

778
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:08,079
because you know we are in north india

779
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:11,119
so geographically we're blessed i mean

780
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:13,599
we're close to almost every cannabis

781
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:15,439
hotspot you know within and we can get

782
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:18,000
there in less than 24 hours so that

783
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,080
really enables us to do all these things

784
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,599
in a way that you know i don't think it

785
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:23,519
would be possible for a lot of other

786
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:25,759
people

787
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:27,759
yeah wow what a powerful little

788
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:30,319
sentiment right there and i think that

789
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:31,519
yeah you're in such a valuable position

790
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:33,359
to be in

791
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:36,000
let's wind it back though for a minute

792
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:37,678
that initial trip to milana

793
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
when you got there

794
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,679
what type of variation were you seeing

795
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,440
in the plants like how many different

796
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,440
phenotypes were there and were they

797
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:49,038
really different or still pretty similar

798
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,558
for the most part what did you observe

799
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:53,119
yeah that's a good question i mean

800
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:55,119
because i i think this is probably the

801
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:57,678
aspect uh that was

802
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:59,278
most intriguing i mean from

803
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,200
because of course you see a cannabis

804
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:02,960
plant so you see a few things you see

805
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,038
the physical embodiment

806
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,720
yeah and you smell it

807
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:08,798
and you know and you look at how

808
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,640
beautiful the flowers look or the way it

809
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:11,440
grows in there's so many other things

810
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,720
right

811
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,200
but um

812
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,679
i so i think what was really interesting

813
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,278
to us was the diversity that was present

814
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,399
within milan i mean

815
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:23,038
i'm just going to give you a little

816
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:24,798
example the first feel that you know i

817
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:26,640
was in waiting valley and

818
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:30,319
i'm seeing this field there are about

819
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:33,440
150 or like 100 plants there and i can

820
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:35,918
see a lot of different phenotypes a lot

821
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,759
of different plants i mean just from a

822
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:40,559
casual look i mean i don't even have to

823
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:41,919
be an expert i don't have to be a person

824
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:43,678
who has some you know prior

825
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,679
understanding of you know

826
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,759
how plants work and all of these things

827
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,120
you you could just be a normal person

828
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:52,558
look at it

829
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:53,678
and be astonished and be you know

830
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:56,398
just

831
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:58,720
be in awe of you know how much

832
00:28:56,398 --> 00:29:00,398
variability is present within a very

833
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,798
small chunk

834
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:04,319
uh because they're growing like tens of

835
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:07,839
millions of plants so if i'm talking

836
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:10,079
about 150 plants field as a sample

837
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:11,759
i'm just talking about a negligible you

838
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:13,038
know proportion

839
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:16,000
so

840
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:17,519
the variability was just immense i mean

841
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,519
and it just

842
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:22,639
brings you to a place psychologically

843
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:25,440
that you are bound to think if this one

844
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:28,240
place has so much diversity just imagine

845
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,840
what other places which have vastly

846
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,798
different environment like you go to

847
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:33,678
equator near kerala or you could go to

848
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:34,960
um

849
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,720
you know

850
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,399
indo tibetan border that is a cold

851
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,880
desert so

852
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:42,398
they have to have something you know

853
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,760
they have to have something different

854
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:45,439
they have to

855
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:48,158
um you know

856
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,759
the plans there have to grow differently

857
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,919
for the reasons that the environment and

858
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:55,038
the cultures are different so i think

859
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:57,440
that really started a relentless cycle

860
00:29:55,038 --> 00:30:00,158
so yeah in the terms of variation when

861
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,640
we talk about in malana i think

862
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,559
that in itself was one of the things

863
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,440
that you know got me thinking and i

864
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:09,599
think uh that was possibly the best

865
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,360
thing i ever did that i thought that if

866
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:13,119
this one place has so much diversity

867
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:15,839
imagine if i could go to other places

868
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:17,439
and how much more i can get and

869
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:19,278
whether or not i can you know preserve

870
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,200
it because at the same time you know the

871
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:23,278
destruction of the habitat is going on

872
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,080
for cannabis because we don't recognize

873
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:27,278
it as a useful plant other than in the

874
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:29,199
hindu

875
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:31,119
um you know cultural practice religious

876
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,679
practices so the government doesn't see

877
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:34,798
it as something you know which is good

878
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,720
so there's not going to be any

879
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:38,480
preservation from the government's side

880
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,880
as a matter of fact the government has

881
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:43,278
been bent on you know taking it out

882
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,120
spent on taking it out i mean

883
00:30:43,278 --> 00:30:47,839
in in kerala they have like completely

884
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:50,158
devastated uh you know these places used

885
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:52,558
to have cannabis fields in and these

886
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,399
people then are forced to go back deeper

887
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:56,158
into the jungles and what happens is

888
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:58,639
they ultimately fall

889
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,480
in the trap of next lights now these

890
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,759
next lights are pretty much running the

891
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,679
show for them

892
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:06,079
and what they do is they provide them

893
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:07,440
protection of course from the government

894
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:09,519
the police

895
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,278
and you know they also help them take

896
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:13,278
that stuff pack it up and you know get

897
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:14,480
to the metro cities like new delhi

898
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:16,720
bombay

899
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,839
pune you know where you can really get a

900
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,360
price uh for that but again i mean

901
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:22,720
the local farmer is really pretty much

902
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:24,079
getting bent over i mean he's not

903
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,960
getting any money

904
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:26,720
so

905
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,440
they're making a lot of money and you

906
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,519
know

907
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,919
they're using it for their organization

908
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:33,679
because of the activities they have to

909
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,240
carry out with weapons and all of these

910
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,440
things so

911
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,759
[Music]

912
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,038
it's sad i mean the way things are going

913
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:40,480
and the same things happening in

914
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:42,398
himachal pradesh where they're really

915
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,319
concerned about their you know tourism

916
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:46,158
and they have this feeling that the

917
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:48,480
cannabis is somehow is going to you know

918
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,240
destroy their tourism industry i mean

919
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,240
it's just nuts when you think about it

920
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,000
because most of the people who go to

921
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,240
himachal pradesh you know they go

922
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,079
because of the cannabis

923
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,319
but well that's how the government sees

924
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:02,558
it and you know the there is relentless

925
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:03,519
pressure from all sides from all sides

926
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:05,759
to just

927
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:07,038
take i mean take this thing out of here

928
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:08,240
and you know

929
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:10,558
um

930
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,079
we really feel that if something is not

931
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:16,000
done right now

932
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:16,000
then it might be a little too late

933
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:20,079
yeah okay

934
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:20,879
um so i mean earlier on you mentioned

935
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:23,038
that

936
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,519
basically you grew up and it was all

937
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:27,359
around you but then you just mentioned

938
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,599
that kind of the government's actually a

939
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:31,119
lot more cracking down on it has that

940
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:33,199
been a recent change what's the

941
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:36,239
government's actual stance on it and is

942
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:39,360
there any sort of medical program

943
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,038
yeah so uh there are a few things um in

944
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:44,158
the few ways the government is working

945
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:46,000
so there are places which are of more

946
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:48,960
interest to government like himachal

947
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,038
pradesh and places like kerala

948
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,399
are have been in highlight i mean ever

949
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:54,798
since the internet has become more

950
00:32:52,398 --> 00:32:57,439
widespread so government definitely have

951
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:59,440
their eyes you know

952
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,440
stuck on these two places and most of

953
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,440
the funds that come i think from the

954
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,720
european union to eradicate the cannabis

955
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,798
in india is

956
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,558
directed towards these places but if i

957
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:10,240
talk about uttarakhand the state i

958
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:11,599
belong from one of the himalayan states

959
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,640
i i've

960
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:17,278
not seen much of the eradication

961
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:19,200
uh you know process except for sometimes

962
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:21,278
what they do is they would make small

963
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,880
local government bodies and they would

964
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:25,278
you know gather people on the sunday and

965
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,640
say let's go out and you know take out

966
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:28,880
all the cannabis plants that you see

967
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,880
around the roadside

968
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,960
but that pretty much doesn't make you

969
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,840
know that doesn't really make the farm

970
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:38,240
population or that uh the cannabis which

971
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:40,959
is growing around the road in atrakhan

972
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:43,038
is not really the part of the plants

973
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,440
which would go on to then make hash

974
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:46,558
those farms are safe somewhere in the

975
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,640
valleys

976
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:51,278
so it's all good and the terrorism i'm

977
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,000
sorry and the tourism is not that much

978
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:54,079
in

979
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,240
you know when you compare it to himachal

980
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:58,879
pradesh uttarakhand is more known for

981
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:01,038
pilgrimage it's um

982
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,760
it has four of the most holiest sites

983
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:05,278
for hinduism hindus and for sikh

984
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:07,599
religion as well

985
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:09,679
uh so a lot of people travel there but

986
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:11,199
for an entirely different reason their

987
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:14,878
tourism has

988
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:16,398
a whole different uh you know no

989
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:17,358
it is it happens because a whole

990
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:19,440
different region because of the

991
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:21,679
pilgrimage and when you look at himachal

992
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,918
pradesh or you look at kerala their

993
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,918
tourism is based around more like

994
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:27,598
recreation and the things you could do

995
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:28,638
there that you could not

996
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:32,079
in the

997
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,079
in the in the other places

998
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:36,719
yeah okay brilliant so

999
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,879
just quickly

1000
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:42,239
was it before sorry let me re-ask that i

1001
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:42,239
kind of asked that really badly

1002
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:48,079
yeah awesome so i mean i'm interested to

1003
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:50,079
know when were you first able to start

1004
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:52,399
to link up with other people who were

1005
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:54,720
kind of like-minded was it before or

1006
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:57,759
after the manila trip which really kind

1007
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:59,598
of solidified things in your mind

1008
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,200
yeah that was really amazing because

1009
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:03,838
before milan i was just connecting to

1010
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:05,598
like i said people morph to acquire like

1011
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:08,159
hash if i could get more of that

1012
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:11,280
experience that i liked at that point in

1013
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:13,679
time after smoking that but once i went

1014
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,280
to milan you know and i came back and i

1015
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:16,480
traveled a little bit to other places

1016
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,560
like i said

1017
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,240
so then i realized i mean i could only

1018
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:22,639
go to so many places you know that i

1019
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:25,118
have to have other people i have to you

1020
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:26,960
know have friends and people like-minded

1021
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:29,200
people in other states because india is

1022
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,760
a vast country right so

1023
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:34,000
it's hard to travel you know all across

1024
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:36,079
the country so i thought this would be a

1025
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,400
good idea but in in the end i mean that

1026
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:40,560
didn't really uh you know work out uh

1027
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,400
too well because uh you know a lot of

1028
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:44,000
things that happened

1029
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,838
and and it's understandable because if

1030
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,119
you're going to involve you know if

1031
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:48,559
human beings are going to involve in

1032
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,720
something then there's going to be some

1033
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:52,719
fuss at some point

1034
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:54,639
so uh that was not really a big deal

1035
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:57,598
though but yeah after that i mean i was

1036
00:35:54,639 --> 00:36:00,000
really uh you know inclined towards uh

1037
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:02,320
getting connected with more people

1038
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,760
you know who are like-minded but after i

1039
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,920
realized that hey you know what this is

1040
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,520
not going to work i mean i cannot trust

1041
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,760
somebody who's sitting on internet

1042
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:10,559
because i see that is the trend right

1043
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,160
now

1044
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:14,639
that you know you get hold of someone

1045
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:17,039
who's on internet uh let's say he's in

1046
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:19,199
you know africa and you say oh you're in

1047
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:21,199
africa so you can get me african seats

1048
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:23,039
well he can get you african seats but i

1049
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:24,239
mean if that's how you're gonna go about

1050
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:26,239
it then

1051
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:28,559
i think then we're at two different

1052
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:29,279
places uh you know thinking about this

1053
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:31,759
thing

1054
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,920
so i thought you know i have to go there

1055
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,920
and the other more

1056
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,159
bigger part was that you know that it

1057
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,960
had started to generate some sort of

1058
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:43,039
revenue and i had a concern that okay

1059
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:46,240
now i have this revenue coming in from

1060
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:48,239
the seats so what happens to this

1061
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:50,639
what do i do with this so

1062
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:52,078
eventually you start thinking about it

1063
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:54,159
and you understand that you know what

1064
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:56,560
you have to do all your answers lies in

1065
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:58,399
one thing that you have to physically go

1066
00:36:56,559 --> 00:37:00,400
to these places you have to meet these

1067
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,880
people people make them understand you

1068
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,639
know what your program is all about what

1069
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,640
you're doing and how it's going to help

1070
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:08,559
them and you know the other community on

1071
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:10,000
the other side of the world

1072
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,358
and just

1073
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,199
make them understand that this is

1074
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:15,199
something bigger than you me and all of

1075
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:17,118
us put together you know and you know

1076
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:19,118
get them on board and at the same time

1077
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:21,680
they get paid for the seeds that they're

1078
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:23,119
giving so that makes you feel great i

1079
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:24,879
mean you know that you know not only

1080
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,800
that you're helping in preservation

1081
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,559
you're also able to mobilize resources

1082
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,839
to these people

1083
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:32,159
who

1084
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:34,239
could never imagine they can see making

1085
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:37,118
money off season and for them it's the

1086
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:39,118
resin that makes uh really the cash now

1087
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:41,838
i'm trying to make them understand the

1088
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:44,400
value of the seed and you know value of

1089
00:37:41,838 --> 00:37:47,119
just about everything in that plant

1090
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,838
that uh you know they may be undermining

1091
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:51,838
so

1092
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:54,000
far yeah of course that's a really

1093
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:55,838
valuable point to make and it brings on

1094
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,679
a range of different questions i had

1095
00:37:55,838 --> 00:37:59,599
such as

1096
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:01,598
do you think that money is one of the

1097
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:03,119
best things you can trade people for the

1098
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,200
seeds or what are some other things

1099
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,599
because i remember in a previous bodhi

1100
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:09,118
episode he mentioned a few different

1101
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,800
things he likes to trade and they all

1102
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:13,838
sounded really good like he'll take some

1103
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,599
basic medicines sometimes or you know

1104
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:17,759
some coloring in books for the kids and

1105
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:18,880
whatnot what are some things you like to

1106
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,800
trade do you think just money is the

1107
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,200
best or

1108
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:26,800
no i don't think money is the best uh at

1109
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:29,199
least not for the villages you know

1110
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:31,359
which are really located in remote areas

1111
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:33,519
so for them even if i get them some

1112
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:35,279
money i mean it's more like being on an

1113
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:37,759
island with a lot of cash i mean you

1114
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:40,160
can't really do anything with it right

1115
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,160
so what i feel

1116
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:44,159
more appropriate is i really go there

1117
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:47,039
and understand their situation and you

1118
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:48,879
know we look around at how could we make

1119
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:51,119
you know life better for these people

1120
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:54,000
but at the same time

1121
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:56,800
not interfere with the culture enough

1122
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,400
that it begins to morph into

1123
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,160
something you know like a third thing

1124
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,519
right so you have to be very careful

1125
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:03,279
about that

1126
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:06,719
so what we do is

1127
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,560
you know mobile phones is uh one of the

1128
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:10,239
most sought after things amongst the

1129
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:12,559
villagers because you know they can

1130
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:16,799
hardly get to those places where good

1131
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:19,199
mobile phones are available and then bad

1132
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,920
you know battery backups and

1133
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:23,519
led lights which are charged by you know

1134
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,680
solar energy

1135
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:27,599
and just a bunch of batteries and you

1136
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:30,159
know clothes for their kids

1137
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:32,240
and of course some you know other things

1138
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:35,199
that kids would really appreciate and

1139
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:37,919
you know you just could not find it but

1140
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:39,919
still i mean uh being very careful that

1141
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,440
you know we don't bring something that

1142
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,440
might lead to

1143
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,720
any detrimental change in their culture

1144
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,838
or that

1145
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:47,598
you know

1146
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:50,078
could be the beginning of something

1147
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:51,920
which is not desirable

1148
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:54,480
yeah so i mean to kind of throw you in

1149
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,720
the hot seat what do you think about

1150
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:59,358
what greenhouse seeds does where they go

1151
00:39:56,719 --> 00:40:01,358
to these places and trade their crappy

1152
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:03,039
european genetics for the land race

1153
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:06,159
seeds

1154
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:08,219
um i i i don't really have an opinion

1155
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:09,440
about that i mean because

1156
00:40:08,219 --> 00:40:11,838
[Music]

1157
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,599
i think i i've seen the i've seen the

1158
00:40:11,838 --> 00:40:15,920
documentary you know that they came in

1159
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:18,720
milana and it was really nice it was

1160
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,559
shot you know very professionally but

1161
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:22,959
uh i don't have a very strong opinion

1162
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:25,119
about it but yeah i will say this that

1163
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,920
you know uh they should not be giving

1164
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,680
people

1165
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,280
those seeds you know

1166
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:30,719
i mean because you know then i heard an

1167
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,960
argument from someone it was a really

1168
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:34,799
stupid argument that somebody said hey

1169
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:37,119
you know these are like feminized seeds

1170
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,599
and you know it doesn't really matter

1171
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:40,480
and you just begin to understand i mean

1172
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,800
how

1173
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:45,280
short-sighted and myopic uh you know

1174
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,560
these people these people's visions are

1175
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,319
because they're not thinking even if

1176
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:50,239
it's a feminized plan if it gets

1177
00:40:48,318 --> 00:40:52,559
pollinated which it will get pollinated

1178
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:54,879
by the males around it and sudden seeds

1179
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:56,559
are going to drop you can't you can put

1180
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,400
like an umbrella under those plants and

1181
00:40:56,559 --> 00:41:00,239
make sure you collect every seeds and

1182
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:03,200
just takes one seed to fall down you

1183
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:04,879
know which is like a hybrid uh which is

1184
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:07,358
hybrid in nature and i'm not saying that

1185
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,440
it's going to ruin everything or but you

1186
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:11,440
have to understand i mean

1187
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,519
we already have a lot of that i mean you

1188
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,679
know we have all the hybrid varieties we

1189
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:17,358
want and we have these places where it's

1190
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:20,159
even legal and you could grow it and

1191
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:22,159
it's being sold and being taxed you know

1192
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:24,239
people are making t-shirts and trays and

1193
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:26,239
i don't know what not you know so

1194
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:27,759
let's just you know i think that's

1195
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:29,358
enough you know you don't have to really

1196
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,040
bring it to places you know where it's

1197
00:41:29,358 --> 00:41:34,400
really not required

1198
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:36,159
i mean that's just how i feel about it

1199
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,559
yeah i mean

1200
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:40,719
i'm probably gonna go down a wrong path

1201
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:41,759
here but just just as a one isolated

1202
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:43,358
question because we're gonna talk about

1203
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,119
this a lot more later

1204
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:47,119
no problem i'm in no problem

1205
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:49,200
have you ever gone to an area like a

1206
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:51,119
regional area found a patch and you

1207
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:53,199
thought oh my god this is all just like

1208
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:55,440
super lemon haze or like something like

1209
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:57,279
that

1210
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,039
yeah of course

1211
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:01,359
so uh if you go to imagine pradesh there

1212
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:03,358
are certain places

1213
00:42:01,358 --> 00:42:04,799
you know you could like absolutely tell

1214
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:07,039
what's happening there

1215
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,640
so uh himachal pradesh is a very

1216
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:10,960
interesting place let's just first of

1217
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:12,879
all understand something about you know

1218
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,318
how people are and then that would

1219
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,680
really put a lot of other things in

1220
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:17,358
perspective

1221
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:19,838
so when you compare three himalayan

1222
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:22,239
states kashmir uttarakhand and himachal

1223
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:24,000
pradesh i'm going to say the most

1224
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:25,919
advanced state and the most advanced

1225
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,519
people are living in himachal pradesh

1226
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,318
when you just compare it i mean amongst

1227
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:32,639
these three states not just the india

1228
00:42:30,318 --> 00:42:34,318
and why that is well that's because the

1229
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:35,519
exposure that they're getting they have

1230
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:37,838
so much

1231
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:39,838
tourism going in there you have these

1232
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:42,239
you know israeli people who would almost

1233
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:43,679
never go out of himachal pradesh i don't

1234
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:46,639
even understand you know how they can be

1235
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:49,039
there for indefinite periods anyways and

1236
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:51,118
you have europeans you have americans

1237
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:53,279
and you have you know all these other

1238
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,720
countries like australia canada new

1239
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,240
zealand you know people travel over

1240
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:58,799
there and what

1241
00:42:56,239 --> 00:43:01,358
happens is that over time you know

1242
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:03,440
people get more and more exposure it's

1243
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:05,039
almost like those people are traveling

1244
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:08,720
to those countries because the

1245
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:10,639
experiences are so frequent right so

1246
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:12,799
they have been acquainted with the

1247
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:15,199
information that is just not available

1248
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,800
you know to other places of traditional

1249
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:18,639
you know cannabis

1250
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,839
and these people know that there are

1251
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:24,318
varieties that exist you know uh which

1252
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:26,400
flower faster and can grow you know

1253
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:29,440
bigger buds and you know they are

1254
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:31,680
very very potent as well you know which

1255
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,358
would ultimately you know get you more

1256
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:34,239
money if you were to make hash from them

1257
00:43:33,358 --> 00:43:35,598
so

1258
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:37,679
there are people who understand but

1259
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:39,519
where those people are are they are in

1260
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:42,799
manali they're around manali in old

1261
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:45,280
manali especially there's a place called

1262
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:47,599
that's like famous for that and then you

1263
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:50,160
have nagar there's a place called nagar

1264
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:52,240
that is uh that is also around

1265
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:55,199
uh like old manali

1266
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:57,118
so these uh these places are like really

1267
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:59,118
famous and you go there and you know you

1268
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:01,599
could just look at the plant and smell

1269
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:04,800
it and you know this is this is not a

1270
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:07,599
plant you know that's been grown here or

1271
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,760
has been you know domesticated

1272
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:12,480
from the wild populations you just

1273
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:14,319
understand that you know this is some uh

1274
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,400
this is an effect of

1275
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:19,279
uh you know genetic infection

1276
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,960
rather so yeah there are places uh but

1277
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:24,160
luckily places like kashmir and

1278
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:25,440
uttarakhand have you know stayed

1279
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:28,159
safe from

1280
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:30,720
the things like that because you know

1281
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:32,639
first nobody goes there really and you

1282
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:34,879
know even if they do i mean you don't

1283
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:36,639
get just enough tourism from other

1284
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:39,280
countries that you would eventually

1285
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:40,799
start to have people who can bring seeds

1286
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,079
over there

1287
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,519
plus you know we've been going around

1288
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:46,079
those places and you know we've never

1289
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:48,079
really seen anything any sign even

1290
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:50,000
remotely close to of

1291
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:50,800
uh something that would suggest that you

1292
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,239
know

1293
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,800
there's been

1294
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:57,118
an activity like that

1295
00:44:54,800 --> 00:45:00,160
yeah of course and i guess

1296
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:02,318
the follow-on question i have is that do

1297
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:05,838
you think that people trading these

1298
00:45:02,318 --> 00:45:08,159
modern seeds to land race regions could

1299
00:45:05,838 --> 00:45:11,119
ultimately lead to the extinction of

1300
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:13,358
those regional cultivars

1301
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:14,880
yeah this is i mean this is pretty much

1302
00:45:13,358 --> 00:45:17,440
how it's going to go down and it's

1303
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,400
inevitable in a way and no no matter how

1304
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,800
much we

1305
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,079
you know dislike it or say yeah you know

1306
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,359
we're going to be warriors and we're

1307
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:26,000
going to stop this

1308
00:45:23,358 --> 00:45:26,639
you know we're all human beings and you

1309
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,039
know

1310
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:31,519
we're not even like a government

1311
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:33,838
funded program or something right

1312
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:35,920
so we understand that eventually when a

1313
00:45:33,838 --> 00:45:37,599
lot of people you know would become

1314
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,920
aware that you know there's a global

1315
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:42,079
community and you know the interaction

1316
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:44,079
would have begin to happen in a way like

1317
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:46,079
it happened in the iit sector you know

1318
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:48,318
which is just absolutely you know

1319
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:50,720
maddening then you're gonna have tons of

1320
00:45:48,318 --> 00:45:52,480
people you know uh selling seeds to

1321
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:53,679
india and it only is a matter of time

1322
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,679
that someone

1323
00:45:53,679 --> 00:45:57,919
goes out to all of these places and you

1324
00:45:55,679 --> 00:46:00,399
know start uh growing these plants and

1325
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:03,280
start infecting everything and changing

1326
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,639
them eventually but that's what uh you

1327
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:07,200
know really

1328
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:09,679
our existence is all about and you know

1329
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:11,279
as much as i don't like it i mean i'm

1330
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:13,039
not gonna say that it will not happen

1331
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,720
because that's just not practical yeah

1332
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:16,000
there are going to be some places which

1333
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:18,959
will be saved

1334
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,039
places like lola valley in kashmir or

1335
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:23,838
because you're just you just can't go

1336
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:26,000
there and i mean like it's hard i mean

1337
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:28,639
and the only very few people who can go

1338
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,880
there i mean you know we we know who

1339
00:46:28,639 --> 00:46:32,719
those people are so for the longest time

1340
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:35,440
i think they will be able to save their

1341
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:38,000
uh you know natural varieties but

1342
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,679
uh places like malana and places like

1343
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,760
you know even urgent valley in

1344
00:46:39,679 --> 00:46:43,679
uttarakhand you know where tourism is

1345
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:46,560
more those places would be the first one

1346
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:49,039
to fall prey to things like this because

1347
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:51,920
uh they're easy to access and you know

1348
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:53,838
the villagers are very friendly and

1349
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,519
well i mean that's all you need and you

1350
00:46:53,838 --> 00:46:58,000
know they have an inclination towards

1351
00:46:55,519 --> 00:46:59,599
making more money from this plant so i

1352
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,920
just don't see why they would not want

1353
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:03,519
to have those varieties when they would

1354
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,519
understand that clearly we can you know

1355
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:07,358
make more money off this and just

1356
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:08,800
make the whole situation better for us

1357
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:11,358
harvest early

1358
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:13,440
i mean you cannot deny the fact you know

1359
00:47:11,358 --> 00:47:15,838
that there are certain advantages

1360
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:19,039
inherent advantages which are attached

1361
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:21,279
with these you know hybrid varieties but

1362
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:22,960
uh you just have to move to a different

1363
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:25,040
plane to look at it from a different

1364
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,240
angle and understand that it's not all

1365
00:47:25,039 --> 00:47:28,960
about that

1366
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:31,118
but for the villagers who are making

1367
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,800
money off it to them it's all about that

1368
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:34,880
and as soon as they realize that they

1369
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:37,280
can do something better than they would

1370
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:39,358
they would do it

1371
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,880
yeah okay and i guess my final question

1372
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:43,679
on this topic is

1373
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:46,000
how do you feel about the fact that

1374
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:48,558
greenhouse seeds for example has never

1375
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,159
reproduced and sold to the public these

1376
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:53,839
lines as far as we can tell it's just

1377
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:53,838
sitting in their seed bank

1378
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:58,880
when again i i don't really think about

1379
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,680
those things then i don't really seem to

1380
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,440
have

1381
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:03,039
an opinion or a

1382
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,720
you know available

1383
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:06,880
emotion for that that i can you know

1384
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:09,759
readily express right now but

1385
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:11,039
um what i think about that is

1386
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,960
i don't know there could be reasons

1387
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:15,119
because they did take milano line and

1388
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:17,199
you know they made certain uh certain

1389
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:18,880
varieties with it but at the same time

1390
00:48:17,199 --> 00:48:21,519
you're right they never really released

1391
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:24,079
those things in pure form so

1392
00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:26,480
uh then you have to understand i mean

1393
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:27,680
you have to begin to think at least that

1394
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,519
these people

1395
00:48:27,679 --> 00:48:32,159
i mean someone who does not want to

1396
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:33,838
include everyone into the club

1397
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:36,318
basically you know

1398
00:48:33,838 --> 00:48:37,119
is not for the people right is

1399
00:48:36,318 --> 00:48:38,800
is

1400
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:40,960
those people are just trying to do

1401
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:43,680
something which is very specifically

1402
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:46,000
beneficial to them but at the same time

1403
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:48,639
make it appear as though you know other

1404
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,559
people are part of it so i mean it's

1405
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:52,239
it's it's pretty clever but at the same

1406
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:53,200
time you know it's a business and you

1407
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:54,959
know

1408
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:56,558
uh it's not a surprise i mean you know

1409
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,559
human beings have done

1410
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:00,240
you know so many things i mean this just

1411
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:00,960
is not even you know

1412
00:49:00,239 --> 00:49:02,959
uh

1413
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:05,760
uh the systems stand in a way that it

1414
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,800
would surprise anyone that uh

1415
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,480
you know that

1416
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,318
has happened that they've never released

1417
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,920
any of the pure lines but well that's

1418
00:49:10,318 --> 00:49:14,000
changing because we here and you know

1419
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,519
other people are here uh so many other

1420
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,358
people from india right now who are

1421
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:18,639
actually on instagram and they're

1422
00:49:17,358 --> 00:49:20,400
actually you know uh you know

1423
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:22,558
interacting with these other folks and

1424
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:25,680
getting these seats out as we

1425
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:27,599
speak there are folks from india i know

1426
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:29,039
and these are all decent collectors okay

1427
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:30,880
they're good they're good guys they're

1428
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:32,558
trying to do good things as much as they

1429
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,400
can and they have partnered with you

1430
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:35,200
know certain folks in america and you

1431
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,400
know

1432
00:49:35,199 --> 00:49:38,480
they're going around doing these

1433
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,200
partnerships and you know preserving the

1434
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,559
pla

1435
00:49:39,199 --> 00:49:42,639
pure variety and then making some

1436
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:44,559
hybrids with it and you know rolling it

1437
00:49:42,639 --> 00:49:46,480
out to public you know collect the funds

1438
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:48,079
and then you know distribute it amongst

1439
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,920
the grower and you know the collector

1440
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:50,960
and the other people the farmers are

1441
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,760
involved

1442
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,920
so

1443
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:56,000
i'm just saying seeing these so many you

1444
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:58,400
know multitudes and

1445
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,318
of facets you know in which people are

1446
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,160
discovering you know how the

1447
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:04,719
preservation of the land race and

1448
00:50:02,159 --> 00:50:07,199
heirlooms uh could could become more

1449
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:09,598
prevalent and could become a thing

1450
00:50:07,199 --> 00:50:12,719
actually that you know if you if you are

1451
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:14,318
a person of cannabis and you don't grow

1452
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:16,399
a land race an heirloom variety if you

1453
00:50:14,318 --> 00:50:18,159
haven't preserved one and it should be

1454
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:20,720
like you know shame on you something

1455
00:50:18,159 --> 00:50:21,519
like that you know that you

1456
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:23,838
uh

1457
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:26,800
seem to say that you know you spiritual

1458
00:50:23,838 --> 00:50:29,199
you you derive a spiritual

1459
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:31,359
pleasure from this plan right but at the

1460
00:50:29,199 --> 00:50:32,480
same time you haven't done anything to

1461
00:50:31,358 --> 00:50:33,838
preserve

1462
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:36,240
the source

1463
00:50:33,838 --> 00:50:37,519
from where you derive that pleasure so

1464
00:50:36,239 --> 00:50:39,199
once people have that kind of

1465
00:50:37,519 --> 00:50:41,199
understanding once we understand on the

1466
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:43,439
spiritual level why the history matters

1467
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:45,118
why we cannot ignore these people who

1468
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,960
who have done all the work for thousands

1469
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:49,358
of years who have gone out in the wild

1470
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:51,599
recognized the plant brought them back

1471
00:50:49,358 --> 00:50:53,598
domesticated them and got them to a

1472
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:56,800
point where they started to look like

1473
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:57,838
the cannabis plant that we you know

1474
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,920
look at

1475
00:50:57,838 --> 00:51:01,920
and then some people from europe or

1476
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,519
america you know they went out and they

1477
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,358
grabbed those varieties and you know

1478
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:07,838
made hybrids within a matter of few

1479
00:51:05,358 --> 00:51:10,400
decades i mean that was only possible

1480
00:51:07,838 --> 00:51:12,480
because before that those varieties were

1481
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,639
you know domesticated for thousands of

1482
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:16,480
years let me just say this very bluntly

1483
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:17,598
i mean if those people had to go out to

1484
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,800
places

1485
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:20,480
where

1486
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:23,039
and you know get the varieties which are

1487
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:25,199
absolutely wild you know they grow like

1488
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:27,279
just really weed you understand why it's

1489
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:28,960
called wheat and if you had to work with

1490
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,559
them a lot of people would still be in

1491
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,440
breeding them and getting them to a

1492
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:33,200
point

1493
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:35,440
uh you know where they where they have

1494
00:51:33,199 --> 00:51:37,598
some sort of consistency some some sort

1495
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,720
of homogeneity in terms of their traits

1496
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,680
that they like

1497
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:42,159
and

1498
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:43,679
that's really when you know

1499
00:51:42,159 --> 00:51:46,000
so it would have taken a lot of time and

1500
00:51:43,679 --> 00:51:48,558
we wouldn't be nowhere near where we are

1501
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,480
and a big part of that is to understand

1502
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:53,519
that you know the domestication part the

1503
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:55,280
foundation work was done by the people

1504
00:51:53,519 --> 00:51:57,599
you know who are these indigenous

1505
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:59,119
communities in himalayas in afghanistan

1506
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:02,240
and pakistan

1507
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:04,800
you know africa and laos cambodia

1508
00:52:02,239 --> 00:52:06,558
thailand and like i don't wanna just

1509
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:09,280
like list all of these but you know all

1510
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:11,839
these places so we have to recognize

1511
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:14,559
them in an organic way this is not a

1512
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:16,799
political way of seeing it that uh hey

1513
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:18,319
you know these guys deserve it no it's

1514
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,760
not like that i mean if you're going to

1515
00:52:18,318 --> 00:52:20,639
say that you know

1516
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,319
that

1517
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:24,318
i get a spiritual experience from

1518
00:52:22,318 --> 00:52:25,440
cannabis then let me ask you something

1519
00:52:24,318 --> 00:52:27,920
you know what is the essence of

1520
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:29,119
spirituality i mean it lies in the

1521
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,039
deeper

1522
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:33,039
subjective understanding you know of our

1523
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:34,880
own self of our

1524
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:36,880
things that are around us that

1525
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,480
makes us happy and this is one of the

1526
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,440
things that i can think of that makes me

1527
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,760
happy

1528
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:43,358
and you know it has a deep impact on me

1529
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,160
for that reason

1530
00:52:43,358 --> 00:52:46,719
so

1531
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:49,118
how can you like completely or truly i

1532
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:50,639
mean reconcile that spiritual experience

1533
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:51,838
without actually knowing or

1534
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:53,679
understanding

1535
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:54,558
or even appreciating

1536
00:52:53,679 --> 00:52:56,639
the

1537
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:58,800
i mean the magnitude of work which

1538
00:52:56,639 --> 00:53:00,879
indigenous communities have put

1539
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,640
in these thousands of years before we

1540
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,519
came into the picture

1541
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:06,719
so

1542
00:53:03,519 --> 00:53:08,960
once those things become you know

1543
00:53:06,719 --> 00:53:11,358
common knowledge and we know all of that

1544
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:13,599
history the cultures

1545
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:16,159
that's when we can truly say that we are

1546
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:19,359
able to now have a complete spiritual

1547
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:21,598
experience from this plant

1548
00:53:19,358 --> 00:53:23,759
just that's what i feel

1549
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:26,400
yeah no really powerful sentiment i dig

1550
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:28,400
it i dig it so if we just jump back in

1551
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:31,358
the story i just wanted to quickly ask

1552
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:34,240
another question about the milana fields

1553
00:53:31,358 --> 00:53:36,078
you went to were they making charis or

1554
00:53:34,239 --> 00:53:38,558
hash from those plants and if so what

1555
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:39,920
was it like

1556
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:42,079
um yeah i mean

1557
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,680
so they don't actually like stand in the

1558
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:45,920
fields and rub them

1559
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:48,318
what they usually do is uh either they

1560
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:50,000
send the women of the house or like

1561
00:53:48,318 --> 00:53:50,960
somebody would go out venture into the

1562
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,760
fields

1563
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:55,440
with like a makeshift basket which is

1564
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,520
attached to rope and you could wear it

1565
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:00,400
like a bag right

1566
00:53:57,519 --> 00:54:02,559
so they would uh you know cut a bunch of

1567
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:05,119
plants and they would just bring them to

1568
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:07,119
a designated place of rubbing so

1569
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:09,599
uh let me just tell you some a little

1570
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:11,838
about you know the rubbing here so that

1571
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:13,119
you know it becomes a bit more

1572
00:54:11,838 --> 00:54:15,920
understandable

1573
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:17,519
so one is malana village and most of the

1574
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,960
rubbing does not actually happen over

1575
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:21,119
there most of the hash is not actually

1576
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:23,358
made in the milano village because their

1577
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:25,440
fields are around the village which are

1578
00:54:23,358 --> 00:54:27,598
these different valleys waiting valley

1579
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,119
whaling and magic valley and a few

1580
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:31,039
others

1581
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:33,440
what these people do is that these

1582
00:54:31,039 --> 00:54:36,239
people have makeshift houses in each of

1583
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:38,240
these valleys where their fields are

1584
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:40,239
so they're not traveling back and forth

1585
00:54:38,239 --> 00:54:41,838
every day to their house during the

1586
00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:44,318
harvest season because the harvest

1587
00:54:41,838 --> 00:54:45,838
window is small and the same time police

1588
00:54:44,318 --> 00:54:48,400
is cracking down on them and they have

1589
00:54:45,838 --> 00:54:50,239
to make sure that they go get through

1590
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:52,240
their uh you know

1591
00:54:50,239 --> 00:54:55,039
whatever they've grown their produce

1592
00:54:52,239 --> 00:54:56,879
very quickly so the best way to do it is

1593
00:54:55,039 --> 00:54:59,440
during the octobers they would move with

1594
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:01,200
the entire family to these places like

1595
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:03,039
uh white let's just say in wailing

1596
00:55:01,199 --> 00:55:06,318
valley right

1597
00:55:03,039 --> 00:55:09,039
and now from that point onwards every

1598
00:55:06,318 --> 00:55:11,599
day is simply dedicated from morning

1599
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:13,039
till they go to the sleep rubbing hash

1600
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:14,960
producing hash

1601
00:55:13,039 --> 00:55:16,960
it's a relentless process they're

1602
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:19,440
speaking to you i mean you could be

1603
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:21,119
there smoking or eating food or looking

1604
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:23,200
around and you would just see

1605
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:25,680
these people are going about it as if

1606
00:55:23,199 --> 00:55:28,078
like we go about breathing

1607
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:30,558
around that point in time so

1608
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:32,720
it it gets normalized pretty soon once

1609
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:34,480
you know you get you you grow accustomed

1610
00:55:32,719 --> 00:55:36,480
to it because you see so much of it i

1611
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,318
mean as soon as you get in there

1612
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,679
if you go there around you know the

1613
00:55:38,318 --> 00:55:41,119
season when

1614
00:55:39,679 --> 00:55:42,960
you know plants are flowering that is

1615
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:46,000
around october of course october and

1616
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:48,240
november as well but november um you

1617
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,679
don't see much of rubbing but october is

1618
00:55:48,239 --> 00:55:52,159
everywhere i mean you just get near

1619
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:54,480
milana and you know the air has this

1620
00:55:52,159 --> 00:55:57,039
freaking smell of cannabis you know

1621
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:58,719
it it drives you crazy and it tells you

1622
00:55:57,039 --> 00:56:00,239
you know where to go you can just leave

1623
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:02,879
the smell

1624
00:56:00,239 --> 00:56:04,879
oh wow that sounds lovely i think i

1625
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,640
actually saw on one of your instagram

1626
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:09,280
posts that you were saying

1627
00:56:06,639 --> 00:56:10,879
a lot of the kind of hash and charis and

1628
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:14,720
whatnot that comes out of that region is

1629
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:16,318
kind of like a 50 50 of thc to cbd

1630
00:56:14,719 --> 00:56:18,480
and i thought that's that's really

1631
00:56:16,318 --> 00:56:19,679
surprising do you

1632
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,960
like what do you think of that what do

1633
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:22,000
you make how do you think that really

1634
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,240
happened because i don't think many

1635
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,318
people would have predicted that

1636
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:28,558
yeah first of all i'm gonna uh tell you

1637
00:56:26,318 --> 00:56:31,838
like why i think that is the case and

1638
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:34,480
like how i got to that conclusion so

1639
00:56:31,838 --> 00:56:35,920
um there was somebody in europe uh

1640
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,199
who

1641
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:39,680
imported

1642
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:40,719
by you know however he managed it to

1643
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:43,838
import

1644
00:56:40,719 --> 00:56:45,838
some hash which was from malana okay and

1645
00:56:43,838 --> 00:56:47,519
that was tested and it came out to be

1646
00:56:45,838 --> 00:56:50,880
like 50 percent

1647
00:56:47,519 --> 00:56:52,880
thc and almost like nearly 50 cbd

1648
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:54,640
now you have to understand that if

1649
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,798
hash is coming from malana it's not

1650
00:56:54,639 --> 00:56:57,598
coming from one plant what you have

1651
00:56:56,798 --> 00:56:59,920
there

1652
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:03,359
is you have a small chunk taken out of a

1653
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:04,639
huge chunk that was made from

1654
00:57:03,358 --> 00:57:06,480
so many

1655
00:57:04,639 --> 00:57:08,639
different plants i mean if you were to

1656
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:10,480
do like a random sample

1657
00:57:08,639 --> 00:57:11,920
like you were doing an experiment that's

1658
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:14,000
exactly how it would be done you would

1659
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:16,079
just go about without discriminating

1660
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,838
amongst the plants you just say the

1661
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:19,440
first 50 plant that i encounter you know

1662
00:57:17,838 --> 00:57:21,440
i'm going to rub them and

1663
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,720
whatever the hash tells me is going to

1664
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:25,119
be the story is going to be the

1665
00:57:22,719 --> 00:57:25,919
phytochemical story of this population

1666
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:28,240
right

1667
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:30,318
so when that happened what we saw was

1668
00:57:28,239 --> 00:57:32,719
you see

1669
00:57:30,318 --> 00:57:34,558
you actually see a higher amount of cbd

1670
00:57:32,719 --> 00:57:37,358
by the way but it's still i mean almost

1671
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:39,200
equal it's like 60 40 kind of thing

1672
00:57:37,358 --> 00:57:41,279
and then there was another incident so

1673
00:57:39,199 --> 00:57:44,159
this was one incident the second

1674
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:46,559
isolated incident was i i gave some

1675
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:48,558
seeds to uh one of the guys who who grew

1676
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:50,160
it and he grew actually a few of them

1677
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:51,119
not just one or two

1678
00:57:50,159 --> 00:57:52,480
and

1679
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:54,480
this guy did something really

1680
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,519
interesting he did not see them and you

1681
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:58,079
know he

1682
00:57:55,519 --> 00:58:00,239
trimmed them and cured the buds and he

1683
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:02,240
smoked everything separately and he had

1684
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:03,598
mocked the plants and then he came back

1685
00:58:02,239 --> 00:58:06,159
to me and he

1686
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:09,119
he said he said it look it's weird but

1687
00:58:06,159 --> 00:58:11,279
here's the deal some of the plants uh

1688
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:13,519
you know have a great high

1689
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:15,040
and then these and some plant have mild

1690
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:17,519
high and there are some plants which

1691
00:58:15,039 --> 00:58:19,119
have no high at all no effects

1692
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:20,798
and they're like this

1693
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:22,559
they have all the trichomes they have

1694
00:58:20,798 --> 00:58:24,719
all the beautiful smells

1695
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:26,960
just like the other plants but they just

1696
00:58:24,719 --> 00:58:28,798
don't have any effects to them at all

1697
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:30,480
and that gets you thinking that what is

1698
00:58:28,798 --> 00:58:32,239
happening there so

1699
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:34,079
basically what you're seeing is you're

1700
00:58:32,239 --> 00:58:35,358
seeing resin on the plant so there has

1701
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:37,359
to be some

1702
00:58:35,358 --> 00:58:39,759
something some cannabinoid in it so if

1703
00:58:37,358 --> 00:58:42,719
it's not thc then what is it i mean the

1704
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:44,079
only more abundant cannabinoid that you

1705
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:45,919
know

1706
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:49,039
actually is present in the environment

1707
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:51,519
is cbd and i had already known from that

1708
00:58:49,039 --> 00:58:54,159
test that came from europe for that hash

1709
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:55,920
that was imported from india that a

1710
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:56,639
major part of the

1711
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,720
the

1712
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:59,920
you know the chemical composition is

1713
00:58:58,719 --> 00:59:02,399
cbd

1714
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:05,039
so if you just put these observation

1715
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:07,680
together and you know uh think in a you

1716
00:59:05,039 --> 00:59:10,400
know if in a reductive manner then you

1717
00:59:07,679 --> 00:59:11,199
all ultimately get to a conclusion that

1718
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,960
look

1719
00:59:11,199 --> 00:59:15,759
there seem to be this

1720
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:17,039
uh distribution of population among in a

1721
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:19,440
way that

1722
00:59:17,039 --> 00:59:22,159
there are plants which are purely uh you

1723
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:23,760
know making cbd and with that said they

1724
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:25,759
have certain amounts of thc i'm not

1725
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:27,839
trying to say that just zero

1726
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:29,440
uh thc there's some thc with

1727
00:59:27,838 --> 00:59:31,920
predominantly cbd and then you have

1728
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:34,559
plants which have a very uh

1729
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:36,559
nice balanced cbd and thc content which

1730
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:38,319
is close to 50 50 or you know just

1731
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:40,319
various combinations then you have

1732
00:59:38,318 --> 00:59:43,440
plants which are dominantly producing

1733
00:59:40,318 --> 00:59:46,719
thc and they're uh you know they produce

1734
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:49,440
very little cbd so what you see in

1735
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:51,358
nature is i mean milana that you seem to

1736
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:52,599
have these three varieties and their

1737
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:54,159
intermix they're getting

1738
00:59:52,599 --> 00:59:54,960
cross-pollinated

1739
00:59:54,159 --> 00:59:56,239
so

1740
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:58,400
uh

1741
00:59:56,239 --> 01:00:00,399
the population or the dominance of the

1742
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:02,880
population you know it works out in a

1743
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:05,760
random fashion so what you see is the

1744
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:08,798
the dominant genome sorry the chemotype

1745
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:12,000
is the one that produces cbd and it's

1746
01:00:08,798 --> 01:00:14,480
nthc and i actually fell back to one of

1747
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,719
the studies that happened in 2003 i

1748
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:18,240
think it was from america

1749
01:00:16,719 --> 01:00:20,159
somebody did an experiment he took a

1750
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:22,399
drug variety and he took a non-drug

1751
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:24,639
variety which is a hampy cross them

1752
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:26,838
and what he saw in f1 was

1753
01:00:24,639 --> 01:00:29,598
you know from the heterogeneous

1754
01:00:26,838 --> 01:00:31,440
population he saw that

1755
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:33,440
most of the plants

1756
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:36,798
carried a co-dominant expression which

1757
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:39,119
was thc and cbd and about like 25

1758
01:00:36,798 --> 01:00:40,639
percent of the plants close to 25

1759
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:43,519
percent of the plants with cbd and close

1760
01:00:40,639 --> 01:00:46,480
to 25 percent were thc so it was almost

1761
01:00:43,519 --> 01:00:48,960
like a one ratio ratio one in f1 and and

1762
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:50,960
that tells you something that if these

1763
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:52,480
populations are led to mix and

1764
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:54,880
intermingle then

1765
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:57,039
which chemotype would eventually

1766
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,960
be more dominant and which would be a

1767
01:00:57,039 --> 01:01:00,719
little more recessive in nature and

1768
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:02,480
that's exactly uh you know what we're

1769
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:04,399
seeing in malana when we

1770
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:06,960
isolate these plants and you know grow

1771
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,720
them separately and you know

1772
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:10,880
take out resin separately and sample

1773
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:12,639
them because that is just not a thing

1774
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:14,720
that's going to happen in milan i mean

1775
01:01:12,639 --> 01:01:16,480
you can't get people to just rub one

1776
01:01:14,719 --> 01:01:19,118
single plant and you know give you the

1777
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:21,440
hash and then a different plant although

1778
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:23,680
we are going to try to

1779
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:25,200
make that happen uh this year we're

1780
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:27,440
hoping we're hoping that we're gonna

1781
01:01:25,199 --> 01:01:29,118
make this uh you know happen

1782
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:31,280
uh but it's gonna be difficult because

1783
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:33,599
it's hard to find you know plants big

1784
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:36,160
enough that you could just rub and make

1785
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:39,200
a tangible amount of uh resin to sample

1786
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:41,519
for five to six people so we'll see if

1787
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:43,358
we can work it uh

1788
01:01:41,519 --> 01:01:45,199
that way then if i can get some of the

1789
01:01:43,358 --> 01:01:46,480
samples out for testing as well and i

1790
01:01:45,199 --> 01:01:48,798
can have

1791
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:50,639
uh i can have the testing done from one

1792
01:01:48,798 --> 01:01:53,039
single source to really get a

1793
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:56,318
comprehensive report which can be you

1794
01:01:53,039 --> 01:01:58,400
know taken a little more seriously

1795
01:01:56,318 --> 01:02:00,159
yeah that's a cool little goal for this

1796
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:02,000
next coming year

1797
01:02:00,159 --> 01:02:04,879
i guess the question that comes to mind

1798
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:07,760
for me is why do you think we see this

1799
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:08,640
strong occurrence of cbd in this type of

1800
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:11,520
hash

1801
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:15,199
compared to say afghani hash where we

1802
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:15,199
just see it's primarily thc

1803
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:21,680
i think that the answer lies in the way

1804
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:23,519
human beings have uh you know interacted

1805
01:02:21,679 --> 01:02:25,358
with the cannabis plant

1806
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:27,920
a big part of that is

1807
01:02:25,358 --> 01:02:30,159
the way they have been domesticated so

1808
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:32,639
if we just rewind a little bit and let's

1809
01:02:30,159 --> 01:02:35,358
just start from a time when human beings

1810
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:37,759
are not really uh aware that you know

1811
01:02:35,358 --> 01:02:39,440
cannabis is something that they need

1812
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:41,359
uh as a plan and it has so many you know

1813
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:43,358
beneficial properties and such a

1814
01:02:41,358 --> 01:02:45,279
wonderful thing to be around i'm sorry

1815
01:02:43,358 --> 01:02:47,279
just give me one moment

1816
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:50,400
i'm sorry so

1817
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:52,079
once uh that happens once a community

1818
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,760
let's say let's take an example of hindu

1819
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:55,599
kush that's a community in hindu she

1820
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:57,119
realizes that hey this is a great plant

1821
01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:59,519
this is growing

1822
01:02:57,119 --> 01:03:01,760
around us and you know it has certain

1823
01:02:59,519 --> 01:03:04,000
properties and it's really cool so what

1824
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:05,680
they do is they take that plant and they

1825
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,199
bring it

1826
01:03:05,679 --> 01:03:09,440
to their surroundings where they grow

1827
01:03:07,199 --> 01:03:11,279
other useful plants like tomatoes or you

1828
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:13,119
know coriander or anything else that

1829
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:14,720
they grow over there and they would

1830
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:16,480
start cultivating it

1831
01:03:14,719 --> 01:03:19,519
along with it so eventually what's going

1832
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:21,599
to happen is some physiological changes

1833
01:03:19,519 --> 01:03:24,159
would be observed over time because of

1834
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:25,200
you know the frequency of the nutrient

1835
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:26,318
uh

1836
01:03:25,199 --> 01:03:28,639
you know

1837
01:03:26,318 --> 01:03:30,558
increasing and you know the plant would

1838
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:32,798
eventually accommodate to those changes

1839
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:34,240
and become vigorous right would increase

1840
01:03:32,798 --> 01:03:36,239
the surface level

1841
01:03:34,239 --> 01:03:38,239
surface area of the leaf

1842
01:03:36,239 --> 01:03:41,519
uh the stem is going to become more

1843
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:43,519
rigid instead of the spindly spindly one

1844
01:03:41,519 --> 01:03:46,159
and it would of course produce more

1845
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:48,159
because of all those changes uh

1846
01:03:46,159 --> 01:03:49,440
present in the plant eventually

1847
01:03:48,159 --> 01:03:51,358
so

1848
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:53,920
the domestication that happened in hindu

1849
01:03:51,358 --> 01:03:57,838
kush basically that happened around the

1850
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:59,680
recreation part because i don't think in

1851
01:03:57,838 --> 01:04:01,599
out of the plants i don't think they

1852
01:03:59,679 --> 01:04:03,598
were domesticated those domesticating

1853
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:06,000
those plants so they could you know take

1854
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:07,280
out seeds and make chutney out of that i

1855
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,280
don't think those things were happening

1856
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:10,640
over there what i really think was

1857
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:13,280
happening there was that they had

1858
01:04:10,639 --> 01:04:15,358
realized that this plant has an amazing

1859
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:18,240
capacity to produce

1860
01:04:15,358 --> 01:04:19,598
uh you know substances which are just

1861
01:04:18,239 --> 01:04:21,199
amazing like

1862
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:22,960
you know it could take you into a

1863
01:04:21,199 --> 01:04:24,719
different realm altogether and you know

1864
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:26,880
for someone who's more religious he

1865
01:04:24,719 --> 01:04:29,279
could associate it in a way that hey

1866
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:31,280
this could be spiritual you know and it

1867
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:33,920
it brings me closer to god

1868
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:35,839
so for those reasons i think most of the

1869
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:37,838
domestication that happened in the kush

1870
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:39,199
that happened around the recreation part

1871
01:04:37,838 --> 01:04:40,960
they were more

1872
01:04:39,199 --> 01:04:43,838
inclined towards

1873
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:47,440
you know cultivating the plants which

1874
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:49,038
which had a more significant effect on

1875
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:51,280
our cognition

1876
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:54,079
rather than a selecting plant which

1877
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:56,640
looked to be more beneficial or add like

1878
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:59,599
more stem to it or you know

1879
01:04:56,639 --> 01:05:02,159
larger leaves or whatever but once you

1880
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:04,079
come to like you know southeast asia or

1881
01:05:02,159 --> 01:05:05,519
central asia it's a whole different

1882
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:08,480
thing central asia is in the north

1883
01:05:05,519 --> 01:05:09,838
indian part of central asia it's a whole

1884
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:11,760
different thing what's happening there

1885
01:05:09,838 --> 01:05:14,159
is first of all you look at the plant

1886
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:16,000
the plant has a different uh you know

1887
01:05:14,159 --> 01:05:18,239
morphological structure

1888
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,400
uh how does it differ from the afghani

1889
01:05:18,239 --> 01:05:21,598
variety well the way it differs is much

1890
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:23,358
taller

1891
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:25,760
and it's

1892
01:05:23,358 --> 01:05:27,759
and flowers for a little longer but when

1893
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:30,160
you look at the leaves uh you know

1894
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:32,880
closely at a domesticated variety let's

1895
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:34,879
say from uh you know malana what you see

1896
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:36,400
is the leaves are not narrow they are

1897
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:38,240
actually pretty broad they are actually

1898
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:40,798
pretty broad leaves

1899
01:05:38,239 --> 01:05:41,759
it's just that the plant grows in a way

1900
01:05:40,798 --> 01:05:43,679
that

1901
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:46,079
when you look at the overall plant you

1902
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:47,759
cannot say that it's a broad leaf

1903
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:49,039
variety because it does not have the

1904
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:50,880
other characteristics which will

1905
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:52,480
correspond to that

1906
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:54,400
so

1907
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:56,798
basically i mean

1908
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:58,960
same thing is happening in the equation

1909
01:05:56,798 --> 01:06:00,400
the same thing is happening in uh malana

1910
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:02,400
but what is the difference now the

1911
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:04,240
difference is that in milan or in india

1912
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:06,160
or southeast asia people are selecting

1913
01:06:04,239 --> 01:06:07,439
for various traits and not just for

1914
01:06:06,159 --> 01:06:10,159
recreation

1915
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:11,920
they're selecting the plants because

1916
01:06:10,159 --> 01:06:13,440
they want to make ropes out of it they

1917
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:15,280
want to they're selecting those plants

1918
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:17,280
because they want to be able to you know

1919
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:20,960
use that fiber or

1920
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:22,000
those you know thick stems or uh

1921
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:23,838
you know

1922
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,039
yeah thick stems for a shelter or

1923
01:06:23,838 --> 01:06:27,599
something right

1924
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:30,240
so those changes ultimately led to the

1925
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:32,000
way the those plants are i mean they

1926
01:06:30,239 --> 01:06:33,358
have like a hemp like a hemp-like

1927
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,838
structure and

1928
01:06:33,358 --> 01:06:37,838
basically they are not as potent not

1929
01:06:35,838 --> 01:06:40,318
nearly as potent as any of the afghani

1930
01:06:37,838 --> 01:06:41,440
varieties and i think the biggest

1931
01:06:40,318 --> 01:06:43,599
difference

1932
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:44,838
uh that i mean the

1933
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:47,359
the difference

1934
01:06:44,838 --> 01:06:48,480
between uh you know having a variety

1935
01:06:47,358 --> 01:06:51,519
which is

1936
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:53,358
very potent and not very potent is the

1937
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:55,759
way they were domesticated by human

1938
01:06:53,358 --> 01:06:58,480
beings and what they domesticated them

1939
01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:00,559
for i mean that's what the embodiment of

1940
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:02,480
the plants show with of course

1941
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:03,760
a lot of feature has to do a lot with

1942
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:05,838
the environment as well but i think

1943
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:07,920
we'll get to that later but just for the

1944
01:07:05,838 --> 01:07:10,639
domestication part and from the part

1945
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:13,358
that you said uh why a certain variety

1946
01:07:10,639 --> 01:07:15,440
seem to have you know uh much more

1947
01:07:13,358 --> 01:07:17,038
intense effect than the other one then i

1948
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:18,639
think that really is the answer the

1949
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:21,119
answer lies in the way they have been

1950
01:07:18,639 --> 01:07:23,118
domesticated from the earliest time

1951
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:25,838
and the people and the communities which

1952
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:29,119
have engaged with those plants

1953
01:07:25,838 --> 01:07:31,279
yeah what a fantastic answer so

1954
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:34,240
it makes me think then

1955
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:36,480
do you think that maybe this selection

1956
01:07:34,239 --> 01:07:38,798
for a bit more of those hemp traits like

1957
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:41,119
what we mentioned in the south southeast

1958
01:07:38,798 --> 01:07:43,119
asian region do you think that how they

1959
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:45,280
did select for those other traits such

1960
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:46,318
as the fibrous characteristics and

1961
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:49,039
whatnot

1962
01:07:46,318 --> 01:07:51,519
added to why these plants perceived as

1963
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:54,160
having a more uplifting high or do you

1964
01:07:51,519 --> 01:07:56,480
think the uplifting versus sedating

1965
01:07:54,159 --> 01:07:59,440
component was almost independent of that

1966
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:59,440
type of selection

1967
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:04,000
um i i think they have not really

1968
01:08:02,798 --> 01:08:06,239
selected for the effects very

1969
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,400
specifically uh i mean that could be

1970
01:08:06,239 --> 01:08:11,038
something which is just innate to the

1971
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:13,200
plant that a certain type of plant

1972
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:14,880
uh i think it could have something to do

1973
01:08:13,199 --> 01:08:17,039
with the environment because what you

1974
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:18,719
usually see and i don't necessarily

1975
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:21,759
subscribe to the idea that you know the

1976
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:24,039
narrow leaf varieties would always have

1977
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:26,798
or necessarily have an uplifting high

1978
01:08:24,039 --> 01:08:28,319
energy variety or a short

1979
01:08:26,798 --> 01:08:30,880
you know short flowering variety would

1980
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:32,080
always have sedating effects i i think

1981
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:33,759
it uh

1982
01:08:32,079 --> 01:08:36,318
it's not that black and white first of

1983
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:37,679
all but yeah even to a large part if you

1984
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:39,920
feel i mean

1985
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:42,239
that is the case which we see to a large

1986
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:43,600
extent it is then i think that is that's

1987
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:45,278
a byproduct of

1988
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,960
uh more like the environment that they

1989
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:48,319
grow in i think and i don't really

1990
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:49,920
understand i'm not trying to say that i

1991
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:53,440
do understand that

1992
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:55,759
uh but i would i would lean more towards

1993
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:58,158
the environmental you know factors which

1994
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:59,838
may have contributing in the uh

1995
01:08:58,158 --> 01:09:02,399
you know in the way

1996
01:08:59,838 --> 01:09:05,119
the uh the plan makes you feel and i'll

1997
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:07,278
give you a one example i mean that might

1998
01:09:05,119 --> 01:09:09,838
make you understand that why i'm leaning

1999
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:12,960
towards more environmental factors and

2000
01:09:09,838 --> 01:09:14,479
that is the quality of the resin so

2001
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:16,319
when you go to a

2002
01:09:14,479 --> 01:09:18,238
when you go to a region you know that's

2003
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:21,440
that has a very dry climate and the

2004
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:24,238
brain is very scarce it's it's very arid

2005
01:09:21,439 --> 01:09:26,798
and cold what you see is the trichomes

2006
01:09:24,238 --> 01:09:28,639
have a very dry texture on the outside i

2007
01:09:26,798 --> 01:09:31,439
mean they they're not very sticky i mean

2008
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:32,640
you really have to you know uh

2009
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:34,318
i mean

2010
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:36,798
what do you you really have to touch

2011
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:38,480
them to break them apart you know i mean

2012
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:39,519
you can't just touch them and expect

2013
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:42,000
that you know

2014
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:42,880
like a jelly like like a saliva like you

2015
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,798
know

2016
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:47,039
thing would happen as you you know touch

2017
01:09:44,798 --> 01:09:48,719
the resin because it's just not sticky

2018
01:09:47,039 --> 01:09:50,238
but on the other hand when you go to

2019
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:52,319
places which are like which have a

2020
01:09:50,238 --> 01:09:54,238
subtropical or a tropical environment

2021
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:56,239
where rain is prevalent and it's really

2022
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:58,000
wet during the flowering what do you see

2023
01:09:56,238 --> 01:09:59,039
what you see is that the resin has a

2024
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:02,560
very

2025
01:09:59,039 --> 01:10:05,039
um gluey sticky texture and you know it

2026
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:07,120
makes perfect sense you know because

2027
01:10:05,039 --> 01:10:08,880
in in a situation where it's constantly

2028
01:10:07,119 --> 01:10:11,039
raining while your plant isn't flowering

2029
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:13,359
what you would want is your plant to

2030
01:10:11,039 --> 01:10:15,920
have a very sticky kind of resin so that

2031
01:10:13,359 --> 01:10:18,799
the water does not hold on in between

2032
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:21,359
them and it just you know slides right

2033
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:23,520
through the buds because that is really

2034
01:10:21,359 --> 01:10:25,519
going to help you mitigate those

2035
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:27,280
uh environmental risk i mean apart from

2036
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:30,400
that there are certain you know innate

2037
01:10:27,279 --> 01:10:32,639
qualities in plants which make them of

2038
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:35,119
course resistant to things like mold and

2039
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:37,760
mildew and all these factors but

2040
01:10:35,119 --> 01:10:39,439
the parent physical traits some of the

2041
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:41,360
apparent physical traits are also there

2042
01:10:39,439 --> 01:10:43,279
which you can see as the adaptations in

2043
01:10:41,359 --> 01:10:44,479
the plants because of the environment

2044
01:10:43,279 --> 01:10:45,439
they grow in

2045
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:47,279
and now

2046
01:10:45,439 --> 01:10:48,960
we're talking about the texture of the

2047
01:10:47,279 --> 01:10:51,119
resin i mean we're talking about the

2048
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:52,880
thing that actually induces the

2049
01:10:51,119 --> 01:10:55,439
uh you know the psychological changes

2050
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:58,319
when you smoke it so if

2051
01:10:55,439 --> 01:11:00,559
the texture of that thing is dictated

2052
01:10:58,319 --> 01:11:02,799
pretty much by the environment to grow

2053
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:04,400
in then it's only reasonable to believe

2054
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:05,440
that you could take it a step further

2055
01:11:04,399 --> 01:11:08,479
and you know

2056
01:11:05,439 --> 01:11:10,960
it probably transcends into you know the

2057
01:11:08,479 --> 01:11:12,718
effects as well and

2058
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:14,880
but again i'm not going to say that

2059
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:17,359
that's the case or i understand that but

2060
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:19,679
that's what i feel about it

2061
01:11:17,359 --> 01:11:21,920
no that makes a lot of sense and it

2062
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:24,640
perfectly segues into my next question

2063
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:26,640
which is that we often hear this idea

2064
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:28,800
expressed about let's just say you're in

2065
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:30,560
some region and you smoke some of the

2066
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:32,560
herb and it's it's brilliant and you're

2067
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:34,960
able to get some of the seeds people

2068
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:36,640
would often say that if you take that

2069
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:38,399
back to where you come from let's assume

2070
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:40,480
you're from a different country you go

2071
01:11:38,399 --> 01:11:42,879
back to where you're from if you grow it

2072
01:11:40,479 --> 01:11:44,718
out say indoors or just under some quite

2073
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:46,159
controlled conditions it's just not

2074
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:47,840
going to be the same you know because it

2075
01:11:46,158 --> 01:11:50,158
was all about the terroir and the

2076
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:52,480
environment do you think that's the case

2077
01:11:50,158 --> 01:11:54,238
like if i get some really nice bud from

2078
01:11:52,479 --> 01:11:56,319
india am i never going to be able to

2079
01:11:54,238 --> 01:11:58,879
reproduce it even with the seeds in

2080
01:11:56,319 --> 01:12:01,599
australia for example

2081
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:02,480
i i think what's contributing to that

2082
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:04,480
sort of

2083
01:12:02,479 --> 01:12:06,559
thinking is a few different factors and

2084
01:12:04,479 --> 01:12:08,479
i'm just going to like lay it out here

2085
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:10,159
um i think the first and the foremost

2086
01:12:08,479 --> 01:12:12,158
thing is that we have to understand if

2087
01:12:10,158 --> 01:12:13,920
you're in a place like india where it

2088
01:12:12,158 --> 01:12:15,839
grows naturally let's let's take an

2089
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:18,560
example uh let's take the example of

2090
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:20,400
malana because it's a known place right

2091
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:22,640
so if you're in a place and you find a

2092
01:12:20,399 --> 01:12:24,399
plant oh this is a great plant you know

2093
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:27,280
i would love to grow this plant when i

2094
01:12:24,399 --> 01:12:29,359
go back home to us or australia wherever

2095
01:12:27,279 --> 01:12:31,679
and you take out seeds but you don't

2096
01:12:29,359 --> 01:12:34,399
know which males went on to you know

2097
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:36,880
pollinate that plant but apart from that

2098
01:12:34,399 --> 01:12:38,319
what you're looking at is not a true

2099
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:40,480
breeding variety they're not true

2100
01:12:38,319 --> 01:12:41,679
breeding in nature so that means they

2101
01:12:40,479 --> 01:12:43,519
are not

2102
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:44,719
homozygous for all the traits you're

2103
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:46,400
seeing in them and that's one of the

2104
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:48,800
reasons why you see so much variability

2105
01:12:46,399 --> 01:12:50,639
in the field i mean when you look at 100

2106
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:52,400
plants and like they're like 35

2107
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:53,600
different kinds in 100 plants then you

2108
01:12:52,399 --> 01:12:56,158
understand when there's a lot of

2109
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:57,840
variability in terms of genotype right

2110
01:12:56,158 --> 01:12:59,359
so it becomes really hard to find that

2111
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:01,600
plant that's one of the things because

2112
01:12:59,359 --> 01:13:02,880
it's not being you know bred by someone

2113
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:05,360
it's not being narrowed down or

2114
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:07,119
bottlenecked they just emerge as like

2115
01:13:05,359 --> 01:13:08,238
one-off plant that you may encounter and

2116
01:13:07,119 --> 01:13:10,640
may like

2117
01:13:08,238 --> 01:13:12,559
now the second thing is uh the question

2118
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:15,440
that you asked that is it all about the

2119
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:18,640
terroir is it going to be the same well

2120
01:13:15,439 --> 01:13:20,319
of course terror plays a pivotal role in

2121
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:22,320
the way your plant is going to look for

2122
01:13:20,319 --> 01:13:24,319
example if your grow room is too hot i

2123
01:13:22,319 --> 01:13:26,639
mean you know your plant is going to

2124
01:13:24,319 --> 01:13:27,759
look like [ __ ] pretty much right and if

2125
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:29,440
you have

2126
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:32,480
if you have a colder environment in your

2127
01:13:29,439 --> 01:13:34,639
room which is around 22 24 to 20 degrees

2128
01:13:32,479 --> 01:13:36,238
celsius then you know your plants can

2129
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:38,239
pretty much have a very good time even

2130
01:13:36,238 --> 01:13:40,158
if there are some other deficits

2131
01:13:38,238 --> 01:13:42,479
plant would still do much better so we

2132
01:13:40,158 --> 01:13:43,599
understand that even in real time i mean

2133
01:13:42,479 --> 01:13:45,759
you know

2134
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:48,320
the plant reacts to the environment it's

2135
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:50,719
in and it's try to mitigate those things

2136
01:13:48,319 --> 01:13:52,399
by you know expressing itself in a way

2137
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:54,319
that it could just

2138
01:13:52,399 --> 01:13:56,000
get through this somehow and produce

2139
01:13:54,319 --> 01:13:57,439
flowers and make seeds because at the

2140
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,760
end we have to understand the plant is

2141
01:13:57,439 --> 01:14:01,439
not working for us okay the plot is

2142
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:02,480
working for itself it wants to make

2143
01:14:01,439 --> 01:14:05,519
seats

2144
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:07,839
it wants to reproduce and that's it so

2145
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:09,440
now it's up to us uh you know that we

2146
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:10,560
have to save it from the mail and you

2147
01:14:09,439 --> 01:14:12,238
know uh

2148
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:15,199
you know make it sound similar or like

2149
01:14:12,238 --> 01:14:17,039
whatever we want to do but again we have

2150
01:14:15,198 --> 01:14:19,359
to understand that the environment while

2151
01:14:17,039 --> 01:14:22,238
it's having an impact on the plant it's

2152
01:14:19,359 --> 01:14:24,479
not so deep that it would change the

2153
01:14:22,238 --> 01:14:26,238
characteristic in a way that you'll not

2154
01:14:24,479 --> 01:14:27,759
be able to recognize it and i'm going to

2155
01:14:26,238 --> 01:14:29,198
give you an example for that let's just

2156
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:31,280
say that you went to kerala and you

2157
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:32,479
collected some seeds now we all

2158
01:14:31,279 --> 01:14:34,238
understand these are equatorial

2159
01:14:32,479 --> 01:14:36,399
varieties and you know they flower for a

2160
01:14:34,238 --> 01:14:39,279
very long time around 16 to 18 or even

2161
01:14:36,399 --> 01:14:41,279
20 weeks sometimes it's rare but they do

2162
01:14:39,279 --> 01:14:44,000
anyways so you bring that back and you

2163
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:46,399
you you grow inside your house so

2164
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:48,719
what you may see is that you might just

2165
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:51,039
see that you have slightly broader

2166
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:52,880
leaves because your indoor grow room or

2167
01:14:51,039 --> 01:14:54,800
your outside condition may be a little

2168
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:55,679
colder you know you so you might see

2169
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:56,480
that

2170
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:58,319
but

2171
01:14:56,479 --> 01:15:00,559
you're not gonna see that a kerala plant

2172
01:14:58,319 --> 01:15:02,639
is gonna finish in eight weeks that is

2173
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:05,360
not gonna happen i mean a change of that

2174
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:06,880
magnitude would never happen

2175
01:15:05,359 --> 01:15:08,880
that is one thing

2176
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:11,679
and then the other thing is that are you

2177
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:13,279
able to find the very specific bud or

2178
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:14,960
the flower or the flavor that you're

2179
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:17,840
looking at now in time in terms of

2180
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:19,760
flavor you can get lucky because flavors

2181
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:21,679
even in you know

2182
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:23,920
even in the population which have great

2183
01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:26,239
variability i mean you know the flavor

2184
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:28,719
seems to be pretty homogenous i don't

2185
01:15:26,238 --> 01:15:31,279
know for what reason but it is so yeah

2186
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:33,198
you can have uh you know you can find

2187
01:15:31,279 --> 01:15:35,359
the flavor within a relatively small

2188
01:15:33,198 --> 01:15:37,759
population but if you really want to

2189
01:15:35,359 --> 01:15:39,599
find the same plant

2190
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:41,600
there is no guarantee and if somebody's

2191
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:43,199
like offering you seed by saying that i

2192
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:46,400
mean well then you should be very

2193
01:15:43,198 --> 01:15:47,759
skeptical of that person as well

2194
01:15:46,399 --> 01:15:48,960
i can definitely agree with that

2195
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:51,679
sentiment

2196
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:53,359
so i want to ask a little bit because i

2197
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:55,039
mean i'm the first one to admit i could

2198
01:15:53,359 --> 01:15:57,559
probably be a bit more educated about

2199
01:15:55,039 --> 01:16:00,158
this but what's your take on

2200
01:15:57,560 --> 01:16:02,159
classifications because i know that

2201
01:16:00,158 --> 01:16:03,920
you're not particularly into the whole

2202
01:16:02,158 --> 01:16:06,399
city of indica thing because as you said

2203
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:08,480
it's just not so clear-cut how do you

2204
01:16:06,399 --> 01:16:10,639
try to classify plants and as a little

2205
01:16:08,479 --> 01:16:12,479
follow-up how would you describe most

2206
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:14,239
indian varieties i've heard that they're

2207
01:16:12,479 --> 01:16:16,000
more kind of uplifting how would you

2208
01:16:14,238 --> 01:16:16,959
describe them

2209
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,880
okay

2210
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:21,039
yeah so i mean before i really get down

2211
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:23,840
to the classification part first of all

2212
01:16:21,039 --> 01:16:25,679
uh i'm going to speak briefly about you

2213
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:27,920
know what exactly is the problem with

2214
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:29,359
the current nomenclature that you know

2215
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:32,079
you seem to use

2216
01:16:29,359 --> 01:16:33,759
so the individual thing i mean i i now

2217
01:16:32,079 --> 01:16:35,920
i'm hearing a lot of people you know

2218
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:37,360
they they're uh they're trying to say

2219
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:38,880
that hey you know this india sativa

2220
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:41,439
thing doesn't seem to work i mean the

2221
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:42,800
distinction is not you know great enough

2222
01:16:41,439 --> 01:16:44,319
and then there are a lot of plants in

2223
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:47,039
between so you don't really know what to

2224
01:16:44,319 --> 01:16:48,399
call them so people are you know the

2225
01:16:47,039 --> 01:16:50,079
more they get exposed to different

2226
01:16:48,399 --> 01:16:52,879
varieties more they would understand

2227
01:16:50,079 --> 01:16:55,198
that how these uh you know labels are

2228
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:57,520
just not gonna be enough to encapsulate

2229
01:16:55,198 --> 01:17:00,479
the whole idea of this plant

2230
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:03,120
now very particularly fails is i think

2231
01:17:00,479 --> 01:17:05,439
in the settings that where people have

2232
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:07,359
not been who are using these words so

2233
01:17:05,439 --> 01:17:09,279
let's just say somebody and i'm just

2234
01:17:07,359 --> 01:17:11,519
giving an example right so let's just

2235
01:17:09,279 --> 01:17:13,920
say for example and someone in america

2236
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:15,679
says today says one day

2237
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:18,319
i'm going to call

2238
01:17:15,679 --> 01:17:20,399
all the cannabis plants with narrow leaf

2239
01:17:18,319 --> 01:17:22,399
sativa and everything that grows with

2240
01:17:20,399 --> 01:17:25,039
broad leaf and stay short you know

2241
01:17:22,399 --> 01:17:26,559
subsequently i'm going to call it indica

2242
01:17:25,039 --> 01:17:28,079
and he's like okay that's perfect

2243
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:30,159
because that's all i see i see narrow

2244
01:17:28,079 --> 01:17:32,238
leaf plants and i see broad leaf blonde

2245
01:17:30,158 --> 01:17:34,000
but that's really his

2246
01:17:32,238 --> 01:17:36,238
world i mean i mean it's not other

2247
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,920
people's really far that you have never

2248
01:17:36,238 --> 01:17:39,519
gone out of your house or you've never

2249
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:41,520
gone over your country right and you've

2250
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:45,040
never seen that you know there's more

2251
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:47,040
exist in the world so from that person's

2252
01:17:45,039 --> 01:17:49,279
perspective it's perfectly okay and you

2253
01:17:47,039 --> 01:17:51,840
know the system seemed to work okay

2254
01:17:49,279 --> 01:17:54,000
up to a point where other people start

2255
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:56,159
to come in and you know they start

2256
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,600
sending in all these varieties and what

2257
01:17:56,158 --> 01:17:59,279
you see is

2258
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:01,360
uh you see narrow leaf blonde that

2259
01:17:59,279 --> 01:18:03,039
finish faster like you know what you

2260
01:18:01,359 --> 01:18:04,880
would expect from an indica and then you

2261
01:18:03,039 --> 01:18:07,039
have you know broadly really broadly

2262
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:08,880
planned that would go on to flower like

2263
01:18:07,039 --> 01:18:10,880
13 to 14 weeks

2264
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:13,920
and that's when you begin to

2265
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:16,159
think that hey is it really i mean uh is

2266
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:18,960
it really sufficient the sativa indica

2267
01:18:16,158 --> 01:18:21,198
level to you know capture the whole idea

2268
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:23,439
and clearly the answer is no it's not i

2269
01:18:21,198 --> 01:18:26,559
mean at the lea at the best it creates

2270
01:18:23,439 --> 01:18:27,919
confusion and nothing else now another

2271
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:30,080
problem with

2272
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:31,279
that kind of uh labeling is that when

2273
01:18:30,079 --> 01:18:32,559
you go to

2274
01:18:31,279 --> 01:18:34,800
i'll give you i'll give you an example

2275
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:36,400
of kashmir if you go to palwama

2276
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:38,400
so what you're going to see is there are

2277
01:18:36,399 --> 01:18:41,119
farm population which are being farmed

2278
01:18:38,399 --> 01:18:42,079
by the farmers right domesticated ones

2279
01:18:41,119 --> 01:18:43,679
and

2280
01:18:42,079 --> 01:18:46,238
just on the vicinity what you're gonna

2281
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:47,920
see is there a lot of wild population

2282
01:18:46,238 --> 01:18:50,718
untamed population which is just growing

2283
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:52,960
like wheat and nobody is stopping those

2284
01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:56,000
two varieties from interacting with each

2285
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:58,239
other and then you see a third variety

2286
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:00,158
is stemming from that interaction that

2287
01:18:58,238 --> 01:19:03,439
is an intermediate variety between those

2288
01:19:00,158 --> 01:19:05,679
two so how do you account for that

2289
01:19:03,439 --> 01:19:07,519
i mean it's hard it's hard to account

2290
01:19:05,679 --> 01:19:10,560
for it so

2291
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:13,360
that label sort of like fails us

2292
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:15,440
in like so many ways you know that i

2293
01:19:13,359 --> 01:19:18,639
just don't feel comfortable using it

2294
01:19:15,439 --> 01:19:20,799
because i often get to points where

2295
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:22,560
i just feel that this is not enough so

2296
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:24,239
what i did as a solution because you

2297
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:25,679
just can't complain about it right you

2298
01:19:24,238 --> 01:19:26,879
have to do something about it if you

2299
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:29,679
don't like it

2300
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:33,760
so what i did was i i thought you know

2301
01:19:29,679 --> 01:19:36,000
this uh i i think uh

2302
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:38,000
i may be wrong but i think robert clark

2303
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,679
was the person who proposed that you

2304
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:42,158
know these should be labeled as broad

2305
01:19:39,679 --> 01:19:44,319
leaf and short leaf plants i'm sorry

2306
01:19:42,158 --> 01:19:47,279
narrow leaf plants which

2307
01:19:44,319 --> 01:19:49,119
is good i find i find that uh you know

2308
01:19:47,279 --> 01:19:50,800
much better because first of all those

2309
01:19:49,119 --> 01:19:53,679
words are self-explanatory you don't

2310
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:56,079
need to tell someone what a narrow leaf

2311
01:19:53,679 --> 01:19:58,158
drug variety is it just explains itself

2312
01:19:56,079 --> 01:20:00,158
in itself and that's amazing you want it

2313
01:19:58,158 --> 01:20:02,639
to be simple now the second thing that

2314
01:20:00,158 --> 01:20:05,759
it does is that you know it effectively

2315
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:07,520
classifies those two plants that we are

2316
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:09,039
referring to a narrow leaf drug

2317
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:10,639
producing variety and then you could

2318
01:20:09,039 --> 01:20:13,039
have varieties which are narrow leaf and

2319
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:16,000
non-dog producing so it also accounts

2320
01:20:13,039 --> 01:20:18,000
for those varieties which is great

2321
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:20,399
but then again you run into a small

2322
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:22,960
problem and that small problem is

2323
01:20:20,399 --> 01:20:25,198
when you encounter varieties like

2324
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:27,119
let's say from northern kashmir which

2325
01:20:25,198 --> 01:20:29,599
are narrow leaf

2326
01:20:27,119 --> 01:20:32,800
but they flower very fast they in fact

2327
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:34,000
flower within 55 to 66 days

2328
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:36,560
then it

2329
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:38,560
seemed to uh that it then it seems like

2330
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:40,960
that there has to be a little more to

2331
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:43,600
that broad leaf narrow leaf section if

2332
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:45,279
you could well there is a

2333
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:46,800
very good answer to that so what i

2334
01:20:45,279 --> 01:20:47,840
thought was

2335
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:50,159
you could

2336
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:52,400
basically look at these plants and i'm

2337
01:20:50,158 --> 01:20:54,879
not i'm not talking about hybrids here

2338
01:20:52,399 --> 01:20:57,039
okay because those are like man-made

2339
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:59,039
you know uh combinations so we're just

2340
01:20:57,039 --> 01:21:01,119
talking about the naturally occurring

2341
01:20:59,039 --> 01:21:02,960
varieties and the varieties which were

2342
01:21:01,119 --> 01:21:05,439
derived later and domesticated in those

2343
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:08,079
regions and elsewhere okay

2344
01:21:05,439 --> 01:21:10,638
so what we can do is we can distribute

2345
01:21:08,079 --> 01:21:12,800
the world in basically four to five

2346
01:21:10,639 --> 01:21:16,400
different zones so initially i i did

2347
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:17,840
four zones and what i did was i thought

2348
01:21:16,399 --> 01:21:19,039
okay so i'm going to start from the

2349
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:21,920
equator

2350
01:21:19,039 --> 01:21:24,319
so what do i have is the thinnest leaves

2351
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:26,000
like needle-like leaves

2352
01:21:24,319 --> 01:21:27,279
in the plants which are growing near the

2353
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:30,880
equator

2354
01:21:27,279 --> 01:21:33,359
but they're also not at high altitudes i

2355
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:36,000
mean you can be like you know

2356
01:21:33,359 --> 01:21:38,479
column uh like colombia you know where

2357
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:40,000
you have highlands even though it's

2358
01:21:38,479 --> 01:21:42,000
pretty close to the equator not that

2359
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,760
close i think it's around 26 degrees not

2360
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,119
but still

2361
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:46,320
so but there are highlands so it's going

2362
01:21:45,119 --> 01:21:48,559
to affect the plant in a different way

2363
01:21:46,319 --> 01:21:50,479
so i thought okay pure first category is

2364
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:53,120
going to be the purely

2365
01:21:50,479 --> 01:21:55,678
um narrow leaf plants which grow in the

2366
01:21:53,119 --> 01:21:58,079
equator and i call them equatorial long

2367
01:21:55,679 --> 01:22:00,880
flowering varieties now what this does

2368
01:21:58,079 --> 01:22:03,039
is first of all it tells you about where

2369
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:04,400
that variety is coming from equatorial

2370
01:22:03,039 --> 01:22:06,719
you immediately know this is an

2371
01:22:04,399 --> 01:22:08,158
equatorial variety comes from equator

2372
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:10,399
the second thing you immediately

2373
01:22:08,158 --> 01:22:13,279
understand it's a long flowering variety

2374
01:22:10,399 --> 01:22:15,279
okay so an equatorial long flowering

2375
01:22:13,279 --> 01:22:17,119
variety now this is what i say that you

2376
01:22:15,279 --> 01:22:18,000
go around the equator anywhere in the

2377
01:22:17,119 --> 01:22:19,599
world

2378
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,520
and if you find a plant that is

2379
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:22,560
naturally growing or being domesticated

2380
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:24,560
around

2381
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:27,199
the equator it's going to have a very

2382
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:29,280
long plum period around like 14 to 16

2383
01:22:27,198 --> 01:22:31,039
weeks which is quintessential to the

2384
01:22:29,279 --> 01:22:32,719
cannabis varieties which have adapted

2385
01:22:31,039 --> 01:22:34,000
around those regions and it's going to

2386
01:22:32,719 --> 01:22:36,960
have narrow leaves because it's going to

2387
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:39,198
be hot and the plant would you know uh

2388
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:41,039
the way uh plant tend to mitigate that

2389
01:22:39,198 --> 01:22:42,399
is by you know reducing the surface area

2390
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:44,479
of the leaf

2391
01:22:42,399 --> 01:22:48,079
then we move on to the second

2392
01:22:44,479 --> 01:22:49,439
uh section the second classification was

2393
01:22:48,079 --> 01:22:52,960
um

2394
01:22:49,439 --> 01:22:54,799
highland long flowering zones so now if

2395
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:57,279
you come to places like colombia like i

2396
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:58,800
spoke about colombia or i would actually

2397
01:22:57,279 --> 01:23:01,439
like to talk about

2398
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:03,600
uh himachal pradesh or malana

2399
01:23:01,439 --> 01:23:06,559
because it's around the same

2400
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:09,280
latitude it's around like 29 30 uh

2401
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:11,920
degrees north right so again these

2402
01:23:09,279 --> 01:23:13,519
places are not very close to the equator

2403
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:16,000
but they're not very far away from the

2404
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:18,000
equator either but at the same time

2405
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:20,079
there is a very uh interesting

2406
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,920
characteristic attached to the second

2407
01:23:20,079 --> 01:23:23,920
second category that is that these are

2408
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:27,440
highlands these are the places which

2409
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:30,399
have altitude over 1 500 meters

2410
01:23:27,439 --> 01:23:32,399
so anything at any region that is below

2411
01:23:30,399 --> 01:23:34,238
33 degrees north and i will come back to

2412
01:23:32,399 --> 01:23:35,359
it why 33 degrees north i'll come back

2413
01:23:34,238 --> 01:23:37,759
to it later

2414
01:23:35,359 --> 01:23:40,639
any place that is 33 degrees

2415
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:42,960
which is below 33 degrees north or south

2416
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:45,039
of the equator and it has an altitude of

2417
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:47,520
1500 meters or above that would be

2418
01:23:45,039 --> 01:23:49,679
classified as a highland long flowering

2419
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:52,159
variety because when you go to these

2420
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:54,239
places what you see is you see a medium

2421
01:23:52,158 --> 01:23:56,719
long flowering varieties that it that

2422
01:23:54,238 --> 01:23:58,879
flowers just a tad bit

2423
01:23:56,719 --> 01:24:00,960
earlier than you know the equatorial

2424
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:02,239
ones so your kerala finishes around 16

2425
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:04,560
and your malana is going to be done

2426
01:24:02,238 --> 01:24:07,279
around like 12 13 so there will be about

2427
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:09,280
a month's difference okay

2428
01:24:07,279 --> 01:24:11,198
then we move on to the third category

2429
01:24:09,279 --> 01:24:12,800
and this is where uh you know things

2430
01:24:11,198 --> 01:24:14,799
will get really interesting and the

2431
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:17,760
third category is

2432
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:19,600
the areas which are high latitude

2433
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:21,920
short flowering zones

2434
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:24,880
now the word tells you that these all

2435
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:26,800
areas are situated in high latitudes

2436
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:28,880
and the plants that grow there are short

2437
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:31,440
flowering in nature

2438
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:34,639
so we're talking about places which are

2439
01:24:31,439 --> 01:24:37,039
33 degrees north or above them

2440
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:40,079
they seem to have a characteristic that

2441
01:24:37,039 --> 01:24:42,000
those varieties will finish faster

2442
01:24:40,079 --> 01:24:44,079
and they always tend to have bigger

2443
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,840
resin glands and like more copious

2444
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:46,800
coverage of resin

2445
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:49,600
which

2446
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:52,000
again makes you believe makes you uh you

2447
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:54,560
know think or believe that the colder

2448
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,760
environment has a direct relationship

2449
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:58,480
with you know

2450
01:24:55,760 --> 01:25:00,159
the the resin coverage or the production

2451
01:24:58,479 --> 01:25:02,559
of resin because when you go to the

2452
01:25:00,158 --> 01:25:04,960
places near equator where it's hot

2453
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:06,960
uh the resin is not never

2454
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:07,760
in copious amount and trichomes are

2455
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:08,960
really

2456
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:10,880
small

2457
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:12,639
which is exactly the opposite as you

2458
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:13,440
move to the high latitude regions where

2459
01:25:12,639 --> 01:25:14,880
it's

2460
01:25:13,439 --> 01:25:17,119
always really cold because you're in the

2461
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:18,639
higher latitudes so

2462
01:25:17,119 --> 01:25:20,960
the varieties tend to have these

2463
01:25:18,639 --> 01:25:23,039
characteristics and the last one is high

2464
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:24,639
latitude highlands so there are some

2465
01:25:23,039 --> 01:25:26,560
highlands within the high latitude

2466
01:25:24,639 --> 01:25:28,480
because the third category that we spoke

2467
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:31,039
about high latitude short flowering zone

2468
01:25:28,479 --> 01:25:33,919
that was for all the places which are

2469
01:25:31,039 --> 01:25:36,238
below 1500 meters in altitude but above

2470
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:38,158
33 degrees north so they still have a

2471
01:25:36,238 --> 01:25:40,158
significant short season and the

2472
01:25:38,158 --> 01:25:41,759
varieties tend to finish around like

2473
01:25:40,158 --> 01:25:43,920
eight to nine weeks but

2474
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:46,320
uh or around like 10 weeks sorry and

2475
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:48,480
then you go to a different region you

2476
01:25:46,319 --> 01:25:51,039
know which is highland but it's again

2477
01:25:48,479 --> 01:25:54,000
situated above 33 degrees now now things

2478
01:25:51,039 --> 01:25:56,639
really get interesting here because not

2479
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:58,719
only those places are going to be cold

2480
01:25:56,639 --> 01:26:00,719
you know that those places are going to

2481
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:03,840
get the snowfall right around the end of

2482
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:05,600
november around the end of october or

2483
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:08,239
the beginning of november

2484
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:10,000
because one they are so higher up in

2485
01:26:08,238 --> 01:26:12,799
latitude i mean they're above 33 degrees

2486
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:15,520
of north secondly there is 1500 meters

2487
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:17,119
of altitude or more involved so places

2488
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:18,080
like hindu kush

2489
01:26:17,119 --> 01:26:20,238
you know

2490
01:26:18,079 --> 01:26:22,899
in the mountains or

2491
01:26:20,238 --> 01:26:26,009
certain places in pakistan

2492
01:26:22,899 --> 01:26:26,009
[Music]

2493
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:33,198
you know they also have an altitude of

2494
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:34,840
of 1 500 meters and more and they seem

2495
01:26:33,198 --> 01:26:37,439
to have completely different

2496
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:39,119
characteristics these are the plants

2497
01:26:37,439 --> 01:26:41,519
you know which

2498
01:26:39,119 --> 01:26:43,198
have an insane amount of resin i mean

2499
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:45,199
some of the plants have

2500
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:47,678
so much resin coverage on them that you

2501
01:26:45,198 --> 01:26:50,638
know it could really uh you know rival

2502
01:26:47,679 --> 01:26:53,119
any of the hybrid varieties and we

2503
01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:54,560
understand that all of these places uh

2504
01:26:53,119 --> 01:26:56,880
you know

2505
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:59,360
where where high latitude highland uh

2506
01:26:56,880 --> 01:27:01,039
you know regions are of natural cannabis

2507
01:26:59,359 --> 01:27:03,839
varieties are for domesticated cannabis

2508
01:27:01,039 --> 01:27:05,920
varieties all these places are luckily

2509
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:07,039
you know situated in dangerous areas

2510
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:08,079
where you know

2511
01:27:07,039 --> 01:27:09,679
your

2512
01:27:08,079 --> 01:27:11,198
greenhouse or yellow house seed company

2513
01:27:09,679 --> 01:27:12,639
could not have gone you know with their

2514
01:27:11,198 --> 01:27:14,559
seeds or whatnot

2515
01:27:12,639 --> 01:27:17,440
so we understand you know whatever we're

2516
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:18,400
seeing there is a is a byproduct of the

2517
01:27:17,439 --> 01:27:20,479
environment

2518
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:22,719
so that's how you can basically classify

2519
01:27:20,479 --> 01:27:23,599
for uh categories and you can go on my

2520
01:27:22,719 --> 01:27:26,600
website that is

2521
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:26,600
www.indianlandriesexchange.com

2522
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:30,159
i have written an article that was

2523
01:27:28,238 --> 01:27:33,279
written i think about year year and a

2524
01:27:30,158 --> 01:27:35,279
half ago about this and

2525
01:27:33,279 --> 01:27:37,039
i i need to amend a few things to it

2526
01:27:35,279 --> 01:27:38,479
because i'm always learning and trying

2527
01:27:37,039 --> 01:27:40,800
to put together you know more

2528
01:27:38,479 --> 01:27:42,879
information in a more coherent manner so

2529
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:45,279
you guys can go and actually read that

2530
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:47,199
uh article you know if i may not be

2531
01:27:45,279 --> 01:27:48,960
explaining it very well here

2532
01:27:47,198 --> 01:27:51,919
so but but that's one of the

2533
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:54,719
classifications which i feel is really

2534
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:55,920
complete and it kind of encapsulates

2535
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:58,800
everything

2536
01:27:55,920 --> 01:28:00,960
uh you know that is present in in the

2537
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:02,000
cannabis hot spots where cannabis been

2538
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:04,079
growing

2539
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:06,319
either traditionally for very long time

2540
01:28:04,079 --> 01:28:09,359
or has been growing naturally or has

2541
01:28:06,319 --> 01:28:11,599
been domesticated the only uh issue that

2542
01:28:09,359 --> 01:28:13,279
i had later on was with one of the

2543
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:16,159
regions that became apparent to me and

2544
01:28:13,279 --> 01:28:19,198
that was on the cold desert regions like

2545
01:28:16,158 --> 01:28:21,198
niti valley in uttarakhand this is

2546
01:28:19,198 --> 01:28:23,519
close to indirectly in border and it's

2547
01:28:21,198 --> 01:28:24,559
only at 31 degrees not so this place is

2548
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:26,480
not

2549
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:28,239
above 33 degrees

2550
01:28:26,479 --> 01:28:30,959
however

2551
01:28:28,238 --> 01:28:33,599
the uh the conditions the environmental

2552
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:36,158
conditions at neeti valley are exactly

2553
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:38,880
the same as they are in hindu kush

2554
01:28:36,158 --> 01:28:40,719
mountain top these are

2555
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:42,960
first of all let me just explain to you

2556
01:28:40,719 --> 01:28:45,920
explain it to you why it's that because

2557
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:49,039
uh niti valley is a cloak is a cold

2558
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:51,119
desert because it lies in the rain

2559
01:28:49,039 --> 01:28:53,198
shadow of the himalayas so himalayas has

2560
01:28:51,119 --> 01:28:55,679
a rain shadow and anything that lies

2561
01:28:53,198 --> 01:28:57,919
under it will never get the monsoon okay

2562
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:59,679
it's going to be absolutely dry so

2563
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:02,960
that's one of the reasons it's

2564
01:28:59,679 --> 01:29:04,960
absolutely dry and you know arid

2565
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:06,800
and the plants that grow there they kind

2566
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:08,719
of grow in exactly the similar

2567
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:10,400
conditions uh

2568
01:29:08,719 --> 01:29:12,399
than uh compared to the plan which are

2569
01:29:10,399 --> 01:29:14,960
growing at high altitude and high

2570
01:29:12,399 --> 01:29:17,839
latitude like in the kush so they seem

2571
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:20,399
to acquire exactly the same features

2572
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:21,440
as plants from hindu kush or france from

2573
01:29:20,399 --> 01:29:22,238
chitral

2574
01:29:21,439 --> 01:29:24,479
and

2575
01:29:22,238 --> 01:29:26,238
these places except for when you go to

2576
01:29:24,479 --> 01:29:28,319
niti valley there is no domestication

2577
01:29:26,238 --> 01:29:30,718
that has happened but you can apparently

2578
01:29:28,319 --> 01:29:33,039
see a short stature plant you know in

2579
01:29:30,719 --> 01:29:35,119
the absence of moisture it grows really

2580
01:29:33,039 --> 01:29:37,600
tucked to the ground to keep all the

2581
01:29:35,119 --> 01:29:40,399
moisture intact and you know flowers are

2582
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:41,920
dense the resin is really dry leaves are

2583
01:29:40,399 --> 01:29:43,839
deeply sedated which is very

2584
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:45,440
characteristic of plants which come from

2585
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:46,960
you know high latitude and high

2586
01:29:45,439 --> 01:29:49,279
altitudes

2587
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:51,359
so you see all those features and

2588
01:29:49,279 --> 01:29:52,719
uh you know we have

2589
01:29:51,359 --> 01:29:54,399
and that really solidifies our

2590
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:56,560
understanding that yes indeed

2591
01:29:54,399 --> 01:29:59,119
environment is that one scale that you

2592
01:29:56,560 --> 01:30:01,440
know we can map everything against

2593
01:29:59,119 --> 01:30:03,279
and you know it will be really helpful

2594
01:30:01,439 --> 01:30:04,879
in understanding and classifying these

2595
01:30:03,279 --> 01:30:07,599
varieties but

2596
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:09,760
again this does not really encapsulate

2597
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:12,000
any of the hybrid varieties so then if

2598
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:14,480
you want to have a different system for

2599
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:16,399
for referring to hybrids i i think then

2600
01:30:14,479 --> 01:30:18,158
somebody would have to uh you know come

2601
01:30:16,399 --> 01:30:19,839
up with a way to do that there was

2602
01:30:18,158 --> 01:30:21,920
another classification which was done

2603
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:23,600
after that because environment is not

2604
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:25,520
the only factor even if it is the

2605
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:26,400
biggest factor in shaping the way plants

2606
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:27,199
are

2607
01:30:26,399 --> 01:30:28,799
the

2608
01:30:27,198 --> 01:30:31,599
second biggest factor is the human

2609
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:34,159
beings now so we did a little uh we made

2610
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:35,679
like three different types on based on

2611
01:30:34,158 --> 01:30:37,839
how human beings interact with the

2612
01:30:35,679 --> 01:30:39,760
plants and the first plants are which

2613
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:41,440
are completely wild primordial they have

2614
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:43,119
no contact with human beings human

2615
01:30:41,439 --> 01:30:45,439
beings have never domesticated them they

2616
01:30:43,119 --> 01:30:48,158
have never fed them and that's one and

2617
01:30:45,439 --> 01:30:51,279
then the second category we made is of

2618
01:30:48,158 --> 01:30:53,279
directly affected wild plants directly

2619
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:55,519
affected by plants are something you

2620
01:30:53,279 --> 01:30:57,920
find in the cities these are primordial

2621
01:30:55,520 --> 01:31:00,000
varieties naturally occurring varieties

2622
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:02,239
never been domesticated but they're

2623
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,679
getting affected by human presence

2624
01:31:02,238 --> 01:31:05,759
they're getting affected by the

2625
01:31:03,679 --> 01:31:07,440
artificial lightning by all the

2626
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:09,039
pollution that we're creating and all

2627
01:31:07,439 --> 01:31:10,719
the other situations you know our

2628
01:31:09,039 --> 01:31:11,519
cattle's graze on them and stuff like

2629
01:31:10,719 --> 01:31:13,439
that

2630
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:15,520
so those have

2631
01:31:13,439 --> 01:31:18,319
you know driven some changes and once

2632
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:20,400
again i wrote an article on that that is

2633
01:31:18,319 --> 01:31:22,158
also present on my website so if you

2634
01:31:20,399 --> 01:31:24,960
guys want to get a little more insight

2635
01:31:22,158 --> 01:31:27,039
into that i would uh you know i would

2636
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:29,600
say that you should read that but

2637
01:31:27,039 --> 01:31:31,840
coming back to the point so uh that's

2638
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:34,079
the second variety which we classified

2639
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:36,639
in terms of human interaction that

2640
01:31:34,079 --> 01:31:38,559
varieties which are also wild but

2641
01:31:36,639 --> 01:31:41,279
they're affected by human beings not

2642
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:43,120
domesticated by them affected by them

2643
01:31:41,279 --> 01:31:44,439
because of our activities because of

2644
01:31:43,119 --> 01:31:46,719
what happened after

2645
01:31:44,439 --> 01:31:48,479
industrialization industrial revolution

2646
01:31:46,719 --> 01:31:50,960
you know the lights became widespread

2647
01:31:48,479 --> 01:31:51,678
and you know things had to change and if

2648
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:53,520
you

2649
01:31:51,679 --> 01:31:55,679
go look populations at you know punjab

2650
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:58,000
what you see is that a lot of plants now

2651
01:31:55,679 --> 01:32:00,079
autoflower because you know they are

2652
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:02,319
constantly growing under different light

2653
01:32:00,079 --> 01:32:04,000
patterns from artificial street lights

2654
01:32:02,319 --> 01:32:05,840
they have figured out a way to you know

2655
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:08,158
induce flowering without

2656
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:10,400
uh the light hours because

2657
01:32:08,158 --> 01:32:12,799
that's a much better way to reproduce in

2658
01:32:10,399 --> 01:32:14,479
a situation where you know light

2659
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:16,079
is not natural

2660
01:32:14,479 --> 01:32:18,479
and then you see some of the plants you

2661
01:32:16,079 --> 01:32:20,960
know they they have intersex tendencies

2662
01:32:18,479 --> 01:32:23,519
and the autoflowering tendency you know

2663
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:25,439
so a lot of different things which are

2664
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:28,320
and these changes are you know more or

2665
01:32:25,439 --> 01:32:30,559
less driven by our activities our

2666
01:32:28,319 --> 01:32:32,880
uh you know involvement consciously and

2667
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:35,520
consciously with those plans and then we

2668
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:36,880
selected third right i'm sorry we made

2669
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:38,719
third category

2670
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:40,159
in terms of human interaction that was

2671
01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:42,000
the domesticated varieties the

2672
01:32:40,158 --> 01:32:44,559
traditional varieties like in malana and

2673
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:46,158
uttarakhand in balochistan in pakistan

2674
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:47,760
in afghanistan you know

2675
01:32:46,158 --> 01:32:49,039
which are actually

2676
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:50,560
you know

2677
01:32:49,039 --> 01:32:53,439
affected by human beings but are

2678
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:55,840
actually domesticated not affected in an

2679
01:32:53,439 --> 01:32:57,678
adverse manner but are like cared for

2680
01:32:55,840 --> 01:33:00,159
and you know made into something which

2681
01:32:57,679 --> 01:33:02,239
is more meaningful

2682
01:33:00,158 --> 01:33:04,479
wow what a really comprehensive rundown

2683
01:33:02,238 --> 01:33:07,039
that was awesome i appreciate that

2684
01:33:04,479 --> 01:33:09,198
i guess my next question is quite broad

2685
01:33:07,039 --> 01:33:12,238
so i understand if you find it a bit

2686
01:33:09,198 --> 01:33:13,919
hard to give specific answers to but

2687
01:33:12,238 --> 01:33:16,000
everyone i speak to who's really into

2688
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:17,440
land races has this same sentiment where

2689
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,880
they say i've never really tried an

2690
01:33:17,439 --> 01:33:20,079
indian land race you know it's one of

2691
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:22,239
those ones which just doesn't get as

2692
01:33:20,079 --> 01:33:25,760
much attention as some of the others

2693
01:33:22,238 --> 01:33:27,759
what other land races might you try to

2694
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:29,039
compare india to if you just wanted to

2695
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:31,280
try to give someone an idea if you were

2696
01:33:29,039 --> 01:33:32,399
like oh it's it's kind of like a tie but

2697
01:33:31,279 --> 01:33:34,479
a bit different like you know how would

2698
01:33:32,399 --> 01:33:36,319
you describe it to someone

2699
01:33:34,479 --> 01:33:38,479
well that's that's a great question

2700
01:33:36,319 --> 01:33:40,639
thank you very much for i mean framing

2701
01:33:38,479 --> 01:33:42,399
it in that face so now it's really easy

2702
01:33:40,639 --> 01:33:43,119
to you know make comparison and answer

2703
01:33:42,399 --> 01:33:44,559
that

2704
01:33:43,119 --> 01:33:46,719
now uh

2705
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:48,719
like you said i mean indian varieties i

2706
01:33:46,719 --> 01:33:50,719
mean you know they get like undermined

2707
01:33:48,719 --> 01:33:52,239
big time and i'm telling you you know

2708
01:33:50,719 --> 01:33:54,000
even though there's a little bit of work

2709
01:33:52,238 --> 01:33:55,359
involved there because again like i said

2710
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,760
and i accept this that you know the

2711
01:33:55,359 --> 01:33:59,920
domestication the level of domestication

2712
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:01,520
that has happened in india is nowhere uh

2713
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:03,279
you know close to what has happened in

2714
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:05,360
places like afghanistan or pakistan i

2715
01:34:03,279 --> 01:34:07,920
mean right so

2716
01:34:05,359 --> 01:34:10,238
rightly so people are people are right

2717
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:12,079
in choosing those varieties more often

2718
01:34:10,238 --> 01:34:13,678
over the indians or even some of the

2719
01:34:12,079 --> 01:34:14,479
southeast asians

2720
01:34:13,679 --> 01:34:16,399
uh

2721
01:34:14,479 --> 01:34:18,879
for that reason but i think another

2722
01:34:16,399 --> 01:34:22,399
reason that's there is uh really the

2723
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:24,480
cultural reason and i'm gonna i'm gonna

2724
01:34:22,399 --> 01:34:26,079
try to you know

2725
01:34:24,479 --> 01:34:28,158
i'm gonna actually try to first of all

2726
01:34:26,079 --> 01:34:30,238
answer the other question that i would

2727
01:34:28,158 --> 01:34:32,719
say uh if you go to kashmir if you go to

2728
01:34:30,238 --> 01:34:34,879
southern kashmir or pulvaam or srinagar

2729
01:34:32,719 --> 01:34:35,920
how i see those plants look very similar

2730
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:38,480
to

2731
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:39,920
your ethiopian plants you know the ethio

2732
01:34:38,479 --> 01:34:41,519
the plant that come from ethiopian

2733
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:43,840
islands and they're very you know

2734
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:44,639
spindly and they look absolutely the

2735
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:47,039
same

2736
01:34:44,639 --> 01:34:48,960
to the kashmir varieties at least to me

2737
01:34:47,039 --> 01:34:51,439
and you know that's one of them very

2738
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:52,399
sought after varieties so i mean

2739
01:34:51,439 --> 01:34:54,238
yeah

2740
01:34:52,399 --> 01:34:56,319
and the south indians like kerala and

2741
01:34:54,238 --> 01:34:58,319
shiloh they're like pretty synonymous to

2742
01:34:56,319 --> 01:35:00,639
your average you know southeast asian

2743
01:34:58,319 --> 01:35:02,399
varieties that comes from thailand and

2744
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:04,000
other places like vietnam but now coming

2745
01:35:02,399 --> 01:35:06,399
back to the cultural reason that i was

2746
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:07,279
going to touch upon actually that is i

2747
01:35:06,399 --> 01:35:09,439
think

2748
01:35:07,279 --> 01:35:11,118
i mean try to think about this all the

2749
01:35:09,439 --> 01:35:12,960
varieties which are really famous in

2750
01:35:11,118 --> 01:35:16,399
america or in the larger world are the

2751
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:18,079
ones where america had like had a war so

2752
01:35:16,399 --> 01:35:20,479
they had a vietnam war and like

2753
01:35:18,079 --> 01:35:22,639
vietnamese seems to be very famous and

2754
01:35:20,479 --> 01:35:24,638
you know they constantly have you know

2755
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:27,600
something going in afghanistan for so

2756
01:35:24,639 --> 01:35:29,520
long so afghanistan seems to be you know

2757
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:31,760
of uh you know

2758
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:32,960
seems to be very famous so

2759
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:34,639
there are a few things we have to

2760
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:35,840
understand and the first is the the

2761
01:35:34,639 --> 01:35:38,639
psych uh

2762
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:40,719
the psycholinguistic aspect of it that

2763
01:35:38,639 --> 01:35:42,800
if you're gonna hear about something for

2764
01:35:40,719 --> 01:35:45,359
so long or it has you have certain

2765
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:48,000
memories attached to it right

2766
01:35:45,359 --> 01:35:49,519
so you're naturally going to incline

2767
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:51,359
more towards those things even though

2768
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:53,360
you don't understand i mean there are a

2769
01:35:51,359 --> 01:35:54,880
lot of people who have never actually

2770
01:35:53,359 --> 01:35:56,399
had a pure vietnamese and they're going

2771
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:57,600
to tell you that is the best sweet in

2772
01:35:56,399 --> 01:35:59,439
the world

2773
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:00,239
and that tells you something about you

2774
01:35:59,439 --> 01:36:01,759
know

2775
01:36:00,238 --> 01:36:03,919
how people are getting to these

2776
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:06,000
conclusion i mean i'm sure there are

2777
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:07,920
some killer varieties coming from

2778
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:10,719
vietnam right and some people have had

2779
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:12,880
them and some people truly

2780
01:36:10,719 --> 01:36:14,560
know that you know the these are just

2781
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:16,960
mind-boggling stuff if you run into one

2782
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:18,560
of those psychedelic you know

2783
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:21,198
plants that induce the psychedelic

2784
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:24,080
effects it's really uncanny to feel that

2785
01:36:21,198 --> 01:36:25,359
way on cannabis but do we really feel

2786
01:36:24,079 --> 01:36:26,960
that everybody has gone through that

2787
01:36:25,359 --> 01:36:28,079
kind of experience i don't think so i

2788
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:30,560
think

2789
01:36:28,079 --> 01:36:31,760
a lot of the uh you know opinion that

2790
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:33,600
people have about these different

2791
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:35,520
varieties is just shaped by because of

2792
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:37,360
the culture the way cultures have been

2793
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:40,320
and they are emotions are attached to

2794
01:36:37,359 --> 01:36:42,319
certain places and also because you had

2795
01:36:40,319 --> 01:36:44,079
a war in like vietnam or let's say

2796
01:36:42,319 --> 01:36:44,799
somebody had a war in like afghanistan

2797
01:36:44,079 --> 01:36:47,279
then

2798
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:49,119
there is a bigger there is a

2799
01:36:47,279 --> 01:36:51,599
fat probability that that person is

2800
01:36:49,118 --> 01:36:53,920
going to get some seeds

2801
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:56,079
back right and you can only appreciate

2802
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:57,600
things that you have so if you only have

2803
01:36:56,079 --> 01:36:59,279
vietnamese and afghani then of course

2804
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:00,719
you're going to appreciate them you

2805
01:36:59,279 --> 01:37:01,759
can't appreciate something you don't

2806
01:37:00,719 --> 01:37:04,719
have

2807
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:06,719
i mean in a way in a subjective way that

2808
01:37:04,719 --> 01:37:08,560
you've had them right so i think it's

2809
01:37:06,719 --> 01:37:10,639
only a matter of time as the indian

2810
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:12,800
varieties become more available to

2811
01:37:10,639 --> 01:37:14,800
people that people would understand that

2812
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:16,800
however it requires a little bit of work

2813
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:17,760
but there are so much

2814
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:20,400
uh

2815
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:22,400
untapped potential in these lines and

2816
01:37:20,399 --> 01:37:24,399
you know there is no one way to really

2817
01:37:22,399 --> 01:37:25,759
work with those varieties i have seen

2818
01:37:24,399 --> 01:37:27,359
people work with them you know in

2819
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:30,159
different ways some people just try to

2820
01:37:27,359 --> 01:37:32,238
find very nice plant out of thousand

2821
01:37:30,158 --> 01:37:34,479
plants and you know reverse it and just

2822
01:37:32,238 --> 01:37:36,000
go from there some people like to you

2823
01:37:34,479 --> 01:37:38,319
know select for traits and you know

2824
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:40,560
eventually homogenize them and then you

2825
01:37:38,319 --> 01:37:42,079
know work them work with those varieties

2826
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:43,679
as true breeding varieties and some

2827
01:37:42,079 --> 01:37:44,479
people just take them and you know hit

2828
01:37:43,679 --> 01:37:46,880
it with

2829
01:37:44,479 --> 01:37:48,559
other hybrids and that creates fantastic

2830
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:50,960
plants as well requires some sort of you

2831
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:53,760
know selection work later on but

2832
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:55,920
all good so i i think once these things

2833
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:57,679
become more prevalent it becomes like a

2834
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:59,039
norm because

2835
01:37:57,679 --> 01:38:00,880
i have been you know doing this for

2836
01:37:59,039 --> 01:38:03,439
about like five years now and and i can

2837
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:04,880
tell you this that five years ago you

2838
01:38:03,439 --> 01:38:07,279
know when i was on facebook and i

2839
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:09,679
initially come here i mean people

2840
01:38:07,279 --> 01:38:11,118
were not as inclined you know towards

2841
01:38:09,679 --> 01:38:12,560
collecting and preserving language and

2842
01:38:11,118 --> 01:38:14,639
i'm not trying to say that people

2843
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:16,480
weren't doing that you know because it

2844
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:17,920
could be viewed as that and

2845
01:38:16,479 --> 01:38:20,079
it's it's not because there were a lot

2846
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:21,279
of people who i consider to be legends

2847
01:38:20,079 --> 01:38:23,359
you know

2848
01:38:21,279 --> 01:38:25,599
like bodies there and then you have snow

2849
01:38:23,359 --> 01:38:27,599
high and you know i want to name a lot

2850
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:28,560
of other people but you know i couldn't

2851
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:29,840
but

2852
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:31,679
all these people are there they have

2853
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:34,159
done all that work you know so nobody's

2854
01:38:31,679 --> 01:38:35,840
saying that you know it wasn't done but

2855
01:38:34,158 --> 01:38:38,638
it was not

2856
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:40,319
widespread and i don't think that you

2857
01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:42,719
know people were

2858
01:38:40,319 --> 01:38:45,679
um how should i say this people readily

2859
01:38:42,719 --> 01:38:47,520
wanted to to you know get these

2860
01:38:45,679 --> 01:38:49,760
varieties and grow them

2861
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:52,239
because the culture was just not

2862
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:53,600
uh you know the cultural the flow of the

2863
01:38:52,238 --> 01:38:56,319
market as well because you know there is

2864
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:58,239
a market which we cannot ignore right so

2865
01:38:56,319 --> 01:39:00,158
you have to understand the dynamics are

2866
01:38:58,238 --> 01:39:01,599
such that people are inclined towards

2867
01:39:00,158 --> 01:39:03,439
varieties you know which will finish

2868
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:04,320
faster and you know

2869
01:39:03,439 --> 01:39:06,238
uh

2870
01:39:04,319 --> 01:39:09,920
which are being hyped by the media or

2871
01:39:06,238 --> 01:39:11,279
the social media so a lot of there's a

2872
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:14,079
lot of small things you know which have

2873
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:16,399
contributed so far uh you know

2874
01:39:14,079 --> 01:39:18,238
in indian varieties not really being you

2875
01:39:16,399 --> 01:39:19,839
know one of the uh one of the ones which

2876
01:39:18,238 --> 01:39:22,238
are sought after really when you talk

2877
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:24,079
about land resistant whole but i think

2878
01:39:22,238 --> 01:39:25,039
at the same time the same technology

2879
01:39:24,079 --> 01:39:26,800
helped

2880
01:39:25,039 --> 01:39:28,560
people from india to connect with all

2881
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:30,639
across the people on the globe and you

2882
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:32,400
know really get these seeds out to them

2883
01:39:30,639 --> 01:39:34,639
and it's only now that people are

2884
01:39:32,399 --> 01:39:36,638
beginning to understand that you know no

2885
01:39:34,639 --> 01:39:38,560
cannabis is bad or a good cannabis it's

2886
01:39:36,639 --> 01:39:40,960
just you have to grow enough of it to

2887
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:43,360
find that great one

2888
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:45,279
yeah what an awesome sentiment i mean

2889
01:39:43,359 --> 01:39:46,639
just to jump off topic for one second

2890
01:39:45,279 --> 01:39:49,118
because you kind of brought it up

2891
01:39:46,639 --> 01:39:51,679
yourself there how would you describe

2892
01:39:49,118 --> 01:39:55,198
the effect that social media such as

2893
01:39:51,679 --> 01:39:57,279
instagram has had over the cannabis seen

2894
01:39:55,198 --> 01:40:00,638
in the community within india has it

2895
01:39:57,279 --> 01:40:03,279
changed it fundamentally in your opinion

2896
01:40:00,639 --> 01:40:05,840
um yeah it has it has a lot and i think

2897
01:40:03,279 --> 01:40:08,639
instagram has done

2898
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:10,400
possibly a lot more than youtube

2899
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:13,279
facebook and all the other you know

2900
01:40:10,399 --> 01:40:14,719
platforms we know of put together

2901
01:40:13,279 --> 01:40:16,479
because first of all you know when

2902
01:40:14,719 --> 01:40:17,920
instagram came in i mean it gives you a

2903
01:40:16,479 --> 01:40:20,079
seamless

2904
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:21,359
uh you know platform to just go ahead

2905
01:40:20,079 --> 01:40:24,960
and you know

2906
01:40:21,359 --> 01:40:27,439
upload pictures and talk about them so

2907
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:28,960
that's basically like just being in

2908
01:40:27,439 --> 01:40:30,479
being in that place and listening to

2909
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:32,800
that person's story so it's really

2910
01:40:30,479 --> 01:40:34,879
intuitive first of all so i think that

2911
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:37,440
had a very deep impact on the people in

2912
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:39,039
india and apart from that

2913
01:40:37,439 --> 01:40:41,039
all the information that is coming from

2914
01:40:39,039 --> 01:40:41,840
the western world you know because now

2915
01:40:41,039 --> 01:40:43,920
people

2916
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:46,239
in india a significant amount of people

2917
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:48,079
in india knows what og is what cookies i

2918
01:40:46,238 --> 01:40:49,919
mean they don't know about all the you

2919
01:40:48,079 --> 01:40:52,238
know stories behind them and all the

2920
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:54,560
controversies of course because that is

2921
01:40:52,238 --> 01:40:56,479
something internal to the community but

2922
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:58,320
they they know what cookie that there is

2923
01:40:56,479 --> 01:41:00,000
something called cookies and oh man it's

2924
01:40:58,319 --> 01:41:01,599
the best thing and

2925
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,840
in the most basic way i mean you know

2926
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:06,320
you cannot really blame someone and i'm

2927
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:08,079
not trying to say cookies is not good

2928
01:41:06,319 --> 01:41:09,439
it's really potent i've smoked it it's

2929
01:41:08,079 --> 01:41:10,158
great okay

2930
01:41:09,439 --> 01:41:12,158
but

2931
01:41:10,158 --> 01:41:13,679
i mean that's how people are getting

2932
01:41:12,158 --> 01:41:14,289
their information they're getting it

2933
01:41:13,679 --> 01:41:15,520
from

2934
01:41:14,289 --> 01:41:16,639
[Music]

2935
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:18,400
i mean i don't want to say it but from

2936
01:41:16,639 --> 01:41:21,118
the lowest common denominator sort of

2937
01:41:18,399 --> 01:41:23,039
sources you know who just brings it down

2938
01:41:21,118 --> 01:41:25,920
to a point where you know more people

2939
01:41:23,039 --> 01:41:27,118
can understand it opposed to

2940
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:29,600
a

2941
01:41:27,118 --> 01:41:31,198
thing being more factual i mean i think

2942
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:32,560
because the social media is more

2943
01:41:31,198 --> 01:41:35,359
inclined towards making it more

2944
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:37,679
universal to wider audiences they seem

2945
01:41:35,359 --> 01:41:39,439
to you know lose on a lot of content

2946
01:41:37,679 --> 01:41:42,480
which could have been you know a lot

2947
01:41:39,439 --> 01:41:44,638
more meaningful and would have imparted

2948
01:41:42,479 --> 01:41:46,638
uh knowledge in a sense that people

2949
01:41:44,639 --> 01:41:49,118
would then be curious because see you

2950
01:41:46,639 --> 01:41:52,000
cannot teach someone in one video or in

2951
01:41:49,118 --> 01:41:54,880
one audio and one picture whatever right

2952
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:58,000
it has to be a relentless process

2953
01:41:54,880 --> 01:42:00,159
from the person itself of learning so

2954
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:02,960
all you can do is you can incite the

2955
01:42:00,158 --> 01:42:04,879
curiosity inside that person by

2956
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:06,880
telling him the truth telling him you

2957
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:07,920
know how things exactly are and how

2958
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:09,359
there are some things we don't

2959
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:10,960
understand and how there are some things

2960
01:42:09,359 --> 01:42:11,679
we understand now

2961
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:13,760
and

2962
01:42:11,679 --> 01:42:15,840
i think unless you're leading these

2963
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:18,000
people into a larger pursuit for

2964
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:20,800
understanding the plan then we're just

2965
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:21,679
creating a similar society here you know

2966
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:23,920
where

2967
01:42:21,679 --> 01:42:25,760
people would just fall back to some of

2968
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:27,679
the well-known and respected varieties

2969
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:29,119
like ogn cookies and you know they would

2970
01:42:27,679 --> 01:42:30,880
breed with them there are a lot of

2971
01:42:29,118 --> 01:42:32,880
people who are actually breeding in

2972
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:35,359
india i mean they're not necessarily in

2973
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:36,800
india on instagram or facebook for

2974
01:42:35,359 --> 01:42:39,198
obvious reasons

2975
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:40,800
uh but there is a lot of work going on

2976
01:42:39,198 --> 01:42:43,198
and all credits to

2977
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:45,360
you know social media it has really

2978
01:42:43,198 --> 01:42:47,359
brought nothing short of a revolution if

2979
01:42:45,359 --> 01:42:49,359
i may say so

2980
01:42:47,359 --> 01:42:51,118
wow what a what a great path for us to

2981
01:42:49,359 --> 01:42:53,759
go down i really want to keep going down

2982
01:42:51,118 --> 01:42:56,399
this road so i mean my first question is

2983
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:59,679
do you see what we would refer to as

2984
01:42:56,399 --> 01:43:02,799
cali import within india

2985
01:42:59,679 --> 01:43:05,118
oh yeah a lot a lot a lot i mean more

2986
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:06,639
than you would think so here's the deal

2987
01:43:05,118 --> 01:43:08,479
i mean first of all let me go ahead and

2988
01:43:06,639 --> 01:43:11,679
put things in perspective for you that

2989
01:43:08,479 --> 01:43:14,000
in india if you have hybrid wheat as we

2990
01:43:11,679 --> 01:43:16,000
call it okay in india i if you have

2991
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:20,238
hybrid wheat it sells for anything

2992
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:21,520
between 800 to 1000 us dollars for every

2993
01:43:20,238 --> 01:43:23,039
ounce

2994
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:26,719
about 30 grams

2995
01:43:23,039 --> 01:43:28,560
okay yes sir that is that is the least

2996
01:43:26,719 --> 01:43:29,760
price that you will get it for and then

2997
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:31,199
you know there would be instances you

2998
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:33,280
might be spending like fifteen hundred

2999
01:43:31,198 --> 01:43:35,759
dollars or twelve hundred dollars

3000
01:43:33,279 --> 01:43:37,519
because it's not available in india and

3001
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:39,039
there is no such quality

3002
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:40,719
i'm sorry there's no such thing as

3003
01:43:39,039 --> 01:43:42,960
quality in india okay about when it

3004
01:43:40,719 --> 01:43:44,239
comes to hybrid so if you have hybrid if

3005
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:46,000
it looks

3006
01:43:44,238 --> 01:43:48,158
different enough from the conventional

3007
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:49,840
wheat and you can say it's hybrid and it

3008
01:43:48,158 --> 01:43:51,759
would sell for seven eight hundred nine

3009
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:53,600
hundred thousand dollars man like

3010
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:55,280
whatever you feel like scalping off of

3011
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:57,679
other people right

3012
01:43:55,279 --> 01:43:59,198
yeah so um yeah i mean

3013
01:43:57,679 --> 01:44:01,118
they love it i mean because the prices

3014
01:43:59,198 --> 01:44:03,039
they get from you know people in u.s

3015
01:44:01,118 --> 01:44:04,719
it's just insane because i know i had

3016
01:44:03,039 --> 01:44:06,800
some friend you know who would

3017
01:44:04,719 --> 01:44:08,480
send an ounce for like a hundred bucks

3018
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:09,600
like hundred dollars right

3019
01:44:08,479 --> 01:44:11,599
so

3020
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:13,360
if imagine if you could just get

3021
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:14,639
announced for a hundred dollars from us

3022
01:44:13,359 --> 01:44:15,679
and you could sell it for a thousand

3023
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:17,920
dollars

3024
01:44:15,679 --> 01:44:19,600
in india i mean that's just insane right

3025
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:22,480
i mean you'd be

3026
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:24,159
yeah you'd be pretty rich i i would say

3027
01:44:22,479 --> 01:44:26,158
but at the same time i mean this is a

3028
01:44:24,158 --> 01:44:27,759
whole different domain you know people

3029
01:44:26,158 --> 01:44:29,279
who self-read i mean

3030
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:31,360
so but i'm just trying to put things

3031
01:44:29,279 --> 01:44:33,519
into perspective that that's how people

3032
01:44:31,359 --> 01:44:36,399
you know view

3033
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:38,639
in india and that's the price is like i

3034
01:44:36,399 --> 01:44:41,439
mean that that's the kind of you know

3035
01:44:38,639 --> 01:44:42,960
price tag that comes with it so yeah a

3036
01:44:41,439 --> 01:44:45,198
lot of people are

3037
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:47,840
smoking it at the same time but it's not

3038
01:44:45,198 --> 01:44:50,238
readily available for indians here but

3039
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:53,840
you we do see a lot of bags of cookies

3040
01:44:50,238 --> 01:44:53,839
and runs you know making it over

3041
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:58,560
oh my god i love that you see runs

3042
01:44:55,840 --> 01:45:00,159
that's so good um so

3043
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:01,840
you know i got kind of like a little

3044
01:45:00,158 --> 01:45:03,839
triple question here for you so the

3045
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:06,960
first part is do many people grow

3046
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:09,840
indoors and are there any kind of

3047
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:11,600
strains which are grown locally which

3048
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:13,520
people are well aware of like like the

3049
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:16,079
indian blue dream type of thing is there

3050
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:18,320
anything like that

3051
01:45:16,079 --> 01:45:19,920
yeah i i think most of the people grow

3052
01:45:18,319 --> 01:45:21,599
indoors because of the obvious reason

3053
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:23,600
it's not being legal

3054
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:25,760
and some people are blessed to be in

3055
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:27,520
places like one of my friends who's

3056
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:29,440
actually one of the guys who breeds

3057
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:31,280
along with me he

3058
01:45:29,439 --> 01:45:32,719
lives in a place where he can grow it

3059
01:45:31,279 --> 01:45:34,880
outside and you know because there's

3060
01:45:32,719 --> 01:45:36,399
nobody around him but most people this

3061
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:39,039
is not the case for them i mean you know

3062
01:45:36,399 --> 01:45:40,559
we have to stick to the indoors now to

3063
01:45:39,039 --> 01:45:42,639
the more interesting question you ask

3064
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:46,000
the local variety so there is one such

3065
01:45:42,639 --> 01:45:48,800
variety but i cannot vouch whether it's

3066
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:52,238
simply being you know

3067
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:54,880
bred out of kerala gold or whether it's

3068
01:45:52,238 --> 01:45:56,638
a combination of kerala gold and hybrid

3069
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:59,039
that was then selected

3070
01:45:56,639 --> 01:46:00,480
you know which so i don't understand

3071
01:45:59,039 --> 01:46:01,920
that but here's the thing there's a

3072
01:46:00,479 --> 01:46:03,678
strain called shillabati and you can

3073
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:05,920
google it and i would recommend you

3074
01:46:03,679 --> 01:46:08,000
google that just write shiloh in google

3075
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:10,158
i'll give you the spellings later

3076
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:12,319
and you would see that you know there's

3077
01:46:10,158 --> 01:46:14,079
so much being written about it and it's

3078
01:46:12,319 --> 01:46:16,079
grown in south india

3079
01:46:14,079 --> 01:46:17,920
and this variety is not confined to one

3080
01:46:16,079 --> 01:46:19,600
place it's grown all over south india

3081
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:21,359
and then it makes it over to north india

3082
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:22,639
and everybody knows the name so this is

3083
01:46:21,359 --> 01:46:24,479
one weed

3084
01:46:22,639 --> 01:46:25,679
everybody seemed to know the name of

3085
01:46:24,479 --> 01:46:27,599
because

3086
01:46:25,679 --> 01:46:30,079
it would get you

3087
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:31,600
higher than any other v you know and it

3088
01:46:30,079 --> 01:46:33,760
has a dense

3089
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:36,560
structure i mean the but i mean they're

3090
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:38,000
not dense like the like og or cookie

3091
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:39,760
dense but you know they're relatively

3092
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:42,238
dense when you compare it to

3093
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:43,440
kerala or its predecessors like uh iriki

3094
01:46:42,238 --> 01:46:46,638
gold

3095
01:46:43,439 --> 01:46:48,638
but it has a great smell it has you know

3096
01:46:46,639 --> 01:46:51,359
probably a more intense smell and the

3097
01:46:48,639 --> 01:46:54,239
high is better so it it's it's really

3098
01:46:51,359 --> 01:46:55,839
taking india by storm but again you

3099
01:46:54,238 --> 01:46:57,519
can't really compare it to you know some

3100
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:58,639
of the varieties that you guys have been

3101
01:46:57,520 --> 01:47:00,960
able to

3102
01:46:58,639 --> 01:47:02,560
breed i mean nowhere close to that but

3103
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:04,239
sure yeah we're we're getting there

3104
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:05,679
slowly i guess

3105
01:47:04,238 --> 01:47:08,718
yeah well that's that's still really

3106
01:47:05,679 --> 01:47:10,560
cool to hear so when people are doing

3107
01:47:08,719 --> 01:47:12,960
their little indoor grows or even

3108
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:15,199
outdoors how do people tend to grow do

3109
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:17,279
they do it organically in soil do they

3110
01:47:15,198 --> 01:47:20,158
use salts like what's the most common

3111
01:47:17,279 --> 01:47:20,158
style you see

3112
01:47:21,198 --> 01:47:25,359
in india most people uh choose to grow

3113
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:28,079
organically and

3114
01:47:25,359 --> 01:47:29,839
it is not based on how they feel about

3115
01:47:28,079 --> 01:47:32,479
you know different growing methods i'll

3116
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:35,840
give you an example for in america

3117
01:47:32,479 --> 01:47:38,799
what i see or at least i feel is that

3118
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:42,159
why people choose to grow with salts or

3119
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:44,480
no-till or water whatever is because of

3120
01:47:42,158 --> 01:47:46,719
how they feel about you know

3121
01:47:44,479 --> 01:47:49,198
uh if it's grown organically or if it's

3122
01:47:46,719 --> 01:47:51,439
grown with salts but that's not the case

3123
01:47:49,198 --> 01:47:53,759
in india in india i think it's driven by

3124
01:47:51,439 --> 01:47:55,759
something else so we don't uh at least

3125
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:58,560
the younger generation is not really

3126
01:47:55,760 --> 01:47:59,760
sensitive about this organic non-organic

3127
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:01,840
thing because

3128
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:02,880
we're just in a different sphere here in

3129
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:04,560
india most of the things come

3130
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:05,600
organically to us

3131
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:07,920
and

3132
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:09,840
we are more concerned about

3133
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:12,399
how can i spend the least amount of

3134
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:14,560
money and still pull off a growth

3135
01:48:12,399 --> 01:48:15,839
and that inevitably leads you towards

3136
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:16,880
organic growing

3137
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:19,119
so

3138
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:21,520
that's really what the motivation is

3139
01:48:19,118 --> 01:48:23,279
behind more people actually doing

3140
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:25,520
organic and very few people actually

3141
01:48:23,279 --> 01:48:28,399
using uh these nutrients and i'll tell

3142
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:31,199
you which people do use these nutrients

3143
01:48:28,399 --> 01:48:33,839
and it's very synonymous to the western

3144
01:48:31,198 --> 01:48:35,118
uh countries the people who are growing

3145
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:37,119
for selling the wheat now there are a

3146
01:48:35,118 --> 01:48:40,079
lot of people who are pumping units from

3147
01:48:37,118 --> 01:48:43,198
their houses okay they're like growing

3148
01:48:40,079 --> 01:48:45,600
in the tents and like big rooms

3149
01:48:43,198 --> 01:48:48,319
and they feel that you know if they can

3150
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:50,400
use these uh nutrients which come from

3151
01:48:48,319 --> 01:48:52,079
europe and america then their weed would

3152
01:48:50,399 --> 01:48:53,920
look as good as

3153
01:48:52,079 --> 01:48:55,359
theirs look in picture

3154
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:57,600
but that's

3155
01:48:55,359 --> 01:48:59,759
i mean and you know how that translates

3156
01:48:57,600 --> 01:49:01,199
in the end but at least that's how those

3157
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:03,119
people feel

3158
01:49:01,198 --> 01:49:04,559
and they tend to spend a lot of money

3159
01:49:03,118 --> 01:49:06,000
and the other hand you know they don't

3160
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:07,760
have a concern around money because

3161
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:09,039
they're actually getting paid for it

3162
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:10,159
they're not growing it for the

3163
01:49:09,039 --> 01:49:12,238
consumption

3164
01:49:10,158 --> 01:49:14,319
so they have a whole different financial

3165
01:49:12,238 --> 01:49:16,638
situation going so they can actually

3166
01:49:14,319 --> 01:49:18,639
think about you know using something

3167
01:49:16,639 --> 01:49:20,880
uh like uh you know expensive

3168
01:49:18,639 --> 01:49:23,039
fertilizers which come from countries

3169
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:25,440
like america europe

3170
01:49:23,039 --> 01:49:27,279
so there are different groups but

3171
01:49:25,439 --> 01:49:28,399
basically that's what the thinking is in

3172
01:49:27,279 --> 01:49:29,679
india

3173
01:49:28,399 --> 01:49:31,598
yeah of course well i mean that

3174
01:49:29,679 --> 01:49:33,279
certainly makes sense and especially

3175
01:49:31,599 --> 01:49:34,639
considering most things are organic you

3176
01:49:33,279 --> 01:49:35,920
could understand most people would do

3177
01:49:34,639 --> 01:49:37,440
that so

3178
01:49:35,920 --> 01:49:38,560
just to kind of stay on this general

3179
01:49:37,439 --> 01:49:40,399
topic

3180
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:43,199
what would be your advice to someone if

3181
01:49:40,399 --> 01:49:45,759
they've just flown into india somewhere

3182
01:49:43,198 --> 01:49:47,598
is there kind of like a general strategy

3183
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:49,679
you would advise for them to be able to

3184
01:49:47,599 --> 01:49:52,000
track down some weed or do they really

3185
01:49:49,679 --> 01:49:54,639
just need to like ask around like what's

3186
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:57,118
the way to go about doing that

3187
01:49:54,639 --> 01:49:59,520
well it depends i mean where you headed

3188
01:49:57,118 --> 01:50:01,519
to because i mean india is such a

3189
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:04,000
diverse country when it comes to culture

3190
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:05,840
and people and languages and so much

3191
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:07,359
more you know every 10 kilometers

3192
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:09,840
language changes

3193
01:50:07,359 --> 01:50:11,839
you know the dresses changes so does the

3194
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:13,840
culture and the way people behave and

3195
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:16,000
people feel about uh certain things

3196
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:18,239
which also involves cannabis so for

3197
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:19,118
example if you go to uttarakhand

3198
01:50:18,238 --> 01:50:21,678
that is

3199
01:50:19,118 --> 01:50:24,639
my hometown and you

3200
01:50:21,679 --> 01:50:26,399
you see a very relaxed kind of demeanor

3201
01:50:24,639 --> 01:50:28,079
towards cannabis from other people i

3202
01:50:26,399 --> 01:50:30,319
mean you know you could literally go to

3203
01:50:28,079 --> 01:50:32,319
a tea shop and you could you know buy a

3204
01:50:30,319 --> 01:50:34,079
tea and after five minutes you could ask

3205
01:50:32,319 --> 01:50:36,479
him you know if you could like help me

3206
01:50:34,079 --> 01:50:38,238
score some and if he doesn't have some

3207
01:50:36,479 --> 01:50:40,079
you know he will like let you know where

3208
01:50:38,238 --> 01:50:41,919
you can get some and you know if he

3209
01:50:40,079 --> 01:50:43,679
doesn't then you just likely say that i

3210
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:45,279
don't know or he would probably send you

3211
01:50:43,679 --> 01:50:46,399
to another guy who would be able to help

3212
01:50:45,279 --> 01:50:48,960
you

3213
01:50:46,399 --> 01:50:52,158
um but if you're going to let's say

3214
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:53,920
south india there it's not uh i wouldn't

3215
01:50:52,158 --> 01:50:56,158
say it's not recommended that you know

3216
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:58,319
you go ask any random person but you

3217
01:50:56,158 --> 01:51:00,319
rather try to connect with the youth in

3218
01:50:58,319 --> 01:51:02,559
south india because in south india the

3219
01:51:00,319 --> 01:51:04,238
younger people are

3220
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:06,960
a lot more into

3221
01:51:04,238 --> 01:51:08,718
cannabis than i would say in north india

3222
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:10,560
so there's a very good probability if

3223
01:51:08,719 --> 01:51:13,520
you're speaking to someone you know

3224
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:15,840
who's of i was between 18 to 30 years

3225
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:18,320
old that he would know the whereabouts

3226
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:20,560
of the wheat but in north india

3227
01:51:18,319 --> 01:51:22,158
yeah pretty much you can like speak to

3228
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:24,400
the people who are driving you know

3229
01:51:22,158 --> 01:51:26,158
gokart rickshaws or who are selling you

3230
01:51:24,399 --> 01:51:27,759
know cigarettes

3231
01:51:26,158 --> 01:51:29,279
and these are the go-to people i mean

3232
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:31,760
you know you you go

3233
01:51:29,279 --> 01:51:34,319
the best place you can go to is go to

3234
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:35,599
a guy who's you know driving that gokart

3235
01:51:34,319 --> 01:51:37,279
rickshaw kind of thing you know the

3236
01:51:35,599 --> 01:51:38,960
three-wheeler

3237
01:51:37,279 --> 01:51:40,319
i don't know what you guys call that

3238
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:42,319
over there

3239
01:51:40,319 --> 01:51:44,880
yeah rickshaw right so those people are

3240
01:51:42,319 --> 01:51:47,198
really famous and even so much that you

3241
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:49,279
know when our parents had to scold us

3242
01:51:47,198 --> 01:51:51,198
for like or have to tell us that weed is

3243
01:51:49,279 --> 01:51:53,920
bad they would say that hey this is the

3244
01:51:51,198 --> 01:51:55,839
drug of those rickshawers you know so

3245
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:57,039
you smoke it and you're like yeah you

3246
01:51:55,840 --> 01:51:58,319
like them

3247
01:51:57,039 --> 01:52:00,560
so i mean

3248
01:51:58,319 --> 01:52:01,439
i mean it's so engraved in the culture

3249
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:03,440
that

3250
01:52:01,439 --> 01:52:05,039
you know it becomes something

3251
01:52:03,439 --> 01:52:08,238
it becomes something of an expression to

3252
01:52:05,039 --> 01:52:10,479
scare kids so you have to i mean

3253
01:52:08,238 --> 01:52:12,000
i mean we generalize a lot i mean it's

3254
01:52:10,479 --> 01:52:14,559
really bad but

3255
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:15,359
no no no i totally understand that so i

3256
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:17,520
mean

3257
01:52:15,359 --> 01:52:20,880
if we just kind of move on to kind of

3258
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:22,560
the physical landscape a little bit more

3259
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:24,000
what's the soil like to growing because

3260
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:26,480
you mentioned that people tend to grow

3261
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:28,719
organically is the soil well suited in

3262
01:52:26,479 --> 01:52:32,158
european is it rich in nutrients fairly

3263
01:52:28,719 --> 01:52:35,118
depleted how do people work with it

3264
01:52:32,158 --> 01:52:37,198
okay now soil is a very important aspect

3265
01:52:35,118 --> 01:52:39,039
for growing plants as we all know but i

3266
01:52:37,198 --> 01:52:40,960
think there is a vast difference between

3267
01:52:39,039 --> 01:52:42,399
how things are happening in i'm not

3268
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:44,639
going to talk about europe because not

3269
01:52:42,399 --> 01:52:46,879
really aware of that but in terms of

3270
01:52:44,639 --> 01:52:48,480
america and india i could draw like this

3271
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:50,800
little uh

3272
01:52:48,479 --> 01:52:53,039
comparison that in america i see a lot

3273
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:54,800
of people buy soils and

3274
01:52:53,039 --> 01:52:56,719
for someone in india that is completely

3275
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:59,119
insane i mean you know nobody would give

3276
01:52:56,719 --> 01:53:01,599
money for soil i mean

3277
01:52:59,118 --> 01:53:03,118
it's not in a way insulting other people

3278
01:53:01,599 --> 01:53:05,039
but you have to understand from our

3279
01:53:03,118 --> 01:53:06,238
culture we don't pay for soil like we

3280
01:53:05,039 --> 01:53:08,560
pay for food

3281
01:53:06,238 --> 01:53:10,559
we don't pay for soil ever okay it's

3282
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:12,639
free and

3283
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:14,960
what another reason behind that is

3284
01:53:12,639 --> 01:53:15,920
because most of the soil is fertile here

3285
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:18,000
because

3286
01:53:15,920 --> 01:53:20,560
what is northern india by the way

3287
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:22,960
northern india used to be a big flood

3288
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:25,280
plain for all these different rivers i

3289
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:27,679
mean there are only five rivers flowing

3290
01:53:25,279 --> 01:53:28,559
from punjab itself that used to at least

3291
01:53:27,679 --> 01:53:31,359
and

3292
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:33,679
all of the soil that is here is actually

3293
01:53:31,359 --> 01:53:36,639
your alluvial deposits

3294
01:53:33,679 --> 01:53:38,480
and you know the minerals you know which

3295
01:53:36,639 --> 01:53:40,880
the rivers have

3296
01:53:38,479 --> 01:53:43,519
you know flown down into these planes

3297
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:45,599
from from the mountainous regions so the

3298
01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:48,480
soil is really good it's alluvial soil

3299
01:53:45,599 --> 01:53:50,400
mostly like it has a clay loom like

3300
01:53:48,479 --> 01:53:52,638
texture you know some places it's more

3301
01:53:50,399 --> 01:53:56,319
yellowish you go to other places it's a

3302
01:53:52,639 --> 01:53:57,520
little bit dark but soil is really good

3303
01:53:56,319 --> 01:54:00,079
and

3304
01:53:57,520 --> 01:54:01,440
you know the ph is uh right around like

3305
01:54:00,079 --> 01:54:03,118
seven

3306
01:54:01,439 --> 01:54:05,198
i think like seven around like seven

3307
01:54:03,118 --> 01:54:07,759
seven point two it just hovers around

3308
01:54:05,198 --> 01:54:09,678
that so it's perfect for canvas i mean

3309
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:11,280
and even you know if there are some

3310
01:54:09,679 --> 01:54:13,760
varieties you know which do not thrive

3311
01:54:11,279 --> 01:54:15,679
in like higher ph

3312
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:18,079
because you're using the natural soil

3313
01:54:15,679 --> 01:54:20,399
you have the indigenous microbes i mean

3314
01:54:18,079 --> 01:54:21,840
they're just going to you know

3315
01:54:20,399 --> 01:54:24,319
equalize that effect i mean they're

3316
01:54:21,840 --> 01:54:26,000
going to count counteract that effect

3317
01:54:24,319 --> 01:54:28,960
but at the same time you know we have to

3318
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:31,760
be very careful uh when using you know

3319
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:33,520
uh things like micro razor because we're

3320
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:35,599
using indigenous soil so there's already

3321
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:37,040
a species of that you know which is

3322
01:54:35,599 --> 01:54:39,599
present and you know sometimes people

3323
01:54:37,039 --> 01:54:40,960
would buy micro razor from outside of

3324
01:54:39,599 --> 01:54:42,960
india and then you would have two

3325
01:54:40,960 --> 01:54:45,039
different species competing and you know

3326
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:47,679
it could lead to other problems but yeah

3327
01:54:45,039 --> 01:54:49,198
overall we mostly have this you know

3328
01:54:47,679 --> 01:54:51,840
clay loam

3329
01:54:49,198 --> 01:54:54,479
and alluvial deposits you know

3330
01:54:51,840 --> 01:54:56,239
vast deposits of alluvial soil and you

3331
01:54:54,479 --> 01:54:57,839
know the cow dung and

3332
01:54:56,238 --> 01:54:59,359
is just free you can get it from

3333
01:54:57,840 --> 01:55:00,719
anywhere

3334
01:54:59,359 --> 01:55:02,639
so uh

3335
01:55:00,719 --> 01:55:05,198
in india i mean people really don't have

3336
01:55:02,639 --> 01:55:07,359
that kind of like soil buying culture or

3337
01:55:05,198 --> 01:55:08,960
like neutron buying culture i mean it's

3338
01:55:07,359 --> 01:55:11,198
certainly coming to india i'm not going

3339
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:12,719
to say that amazon is not now selling

3340
01:55:11,198 --> 01:55:14,799
amazon is selling

3341
01:55:12,719 --> 01:55:16,800
soil uh but i don't think a lot of

3342
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:18,719
people are buying it as of now but the

3343
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:20,639
culture is due for a change things are

3344
01:55:18,719 --> 01:55:22,319
going to change you know because

3345
01:55:20,639 --> 01:55:24,079
of course the economy is also getting

3346
01:55:22,319 --> 01:55:26,319
stronger i mean apart from this

3347
01:55:24,079 --> 01:55:27,679
coronavirus thing that just happened now

3348
01:55:26,319 --> 01:55:30,158
apart from that things were going good

3349
01:55:27,679 --> 01:55:33,679
for india and i think eventually because

3350
01:55:30,158 --> 01:55:35,279
people are gonna you know uh gonna be

3351
01:55:33,679 --> 01:55:36,000
making more money and they would be you

3352
01:55:35,279 --> 01:55:37,679
know

3353
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:39,599
more resourceful they will eventually be

3354
01:55:37,679 --> 01:55:41,920
able to move on to the ideas like hey

3355
01:55:39,599 --> 01:55:43,440
let's try to invest in soil let's try to

3356
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:45,359
buy soil and see if that makes a

3357
01:55:43,439 --> 01:55:47,359
difference and i think it would make a

3358
01:55:45,359 --> 01:55:50,319
difference because you know

3359
01:55:47,359 --> 01:55:52,079
while the clay and the loam is great

3360
01:55:50,319 --> 01:55:53,599
but i i just feel there are certain

3361
01:55:52,079 --> 01:55:56,559
properties you know

3362
01:55:53,599 --> 01:55:58,639
that that could be changed like it's not

3363
01:55:56,560 --> 01:56:00,639
very loose you know it's not very

3364
01:55:58,639 --> 01:56:03,118
it's very compact so

3365
01:56:00,639 --> 01:56:05,599
certain properties like that but overall

3366
01:56:03,118 --> 01:56:07,839
the soil works fantastically and this is

3367
01:56:05,599 --> 01:56:09,440
the i mean north india is the mecca of

3368
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:10,800
cannabis right so

3369
01:56:09,439 --> 01:56:13,198
all of these varieties has been

3370
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:15,520
naturally growing here so i could say

3371
01:56:13,198 --> 01:56:16,960
very confidently that the soil that's in

3372
01:56:15,520 --> 01:56:19,280
northern india at least in northern

3373
01:56:16,960 --> 01:56:21,359
india or northwest himalayas is very

3374
01:56:19,279 --> 01:56:23,519
suited for growing cannabis and that's

3375
01:56:21,359 --> 01:56:27,279
why most people just go ahead you know

3376
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:29,040
dig some soil and they're good to go

3377
01:56:27,279 --> 01:56:30,880
yeah well i mean it makes total sense

3378
01:56:29,039 --> 01:56:32,079
doesn't it you raise an interesting

3379
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:33,520
point though i would really be

3380
01:56:32,079 --> 01:56:35,760
interested to see

3381
01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:37,760
what some of these cultivars would end

3382
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:39,360
up looking like around harvest time if

3383
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:41,440
they were put in some kind of like

3384
01:56:39,359 --> 01:56:42,559
american no-till soil because i remember

3385
01:56:41,439 --> 01:56:44,238
my first

3386
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:46,159
run with that sort of

3387
01:56:44,238 --> 01:56:47,519
soil composition and it was quite

3388
01:56:46,158 --> 01:56:49,039
different to what i was using before and

3389
01:56:47,520 --> 01:56:51,679
it was it was a very different outcome

3390
01:56:49,039 --> 01:56:53,679
for the same clones but to get back on

3391
01:56:51,679 --> 01:56:56,399
topic for the people who are just using

3392
01:56:53,679 --> 01:56:58,158
the soil around them that's just free do

3393
01:56:56,399 --> 01:57:00,479
they try to supplement it with like

3394
01:56:58,158 --> 01:57:01,839
basic you know like like basic compost

3395
01:57:00,479 --> 01:57:04,079
they make or anything or is it really

3396
01:57:01,840 --> 01:57:07,039
just planted in the soil water only and

3397
01:57:04,079 --> 01:57:09,039
what you get is what you get

3398
01:57:07,039 --> 01:57:11,920
people do make compost because compost

3399
01:57:09,039 --> 01:57:14,238
making has been an integral part of

3400
01:57:11,920 --> 01:57:16,560
indian culture so it's something that

3401
01:57:14,238 --> 01:57:19,359
people are readily aware of so i've seen

3402
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:21,520
a lot of people use uh you know

3403
01:57:19,359 --> 01:57:23,839
compost they have compost bins or they

3404
01:57:21,520 --> 01:57:26,320
have a designated place or a

3405
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:28,719
where they you know stockpile all the

3406
01:57:26,319 --> 01:57:31,359
leaves and you know everything

3407
01:57:28,719 --> 01:57:33,359
so yeah that happens but again i mean

3408
01:57:31,359 --> 01:57:34,880
the nutrient part is people are not big

3409
01:57:33,359 --> 01:57:36,479
on nutrients like buying nutrients just

3410
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:37,599
like buying soil but like i said if

3411
01:57:36,479 --> 01:57:39,039
something someone is running a

3412
01:57:37,599 --> 01:57:40,960
commercial setup you know he's able to

3413
01:57:39,039 --> 01:57:42,399
sell it for a fortune then of course

3414
01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:44,719
they can afford it and they they are

3415
01:57:42,399 --> 01:57:46,559
doing that because uh they don't want to

3416
01:57:44,719 --> 01:57:48,158
leave any stone unturned in making their

3417
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:50,560
wheat the best

3418
01:57:48,158 --> 01:57:52,479
in the market right and probably make

3419
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:54,080
more money off it but at the same time

3420
01:57:52,479 --> 01:57:55,519
they can afford it because they have

3421
01:57:54,079 --> 01:57:56,880
they're getting some returns out of that

3422
01:57:55,520 --> 01:57:58,239
and at the same time there are other

3423
01:57:56,880 --> 01:57:59,760
people you know

3424
01:57:58,238 --> 01:58:01,359
who's not interested in doing that

3425
01:57:59,760 --> 01:58:03,920
because at the end the

3426
01:58:01,359 --> 01:58:06,399
plant grows amazing in that soil without

3427
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:08,880
any inputs but you see a lot of cow dung

3428
01:58:06,399 --> 01:58:11,759
being used which is just you know

3429
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:14,319
very inherent to in people in india

3430
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:16,480
so yeah i mean we use cow dung for a lot

3431
01:58:14,319 --> 01:58:18,319
of other things i mean we you we you

3432
01:58:16,479 --> 01:58:20,399
know like dry it up and you know smoke

3433
01:58:18,319 --> 01:58:22,399
it i mean like burn it up

3434
01:58:20,399 --> 01:58:23,839
so it takes care of the mosquitoes

3435
01:58:22,399 --> 01:58:26,638
because we you know we have a big

3436
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:27,360
mosquito problem in india as you know

3437
01:58:26,639 --> 01:58:30,400
so

3438
01:58:27,359 --> 01:58:32,719
uh it's always around us so we it's only

3439
01:58:30,399 --> 01:58:33,759
a matter of for us it's only a matter of

3440
01:58:32,719 --> 01:58:35,359
time

3441
01:58:33,760 --> 01:58:37,920
a matter of looking around and you know

3442
01:58:35,359 --> 01:58:39,359
finding those things and fertilizer and

3443
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:41,279
everything is

3444
01:58:39,359 --> 01:58:43,839
just all around us and because the

3445
01:58:41,279 --> 01:58:45,920
kettles are also you know going around

3446
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:47,920
everywhere so they're taking [ __ ] and

3447
01:58:45,920 --> 01:58:50,800
it's getting mixed in the soil so the

3448
01:58:47,920 --> 01:58:52,880
soil seems to be really good

3449
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:55,199
overall so people are not really

3450
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:58,079
inclined towards using nutrients some

3451
01:58:55,198 --> 01:58:59,198
people do use them but it's a negligible

3452
01:58:58,079 --> 01:59:01,599
portion of the

3453
01:58:59,198 --> 01:59:03,759
uh you know overall community

3454
01:59:01,599 --> 01:59:05,599
yeah of course really really good answer

3455
01:59:03,760 --> 01:59:07,840
to that one so

3456
01:59:05,599 --> 01:59:10,000
the indian climate itself you know i

3457
01:59:07,840 --> 01:59:11,279
know that it can get quite hot and also

3458
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:13,359
quite cold

3459
01:59:11,279 --> 01:59:15,198
how do you feel that impacts things and

3460
01:59:13,359 --> 01:59:19,198
for how many months of the year can you

3461
01:59:15,198 --> 01:59:22,158
grow in say north india for example

3462
01:59:19,198 --> 01:59:24,158
okay in north india i mean if you are at

3463
01:59:22,158 --> 01:59:26,479
a fairly lower altitude

3464
01:59:24,158 --> 01:59:29,359
like i am right now i'm at near shivalik

3465
01:59:26,479 --> 01:59:32,319
right now at i think around 700 meters

3466
01:59:29,359 --> 01:59:34,799
okay so here it it does not snow at all

3467
01:59:32,319 --> 01:59:37,118
but it gets really cold in the winters

3468
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:40,159
but not as cool that you cannot grow the

3469
01:59:37,118 --> 01:59:42,639
cannabis plants right so you can go

3470
01:59:40,158 --> 01:59:44,079
12 year i'm sorry 12 months

3471
01:59:42,639 --> 01:59:45,920
and you can grow pretty much around the

3472
01:59:44,079 --> 01:59:47,599
year but there is a significant change

3473
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:49,279
in the light duration it's not like

3474
01:59:47,599 --> 01:59:52,560
equator that you have

3475
01:59:49,279 --> 01:59:54,158
a 12 hour day all around the year so

3476
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:56,080
because of that reason then you would

3477
01:59:54,158 --> 01:59:58,399
have to supplement light or you would

3478
01:59:56,079 --> 02:00:00,479
have to you know veg your plants inside

3479
01:59:58,399 --> 02:00:02,879
if you're going to do that towards the

3480
02:00:00,479 --> 02:00:05,519
end of the season let's see if i decide

3481
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:07,359
to you know grow my plants in october

3482
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:08,800
after just going through my first cycle

3483
02:00:07,359 --> 02:00:10,960
then i would have to give them some

3484
02:00:08,800 --> 02:00:12,480
vegetative time indoors or have to

3485
02:00:10,960 --> 02:00:14,239
really supplement some light outdoors in

3486
02:00:12,479 --> 02:00:16,319
my balcony or whatever

3487
02:00:14,238 --> 02:00:18,000
to make sure that you know they stay in

3488
02:00:16,319 --> 02:00:19,279
vegetative state for a significant

3489
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:21,039
amount of time before they hit the

3490
02:00:19,279 --> 02:00:23,679
flowering so then you can you know

3491
02:00:21,039 --> 02:00:25,198
eventually have something

3492
02:00:23,679 --> 02:00:28,560
on the plant

3493
02:00:25,198 --> 02:00:30,079
so that's one thing i mean uh

3494
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:31,599
that 12

3495
02:00:30,079 --> 02:00:32,960
months are available but then you have

3496
02:00:31,599 --> 02:00:34,960
to look at the light the light is not

3497
02:00:32,960 --> 02:00:36,000
really in your favor all the time

3498
02:00:34,960 --> 02:00:37,920
right

3499
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:39,840
another thing that happens around here

3500
02:00:37,920 --> 02:00:41,520
in north india is that what you see

3501
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:43,360
these feral varieties which are growing

3502
02:00:41,520 --> 02:00:45,760
in the flatlands especially punjab

3503
02:00:43,359 --> 02:00:48,479
haryana new delhi surroundings

3504
02:00:45,760 --> 02:00:50,560
these plants grow all around the year

3505
02:00:48,479 --> 02:00:52,959
like you know like you would see in some

3506
02:00:50,560 --> 02:00:55,440
of the equators that means

3507
02:00:52,960 --> 02:00:58,079
um in springtime some of the plants

3508
02:00:55,439 --> 02:00:58,960
would come up okay and they would go on

3509
02:00:58,079 --> 02:01:00,399
to

3510
02:00:58,960 --> 02:01:02,560
they would certainly go into flowering

3511
02:01:00,399 --> 02:01:04,799
because the light is still less than you

3512
02:01:02,560 --> 02:01:06,560
know is still relatively less but they

3513
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:08,079
would just kind of stretch and not

3514
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:10,080
really start to flower because these are

3515
02:01:08,079 --> 02:01:11,840
long flowering varieties and they tend

3516
02:01:10,079 --> 02:01:14,158
to have a stretch before they really

3517
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:15,599
start to flower

3518
02:01:14,158 --> 02:01:18,960
so

3519
02:01:15,599 --> 02:01:20,800
uh those varieties will you know stretch

3520
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:23,439
and then they would again go into

3521
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:25,760
vegetative state as the summer would hit

3522
02:01:23,439 --> 02:01:27,198
around like end of april and may

3523
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:29,760
and then they would again go into

3524
02:01:27,198 --> 02:01:31,439
flowers sometime in you know around

3525
02:01:29,760 --> 02:01:33,599
august then and they would finish some

3526
02:01:31,439 --> 02:01:35,359
around like november ending but as soon

3527
02:01:33,599 --> 02:01:37,599
as the november end comes and those

3528
02:01:35,359 --> 02:01:39,679
seeds you know fall down on the ground i

3529
02:01:37,599 --> 02:01:42,400
mean they don't stay dormant like some

3530
02:01:39,679 --> 02:01:44,399
of the places like kashmir where because

3531
02:01:42,399 --> 02:01:47,359
in kashmir what happens is once the seed

3532
02:01:44,399 --> 02:01:49,359
fall down there's snowfall on them so

3533
02:01:47,359 --> 02:01:51,920
those plants have evolved different

3534
02:01:49,359 --> 02:01:54,399
features in them like some of the plants

3535
02:01:51,920 --> 02:01:56,960
in colder places like kashmir in higher

3536
02:01:54,399 --> 02:01:58,799
altitudes where the snowfall happens for

3537
02:01:56,960 --> 02:02:00,560
like three to four months they have

3538
02:01:58,800 --> 02:02:02,960
developed features

3539
02:02:00,560 --> 02:02:05,119
uh like seed dormancy which can be

3540
02:02:02,960 --> 02:02:06,719
chemically or physically induced like

3541
02:02:05,118 --> 02:02:09,519
physically and used in a way that it

3542
02:02:06,719 --> 02:02:11,920
could have a very thick seed coat

3543
02:02:09,520 --> 02:02:14,000
you know that will take a very long

3544
02:02:11,920 --> 02:02:15,279
while to wither and eventually it'll

3545
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:17,279
take the time

3546
02:02:15,279 --> 02:02:19,679
till the snow is off and it would

3547
02:02:17,279 --> 02:02:21,679
ultimately you know pop out in spring

3548
02:02:19,679 --> 02:02:23,760
so one is that and then there is

3549
02:02:21,679 --> 02:02:26,239
chemical dormancy you know i think that

3550
02:02:23,760 --> 02:02:29,119
is caused because of the abscisic acid

3551
02:02:26,238 --> 02:02:30,399
in the seed and really the only way to

3552
02:02:29,118 --> 02:02:31,759
you know break that is you have to take

3553
02:02:30,399 --> 02:02:34,158
those seeds and put it in the

3554
02:02:31,760 --> 02:02:36,159
refrigerator and you know mimic what

3555
02:02:34,158 --> 02:02:38,319
would happen in what would have happened

3556
02:02:36,158 --> 02:02:40,079
in the nature like it would have

3557
02:02:38,319 --> 02:02:42,000
been under the snow so you keep it like

3558
02:02:40,079 --> 02:02:43,519
a couple of months under in the

3559
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:46,800
refrigerator and then you try to pop

3560
02:02:43,520 --> 02:02:49,440
them and and they pop you know so

3561
02:02:46,800 --> 02:02:51,199
uh that doesn't really happen in uh here

3562
02:02:49,439 --> 02:02:52,799
northern india because here you have the

3563
02:02:51,198 --> 02:02:53,598
varieties they fall down on the ground

3564
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:55,840
and

3565
02:02:53,599 --> 02:02:57,679
next week they they're out because you

3566
02:02:55,840 --> 02:02:59,440
know it's not snowing it's not that cold

3567
02:02:57,679 --> 02:03:02,158
that they're gonna die so you just have

3568
02:02:59,439 --> 02:03:03,839
this perpetually seedlings coming up and

3569
02:03:02,158 --> 02:03:06,079
plants going into flower at different

3570
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:07,279
stages and reverting to vegetative

3571
02:03:06,079 --> 02:03:08,719
states so

3572
02:03:07,279 --> 02:03:10,800
it's a very complex picture i mean you

3573
02:03:08,719 --> 02:03:12,719
have to live here and you have to go out

3574
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:14,400
and you know little notebook every day

3575
02:03:12,719 --> 02:03:17,359
and just look around you and it's not

3576
02:03:14,399 --> 02:03:19,359
that hard to understand but it's complex

3577
02:03:17,359 --> 02:03:21,198
and if somebody's going to come here for

3578
02:03:19,359 --> 02:03:22,880
like a day or two from a different

3579
02:03:21,198 --> 02:03:24,719
country i think it's going to be very

3580
02:03:22,880 --> 02:03:26,480
difficult for him to really you know

3581
02:03:24,719 --> 02:03:29,520
appreciate all those

3582
02:03:26,479 --> 02:03:31,598
little things yeah certainly there's a

3583
02:03:29,520 --> 02:03:33,440
huge layer of complexity to it all with

3584
02:03:31,599 --> 02:03:35,199
everything going on

3585
02:03:33,439 --> 02:03:36,799
i'd love to know though you've you've

3586
02:03:35,198 --> 02:03:39,198
spoken about how there's all these

3587
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:40,719
different areas geographically with

3588
02:03:39,198 --> 02:03:43,039
india you know we've got like the high

3589
02:03:40,719 --> 02:03:45,118
altitudes the lower some kind of in the

3590
02:03:43,039 --> 02:03:46,639
middle and even deserts

3591
02:03:45,118 --> 02:03:49,839
out of all of them

3592
02:03:46,639 --> 02:03:52,800
what produces the nicest end product in

3593
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:52,800
your experience

3594
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:57,840
okay the well if you're going to talk

3595
02:03:55,279 --> 02:03:59,439
about the nicest end product i mean uh

3596
02:03:57,840 --> 02:04:02,800
there could be a few ways of looking at

3597
02:03:59,439 --> 02:04:05,118
it so some people would say a bigger bud

3598
02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:06,480
or some people would say more potent

3599
02:04:05,118 --> 02:04:07,759
resin right

3600
02:04:06,479 --> 02:04:10,238
so um

3601
02:04:07,760 --> 02:04:12,800
i'm going to talk in

3602
02:04:10,238 --> 02:04:13,919
in different aspects okay like i'm gonna

3603
02:04:12,800 --> 02:04:14,800
say that

3604
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:17,440
this

3605
02:04:14,800 --> 02:04:20,000
region or this place would produce the

3606
02:04:17,439 --> 02:04:22,479
best of this certain characteristic okay

3607
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:25,599
so first if we if we begin with cold

3608
02:04:22,479 --> 02:04:28,319
desert region a cold desert is basically

3609
02:04:25,599 --> 02:04:30,639
what it's extremely cold place and you

3610
02:04:28,319 --> 02:04:32,719
know that it doesn't rain at all nothing

3611
02:04:30,639 --> 02:04:34,480
at all i mean maybe once or twice a year

3612
02:04:32,719 --> 02:04:36,639
and all you see is just

3613
02:04:34,479 --> 02:04:39,439
rock withering away

3614
02:04:36,639 --> 02:04:41,679
in a very arid desolate you know region

3615
02:04:39,439 --> 02:04:43,359
so you have some plants growing in those

3616
02:04:41,679 --> 02:04:45,440
regions so number one i'm gonna put

3617
02:04:43,359 --> 02:04:47,920
those plants right up there for their

3618
02:04:45,439 --> 02:04:50,158
hardiness and for their survival skills

3619
02:04:47,920 --> 02:04:51,520
so if you're going to you know if you're

3620
02:04:50,158 --> 02:04:52,638
going to look for a variety you know

3621
02:04:51,520 --> 02:04:55,280
that has

3622
02:04:52,639 --> 02:04:58,000
the ability to survive in least amount

3623
02:04:55,279 --> 02:05:00,479
of water and in marginal conditions

3624
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:02,078
as they are in you know cold desert then

3625
02:05:00,479 --> 02:05:04,479
that would be you know

3626
02:05:02,078 --> 02:05:06,399
uh the number one for me okay but then

3627
02:05:04,479 --> 02:05:08,078
let's talk about in terms of resin

3628
02:05:06,399 --> 02:05:10,399
production okay and when we say resin

3629
02:05:08,078 --> 02:05:13,439
production i'm talking about in how

3630
02:05:10,399 --> 02:05:15,279
dense the resin coated uh coating is

3631
02:05:13,439 --> 02:05:17,279
okay and whether it's confined only to

3632
02:05:15,279 --> 02:05:19,039
the floral bracts or is it also moving

3633
02:05:17,279 --> 02:05:21,198
on to the leaves and to the stems and

3634
02:05:19,039 --> 02:05:24,158
the patios okay because some varieties

3635
02:05:21,198 --> 02:05:26,638
do that and once again if you go to uh

3636
02:05:24,158 --> 02:05:28,638
cold desert regions like niti valley you

3637
02:05:26,639 --> 02:05:31,599
know close to uh

3638
02:05:28,639 --> 02:05:34,960
enda tibetan border intermole

3639
02:05:31,599 --> 02:05:36,800
those plants tend to have a very dense

3640
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:39,359
uh you know coverage of resin

3641
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:41,279
surprisingly and

3642
02:05:39,359 --> 02:05:43,198
the trichomes are big as well even

3643
02:05:41,279 --> 02:05:46,158
though the plants are really feeble and

3644
02:05:43,198 --> 02:05:48,078
small they have absolutely zero

3645
02:05:46,158 --> 02:05:50,799
you know vigor to them and they barely

3646
02:05:48,078 --> 02:05:52,639
look like cannabis plants by the way but

3647
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:55,360
you would find plants which have this

3648
02:05:52,639 --> 02:05:57,118
amazing and parallel amount of resin on

3649
02:05:55,359 --> 02:05:59,920
them and similar is the case with

3650
02:05:57,118 --> 02:06:02,559
kashmir i mean the places so basically

3651
02:05:59,920 --> 02:06:04,399
what i'm trying to say here is that if

3652
02:06:02,560 --> 02:06:06,719
you go to the colder places and more

3653
02:06:04,399 --> 02:06:08,960
drier places places like hindu places

3654
02:06:06,719 --> 02:06:11,039
like chitral in pakistan places like uh

3655
02:06:08,960 --> 02:06:13,679
you know niti valley and you're going to

3656
02:06:11,039 --> 02:06:16,078
encounter uh you know populations which

3657
02:06:13,679 --> 02:06:18,560
have a dense resin coating and you know

3658
02:06:16,078 --> 02:06:20,639
the resin is abundant now that could be

3659
02:06:18,560 --> 02:06:22,560
because these places are higher up on

3660
02:06:20,639 --> 02:06:25,118
the latitude higher up on the globe and

3661
02:06:22,560 --> 02:06:28,000
you know also have altitudes so they may

3662
02:06:25,118 --> 02:06:29,598
be exposed to you know a more intense

3663
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:31,198
ultraviolet radiation so we don't

3664
02:06:29,599 --> 02:06:32,800
understand you know what basically

3665
02:06:31,198 --> 02:06:36,879
trichomes are doing or what all they're

3666
02:06:32,800 --> 02:06:39,599
doing at least so if uh it is to deflect

3667
02:06:36,880 --> 02:06:41,279
you know uv radiation then certainly it

3668
02:06:39,599 --> 02:06:42,800
makes sense you know why those varieties

3669
02:06:41,279 --> 02:06:44,719
would have bigger trichomes and a more

3670
02:06:42,800 --> 02:06:46,719
dense coverage even on the

3671
02:06:44,719 --> 02:06:47,760
non-reproductive parts like leaves and

3672
02:06:46,719 --> 02:06:50,639
you know

3673
02:06:47,760 --> 02:06:52,239
patios of the plant

3674
02:06:50,639 --> 02:06:53,840
but if you're going to talk about the

3675
02:06:52,238 --> 02:06:55,039
girth if you're going to talk about the

3676
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:57,199
produce

3677
02:06:55,039 --> 02:06:58,960
well it's absolutely zero in these

3678
02:06:57,198 --> 02:07:01,118
places you go to kashmir and you go to

3679
02:06:58,960 --> 02:07:03,439
places like niti valley the cold desert

3680
02:07:01,118 --> 02:07:05,679
places and again the cold is doing

3681
02:07:03,439 --> 02:07:07,839
something here the cold is somewhat like

3682
02:07:05,679 --> 02:07:09,599
a factor that is directly influencing

3683
02:07:07,840 --> 02:07:11,520
you know these changes that

3684
02:07:09,599 --> 02:07:13,599
while the resin coating is going to be

3685
02:07:11,520 --> 02:07:15,360
absolutely maddening on the plant the

3686
02:07:13,599 --> 02:07:17,039
plant is not the plant itself is not

3687
02:07:15,359 --> 02:07:20,000
going to produce anything

3688
02:07:17,039 --> 02:07:22,158
you you may even see plants that has no

3689
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:24,560
bud at all i mean there's a couple of

3690
02:07:22,158 --> 02:07:26,000
floral bracts here and there and there's

3691
02:07:24,560 --> 02:07:28,800
leaves coming out of them but they're

3692
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:31,039
just completely smothered with resin

3693
02:07:28,800 --> 02:07:32,800
so that's what you see so

3694
02:07:31,039 --> 02:07:34,399
they're not fully complete they have

3695
02:07:32,800 --> 02:07:37,199
certain aspects you know which are

3696
02:07:34,399 --> 02:07:39,279
really desirable to us as if we talk in

3697
02:07:37,198 --> 02:07:41,039
terms of like commercial production

3698
02:07:39,279 --> 02:07:43,359
but they don't have all of them they

3699
02:07:41,039 --> 02:07:44,560
just seem to have like one or two okay

3700
02:07:43,359 --> 02:07:46,158
so then you

3701
02:07:44,560 --> 02:07:48,639
you could move to the other extreme and

3702
02:07:46,158 --> 02:07:50,319
the other extreme is the equatorials

3703
02:07:48,639 --> 02:07:52,639
when you go to the equatorials what do

3704
02:07:50,319 --> 02:07:54,559
you see equatorial regions i'm sorry

3705
02:07:52,639 --> 02:07:56,319
what you see is that

3706
02:07:54,560 --> 02:07:59,119
the plants

3707
02:07:56,319 --> 02:08:01,679
produce huge buds huge yields i mean you

3708
02:07:59,118 --> 02:08:03,279
know it's hard to find a plant that is

3709
02:08:01,679 --> 02:08:05,118
not yielding a lot

3710
02:08:03,279 --> 02:08:06,479
but when you get closer and you try to

3711
02:08:05,118 --> 02:08:07,679
look at the resin

3712
02:08:06,479 --> 02:08:08,479
production

3713
02:08:07,679 --> 02:08:10,880
it's

3714
02:08:08,479 --> 02:08:12,559
not even closed not even close to you

3715
02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:14,000
know what you have seen in places like

3716
02:08:12,560 --> 02:08:16,400
cold desert or

3717
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:19,118
uh in places like kashmir you know not

3718
02:08:16,399 --> 02:08:20,638
even close it's not dense it's sparsely

3719
02:08:19,118 --> 02:08:22,960
scattered and it's

3720
02:08:20,639 --> 02:08:25,599
very hard it's very hardly you see that

3721
02:08:22,960 --> 02:08:28,158
on you know patios or on the

3722
02:08:25,599 --> 02:08:29,760
leaf surface it's mostly confined to the

3723
02:08:28,158 --> 02:08:32,000
reproductive part

3724
02:08:29,760 --> 02:08:35,360
and again we don't understand you know

3725
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:37,599
what all things you know trichomes do so

3726
02:08:35,359 --> 02:08:39,598
we can't really say what's driving that

3727
02:08:37,599 --> 02:08:41,920
but at least that's what we see and at

3728
02:08:39,599 --> 02:08:44,239
least we can you know relate it to

3729
02:08:41,920 --> 02:08:45,760
um you know the environment because

3730
02:08:44,238 --> 02:08:48,559
those results

3731
02:08:45,760 --> 02:08:50,719
be because those observations kind of

3732
02:08:48,560 --> 02:08:52,800
hold up even if you go to different

3733
02:08:50,719 --> 02:08:54,078
places with different cultures so we

3734
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:56,560
know that it's not because of the

3735
02:08:54,078 --> 02:08:58,238
domestication we understand that

3736
02:08:56,560 --> 02:09:00,639
this is something which is inherent to

3737
02:08:58,238 --> 02:09:02,638
these varieties or inherent to

3738
02:09:00,639 --> 02:09:05,118
this terroir that they are growing in

3739
02:09:02,639 --> 02:09:06,560
and they've been growing in for so long

3740
02:09:05,118 --> 02:09:08,399
and so

3741
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:11,039
then what's left what's left is in

3742
02:09:08,399 --> 02:09:12,960
between your highlands your uh the

3743
02:09:11,039 --> 02:09:17,039
places which are you know very close to

3744
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:19,679
uh tropic of cancer around like 28 26 29

3745
02:09:17,039 --> 02:09:22,000
degrees 30 31 degrees of north

3746
02:09:19,679 --> 02:09:23,840
and they also seem to have a little bit

3747
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:26,000
of highland so you know because the

3748
02:09:23,840 --> 02:09:28,960
temperature is cold but at the same time

3749
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:31,520
it's not extremely cold so what do you

3750
02:09:28,960 --> 02:09:35,198
get is a beautiful mix of both of those

3751
02:09:31,520 --> 02:09:37,440
words you you get good resin content i

3752
02:09:35,198 --> 02:09:39,759
would say at least decent resin content

3753
02:09:37,439 --> 02:09:41,598
and and you can find plants which more

3754
02:09:39,760 --> 02:09:44,079
than often would produce uh you know

3755
02:09:41,599 --> 02:09:46,078
good yields so then it only becomes a

3756
02:09:44,078 --> 02:09:48,000
matter of you know looking for the right

3757
02:09:46,078 --> 02:09:50,799
plant i mean and it's growing enough to

3758
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:52,238
run into a plant that you can say key i

3759
02:09:50,800 --> 02:09:54,400
mean you could say that yeah this is

3760
02:09:52,238 --> 02:09:56,158
this is it this is what i uh you know

3761
02:09:54,399 --> 02:09:58,158
what is good so

3762
02:09:56,158 --> 02:10:00,879
um if somebody is going to find that

3763
02:09:58,158 --> 02:10:02,399
ideal plan then either he would have to

3764
02:10:00,880 --> 02:10:04,960
take both of the extremes and you know

3765
02:10:02,399 --> 02:10:07,039
cross them and just go from there

3766
02:10:04,960 --> 02:10:09,679
or he would just have to look for these

3767
02:10:07,039 --> 02:10:11,920
intermediate varieties from highlands of

3768
02:10:09,679 --> 02:10:14,480
which which grow around the tropic of

3769
02:10:11,920 --> 02:10:17,760
cancer and you know have seemed to have

3770
02:10:14,479 --> 02:10:19,919
best of both worlds to some extent

3771
02:10:17,760 --> 02:10:21,760
yeah what a really awesomely detailed

3772
02:10:19,920 --> 02:10:22,960
explanation i think our viewers will

3773
02:10:21,760 --> 02:10:24,800
probably have to listen to that one a

3774
02:10:22,960 --> 02:10:26,710
few times to pick out all the awesome

3775
02:10:24,800 --> 02:10:34,960
